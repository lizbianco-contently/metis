Today's opening prayer will be offered by our \nguest Chaplain, Rev. Chuck Lawrence, Christ Temple Church, Huntington, \nWV.\n  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:\n  Let us pray.\n  King of Glory, first of all, we are thankful that we can pray and \nthat You hear us. We are thankful that You have the power, and also the \ndesire, to answer us.\n  As our Creator, You know what is best for us. So, Lord, even more \nthan Your blessings and what You can give to us, we desire Your \npresence. We want Your presence to be woven into the very fabric of our \nlives because Your presence brings purpose to our lives. Without You, \nwe are empty, void of meaning.\n  Your presence also brings joy to life, not just one arduous task \nafter another but a joyful journey. Your presence will guide us to \nproper finish lines, to accomplishments that really matter. Your \npresence brings freedom as well; not just freedom from something but \nfreedom to make the right decisions that will help us fulfill the \ndestiny into which we are called. Your presence brings peace; not a \npeace from agreeable circumstances but a peace even in the midst of \ntumultuous moments.\n  So, today, let every Senator sense Your presence. Let every Senator \nknow that Your hand is available to guide them in all they do. Let us \nall remember that just having You is enough, and we will continue to \npursue Your presence until the day we hear: ``Well done, good and \nfaithful servant.'' In Your Name, we pray. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12189-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Benjamin L.

Mr. President, briefly, let me outline the schedule for \nthis morning. Under an order entered last night, there are 2 hours of \ndebate equally divided prior to votes on pending cloture motions on the \ntwo hate crimes amendments.\n  Once the votes begin, around 11 this morning, there will be very \nbrief debate between the votes, so Members\n\n[[Page S12190]]\n\nshould remain close to the floor during that time.\n  Once action has concluded on the hate crime amendments, the Senate \nwill then have a brief debate prior to the cloture vote on the motion \nto concur to the House amendments to the Senate amendments to the CHIP \nlegislation.\n  Therefore, Members can expect five rollcall votes starting around 11 \nthis morning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 10 minutes \nimmediately prior to the first vote be controlled equally between the \ntwo leaders, with the majority leader controlling the last 5 minutes, \nand that after the first vote, the remaining votes be limited to 10 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent if there are \nquorum calls during this time, they be evenly divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend and one of the principal \narchitects of this CHIP program on the floor. I know he desires to \nspeak for some time. I am glad to accommodate him. I think I am going \nto speak on both of the measures that are before the Senate, both the \nCHIP program as well as the hate crimes. So I do not know what the \ndesire of the Senator from Utah would be. But I will be glad to yield \nto him.\n\n\n                                  CHIP\n\n  Mr. President, as the instructions to the Senate said, later in the \nmorning, we are going to have an opportunity for the Senate to express \nitself on what is commonly known as the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, a program that has effectively been in place now for some 10 \nyears and has made a very significant and important difference in the \nquality of life for children.\n  It has been said, and I certainly agree, that the great test of a \nnation and a civilization is how it cares about its children. Some 10 \nyears ago, the Senator from Utah, myself, others, were very much \ninvolved in the fashioning, the shaping of this legislation.\n  It has made a very important difference, which we will come to in a \nmoment, to the quality of health care for children in this country. The \nSenate, later this morning, is going to make a judgment whether we are \ngoing to continue that march for progress for children and expand that \nopportunity or whether we are going to take a different course and say \nthat is not a national priority.\n  Being in the Senate and voting is about priorities. Priorities. \nMembers in this body express themselves in votes by indicating our \npriorities, both our priorities in the allocation of resources, our \npriorities in views with regard to foreign policy.\n  This morning, we are going to be making a judgment whether we think \nit is appropriate that we continue this real march for progress for \nchildren in this country with this Children's Health Insurance Program \nthat has proved to be so successful.\n  First, I wish to show what President Bush himself has stated about \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. This is the quote of President \nBush from the 2004 Republican Convention, not all that long ago, when \nhe said:\n\n       America's children must also have a healthy start in life. \n     In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll \n     millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up \n     for the Government's health insurance programs.\n\n  That is what we are talking about, the CHIP program. Here is the \nPresident saying:\n\n       In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll \n     millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up \n     for the Government's health insurance programs. We will not \n     allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand between \n     these children and the health care they need.\n\n  Well, that is the issue. This is the place where that promise and \npledge is going to be tested later this morning. Many of us are going \nto say: President Bush was absolutely right when he made that \nstatement. But since he has made that statement, he has come to a \ndifferent position where he is urging opposition to that position \ntoday.\n  We can understand why the President came to that position because we \ncan look at the record of the last 10 years. In the evaluation of the \nCHIP program, this is the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, it \nis an administration department, effectively known as CMS, the Center \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, this is in the Department of Health \nand Human Services. This is their evaluation as of September 19, 2007:\n\n       Over the past 10 years, the CHIP program has improved \n     overall access to care.\n\n  Improved overall access to care.\n\n       Reduced the level of unmet need.\n\n  Reduced the level of unmet need.\n\n       And improved access to dental care, expanded access to \n     preventive care.\n\n  Expanded access to preventive care. Imagine the parents who may have \ntaken a little time this morning and said: This is going to be an \nimportant vote in the Senate today. I think I will listen to it. What \nis this program all about?\n  Well, here we have the President of the United States, who has \nendorsed this, said it ought to be expanded, and then we have the \nevaluation of the program, not by those of us who were there at the \nvery beginning and who supported the program but by the \nadministration's own evaluation. This is what they say--and who can \ndiffer with that? Those who have been opposed to it have been unable to \nchallenge this: Improved the access to care, reduced the level of unmet \nneed, improved access to dental care, expanded access to preventive \ncare.\n  Every parent knows the importance of preventive care for their \nchildren. Anyone who cares about health care policy knows that it is \nenormously important at any time and particularly in a child's life. \nAnd ``reduced emergency department use.'' That is the final item that \nis mentioned in this chart.\n\n  But this has importance in a number of different ways. It means they \nare taking care of children before they need the emergency care, \nbecause their illness, their throat infections, ear infections, other \ninfections have been addressed in preventive care, so they do not have \nto go to the emergency room.\n  What is the result of the emergency room visit when the child gets a \ngreat deal sicker? More often than not, the parents cannot afford to \npay the bills. Or if the bills are there, they are out of sight. So the \ncosts, in terms of the health care system, are dramatically enhanced \nwhen the children go to the emergency room. The costs, in terms of the \nparents' anxiety, are dramatically enhanced when the children have to \ngo to the emergency room.\n  Last night, there were millions of parents who were wondering, when \nthey were listening to their child cry in the night, whether that child \nwas $150 or $250 sick, because that is what the cost was going to be in \nan emergency room. Maybe I will wait it out. Maybe I am making the \nminimum wage. Can I afford to dig deeper and pay those $250? So I am \ngoing to let my child remain without being taken care of during the \nnight, to see if that child gets better, rather than having the \npreventive care. It is a moral issue, a defining moral issue, a \npriority issue, a moral issue for this country.\n  So that is the evaluation of the administration, the statement of the \nPresident. We can understand why the administration has come up with \nthat kind of--those results, because of the extraordinary reduction in \nthe uninsured rate for children.\n  If you look, going back to 1997, almost 25 percent of all children \nhad no coverage. Look at this red line going down over the years as the \nCHIP program is reaching out through the States. This was worked out in \nthese careful negotiations, which Senator Hatch was also involved in, \nto make sure it was going to be a State program, State-run, State \npriorities, States establishing the deductibles, the copays, States \nmaking the judgments about those items, States setting up the whole \nprogram. It is going to be effectively a private insurance program. \nThat is what confuses me about the administration talking about a \nGovernment-run program. This is effectively a State-run program built \nupon private insurance.\n  The delivery system is very much like the administration favored with \nthe prescription drug program. So we see this dramatic reduction in \nterms of children.\n  Now, what has been the reaction? This, for example, is one of the \nblessings of this program. Not only are the\n\n[[Page S12191]]\n\nchildren healthier with the CHIP program--this is an evaluation of how \nthe child does in class. Not only are we getting a healthier child. We \nare getting a more attentive child. We are all challenged here, and \ncertainly we are in our education committee, as we are looking out \nacross at the various education programs how we are going to try to \ndeal with children improving in terms of their attention and also \nkeeping up with the school activities.\n  This last week, the Secretary of Education announced the improvement \nof children in what they call the NAPE test, children are improving. I \nam so proud of Massachusetts being the No. 1 State, in terms of the \nresults. That is basically because the State got started on many of \nthese reforms before the Congress did.\n  But there is no question in my mind that a principal part of the \nimprovement of children doing well academically is as a result of the \nCHIP program.\n  This is the proof: paying attention in class, from 34 percent to 57 \npercent; keeping up with school activities, from 36 to 61 percent. It \nis understandable. If children can't see the blackboard, if they can't \nhear the teacher, if they are sick, they are not going to learn. If \nthey are healthy, they can learn. It is pretty fundamental, but \nevidently there are some who haven't learned the lesson.\n  We are constantly challenged, if we are going to be one country with \none history and one destiny, about moving along together, moving all \nthe children--White, Black, Hispanic--together. Before CHIP, you had \nimportant unmet health care needs reflected in disparities between the \ndifferent races. Once we had the CHIP program put in place for the \nchildren, we effectively saw an important improvement in the health of \nchildren, and all the children moved along together.\n  This is for a typical disease. We chose asthma because it has been a \ndisease which has been expanding over time, unquestionably, because of \nthe relaxation of a variety of different environmental requirements and \nstandards. In other illnesses and diseases, it is going down. The \nchallenge with children with asthma is it has actually been going up. \nBut even if the totality is going up, look what happens with these \nchildren with asthma as a result of the CHIP program. The number of \nchildren who are getting their health needs taken care of dramatically \nincreased. Emergency visits were dramatically down, and \nhospitalizations were dramatically down. This reflects itself in not \nonly healthier children but in savings.\n  This is basically a matter of priorities. This is a sound program. It \nis an effective program. It is one the President endorsed a few years \nago. It has been tested, tried. The evaluation of the program has been \nthat it is a great success. Now we have the opportunity to express once \nagain the issue of priorities here in the Senate. What are going to be \nthe priorities for this body? What do they think is really important in \nthis country at this time? The CHIP program reauthorization, $35 \nbillion? That isn't being paid by taxpayers or middle-income families \nor working families unless they smoke because this is going to be \noffset completely by those who are going to smoke. As we have pointed \nout earlier, that has a double positive value. We are not going to put \nan additional burden on ordinary taxpayers. But with the increased cost \nof cigarettes and tobacco, it is going to mean less use of tobacco by \nchildren and children are going to be healthier. So not only is the \nfundamental legislation a demonstration in improving health care, but \nthe remedy and how we do that is also adding an additional dimension to \nthe quality of health for children. More than 3,000 children start \nsmoking every single day, and 1,200 of them become effectively addicted \nevery single day. We can do something about this and, eventually, when \nwe pass this legislation and we pass our other tobacco legislation that \nwe have reported out of our committee, we will get a handle on \nprotecting children from addiction to nicotine.\n  This is over a 5-year period, $35 billion; 1 year in Iraq, $120 \nbillion--almost four times in 1 year what this is in 5 years. Don't we \nthink we ought to be looking after the children in the United States? \nThis is where it is, Mr. President. We have a choice to express \nourselves. The President says: No, we are not going to have this for \nthe children; yes, we are going to have this. Many of us believe that \ninvesting in the children in this country is where we ought to be \ninvested and we ought to end the conflict and end this war.\n  That chart could be expressed in another way of what we are spending \nas, again, a matter of priorities, what we are spending per day--$333 \nmillion in Iraq versus $19 million nationwide on the children. So when \nthe time comes, we have a very clear choice in terms of the Nation's \npriority.\n  Finally, this is a statement by Dedra Lewis, mother of Alexsiana, a \nchild covered by CHIP from my State:\n\n       If I miss a single appointment, I know she could lose her \n     eyesight. If I can't buy her medication, I know she could \n     lose her eyesight. If I didn't have MassHealth, my daughter \n     would be blind.\n\n  One parent, one child, one piece of legislation that can make all the \ndifference in the world.\n  When we have a chance to vote, we will be voting for this \nlegislation, and we will be asking ourselves, why aren't we doing more \nto help the children?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as usual, I appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, when we are on the same \nwavelength. On this one, we are. I have to say that the original CHIP \nbill that virtually everybody acclaims as an excellent piece of \nlegislation that has helped millions of children from working poor \nfamilies, the only children left out of the process, wouldn't have come \nto pass except for the support of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts. We both took a lot of flak during those early months \nwhen we were trying to solve this problem of the working-poor children.\n  I had two Provo, UT, families come in to see me. Both parents in each \nfamily worked. Each family had six children. Neither family, with both \nincomes, had more than $20,000 a year in total gross income. They \nclearly could not afford child health insurance. CHIP was the only \nanswer to their plight. They were the only people left out of the \nprocess. They worked. They did the best they could.\n  I remember when the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and I \nsat down together. We are from two opposite poles in many respects, \nalthough he doesn't realize that he is a lot more conservative than he \nthinks. He thinks I may be a lot more liberal than I think. But when \nKennedy and Hatch can get together, people around here say: Well, if \nthey can get together, anybody can. People tend to get out of the way \nbecause they know it took a lot of effort for us to come together.\n  But the original CHIP bill could not have occurred but for my \ndistinguished friend from Massachusetts and the work he did. Even \nthough that hasn't been broadcast very much in the current debate, it \nis true. In the current debate, we wouldn't be as far along if it had \nnot been for the efforts of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  There are two sides to this. Yes, there is a legitimate side in \nopposition to having CHIP be $35 billion above the baseline of $25 \nbillion. That argument is that we are growing this program too fast and \nwe are putting too many people in it who were not originally supposed \nto be in it. The fact is, when we wrote the original CHIP bill, we \nprovided for a system of waivers because we were afraid we didn't cover \nsome things that should be covered. What really bothers me is that the \npeople complaining about CHIP costing so much today in this \nadministration, my administration, are the ones who gave 14--well, the \ntail end of the Clinton administration but primarily this \nadministration--waivers to allow this program to go to many more people \nthan we had originally intended. In fact, two States have more adults \non the program than they do children. That has caused a lot of angst. A \nseveral States are way over the 200 percent of poverty--one state even \ncovers families with incomes up to 350% of poverty.\n\n  Let's put it this way: The opponents seem to ignore the fact that \nthis bill covers 92 percent of kids who are under 200 percent of \npoverty. Yes, there is 8 or 9 percent who may be above but the\n\n[[Page S12192]]\n\nvast majority of them have lived with this program. We found that even \nwith the moneys that we had in the original CHIP bill, which happened \nto be $40 billion over the last 10 years--that it wasn't enough to put \nall of the kids who were eligible on the program.\n  One of the higher costs we found has been documented by CBO. We rely \non CBO around here. CBO said that the high costs come from trying to \nlocate the kids to get them in the program so they have a shot at being \nhealthy, so that they are not liabilities for society as a whole when \nthey get older.\n  This program is very important. We fought hard to keep the program \nwithin the $60 billion--$25 billion baseline and $35 billion above the \nbaseline, for a total of $60 billion. At first, those in the House \nwanted $100 billion. Then they came down to $75 billion. Finally, to \ntheir credit, they acknowledged that we were not going to do any better \nthan $35 billion over the baseline, and Senator Grassley and I had to \nstick with that, with the hope that the administration would recognize \nhow hard we had worked, how important this program is, this program \nwhich they themselves would like to reauthorize, and how difficult it \nis to get the additional 6 million eligible kids on CHIP. To be honest \nwith you, it proved to not be enough as far as federal funding was \nconcerned. And, we lost out on a lot of kids who should have had \ncoverage through this program.\n  Through this bill, what we are trying to do is cover the kids who \nshould be on the program. They are basically kids of the working poor. \nWe did add pregnant women because we thought that since this involves \nchildren and it is so important to have good prenatal care and \npostnatal care for the health and well-being of those children, that is \na logical thing to do.\n  Really what bothers me about the arguments on the other side--there \nare legitimate arguments, there always are on both sides--is that we \nspend about $1.9 trillion on health care in our society today each \nyear. About $1 trillion of it is in the private sector, and about $900 \nbillion is in the public sector. We are asking for $60 billion out of \n$1.9 trillion to help the kids who are left out of the program. The CBO \nsays even at that, we will not put enough money into this program.\n  Then we have the argument: This is leading to one-size-fits-all \nGovernment-mandated, socialized medicine health care. I think you could \nmake that argument on anything we do in health care around here that \ninvolves Government. But on the other hand, I don't want to leave these \nkids high and dry, either. So it is very important that we get this \nstraight and do what is right.\n  I have appreciated the remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts. Many on his side don't care to ever ask where is the \nmoney going to come from to pay for these things. On the other hand, in \na $1.9 trillion budget, it seems to me $60 billion is not too much, \nespecially since we are covering kids who should be covered who weren't \ncovered in a program that virtually everybody says is important, \nvirtually everybody says we ought to have, just not as much. And even \nwith the $60 billion, it is my understanding, according to CBO, we will \nnot really cover all of the kids we should, but we will cover most, \nwhich is a big improvement over the current program.\n  I join with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts hoping that \nthe administration will listen and maybe change its perception. There \nare good arguments on both sides. The better argument is to try to do \nwhat we can for these kids; that is, work on an overall comprehensive \nhealth care bill that will save money, have less Government intrusion, \nhave more private sector development, give people more opportunities of \nchoice, and give them the choice to bring costs down in the current \nsystem. People of good will on both sides could probably do that if we \nreally set our minds, if we just don't make this one big political \nbattle all the time. Unfortunately, it is a political battle over CHIP.\n  According to some in the administration, I am on the wrong side. I \ndon't think so. I am on the right side. I believe this has to be done. \nDoes that mean that I am not willing to modify and work and do what we \ncan to come up with a comprehensive health care approach that \nemphasizes competition and opportunity, that will cover everybody? Of \ncourse not! I would like to get there. This is a bill which does not \nnecessarily take us away from getting there, but I think some of these \narguments which have been offered have been not very good and not very \naccurate.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator let me proceed for 2 \nminutes? I see the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course, and then I think we ought to get in this debate \non hate crimes. I would want to yield to Senator Isakson, and then I \nwill have my remarks a little later.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator from \nUtah. I want to say that the 6 million children who today are covered \nin all parts of the country, including my State of Massachusetts, would \nnot be if it was not for the Senator from Utah. There was a very \nimportant insistence that has been sort of lost in this whole \ndiscussion and debate.\n  At the time we had talked about this program, I was very interested \nin expanding the Medicaid Program and moving that up. Medicaid deals \nwith the very poor. The real question was the working poor for these \nprograms. Senator Hatch insisted we should not expand the Government \nprogram, that we have to let the States participate and involve \nthemselves in it. This was a very contentious discussion in the debate \nwhich, eventually, Senator Hatch was successful in winning. Then we \nwould establish the criteria, at least, of the kinds of services that \nwere going to be provided within that kind of a program. That was a \nvery contentious debate, but again Senator Hatch insisted the States \nshould make the judgments on this program. Then we had the issues about \ntrying to make sure about the inclusion, having it be more sweeping, \nand Senator Hatch stuck by his guns to make sure the States were going \nto be the ones that were going to do the outreach and set up this \nprogram.\n  So those issues--in terms of when we are talking about these cliches \nof socialized medicine or Cuban-type of medicine--for those who are \nreally interested in the philosophical underpinnings of this program, \nof why it is different from other programs, if they go back and look \nand carefully read the bill, I must say Senator Hatch's position of \ninsisting that the States be the full partner and be the ones that are \ngoing to have the prime responsibilities has been the fact.\n  I think to the credit of the Senator from Utah is the fact that so \nmany of the Governors are in such support of this legislation--not only \nDemocratic Governors but Republican Governors--because they have seen, \nthey have both the responsibility and the opportunity to make a \ndifference for their constituents.\n  So that is just a small ``factoid'' about the history of the \ndevelopment of this legislation but one that should not be lost when \npeople are thinking about whether this is just another kind of a \ngovernmental program. The Senator insisted on principle on a number of \nthese important philosophical issues, and the Senate, in a bipartisan \nway, came together to support the recommendations that eventually were \nworked out with members of the Finance Committee and Senator Baucus, \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Chafee, and many other colleagues. But the \nunderpinnings were from the Senator from Utah. I think history ought to \nreflect that. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. He is accurate on \neverything except one thing; that is, the 6 million children whom we \nwere supposed to cover, we did on an annualized basis, but really only \nabout 4.5 million were covered fully. I wanted to add that little bit \nbecause it is apparent this program has worked. It is apparent it has \nworked well under this administration as well as under the Clinton \nadministration. It is apparent it has helped millions of kids who \notherwise would not have been helped. It is apparent it has helped the \nchildren of the working poor. But it has not helped all of those who \ndeserve that help. And, over the long run, if we help them today, it \nwill save us money and problems in the future.\n\n[[Page S12193]]\n\n  Frankly, this is an important debate. I acknowledge there are people \nwho disagree. There were back then when we first created CHIP. But the \nfact is, this is a program which has worked. The administration has \nadmitted it has worked. The Governors have admitted it has worked. \nMaybe it is mired in politics that I wish we were not mired in. My \nattitude is, let's think of the kids. If there is a way of improving \nit, I am certainly open to that, but we have come a long way, in a \nbipartisan way, to get where we are. That is not an easy accomplishment \nin a Congress that has been pretty partisan in many respects.\n  I do not think some have really recognized how difficult it was to \nget to where we are and how many concessions both sides have made, in \nparticular the House. So I think this has been an important part, \nmaybe, of the debate this morning.\n  But at this point, how much time would the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia want?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nUtah and appreciate the time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, can I ask how much time the Senator would \ndesire?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I would like to speak as in morning \nbusiness for about 8 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. No objection.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may I ask a question? I have no \nobjection, but is this going to be within the time as expressed by the \nleader?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It would be time yielded by the \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Eight minutes, was it?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Eight minutes, yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today based on an occurrence that took place \nlast evening that caused me to think a little bit about this body and \nour priorities right now at this time.\n  Two gentlemen from my home community of Cobb County, GA, invited me \nto go to dinner with them and about 25 other members of the Cobb \nChamber of Commerce--Mr. Don Beavers, a distinguished retired marine \nwho now works at the Chamber; and the chairman-elect, Sam Kelly. The \ninvitation was to talk about their issues. But they did an amazing \nthing last night: They called Walter Reed, they called the Army, and \nthey said they would like to entertain a couple of our wounded warriors \nwho are being treated as outpatients at Walter Reed hospital.\n\n  So last night, I sat at a table at Old Ebbets Grill with citizens \nfrom my community and two distinguished wounded warriors from the 82nd \nAirborne Division of the U.S. Army. One had served in Iraq as a sniper \nand was injured when an IED exploded on his humvee as he was coming \nback from deployment near Baghdad. Since that hit, he has had 12 \nsurgeries, with substantial reconstruction on the entire left side of \nhis body, from his head to his toe. The other, a special operations \nsoldier of the 82nd Airborne Division, lost his leg. Both--some time \nnow, a year after their initial treatment--still take pain killers, \nstill are in therapy, and still show the scars from their tragic \ninjuries suffered at the hands of an IED in the case of one, and in the \ncase of the other, an RPG, a rocket-propelled grenade.\n  As we sat at the table, I thanked them so much, as all of us do, for \ntheir service to our country and listened to their concerns and \nlistened to their thoughts and listened to their prayers for the \nsoldiers they left when they were injured in Iraq.\n  It occurred to me as we were talking that we are now in the third \nweek in the Senate--over the third week--of debating the \nreauthorization of the Defense bill. Think about that. You sit at \ndinner one night with two soldiers who sacrificed limbs and pain and \nsuffering for you and for me, and we continue to dawdle and get off \ntrack on authorizing or reauthorizing probably the single most \nimportant thing we ought to be doing. I am concerned that the \nleadership has decided to take ancillary issues unrelated to defense, \nunrelated to our men in the field, unrelated to what is going on in the \nworld today, and protracting the debate on what is absolutely essential \nand needed.\n  As I sat there and listened to these two wounded warriors, both of \nwhom suffered from explosive devices that hit their humvee or their \narmored personnel carrier, I realized we were still dawdling on the \ndebate on the authorization of the MRAP; I realized we are dawdling on \nthe debate in terms of the pay raise for our soldiers; I realized, as \nmeritorious as some of the amendments we are discussing may well be, \nthey all pale in comparison to the 170,000 men and women deployed right \nnow in Iraq fighting on our behalf.\n  Now, there are differences of opinion on the war in the Senate, and I \nrespect that. This is the body and this is the place where those \ndifferences should be debated and be debated thoroughly. But I want to \njog everybody's memory for a second. It was May when we did the \nemergency supplemental that we spent not 1 week but 2 weeks on, not \ndebating the supplemental but debating whether we should withdraw or \nset dates certain or leave Iraq. We had numerous votes--none of them \nsuccessful--on setting a date certain. Finally, as Memorial Day \napproached, we decided to pass on the money so needed to support our \ntroops. Then, 60 days later, in the middle of July, pressing before the \nAugust break, another bill came up, and once again we redebated all the \nsame issues with regard to dates certain, with regard to withdrawal, \neven one with regard to defunding the military operations in the war on \nterror and the battle in Iraq.\n  Now here we are, 2 months later, in the third week of a Defense \nauthorization bill, and we have already had these same debates once \nagain, and the votes have not changed except they have lost by a little \nbit more than they lost in July. Yet, all over the country, and last \nnight at Old Ebbets Grill, Americans are sitting down with their sons \nand daughters, who fought in harm's way and have come back, many of \nthem wounded and harmed, and how do you explain to them it takes 3 \nweeks to debate the reauthorization of their pay or 3 weeks to debate \nthe reauthorization of MRAP that just might have prevented the very \ninjuries those two soldiers I sat with last night incurred?\n  So I think it is important that we set priorities. It is very \nimportant, I am sure, to the Senator from Massachusetts to discuss hate \ncrimes legislation. I understand that. But in setting priorities, is it \nright to take something such as hate crimes--which already exists in 45 \nStates, already exists in the Federal law in terms of race and \nreligion--and get all off track on MRAP and reauthorizing the pay of \nour troops and an increase? Is that right? Is that setting the right \npriority? Is it important for us to do that?\n  Is it important for us to do some of the things that have happened \nover the last 3 weeks? In fact, to give a little report card, because I \nhave been intimately involved in amendments on this bill, this Senate, \nin 3 weeks of debate, has passed en bloc 34 amendments to this bill--\nall technical, none requiring debate, one of them mine. It would seem \nthat instead of having all the debate about ancillary subjects or about \nrecirculating amendments that twice before on the floor of the Senate, \nwithin 6 months, have failed, it is about time we got our priorities \nstraight. It is about time we authorize the Department of Defense. It \nis about time we get to the pay raise for our soldiers. It is about \ntime we get to the MRAP that Republicans and Democrats--the Senator \nfrom Delaware, Mr. Biden, and all of us--have worked so hard on.\n  It is about time we set our priorities and get them straight. \nWhatever the merit of other issues may be, if they are unrelated to the \nDepartment of Defense reauthorization, they can wait until another day \nbecause every day our sons and our daughters are deployed for you and \nfor me in harm's way. We can differ on the war, and I respect that, but \nthere should not be a difference on the funding of our men and women \ndeployed in the Middle East.\n  I, for one, call on the leadership for us to get back to the business \nwe are called on to do. Let's complete the DOD authorization without \nany other dilatory tactics or any other ancillary amendments, other \nthan those that relate to the Department of Defense.\n\n[[Page S12194]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Forty minutes on each side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On each side. Good.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes, and the Chair will notify me \nwhen that time has expired.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we mentioned at the opening this \nmorning, there are going to be two major decisions by the Senate this \nmorning: one on dealing with the children's health issue, which we have \nhad a good discussion of here this morning, and the other issue on the \nhate crimes legislation, which we have been attempting to realize for a \nperiod of some 10 years.\n  This is not a new issue to the Defense authorization legislation. We \nhave passed it by more than 60 votes on the last occasion we had it. We \npassed it by a majority on other occasions. So for those who sort of \nsuggest it is not appropriate that we deal with this, the majority--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike--have overwhelmingly supported the \nlegislation. But it has been a strong minority that has resisted it and \nrefused to let it move on into law. We finally are at a time and a \nplace and a judgment where the House of Representatives now has moved \nin favor of the legislation. We have an opportunity today to do it. We \nhaven't taken an unreasonable period of time.\n\n  The application of this legislation and why it should be here is a \nvery simple and basic and fundamental one; that is, what the Defense \nauthorization bill is about--dealing with the challenges of terrorism \noverseas and the support that our men and women ought to get in dealing \nwith terrorism overseas. This is about terrorism in our neighborhoods--\nterrorism in our neighborhoods--and making sure we are going to fight \nit. We can talk about having the MRAP, which I support, in the Defense \nauthorization bill. We are fighting overseas with all of our weapons. \nWe want to fight terrorism at home with all of our weapons.\n  We want to be able to have a value system that is worthy for our \nbrave men and women to defend. They are fighting overseas for our \nvalues. One of the values is that you should not, in this country, in \nthis democracy, permit the kind of hatred and bigotry that has stained \nthe history of this Nation over a very considerable period of time. We \nshould not tolerate it. We keep faith with those men and women who are \nserving overseas when we battle that hatred and bigotry and prejudice \nat home. So we are taking a few minutes in the morning to have this \ndebate and discussion.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, Senate majority leader Harry Reid, \nSenator Smith, and 31 cosponsors of the Matthew Shepard Act by voting \nin favor of cloture and our underlying amendment today. Hate crimes are \ndomestic terrorism. Like all terrorist acts, they seek to bring fear to \nwhole communities through violence on a few. Just as we have committed \nourselves to fighting terrorists who strike from abroad, we must make \nthe same commitment to swift and strong justice against homegrown \nterrorists. We have worked hard to ensure that all of our citizens can \nlive without fear of victimization because of their race, religion, and \ntheir national origin. We have made progress over the years, but we \nneed stronger tools to ensure that all Americans--all Americans--are \nprotected under the law.\n  Hate crimes challenge us to recognize the dignity of each individual \nat the most basic level. When victims are selected for violence because \nof who they are--because of the color of their skin or sexual \norientation--it is a crime that wounds all of us. Each person's life is \nvaluable, and even one life lost is too many. No member of our \nsociety--no one--should be the victim of hate crimes. Today we can send \na message that no one--no one--should be a victim of a hate crime \nbecause of their disability, their sexual orientation, their gender, or \ngender identity.\n  Hate crimes are especially heinous because they deny the dignity, the \nhumanity, and the worth of whole segments of our society. They inflict \nterror not only on the immediate victims but on all their families, \ntheir societies, and, in some cases, an entire Nation. A hate crime \nagainst one member of another group shouts to the other members: You \nare next. You better watch your step when you leave your home, when you \ngo to work, when you travel. This is domestic terrorism, plain and \nsimple, and it is unacceptable as an assault from our enemies abroad \nwho hate us just as irrationally.\n  At bottom, hate crimes strike out at our most fundamental, moral \nvalues. They deny the teaching that we are all--even those viewed as \noutcasts among us--members of the human family. They seek to divide \nthat family by labeling some so unworthy that they should become \nobjects of violence. They reject our great national motto, ``E pluribus \nunum''--out of many, one. Instead, hate crimes seek to divide us, to \nreject whole communities by terrorizing their members.\n  Centuries ago, Blackstone wrote:\n\n       It is but reasonable that among crimes of different \n     natures, those should be most severely punished which are the \n     most destructive of the public safety and happiness.\n\n  Hate-motivated crimes are the most destructive of the public safety \nand happiness and should be punished more severely than other crimes. \nThat is why over 1,400--1,400--clergy from across the spectrum of \nreligious traditions have come together to support the Matthew Shepherd \nAct. They write:\n\n       Although we come from diverse faith backgrounds, our \n     traditions and our sacred texts are united in condemning hate \n     and violence. As religious leaders, we are on the front lines \n     dealing with the devastating effects of hate-motivated \n     violence. Our faith traditions teach us to love our neighbor, \n     and while we cannot legislate love, it is our moral duty to \n     protect one another from hatred and violence.\n\n  These leaders of America's religious communities have called on \nCongress to stand united against the oppression imposed by violence \nbased on personal characteristics and to work together to create a \nsociety in which diverse people are safe as well as free.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, The Interfaith Alliance, a nonpartisan \nadvocacy organization representing 75 different religions, said hate \ncrimes are an assault upon ``the belief that lies at the core of our \ndiverse faith traditions--that every human being is endowed with \ndignity and worth.''\n  This is what The Interfaith Alliance said:\n\n       Hate crimes are an assault upon the belief that lies at the \n     core of our diverse faith traditions--that every human being \n     is endowed with dignity and worth.\n\n  Dignity and worth.\n  The simple fact is, hate crimes are different and more destructive \nthan other crimes. As my friend, Senator Hatch, stated during our \ndebate in 2000:\n\n       Crimes of animus are more likely to provoke retaliatory \n     crimes; they inflict deep, lasting and distinct injuries--\n     some of which never heal--on victims and their family \n     members; they incite community unrest and, ultimately, they \n     are downright un-American.\n\n  The Federal Government has a responsibility to send a clear and \nunambiguous message that hate-motivated violence in any form, from any \nsource, will not be tolerated. Hate crime perpetrators use violence to \ndehumanize and diminish their victims. This legislation fights back by \nreinforcing this country's founding ideals of liberty and justice \nfor all.\n\n  In Iraq and Afghanistan, our soldiers are fighting for freedom and \nliberty. They are on the front lines fighting against hate. We are \nunited in our effort to root out the cells of hatred around the world. \nWe should not turn a blind eye to acts of hatred and terrorism at home. \nWe owe it to our troops to uphold those same principles at home. We \nshould not shrink now from our role as a beacon of liberty to the rest \nof the world. When the Senate approves this amendment, we will send a \nmessage about freedom and equality that will resonate around the world.\n  If America is to live up to its founding ideals of liberty and \njustice for all, combating hate crimes must be a national priority. Now \nis the time for\n\n[[Page S12195]]\n\nCongress to speak with one voice, insisting that all Americans will be \nguaranteed the equal protection of the laws. We must pay more than \nlipservice to this core principle of our democracy, and we must give \nthose words practical meaning in our modern society. No American should \nfeel they are second-class citizens because Congress refuses to protect \nthem against hate crimes.\n  Far too many times, hate crimes have shocked the conscience of the \ncountry. Tolerance in America still faces a serious challenge, and we \nmust have the courage to act. As the Reverend Sockman said:\n\n       The test of courage comes when we are in the minority. The \n     test of tolerance comes when we are in the majority.\n\n  Most of us in this Chamber have lived our lives in the majority, and \nit is time for us to recognize the courage of those who have lived \ntheir lives in the minority and stand up for tolerance. When bigotry \nexists in America, each of us is diminished. Injustice inflicted on any \namong us is injustice against us all.\n  As Leviticus commands us:\n\n       You may not stand idly by when your neighbor's blood is \n     being shed.\n\n  For too long, the Federal Government has been forced to fight this \ninjustice with one hand tied behind its back. We know some crimes are \nmotivated by a desire to harm whole communities. It is time those \ncrimes were punished in a manner that is equal to their \ndestructiveness.\n  The President has threatened to veto this legislation if it comes to \nhis desk, but I urge my fellow Senators to display the same kind of \ncourage that came from David Ritcheson, the victim of a brutal hate \ncrime that scarred him both physically and mentally. Rather than living \nin fear, David bravely came before the House Judiciary Committee and \ncourageously--courageously--described the horrific attack against him \nthe year before.\n  We should fight to protect the rights of our fellow citizens such as \nDavid and not let a veto threat stop us from doing the right thing. \nWith both the Senate and the House moving forward on this legislation, \nI hope the President will hear our call and that he, too, will support \nthis much-needed measure.\n  Nobel Prize laureate Elie Wiesel said:\n\n       Indifference is always the friend of the enemy--\n     Indifference is always the friend of the enemy--for it \n     benefits the aggressor, never the victim, whose pain is \n     magnified when he or she is forgotten.\n\n  Today, we can take a strong stand against indifference and \nintolerance.\n  Dr. King reminded us all that ``our lives begin to end the day we \nbecome silent against the things that matter.'' Today, this body has a \nchance to break the silence. It has the chance to speak with one voice \nin support of the value of every individual in our society. Join me and \nmy colleagues in breaking the silence. Make the fight to end violence \ndriven by bigotry the high national priority that it should be. Now is \nthe time because, as Reverend Martin Luther King reminded us:\n\n       The time is always right to do what is right.\n\n  Now is the time for Congress to speak with one voice and insist that \nall Americans will be guaranteed the equal protections of the law. I \nurge all my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time does each side have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 40 minutes the Senator \nfrom Utah controls and about 25\\1/2\\ minutes for the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to \nthe distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know the great passion and sincerity \nwith which our colleague from Massachusetts brings to this subject, but \nthere is a time and a place for everything, and this is not the time--\n16 days into the Defense authorization bill which should have been \nfinished a long time ago--to inject extraneous matters and matters \nwhich, as I will explain, have been poorly thought out and not \ncompletely aired by the Members of Congress.\n  A few blocks from here is the United States Supreme Court building, \nand above the entry to that building reads the motto ``Equal Justice \nUnder The Law.'' Equal justice under the law. Too many people have \nsacrificed too much for too long to make sure that guarantee of equal \njustice under the law is a reality for Congress to continue down the \npath to treat some crimes unequal from others.\n  Every civilized Nation recognizes that all people deserve equal \nprotection from criminal attacks. Unfortunately, there are some who \nreject that notion. But they are brought before the bar of justice, \ntried, many convicted, and many punished according to the laws we have \non our books at the State level and, yes, even at the Federal level. I \nfear by trying to inject this extraneous matter on to a Defense \nauthorization bill without adequate time for deliberation and \ndiscussion and inquiry, that Congress and the Senate in particular are \nbeing asked to pass on legislation without full knowledge of the \nconsequences of the legislation.\n  For example, under current Federal law, an individual who violates \ncurrent Federal hate crimes law can be given the death penalty by a \njury in appropriate circumstances. Under this legislation the Senate is \nbeing asked to vote on today, the death penalty is not available for \nviolating this particular amendment or this particular legislative \nlanguage.\n  Thus, James Byrd's killers were convicted under State law, and \naccording to a jury verdict, after exhausting all appellate remedies, \nwere ultimately executed. If the same individuals committing those \nheinous acts back then were charged by a Federal prosecutor under this \nbill, they could not be given the death penalty by the jury. That is \nonly one example of how this particular provision has not been \nthoroughly thought out or the consequences thoroughly vetted.\n  I will be very clear. I don't support this legislation on the merits \nbecause I do believe in equal justice under the law. I believe \nindividuals ought to be treated as individuals and not as members of \ngroups, and that all human beings are entitled to the dignity God gave \nthem by creating them, and they all ought to come equally before the \nbar of justice when they are accused of crimes and be given equal \njustice under the law. It is a mistake, in my judgment, to begin to \ntreat people unequally based on the same conduct because of notions \nthat some crimes are simply more despicable than others based upon the \nindividual against whom they are perpetrated.\n  All crimes of violence are crimes of hate. All ought to be judged \naccording to the same criteria. All ought to be subject to the same \nrange of punishments given to juries able to convict people based on \nevidence in court, not based on a politically correct notion that some \ncrimes are more heinous than others. All crimes of violence are heinous \nand all ought to be punished equally under the law.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has alluded to the \nthreat of a Presidential veto of this legislation if this amendment is \npassed, thus, making one of my points, that by introducing this \namendment on the Defense authorization bill, the sponsors of this \namendment are jeopardizing our ability to pass a Defense authorization \nbill.\n  It is worth recounting what it is the Defense authorization bill \nprovides and what they are putting in jeopardy by insisting on this \nextraneous amendment at this time: a pay raise of 3 percent; the \nauthority to pay bonuses as special pay for enlistment and \nreenlistment; flight pay; various medical and dental benefits; nuclear \nincentive pay; an authorization for an additional 13,000 active-duty \nsoldiers and 9,000 active-duty marines.\n  In the Boston Globe of September 27, 2007, the Army's top officer, \nGeneral Casey, said what we all know, which is that the military has \nbeen stretched too thin. We know, based on the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, Senator Webb, these are concerns \nwe all share about the lengthy deployments of our troops because we \ndon't have enough men and women in uniform, particularly in the Marines \nand members of the U.S. Army; and this bill, which this amendment puts \nin jeopardy, expands the end strength of the Army to reduce that stress \nand strain on our volunteer military and their families. We should not \nput it in jeopardy.\n  This bill also authorizes an additional $4 billion for the MRAPs. To \nrecall, the MRAPs are the mine resistant ambush protected vehicles that \nare specially constructed vehicles devised\n\n[[Page S12196]]\n\nto defeat IEDs and save the lives and limbs of U.S. soldiers. Why in \nthe world, in order to add extraneous legislation that has nothing to \ndo with national security, would the advocates of this amendment \njeopardize the ability to pass this Defense authorization bill, which \nis so important to our men and women in uniform? It is one thing to \nclaim we support our military members; it is another thing to act on \nthat stated conviction.\n  Have no doubt about it, this amendment has nothing to do with our \nmilitary. There are remedies in place under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice if, in fact, there is an attempt to link this to the \nmilitary somehow. I think that is a spurious claim. There are a myriad \nof laws, since 1968 under the Federal United States Code itself, \ndealing with hate crimes. As I mentioned, this bill, because it has \nbeen brought in haste on this legislation without an opportunity for \ncalm deliberation and investigation and understanding by Members, \nactually dilutes some of the penalties currently available under \nFederal law if, in fact, the same conduct were indicted or charged \nunder this amendment if it were to become law. Why in the world would \nthe advocates of this legislation want to dilute the punishment that is \npotentially available to the jury in admittedly heinous crimes?\n  It would be a mistake, and a mistake made out of haste. We should not \nindulge the desire to pass this legislation, no matter how sincere it \nis, in haste and without the kind of calm deliberation that will allow \nthe Members of the Senate to understand what they are voting on and \nwhat we are doing. We should not jeopardize passing the Defense \nauthorization bill, which contains the essential protections and \nbenefits for our military members by loading it down with this \nextraneous amendment; or as the Senator from Illinois said, he wants to \nadd an amendment relating to immigration. We know that will only spawn \nother amendments and burden this bill down so it will never pass. That \nwould be a travesty.\n\n  Instead of engaging in these ill-considered attempts to burden this \nimportant legislation with extraneous amendments, we ought to be doing \nthe rest of our work. Why are we going to have to pass a continuing \nresolution to keep the Federal Government open before we leave this \nweek? It is because none of the appropriation bills that are to pay for \nthe Federal Government to keep the Federal Government open have cleared \nthe Congress and gone to the President to be signed. We are simply not \ntaking care of the people's business when we engage in rabbit trails \nsuch as this amendment calls for.\n  I don't doubt the sincerity of the sponsors of this amendment. I \ndisagree with them on adding this amendment to this important \nlegislation for the reasons I have stated. I even disagree with them \nthat some crimes ought to be treated or punished unequally than others \nbased upon a membership in a particular group that can be identified, \nas I have described. So I don't doubt their sincerity; I just disagree \nwith them. But we ought to have this debate at a time when we can focus \nour efforts, after a hearing and due deliberation, and after adequate \nconsideration about the merits of the particular proposal, as we \nordinarily do--not add it on 16 days after we have started the Defense \nauthorization bill that has taken too long, jeopardizing our ability to \nadd to the end strength and relieve the stress of our men and women in \nuniform and their families, and make sure they get the dignified \ntreatment of the Wounded Warriors Act, which is part of this underlying \nDefense authorization bill, so we can deal with the concerns expressed \nagain in the GAO report, which said the reforms we all want to come \nquickly are coming far too slowly when it comes to cutting the redtape \nand making sure our wounded warriors not only get the medical care they \ndeserve, but get to move through the Department of Defense health care \nsystem and Veterans Affairs system in a way that lightens their load \nand not burdens them further.\n  I think it is a mistake to consider this amendment at this time and \nin this way--a way that jeopardizes this important legislation. It has \nnothing--zero--to do with the Defense authorization bill.\n  Whatever the merits of the amendment may be, I encourage the majority \nleader to give the proponents of this amendment an opportunity to \npresent it at another time when we don't place in jeopardy these \nimportant benefits and relief designed to help our men and women in \nuniform during a time of war. We are at war. Why in the world would we \nbe engaged in these rabbit trails on extraneous topics when we ought to \nbe providing our men and women in uniform the relief they deserve and \nso urgently need.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote against cloture on this amendment, no \nmatter how good the intentions may be. I disagree that it belongs on \nthis bill. I disagree that we should jeopardize this important \nlegislation with extraneous matters such as immigration amendments, or \nhate crimes amendments, or anything else that doesn't have to do with \nhelping our men and women in uniform during a time of war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened carefully to my friend from \nTexas. We have spent more time in quorum calls around here over these \nlast few days. We spent a good deal of time on a poster--expressing the \nwill of the Senate on various posters. We spent hours on those issues. \nTalk about delaying paying for the troops. I didn't hear those \narguments when we were trying to uparmor HMMWVs last year. So I have \ndifficulty in giving a lot of focus and attention to it.\n  Quite frankly, I imagine the Senator is talking about the DREAM Act, \nwhich will permit children who have been in this country for 5 years--\nbrought in by their parents through no fault of their own--that we \neither permit them to go through an education or join the military--\njoin the military. That has something to do with the Defense \nauthorization bill--when we find out that many units are not being kept \nup to speed. So we will move ahead.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator has 24 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, like Senator Kennedy, I feel it appropriate \nto respond very respectfully to a dear friend of mine from Texas. I \nhave great affection for him. I have only been in this body for 11 \nyears. For 11 years, I have been working on this piece of legislation. \nFor 11 years, it has often been put on the Defense authorization bill--\npassed several times by the Senate. You might wonder why is it \nappropriate to put on the Defense authorization bill. Let me put a \nhuman face on it. This photo depicts a Navy seaman who was a gay man \nserving lawfully under ``don't ask, don't tell.'' Somehow it was \ndiscovered that he was a gay man. He was beaten to death so brutally \nthat his mother was only able to recognize his body because of a tattoo \nthat she was able to recognize.\n  The U.S. military is not immune from hate crimes. It is utterly and \nentirely appropriate that this be on the Defense authorization bill--if \nnot for this man's reason, for the fact that we are engaged in a war on \nterrorism, utilizing our U.S. military. They are fighting terrorism \nabroad. Surely we have the stuff in the Senate to fight terrorism at \nhome and within the military. If you need a human face for why this is \nentirely appropriate, look at Allen Schindler, whose mother was only \nable to identify him because of a tattoo she knew he had.\n\n  In terms of doing this in haste, I am not on the Judiciary Committee, \nbut I know there have been many hearings in Congress after Congress and \ndebates in the past 11 years in which I have participated. This is not \ndone in haste. This is done thoughtfully and deliberately in Senate \nfashion. I don't think that charge sticks, and I think it is high time \nwe pass this legislation and that we fight terrorism at home and abroad \nand even within the military.\n  I have made it a practice, since becoming aware that the Federal \nGovernment did not have a backstop law to State law, of a need to have \nthe Federal Government to have authority to show up to work, to be able \nto be a backstop to State and local law--not preempt them but to help \nthem and to let Americans know that at every level\n\n[[Page S12197]]\n\nof their Government, we care about public safety, we care about \nfighting terrorism.\n  Some will say this law is symbolism, it will not do anything. Ever \nsince the Ten Commandments came down off Mount Sinai, the law has also \nbeen a teacher. We all fall short of the law. But the truth of the \nmatter is, it does set a societal standard. I believe the Federal \nGovernment should join the States in setting this standard so this law \ncan go from symbol to substance because it can, over time, change \nhearts and minds.\n  When one does what I have done, and that is enter into the \nCongressional Record a hate crime committed in the United States almost \nevery day I have served in the Senate, I think it is apparent we have a \nproblem, and I think it is apparent the Federal Government ought to \nhave a role.\n  This law, symbolic as it is, can change hearts and minds and can be \nreal substance. We are neglecting our role in this fight against hatred \nat home in living up to our national motto: ``E Pluribus Unum''; out of \nmany one.\n  So irrespective of one's race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, \nwe get equal protection under the law, and this is a glaring omission \nin the standard of equal protection, as I see it.\n  When I went to law school, I learned that to establish a crime, one \nof the first elements you have to determine is motive and intent. Some \nhave said this is thought speech. The truth is, no thoughts are \npunished here. There is nothing in this amendment that prevents one \nfrom saying and thinking anything. The first amendment is unaffected by \nthis legislation. But what this says is, if you think it, you speak it, \nand you act on it, you come under the jurisdiction of local, State, and \nI hope Federal hate crimes laws.\n  It is an element in a crime. Some argue it is unconstitutional. This \nvery issue, as it related to sexual orientation in a Wisconsin case, \nwas tried all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. A unanimous decision \nwas written affirming the inclusion of sexual orientation and the \nconstitutionality of the Wisconsin State law. I have it in my hand. It \nis called Wisconsin v. Mitchell. It was written by William Rehnquist, \nnot exactly a liberal, who made it very clear that hate crimes laws are \nconstitutional because it goes to action, criminal behavior, and the \nspeech, the thought, all of those are mere elements in proving a crime.\n  Many of my brothers and sisters in the religious community are now \nsaying on national television even that this will limit the free \nexercise of religion, it will limit their ability to preach and \ninterpret the Bible any way they want. If it did that, I would not be \nhere. But if it did that, they would already be in jail because most \nStates in the United States already have these laws. They are \nconstitutional. They go to the elements of establishing the commission \nof a crime.\n  It is high time we passed this legislation. We have passed it as a \nSenate many times. We now have an opportunity to get it to the next \nstep. I hope and pray the President does not veto it. We are not doing \nthis in haste. We are not doing this because it is inappropriate on the \nDefense authorization bill. We are doing it because it is high time the \nFederal Government be able to show up to work in rural places such as \nLaramie, WY, where this young man was brutally beaten to death. This is \nMatthew Shepard. Matthew's mother Judy is a friend of mine. The sheriff \nin Laramie, WY, is one of the individuals who persuaded me they needed \nthe help of the Federal Government. They were overwhelmed with what \nhappened in the case of this young man, a 21-year-old college student \nwhose life was taken on this lonely fence.\n  His life was taken not because they wanted his money or they wanted \nsomething else from him. They knew he was gay, and they beat him and \nleft him to die on this fence in Wyoming.\n  With Matthew's mother's permission, Senator Kennedy and I have named \nthis amendment the Matthew Shepard Act. What happened to Matthew should \nhappen to no one, no matter their religion, no matter their race, no \nmatter their ethnicity, no matter their sexual orientation, because in \nthe public square, we are all imperfect people. In the public square, \nwe have a duty to provide public safety for all Americans, no matter \ntheir transgressions or whatever we think of their lifestyles.\n  This is a glaring omission in Federal law. I hope we are about to \nright it, and I hope as we do, we will remember the sacrifice and the \ncommitment and the advocacy of Judy Shepard on behalf of her son and \nhis memory. Let us enshrine this act in his name in our law because it \nis the right thing to do, and it is about time we do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will take a few seconds, and then I will \nyield to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  To be honest with you, I don't think anybody differs with about 90 \npercent of what the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts or the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon have said, but it needs to be pointed \nout that in every case they have cited, State law took care of it and \ntook care of it stronger than this bill will take care of it.\n  Frankly, whether it is Matthew Shepard or whether it is Byrd or \nwhether it is the other case the distinguished Senator from Oregon \nmentioned, there is no need to federalize these crimes because they are \nbeing taken care of.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, before my colleague from Oregon leaves, I \ndon't think there is anybody in this body who is more respected than \nSenator Gordon Smith. He is a very sincere, thoughtful guy who tries to \npersonalize issues that affect people throughout this country. I know \nhe is motivated by all the right reasons, but somebody needs to talk \nabout the politics.\n  This legislation has been placed on the Defense authorization bill in \nthe past. It never made it out of conference because we knew, with the \nmakeup of the conference, the amendment would fall. Given the makeup of \nthis conference, the amendment will be part of the bill and it is going \nto be vetoed. That is the politics. Whether one agrees with President \nBush, he said he is going to veto this bill, and if I were him, I would \nas Commander in Chief. I would not buy into this way of legislating.\n  Another reason for this amendment, if you think there is a gap in \nmilitary law that without this kind of amendment the military is not \ngoing to prosecute people who act on their prejudices, you are wrong. \nIf someone in uniform commits a crime against a civilian or another \nperson in uniform, I don't care why they did it; if they beat somebody \nup, hurt somebody, they are going to get prosecuted. That is the way \nthe military law works.\n  We are not doing the military a favor by passing this legislation \nbecause there is no problem in the military in terms of how justice is \nadministered. Whatever motivates you to hurt someone or to take the law \nin your own hands or act on your prejudices, you are going to be dealt \nwith because we cannot have good order and discipline in the military \nwhen people can hurt someone based on their individual prejudice \nbecause the whole unit falls apart. This is nothing the military needs. \nThey are going to take care of violence in the ranks based on the law \nthey already have.\n  I can assure my colleagues that no one in the military gets a pass \nbecause of the status of their victim. If you engage in violent \nconduct, inappropriate behavior, illegal behavior, the law is going to \ncome down on your head because we need good order and discipline.\n  The politics of this amendment is that this bill will get vetoed. The \nPresident is not going to agree to this social legislation on the \nDefense authorization bill, and we have to take responsibility for that \naction. Whether one agrees with him or not, we are going to put in \njeopardy items the military does need. They don't need a hate crimes \nbill to make it an effective fighting force. We already have \ndisciplinary tools to discipline people. They need pay raises and MRAP \nprotection, and this bill provides those items.\n  Members of this body have different views about hate crimes \nlegislation. We can argue those differences any time, anywhere, on any \nother piece of\n\n[[Page S12198]]\n\nlegislation. It can be brought up as a freestanding bill. But to put it \non this bill is going to put in jeopardy items our men and women who \nare in combat and being shot at need. When I go to Iraq, I don't have a \nlot of people coming up to me saying we need to pass a hate crimes \nbill. They do need better body armor. They do need pay raises. They do \nneed better MRAPs.\n  I think this is a very poor use of the legislative process knowing \nthe end game. The end game is, we are going to hijack the Defense \nauthorization bill by legislation not needed in the military, that is \ncontentious, and that has an opportunity to be debated somewhere else. \nI hope reason prevails eventually.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 14 \nminutes, and the Senator from Utah controls 22 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 5 minutes from the \ntime of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering an \namendment to the Department of Defense bill to address crimes that \nterrorize entire communities. Violent crimes motivated by prejudice and \nhate are tragedies that haunt American history. From the lynchings that \nplagued race relations for more than a century to the well-publicized \nslayings of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., in the 1990s, this is \na story we have heard too often in this country. Unfortunately, in my \nhome state of Vermont, there have been two recent attacks that appear \nto have been motivated by the victims' religion or sexual orientation. \nA well-respected State representative in the Vermont Legislature has \nnot been immune to threats of violence based solely on his sexual \norientation.\n  I am proud to once again be a cosponsor of this legislation. I would \nlike to express my appreciation to the Senator from Massachusetts and \nthe Senator from Oregon for their work on this. I hope that this time \nCongress will have the courage to pass it. Six years ago, I made this \nbill one of the first major bills to move through the Judiciary \nCommittee after I became chairman. It passed the Senate in the 106th \nCongress and again in the 108th Congress, but Republicans in the House \nblocked this important bill each time. In the Democratically led House \nof Representatives, the companion bill this year passed by a wide \nbipartisan margin. So I am hopeful that this time, Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate will join together finally to enact this \ncivil rights measure into law.\n  This hate crimes legislation improves current law by making it easier \nfor Federal authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes based on \nrace, color, religion, and national origin. Victims will no longer have \nto be engaged in a narrow range of activities, such as serving as a \njuror, to be protected under Federal law. This bill also focuses the \nattention and resources of the Federal Government on the problem of \nhate crimes committed against people because of their sexual \norientation, gender, or disability, which is an important and long \noverdue expansion of protection. Finally, this bill provides assistance \nand resources to State, local, and tribal law enforcement to address \nhate crimes.\n  The crimes targeted in this bill are particularly pernicious crimes \nthat affect more than just their victims and their victims' families--\nthey inspire fear in those who have no connection to the victim other \nthan a shared characteristic such as race or sexual orientation. When \nJames Byrd, Jr., was dragged behind a pickup truck and killed by bigots \nin Texas in 1998 for no reason other than his race, many African \nAmericans throughout our Nation surely felt diminished as citizens. \nWhen Matthew Shepard was brutally murdered in Wyoming the same year \nbecause of his sexual orientation, many in the gay and lesbian \ncommunity felt less safe on our streets and in their homes. These \ncrimes promote fear and insecurity that are distinct from the reactions \nto other crimes, and we need to take action to enhance their \nprosecution.\n  All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they \nchoose. In the past, we have responded as a Nation to deter and to \npunish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted Federal laws to \nprotect the civil rights of all of our citizens for nearly 150 years. \nThe Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act continues that \ngreat and honorable tradition.\n  This bill will strengthen Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a \nbackup, but not a substitute, for State and local law enforcement. \nStates will still bear primary responsibility for prosecuting most hate \ncrimes, which is important to me as a former State prosecutor. In a \nsign that this legislation respects the proper balance between Federal \nand local authority, it has received strong bipartisan support from \nState and local law enforcement organizations across the country.\n  Moreover, this bill accomplishes a critically important goal--\nprotecting all of our citizens--without compromising our constitutional \nresponsibilities. It is a tool for combating acts and threats of \nviolence motivated by hatred and bigotry. But it does not target pure \nspeech, however offensive or disagreeable. The Constitution does not \npermit us in Congress to prohibit the expression of an idea simply \nbecause we disagree with it. As Justice Holmes wrote, the Constitution \nprotects not just freedom for the thought and expression we agree with, \nbut freedom for the thought that we hate. I am devoted to that \nprinciple, and I am confident that this bill does not contradict it.\n  We have been trying for years to pass the Local Law Enforcement Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act. It is appropriate to attach this important \nlegislation to the pending Department of Defense authorization bill, as \nwe have done twice in recent memory, because this is a pressing issue. \nI hope that we will not see another Republican-led filibuster on what \nshould be a bipartisan measure.\n  Adoption of this amendment will show once again that America values \ntolerance and protects all of its people. I urge the opponents of this \nmeasure to consider the message it sends when year after year, we are \nprevented from enacting this broadly supported bill. The victims of \nhate deserve better. Let us join together and adopt these provisions \nwithout further obstruction and delay.\n\n\n                  Children's Health Insurance Program\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to express again my strong support for the \nreauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program. When we \ntalk about the work of this Congress, I believe the extension of CHIP \nwill stand out as one of the great accomplishments of this body. The \nbill is a clear statement of the priority of the majority in the \nCongress.\n  In passing this legislation, we state clearly that the health of our \nNation's children is an issue too important to be dealt with in a \n``business as usual'' fashion. This is a program that represents the \nbest of what can happen when Members of both sides of the aisle come \ntogether to forge a consensus, with Democrats and Republicans working \ntogether for that consensus.\n  The outcome is a solid compromise on a vital issue: more health \ninsurance coverage for millions of children. The choice is clear. \nEither you support children's health care or you do not. Either it \ndeserves to be a high priority on our agenda or it does not. Frankly, \nas a parent, as a grandparent, I don't see this as a choice at all. It \nis a matter of priority. Few issues are as important as caring for our \nchildren.\n  Instead of helping more families who are struggling to afford basic \nhealth care for their children, the President would cut thousands in \nVermont who have coverage right now. He is failing to lead, so Congress \nagain is stepping in to realign our priorities.\n  If we can find the money to fund the war in Iraq for 41 days, the \nsame amount that would pay for 10 million children to have health \ninsurance for a whole year, then we can pay for this bill. I have heard \nsome argue the bill should be opposed because it raises taxes on \ntobacco--just tobacco. Anyone who opposes this bill on these grounds is \nchoosing big tobacco over children's health.\n  I support this bill because I believe it is a travesty that in the \nrichest, most\n\n[[Page S12199]]\n\npowerful country in the world, there are more than 47 million people \nwithout health insurance. It is an absolutely shocking number. It \nrepresents roughly one in six people who are going without regular \ntrips to the doctor and foregoing needed medications and who are forced \nto use the emergency room for care because they have nowhere else to \nturn. These are our friends, our neighbors, and millions of our \nchildren.\n  My wife, during the years when she worked as a registered nurse, saw \nthese people and realized what happened to them.\n  The legislation before us will extend and renew health care coverage \nfor 10 million children. My own State of Vermont has been a national \nleader in children's health care. Even before the creation of CHIP, we \nknew this was the right thing to do. Because of our early action, \nVermont has the lowest rates for uninsured children in the country, \nmaking our State a leader and an example for the rest of the Nation. \nThis bill will bring us still closer to the goal of covering all \nchildren in our State but also to thousands elsewhere.\n  We are faced with many choices in the Senate. For me, the choice in \nthis bill is clear. It is a must-pass bill. It is worthy of our \nsupport. I urge all my colleagues to stand for the children of this \ncountry and support this bill, and I urge the President to abandon his \nill-advised threats and to sign it into law. If we can afford the war \nin Iraq, we can afford to insure our children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just want to share a few thoughts with \nmy colleagues on the pending amendment. This hate crimes legislation is \nconstitutionally dubious and very unusual legislation in the history of \nhow we do law enforcement in America.\n  What I want to say to my colleague is that a murder in Utah, a murder \nin Massachusetts, a murder in Alabama is not a Federal crime unless \ncertain other events occur, unless it is related to some other event. A \nrobbery in any State is not a Federal crime per se. It has to be \nrobbery of a Federal bank. It has to be robbery of an interstate \nshipment or something of that nature. But simple assaults, simple \nmurders, no matter how grievous, are not Federal crimes. So the Supreme \nCourt has been cautious about that and has raised questions about it.\n  Now, with regard to our history of legislating in this area, we have \nmade Federal civil rights laws applicable to assaults and murders of \npeople in America on account of their race, and the Supreme Court has \nupheld that. One of the fundamental reasons for that is that in many \nareas of the country, for many years--truly not so today, I believe, \nbut in the past, areas such as my area of the country, have not \nprosecuted those cases, and there was a historical record of a failure \nto effectively prosecute in racial assaults that affected people's \nfundamental civil liberties. So that has been upheld. But the \nlegislation we are talking about today is about picking an area that \npeople care about and are concerned about and feel deeply about, which \nis that people should not be assaulted or abused as a result of their \nsexual orientation, and now we want to create a Federal crime wherever \nin America such an assault or an illegal activity or murder against \nthat person occurs. We want to make that a Federal crime.\n  One of my colleagues said it is a backstop for the Federal \nGovernment. It is not a backstop. I was a Federal prosecutor. Federal \nlaw has priority. So this is a move in that direction.\n  So the question is, what about the elderly? What about those who are \nsick and infirm? What about police officers, if they are murdered? Do \nwe need the Federal Government to make that a crime also and be able to \nprosecute all of those murders throughout the country when we have \nnever done that historically? It is a big deal from that perspective, \nand that is why it is constitutionally suspect.\n  A State can pass such a law, I will admit. The Federal Government can \npass such a law on Federal property, military bases, and the District \nof Columbia. But when the Federal Government reaches into a State that \nhas no interstate nexus and creates a crime of this kind, I think it \nis, first, constitutionally questionable; secondly, not necessarily \ngood policy because what other kinds of crimes motivated by what other \nkinds of malintent are we going to now make a Federal crime?\n  So Senator Hatch has explicitly and openly and directly delineated \nthe very aggressive prosecutions we are seeing in States for hate-type \ncrimes against homosexuals, and he has shown how a number of them have \ngotten a death penalty, which this act does not provide for, but State \nlaws do. We have no record to indicate there is a shortage or a lack of \nwillingness to prosecute these cases, so I think, under those \ncircumstances, we ought not to do it.\n  I also would note it would be a tragic thing indeed if this Defense \nbill would be vetoed as a result of this extraneous piece of \ncontroversial legislation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this has been an interesting exercise, as \nfar as I am concerned, but I rise to oppose this hate crimes \nlegislation. This is wrong--hate crimes legislation. Instead, we have \nthe opportunity to support the prosecution of hate crimes in a \nmeaningful and a legitimate way that is different from this.\n  I have said for years in this Chamber that violence motivated by bias \nagainst a particular group is abhorrent. Everybody in this body \nbelieves that. There is no issue here. We believe that. I believe such \nconduct must and should be made a crime and punished differently from \nother crimes. I know all of my colleagues share my conviction about \nhate crimes. But where should that conviction lead us? The conviction \nthat hate crimes are abhorrent leads me to ask what Congress may \nproperly do about it. That conviction cannot, however, justify \nsupporting the wrong legislation.\n  The Senate has before it today two amendments which represent two \ndifferent approaches to the problem of hate crimes. I believe the \namendment offered by my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, is unwise, unnecessary, and unconstitutional. Some would argue \nthe ends justify the means. They say, if you believe hate crimes are \nabhorrent, then you must vote for the Kennedy amendment. That certainly \nis not true, and I urge my colleagues to resist that sort of misguided \npressure.\n  Our obligation is not only to pursue the right goals but to do it in \nthe right way. The Kennedy amendment would federalize the prosecution \nof hate crimes. It would create a new Federal felony, punishable by up \nto 10 years in prison, for causing bodily injury to another because of \nthat person's actual or perceived religion, national origin, gender, \nsexual orientation--gender identity?--or disability.\n  This amendment is unwise because of how it is drafted and how its \nsupporters are trying to get it passed. The Senator from Massachusetts \nintroduced S. 622 in the 106th Congress. He introduced S. 966 in the \n108th Congress. He introduced S. 1105 in April. It would prohibit \nviolence motivated by an additional new category of bias. The amendment \nbefore us today would do the same. That process of adding categories \nconstituency by constituency and extending the reach of the Federal \nhate crimes law could continue indefinitely.\n  When my colleagues consider whether to support the current Kennedy \namendment, even if they have supported previous versions, they should \nknow that this amendment before us today is broader than any version of \nthis legislation ever considered by this body. In its latest iteration, \nthe Kennedy amendment would prohibit violence motivated by gender, \nsexual orientation, and gender identity. Now, there has been no public \ndiscussion about what these terms mean, how they may differ, and \nwhether they can be applied in anything approaching a consistent and \nreasonable way.\n  But let me address another problem with including the latest new \ncategory--what the Kennedy amendment calls perceived gender identity. \nThe term ``perceived'' applies to gender identity as it applies to the \nother categories, and it refers to the perpetrator's perception. In \nother words, the amendment prohibits violence based on\n\n[[Page S12200]]\n\nwhat the perpetrator perceives to be the victim's gender identity. But \nthe term ``gender identity'' refers to the victim's perception. Get \nthat? The term ``gender identity'' refers to the victim's perception.\n  The online resource Wikipedia defines gender identity as:\n\n       Whether one perceives oneself to be a man, a woman, or \n     describes oneself in some less conventional way.\n\n  Now, the contradiction is obvious. The Kennedy amendment would \ncriminalize violence based on the perpetrator's perception of the \nvictim's self-perception. Whether or not this is good sociology--and I \ndon't believe it is--it is bad legislation.\n\n  The Kennedy amendment is also unwise in the way its supporters are \ntrying to get it passed. Even though my good friend from Massachusetts \nintroduced it as a separate bill, we are here today considering it as \nan amendment to the Defense authorization bill. Some justify that by \nsaying it would also protect members of the military. This measure \nwould protect those serving in the military as well as everyone it \nattempts to cover whether it is attached to this bill or any other bill \non any other subject at any other time. So that is not a good argument.\n  Its proponents wanted to attach the Kennedy amendment to this \nlegislative vehicle not because it is relevant to the Defense \nauthorization bill but because we consider the Defense authorization \nbill around here to be what we call a must-pass bill. If the Kennedy \namendment prohibited violence against individuals because of their \nstatus as members of the military, I suppose it might be more relevant \nto the Defense bill. But I note that the Kennedy amendment does no such \nthing.\n  The Kennedy amendment does not belong on the Defense authorization \nbill, especially when the President has already threatened to veto the \namendment and may have to veto this bill because of this amendment, a \nbill that is absolutely necessary for the benefit of our soldiers.\n  Now, in addition to being unwise, the Kennedy amendment is \nunnecessary. State laws already provide for prosecuting the underlying \nviolence prohibited by the Kennedy amendment. Laws against murder, \nrape, assault, and the like are State laws, and they should remain that \nway. Forty-six States also have hate crimes legislation on the books \nthat either criminalize substantive offenses or enhance criminal \npenalties for existing offenses because of their motive or bias.\n  By the way, the murderers of James Byrd in Texas and Matthew Shepard \nin Wyoming, after whom this bill is named, were either sentenced to \ndeath or are in prison for the rest of their lives under State law, \nmore than this bill would do. My point is, State laws have been taking \ncare of these matters, and there is absolutely no evidence that the \nproponents of this bill have been able to show that States are not \ndoing their job under their laws, which are better than this law.\n  While these are the most widely cited examples, the Byrd and Shepard \ncases, and the other case cited by my friend from Oregon to demonstrate \nthe need for the Kennedy amendment, it would treat both of these hate \ncrime murders more leniently than current State law does.\n  There is no evidence that State and local governments are incapable \nof prosecuting these crimes, or that they are failing to do so.\n  Fewer than 17 percent of all law enforcement agencies reported even a \nsingle hate crime in 2005.\n  Hate crimes account for less than one-tenth of 1 percent of crimes in \nAmerica.\n  The majority of hate crimes involve such things as vandalism or \nverbal intimidation.\n  By requiring actual or threatened bodily injury, the Kennedy \namendment focuses on an even smaller portion of hate crimes.\n  This means that States would be more, not less, able to address the \nhate crime problem themselves.\n  The States are, in fact, already doing so.\n  In addition to being unwise and unnecessary, the Kennedy amendment is \nunconstitutional.\n  Yesterday in this Chamber, my good friend from Massachusetts \nstrenuously emphasized, clearly and unambiguously, that his amendment \nis not limited by existing Federal jurisdiction.\n  In fact, he deliberately wants to break this new Federal hate crime \nfelony free from any such limitation.\n  In his words, the limitation of requiring Federal jurisdiction for \nsuch a Federal crime would be ``outdated, unwise, and unnecessary.''\n  He said the same thing in April when he introduced this measure as a \nseparate bill.\n  But the requirement that Congress have authority to legislate on such \nan issue derives from the very Constitution that each of us has sworn \nto support and defend.\n  We must have affirmative authority, derived from the Constitution, to \nlegislate.\n  By giving us only delegated powers, America's founders rejected the \nidea that the desirable ends justify the political means.\n  Federalizing crime is legitimate only when it is connected to a power \nproperly exercised by the Federal Government.\n  Rejecting the requirement of Federal jurisdiction in the legislation \nbefore us is rejecting the limitations imposed upon us by the \nConstitution.\n  With all due respect to my good friend from Massachusetts, I do not \nbelieve the Constitution is outdated, unwise, or unnecessary.\n  In its findings, the Kennedy amendment cites the 13th amendment to \nthe Constitution, which banned slavery and involuntary servitude, as a \nconstitutional basis for this legislation.\n  Modern forms of slavery do exist, and I urge my colleagues to support \nefforts by the Departments of Justice, Labor, and State to uncover and \neliminate such heinous practices as human trafficking and forced \nprostitution.\n  But that is not what the Kennedy amendment, or existing hate crimes \nlaws for that matter, are about and they cannot hook their train to the \n13th amendment engine.\n  Connecting 19th century slavery with 21st century perceived gender \nidentity at least requires a long series of rhetorical dots, but it \nshould require more than a storytelling imagination to produce sound \nlegislation.\n  The Kennedy amendment's growing list of prohibited bias categories \nextends far beyond anything the Supreme Court has ever recognized as \nrelating to the badges and incidence of slavery.\n  We do not have to speculate about other constitutional defects in the \nKennedy amendment.\n  As I said yesterday in this chamber, the Supreme Court struck down a \nportion of the Violence Against Women Act--I was a prime sponsor with \nSenator Biden of that bill--because Congress's authority to regulate \ninterstate commerce did not extend to turning State crimes into Federal \nlawsuits.\n  The Court emphasized the distinction between the truly national and \ntruly local and concluded that Federal legislation must be directed at \nsuch things as the actual instrumentalities, channels, or goods \ninvolved in interstate commerce.\n  The Kennedy amendment tries to avoid the same fate by appearing to \nrequire an interstate commerce nexus for some of the hate crimes it \nwould cover.\n  If its backers are serious about this requirement, as the Supreme \nCourt surely is, this would further reduce the hate crimes the Kennedy \namendment would actually reach.\n  Their rhetoric and the ever-expanding list of prohibited bias \ncategories in successive versions of this legislation, however, make me \nwonder whether they genuinely want the Kennedy amendment to be so \nnarrowly applied.\n  As I said in this chamber yesterday, my good friend from \nMassachusetts, in the straightforward and direct way we have all come \nto appreciate and respect, has said unequivocally that all hate crimes \nwill face Federal prosecution.\n  This will lead to a massive federalization of hate crimes that \ntraditionally have been, and that constitutionally should remain, left \nto the authority of the States.\n  There is no need to burden prosecutors and courts and do such damage \nto our constitutional framework of government.\n  Our conviction about hate crimes cannot, it must not, blind our \nconviction about the need for wise legislation and respecting the \nfundamental limits of our constitutional authority.\n  While the Kennedy amendment is unwise, unnecessary, and \nunconstitutional, the good news is that we can do\n\n[[Page S12201]]\n\nsomething legitimate and meaningful about hate crimes without back-\nhanding the Constitution.\n  The amendment I have offered would strengthen enforcement of hate \ncrimes laws right where that enforcement may legitimately and most \neffectively occur, at the State and local level.\n  My amendment would charge the Comptroller General, in consultation \nwith the National Governors Association and State and local law \nenforcement, with studying whether State and local governments are \nproperly and effectively addressing hate crimes.\n  This would give us a more objective understanding of the nature and \nscope of the hate crimes problem so that we can better determine \nwhether there is any basis for a greater Federal role before we go off \non this massive sweeping legislation the distinguished senator from \nMassachusetts is urging. My legislation would help identify whether any \ngaps exist in the ability and determination of States to prosecute hate \ncrimes and provide Federal resources to help them do so.\n  The authority to prosecute hate crimes rests with the States, and if \nwe truly want both to address hate crimes and stay within our proper \nconstitutional role, we can help the States effectively carry out their \nresponsibility.\n  I said it before, and I will say it again.\n  Crimes of violence, no matter their motivation, are abhorrent.\n  I recognize that some crimes of violence are directed not only \nagainst individual victims, but against the groups or communities with \nwhich those victims identify.\n  Concern about hate crimes, however, is only the beginning of the \ndiscussion and the political ends do not justify the legislative means.\n  I know that my good friend from Massachusetts is genuinely passionate \nabout what he sees as an injustice.\n  His amendment, however, is the wrong way to address the problem.\n  The Kennedy amendment is unwise, unnecessary, and unconstitutional.\n  It is unwise in its drafting and in the way its supporters are trying \nto get it passed.\n  It is unnecessary because States have their own hate crimes laws and \nare demonstrably able to address the problem.\n  It is unconstitutional because Congress lacks authority to create \nsuch a freestanding criminal felony unrestricted by Federal \njurisdiction.\n  I urge my colleagues, instead, to do the right thing and to do it the \nright way by supporting the amendment I have brought to the floor.\n  I find no fault with people who are sincere in trying to do things \nthat sincerely are well motivated. But we should live within the \nconfines of the Constitution. There is no nexus that would justify this \ntype of overwhelming legislation, imposed upon everybody in this \ncountry, when the States are already doing the job.\n  We have two hate crimes amendments before us today. One is extremely \nbroad, probably unconstitutional, and likely unnecessary. The President \nhas threatened to veto it. The amendment would torpedo the Defense \nauthorization bill. The other is a more modest approach. My amendment \nwould assist State and local law enforcement as they do the hard work \nof providing equal justice for all their citizens. The Kennedy \namendment is sweeping, but it cannot realistically get done on this \nbill. Mine is a modest, and I believe adequate, approach to this \nproblem, and it would become law. To quote an unappreciated political \nphilosopher:\n\n       You can't always get what you want. But if you try, \n     sometimes, you'll find you get what you need.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture on the Kennedy amendment \nand for cloture on my amendment and I think we will make better headway \nthan we would if we agree to the Kennedy amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the passage of the Matthew \nShepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. We \nhave all heard the story of Matthew Shepard: the 21-year-old student at \nthe University of Wyoming who was brutally beaten--his skull smashed--\nand tied to a fence with a rope and left to die--because he was \nhomosexual. No one should be targeted because of the color of their \nskin, their religion, their gender or their sexual orientation.\n  In April of this year, I joined Senators Kennedy, Smith, and others \nin introducing hate crimes legislation. This amendment, which is \nidentical to that legislation, for the first time will expand the \ndefinition of a hate crime to include gender, gender identity, \ndisability, and sexual orientation. It gives the Justice Department \njurisdiction over crimes of violence committed because of a person's \nactual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \nsexual orientation, or disability. Existing law only covers race, \ncolor, religion, or national origin-based hate crimes, where the victim \nwas engaging in one of six `specified activities.' It will also \nstrengthen the ability of the Federal, State, and local governments to \ninvestigate and prosecute hate crimes based on race, ethnic background, \nreligion, gender, sexual orientation, and disability.\n  Some have said that this bill will take away first amendment rights. \nThat is just not true. This law would punish violent acts, not beliefs. \nThis legislation only applies to violent, bias-motivated crimes and \ndoes not infringe on any conduct protected by the first amendment. The \nfirst amendment right to organize against, preach against and speak is \nnot impinged.\n  America's diversity is one of our greatest strengths. Our tolerance \nfor each other's differences is part of the lamp that can help bring \nlight to a world which is enveloped in bigotry and intolerance.\n  America has taken many steps throughout our history on a long road to \nbecome a more inclusive Nation.\n  We are hopefully about to take another one if we adopt the Matthew \nShepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007.\n  Ms. FEINSTEIN. I rise today in support of the Kennedy-Smith amendment \nNo. 3035, the Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act of 2007.\n  This legislation is a crucial step toward prosecuting crimes directed \nat thousands of individuals who are the targets of brutal and senseless \nviolence.\n  The current Federal hate crimes law simply does not go far enough. It \ncovers only crimes motivated by bias on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, or national origin.\n  This amendment improves the current Federal hate crime law by \nincluding crimes motivated by gender, gender identity, sexual \norientation, and disability.\n  Congress must expand the ability of the Federal Government to \ninvestigate and prosecute anyone who would target victims because of \nhate. In those States with State hate crimes laws, the Federal \nGovernment must provide the resources to ensure that those crimes do \nnot go unpunished. We can and must do more.\n  In my own State of California, horrific instances of violence signify \nthe critical need for legislation today.\n  I would like to share just a few examples:\n  In Santa Ana, retired Federal agent Narciso Leggs, Jr., was found \nstrangled and tortured on June 29 in his southern California apartment. \nThe killer placed a smiling ceramic angel on the victim's shoulder \nblade and wrote antigay slurs on his flesh with a black marker.\n  Another instance, in Los Angeles, CA, this past Spring: James \nMcKinney, a mentally disabled man, was beaten to death by an \nunidentified man wielding an aluminum baseball bat as he was walking to \nthe store from his home, a mental health care facility. The attack was \ncaught on surveillance camera on Tuesday May 29, but his attacker \nremains at large.\n  In San Diego, attackers wielding baseball bats and shouting antigay \nslurs beat two men and stabbed a third in the back. The attack was the \nfirst in more than a decade at San Diego's annual gay pride festival.\n  Lastly, one of the most well-known cases in California happened in \nWest Hollywood to actor Trev Broudy in 2002.\n  The night of his attack, Trev Broudy was hugging a man on a street. \nThree men with a baseball bat savagely attacked the actor, leaving him \nin a coma for approximately 10 weeks. As a result of the attack, Trev \nsuffered brain damage, lost half of his vision, and has experienced \ntrouble hearing.\n\n[[Page S12202]]\n\n  The crimes are brutal. The attackers targeted their victims because \nof who they are. Yet none of these crimes can be prosecuted as a \nFederal hate crime.\n  These are not isolated instances. These crimes occur all over the \ncountry. According to FBI statistics, 27,432 people were victims of \nhate-motivated violence over the last 3 years. That is an average of \nover 9,100 people per year, with nearly 25 people being victimized \nevery day of the year, based on their race, religion, sexual \norientation, ethnic background, or disability.\n  Even more disturbing is the fact that these FBI statistics show only \na fraction of the problem because so many hate crimes are unreported.\n  The Southern Poverty Law Center estimates that the actual number of \nhate crimes committed in the United States each year is closer to \n50,000, and survey data from the biannual National Crime Victimization \nSurvey suggests that an average of 191,000 hate crime victimizations \ntake place per year.\n  Race-related hate crimes are the most common, but crimes based on \nreligion, ethnic background or sexual orientation are also significant. \nIn fact, a close analysis of hate crimes rates demonstrates that groups \nthat are now covered by current laws--such as African Americans, \nMuslims, and Jews--report similar rates of hate crimes victimizations \nas gays and lesbians--who are not currently protected.\n  On average, 8 in 100,000 African Americans report being the victim of \nhate crime; 12 in 100,000 Muslims report being the victim of hate \ncrime; 15 in 100,000 Jews report being the victim of hate crime; and 13 \nin 100,000 gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals report being the victim of \nhate crime.\n  Every individual's life is valuable. Congress must act to protect \nevery person who is targeted simply because of who they are.\n  Specifically, the Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act of 2007 expands on the 1968 definition of a hate crime.\n  Under current Federal law, hate crimes only cover attacks based on \nrace, color, religion, and national origin. Under this amendment, hate \ncrimes will include gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and \ndisability.\n  The bill enables States, local jurisdictions, and Indian tribes to \napply for Federal grants in order to solve hate crimes and provides \nFederal agents with broader authority to aid State and local police.\n  Additionally, the bill amends the Hate Crime Statistics Act by \ninserting ``gender'' and ``gender identity,'' allowing law enforcement \nagencies to gather data on the newly protected groups.\n  This is not a new bill. It was first introduced in 1998. It has \npassed the Senate three times: in 2000, and in 2002 and 2004 as an \namendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  It passed the House this year as a stand-alone bill and last year as \nan amendment to the Adam Walsh Act.\n  It is bipartisan. It has 44 cosponsors in the Senate and 171 \ncosponsors in the House. It is endorsed by over 210 law enforcement, \ncivic, and religious organizations and has the support of 73 percent of \nthe American population.\n  There is no excuse for not passing this bill out of the Senate today. \nThis bill is not about free speech. It is about crimes of violence--\noften brutal, savage acts of violence. These crimes target a person \nsolely because of that person's race, sexual orientation, religion, \ngender, national origin, or disability. By terrorizing one member of a \ngroup, they terrorize entire communities of people. These crimes damage \nour social fabric. We must be clear that we cannot tolerate this kind \nof intimidation.\n  Today, I ask all of my colleagues to rally against hate by working to \nensure that this legislation is not simply supported but actually \npassed and signed into law.\n  Until it is enacted, many hate crime victims and their families will \nnot receive the justice they deserve.\n  Let us send a message to all Americans that we will no longer turn a \nblind eye to hate crimes in this country.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I still remember standing on the steps of \nthe Capitol on October 14, 1998--thousands gathered on a cool autumn \nevening--to remember Matthew Shepard 2 days after he had been killed in \nLaramie, WY.\n  That night I said:\n\n       Matthew Shepard is not the exception to the rule--his \n     tragic death is the extreme example of what happens on a \n     daily basis in our schools, on our streets, and in our \n     communities. And that's why we have an obligation to pass \n     laws that make clear our determination to root out this \n     hatred. We hear a lot from Congress today about how we are a \n     country of laws, not men. Let them make good on those words, \n     and pass hate crimes legislation.\n\n  Almost 10 years have passed since that candlelight vigil--10 years \ntoo long for Washington to do what was so obviously needed. Violent \nhate crimes are on the rise--almost 10,000 violent acts of hate against \nindividuals based on their sexual orientation have been reported to the \nauthorities since Matthew Shepard's murder. What a tragic reminder of \nthe urgency of providing local law enforcement with the added resources \nand support needed to get tough on hate crimes. What a horrific wake-up \ncall to a sleepy Washington about the need to ensure a Federal backstop \nto assist local law enforcement in those cases in which they request \nassistance or fail to adequately investigate or prosecute these serious \ncrimes.\n  The good news is that today with this Senate vote we will move one \nstep closer than ever to legislating a Federal hate crimes law that \nincludes sexual orientation and gender identity--the Matthew Shepard \nAct.\n  This is the least we can do, as we committed to do that night in \n1998, to insure that ``the lesson of Matthew Shepard is not \nforgotten.'' It is the least we can do to right a wrong in an America \nwhere every morning, someone takes the long way to class, an America \nwhere every day someone looks over his shoulder on the street, and \nstill today in America innocent people fear for their safety--all \nbecause some people hate them for being who they were born to be--gay, \nlesbian, bisexual, or transgender.\n  This fight is not over, but this vote is an important milestone in \nthe fight--a day when I hope we will begin at last to turn the tide, \nand reaffirm our faith that the strength of human justice can overcome \nthe hatred in our society by confronting it.\n  I want to thank my friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy, for his \nhard work to address hate crimes and ensure that this vital legislation \nis enacted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to my \nfriend from Utah describe this legislation. He has followed one of the \ngreat traditions of the Senate. That is, he has misrepresented and \nmisstated my position and then he has differed with it. I know that \ntechnique because I have used it a few times myself.\n  I hope, for those of our colleagues who have been following this \ndebate, to keep in mind very briefly--I outlined earlier the principal \nreasons for this--but with regard to what is happening in the local \ncommunities, and in the States, the fact is the National District \nAttorneys Association is supporting this legislation. Do you believe if \nwe were doing all the things the Senator said, if we were violating \neverything local and State, the National District Attorneys Association \nwould be supporting this? The National Sheriffs' Association is \nsupporting it, as is the States Attorneys General of the United States. \nThe principal law enforcement agencies in the States are supporting it. \nDo you think they would be supporting this if it was unconstitutional? \nYou don't think they would have the opportunity to know what is \nconstitutional or not constitutional? And you don't think they \nunderstand what is necessary to protect their citizens from the \nviciousness of hate crimes?\n  There it is. I ask unanimous consent the entire list be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Letters From Organizations That Support the Local Law \n     Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007\n       1.

I will mention a few. They include the Anti-Defamation \nLeague, Human Rights Campaign, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Why? \nBecause, as we know, hate crimes are increasing. They are not \ndiminishing in the United States of America. They are increasing. All \nthe statistics demonstrate it.\n  What is also demonstrable is what local law officials point out by \ntheir support. They do not have the tools or the will to deal with the \nmost vicious types of attacks that take place upon individuals because \nof who they are. That is why they support this rather measured proposal \nthat we have, that will give help and assistance in attacking the \nproblems of hatred at home like we are attacking the problems of hatred \nabroad.\n  This is not such a strange issue.\n  Will the Chair let me know when I have a minute left, please.\n  My friend, Senator Hatch, pointed out during our debate in 2000:\n\n       Crimes of animus are more likely to promote retaliatory \n     crimes; they inflict deep, lasting and distinct injuries--\n     some of which never heal--on victims and their family \n     members; they incite community unrest and, ultimately, they \n     are downright un-American.\n\n  No one could say it better. He understands that is what we are \ntalking about and whether we are going to battle that with both hands, \nnot with one hand tied behind our back as exists at the present time. \nIt is the local law officials who are stating that. Even the Justice \nDepartment said the same a few years ago.\n  Finally, on why this is such an extraordinary situation--this is what \nthe Justice Department says.\n\n       Local authorities may not have the tools or the will to \n     prosecute a particular bias-motivated crime fully.\n\n  We put this aside. This, basically, is a moral issue. It is a moral \nissue because of the viciousness and the motivational aspects of hatred \nand bigotry. Our Founding Fathers, as brilliant as they were, wrote \nprejudice in the Constitution of the United States. They wrote slavery \nin the Constitution of the United States. This Nation has been battling \nfor 230 years to free ourselves from the stains of discrimination, and \nwe are not there yet. We suffered the brutalities of the Civil War. We \nwent through the period of Reconstruction. We have faced those issues \non the floor of the Senate: In 1964, the Civil Rights Act; the 1965 \nCivil Rights Act; the 1968 Civil Rights Act. We went on to knock down \nthe walls of discrimination.\n  When we knocked down the walls of discrimination on the basis of \nrace, we also, history will show--we knocked them down with regard to \ngender, we knocked them down with regard to ethnicity, we knocked down \na lot of them in terms of disability. We have not with regard to sexual \norientation. But we have made remarkable progress. No nation in the \nworld has made that progress--no nation.\n  That is one of the reasons I am as proud of this Nation as I am. But \nit is a continuing process. If we do not understand that out there, as \nthe various statistics of the Justice Department and the Southern \nPoverty Law Center say, there are these centers of hatred and bigotry \nthat exist out there, that are hating and demonstrating and killing our \ncitizens on the basis of those definitions.\n  That is continuing, and the question is whether we are going to do \nsomething about it. We are not going to solve all of the problems with \nlegislation, but if we do not solve this one, we miss a golden \nopportunity.\n  I finally say, to those who have talked about, we are adding this on \nthe Defense authorization bill, we have had more time in quorum calls \naround here. We have not taken a great deal of time. We are taking 2 \nhours this morning on SCHIP and hate crimes. We have not taken up a \ngreat deal of time.\n  The majority of the Members have supported this. On three other \noccasions, a majority of Republicans and Democrats have supported this \nconcept--on three other occasions. Let's get the job done. We have that \nopportunity this morning.\n  Finally, this is about the morality of our country, the values of our \ncountry. That is directly tied into what our men and women are doing \noverseas in resisting terrorism and fighting for the values here at \nhome. One of the values that is here at home is the value of honoring \nthe dignity of the human being and the individual. That is why\n\n[[Page S12204]]\n\nall of those in the great religious faiths, the Interfaith Alliance, 75 \ndifferent religions--the belief that lies at the core of our diverse \nfaith traditions is that every human being is endowed with dignity and \nworth. That is why 1,400 members of the clergy have pointed out: Our \nfaith traditions teach us to love our neighbor. While we cannot \nlegislate love, it is our moral duty to protect one another from hatred \nand violence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is from the religious community.\n  So we have on that standard above the Presiding Officer ``E pluribus \nunum''--``out of many, one.'' We have a responsibility, to the extent \nwe can, to eliminate division, to eliminate the hatred, to eliminate \nthe bigotry, and to become one Nation with one history and one destiny. \nThis amendment moves us on that road to the kind of country this Nation \ndeserves to be. I hope our colleagues will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 54 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I agree with 80 percent of what the \ndistinguished Senator has said during this debate. The fact is, the \nvery name of this bill makes the very point I am making. It is the \n``Matthew Shepard Act,'' a heinous crime committed against him where \nboth people were prosecuted and sentenced to life; in the Byrd case, \nsentenced to death. We are taking care of these problems. There has \nbeen no showing by the other side that the State prosecutors are \nincapable of doing so. The fact is, we do not need a massive Federal \npiece of legislation that would require the Federal Government to get \ninto areas that clearly are not in interstate commerce but are subject \nto State laws that are being enforced. That is a very important point. \nWe should be very loath to go beyond that point.\n  I thank my very loquacious colleague who feels very deeply, but I \nfeel deeply, too, about the issue, about these people, about what is \nhappening, and what I am saying constitutionally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would refer my colleagues to my statement \nin yesterday's Record on the hate crime legislation.\n\n\n                                  CHIP\n\n  Mr. President, just like any job in America, Senators have good days \nand bad days. We all know what it is like to leave work frustrated that \nwe did not make the right decision, that the progress we have made was \nnot what we had hoped, that we did not express our views in quite the \nright way or we just did not have enough time to get everything done. \nBut we also know, here in the Senate, how the opposite feels: days when \nwe put our political differences aside, rise above partisanship, and do \nsomething lasting and meaningful for our country.\n  Earlier this year, when the Senate passed its version of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, it was a day just like that. It \nwas a day of happiness. And today can be another day just like that. As \na result of the hard work of Chairman Baucus, Senators Rockefeller, \nGrassley, and Hatch, we have before us legislation that I am confident \nwill enjoy overwhelming bipartisan support, which we will vote on \nshortly.\n  Hopefully, the strong bipartisanship message this body sends today \nwill be loud enough and strong enough that the President will \nreconsider his stubborn opposition to this legislation. Senators \nGrassley and Hatch are very supportive of the President. No one needs \nto lecture anyone on that. But they have said the President's stand on \nchildren's health is wrong and that he should join with us. And they \nare right. For all the talk we hear about what Government does wrong, \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program is a shining example of what \nGovernment does right.\n  Before children's health became law 10 years ago, millions of \nchildren were totally uninsured. These children were part of a coverage \ngap. Their parents' incomes were not high enough to afford private \ninsurance, nor low enough to qualify for Medicaid. Now, a decade later, \nthis program has reduced the number of uninsured children in working \nfamilies by 35 percent. Today, 6.6 million children have insurance \nthanks to this exemplary program. Many of these children are now \ngetting regular checkups. They are benefiting from preventative \nmedicine. They are saving money for society, and their primary care \ncomes from a doctor, a family doctor, not from an expensive, \ninefficient emergency room. Examples of this success can be found in \nevery single State, in urban areas, rural areas, east coast, west \ncoast, south, north, everywhere in between.\n\n  When we voted on this bill originally, I gave an example. I told the \nstory of a Reno woman named Terry Rasner. Since 1998, Terry has helped \nchildren in Nevada enroll in Nevada Check Up, which is Nevada's \nchildren's health insurance program. Her work has never been more \nimportant. The latest numbers just released show that 430,000 Nevadans \nhave no insurance; they are uninsured. Nevada is a sparsely populated \nState, but these numbers are overwhelming--430,000 people have no \nhealth insurance. And 115,000 of the uninsured are kids, children.\n  Terry explained to me, in an e-mail she sent me, how the program is \noperating in Nevada. She wrote:\n\n       There are many stories of children as old as 11 and 12 who \n     were finally able to visit a dentist for the first time in \n     their lives.\n       Stories of families who finally felt whole because they \n     could access affordable medical and dental care for their \n     children.\n       School nurses who were acutely involved in supporting and \n     promoting this program from the outset because they were on \n     the front lines of failed programs, or no programs at all, to \n     address the medical and dental needs of children of low-\n     income working families.\n       One child in particular was so bad off he was unable to eat \n     or chew food due to the dramatic decay in his mouth. Imagine, \n     children for the first time in their lives actually getting \n     to see a doctor or dentist that their parents were able to \n     afford.\n\n  Stories like this, examples of the children's health program saving \nlives--these same stories are being told all across America, and \nstatistics bear this out.\n  This program is even better than ever because we have extended dental \ncare for these children. Study after study shows that our youth \nenrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program are much more \nlikely to have regular doctor and dental care. They report lower rates \nby far of unmet needs for care. The quality of care they receive is far \nbetter than it was before. That is an understatement. School \nperformance improves. The plan is helping to close the disparity in \ncare for minority children. And the Children's Health Insurance Program \nhas become a major source of care for rural children. So there is no \ndoubt, no question at all that the Children's Health Insurance Program \nis good for kids, little people who cannot help themselves, it is good \nfor families, also, and it is good for America for sure.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to take the next step toward making \nthe great American success story even more of a success. The bill \nbefore us maintains coverage for the 6.6 million children currently \nenrolled and adds an additional 4 million low-income, uninsured \nchildren. It also improves the program by curbing coverage of adults in \nthe program and targeting the lowest income eligible families as new \nenrollees. It does all of this in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  This legislation is fully paid for. It does not add one penny to our \nNation's debt or add to the deficit.\n  It is not surprising that this bill was supported by 45 Republicans \nin the House and virtually every Democrat in the House. Chairman \nGrassley, Senator Hatch, and more than a dozen other Republican \nSenators voted for this bill the first time around, and every single \nDemocrat in the Senate.\n  I might just add, as an aside, Senator Hatch has never been known as \na big spender, and he supported this bill overwhelmingly. We could not \nbe where we are but for him and Senator Grassley.\n  But not only do a significant number of Republican Senators support \nthis legislation, but Governors support it, our health care providers \nsupport it, children's advocates and the vast majority of Americans are \ncheerleaders for this worthy legislation. The Senate\n\n[[Page S12205]]\n\nwill shortly do its part and pass this children's health insurance \nlegislation.\n  But despite all of this, all of the bipartisan support, all of the \ngoodwill this bill enjoys, surprisingly, stunningly, President Bush \ncontinues to insist he will stop this bill from becoming law. This is \nthe same President Bush who, during the 2004 campaign, touted his plan \nto expand the SCHIP program.\n  Quoting from the President, in a release he made:\n\n       The President will launch an aggressive, billion-dollar \n     effort to enroll children who are eligible but not signed up \n     for the government's health insurance program. The goal will \n     be to cover millions more SCHIP and Medicaid-eligible \n     children within the next 2 years.\n\n  That is what he said in 2004. Now President Bush offers us a list of \nreasons for opposing legislation that would do what he said he strongly \nsupports.\n  One of the reasons he gives us is we cannot afford it. Let me repeat \nwhat I said before: This bill is paid for and will not increase the \ndeficit a single cent.\n  Second, let's look at the things the President thinks we can afford. \nIn about a month in Iraq, the President will spend $12 billion. This \nwould far exceed what we would spend on these children. But, remember, \nwe are spending for what is fully paid for. It comes from a tobacco \ntax.\n  So clearly it is not about having money; it is not about any of the \nreasons he has given. Despite his list of unknown reasons, it has \nbecome clear in recent days that there is only one reason I can come up \nwith for his reversal, his flip-flop on the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram: I guess it is because he wants to do something with health \ncare that he has not yet told us.\n  He has in the past calculated that holding this bill hostage is the \nonly way to raise from the dead his partisan, unpopular, and \nineffective health agenda. We realize this. Republicans realize this. \nIn fact, the ranking member of the Finance Committee realizes this, and \nhe has spoken so on the floor, Senator Grassley.\n  President Bush, on this issue, stands alone. Can one imagine our \nPresident, President Bush, going to one of these children and saying: \nYou cannot have health care. You have to stop seeing your doctor. If \nyou get sick, your parents or a brother or sister will have to take you \nto the emergency room. Get a brother or sister, get a neighbor to do \nthat, but we are not going to let you go see a doctor.\n  So despite his promises, I hope he will come to his good side and put \nthe well-being of millions of poor children ahead of his own flawed \npolitical agenda that we are seeing on this issue today. I hope he \nrealizes this program is government at its best--lending a helping \nhand, providing a safety net to children who need our help to reach \ntheir full potential.\n  If we pass today the Children's Health Insurance Program with a good \nbipartisan vote, this can be one of our good days, our legislative good \ndays, when we do something lasting and meaningful for the American \npeople who sent us here to help fulfill their dreams and their hopes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to proceed for a few moments \nwith my leader time and say to my good friend the majority leader, I \nknow it is customary for him to speak last, but I was unavoidably \ndetained from getting to the floor and wanted to make a couple of \nobservations about the Kennedy amendment on my leader time.\n  A vote for Senator Kennedy's hate crime amendment regretfully puts \nthis whole bill in jeopardy. The only way to ensure we have a Defense \nauthorization bill this year is to vote against the Kennedy amendment. \nThere are too many important Defense provisions in the bill that are at \nrisk because of a controversial, nongermane amendment dealing with \nsocial policy.\n  Among the items at risk, the Wounded Warriors provision, the pay \nraise, acquisition reform, and many other important Defense provisions, \nall are put at risk by the adoption of the Kennedy amendment.\n  We have now gone through a long exercise debating Iraq amendments and \nnongermane amendments related to the social agenda of the other side. \nBut what are we trying to accomplish here? Do we want to protect the \ndefense policy matters in this bill that actually matter to our forces \nin the field, or do we want to debate political and social issues on \nthis measure? The Senate has been on record all year that we will not \ncut off funding for our troops in the field and that we need to do more \nto help our wounded warriors returning from the war. Let us not \nsacrifice the bipartisan work of the committee for an amendment that is \nnot relevant to the underlying bill.\n  I hope the Kennedy amendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on amendment No. 3035 \n     regarding hate crimes.\n         Gordon H.

The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 5 minutes to make a quick statement, and then I will make a \nunanimous consent request, to which there will be an objection on the \nother side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, let me make it clear. I support the \nelectronic filing by Senators in the underlying bill that Senator \nFeinstein brought forward. There is an issue I want to raise on an \namendment I wish to add to the bill.\n  We have a problem going on in the Senate where there are anonymous \noutside groups who are filing ethics complaints, and they are doing it \nfor purely political reasons. As often is the case, this can be fixed \nwith transparency.\n  If someone files an ethics complaint against a Senator from the \noutside, then they would have to disclose their donors under my \namendment. Right now in the Senate, there is no such requirement for \nfiling a complaint. The complaints do not have to be sworn, signed, or \neven identified, and they can be submitted by a person or an unnamed \ngroup no one will ever know.\n  The complaints do not have to be submitted in a formal manner. They \ncan be on a beverage napkin or written in crayon. However, this is not \nthe case in the other Chamber. In the House of Representatives, they \nhave very formal, rigorous requirements to file complaints. The \ncomplaints must be sworn to and filed by a Member of Congress. With no \nrequirements in the Senate, the result is that people create shell \norganizations in order to register purely political complaints.\n  Some say my amendment will prevent people from filing complaints. \nThis is simply not true. My amendment will make the complaint process \ntransparent and similar to the FEC process. Has there ever been a \nshortage of complaints at the FEC?\n  If these complaints are being filed purely for political reasons, \nthen we will find that out because we can see who the donors are. We \nneed to protect this institution. We need to protect individual \nSenators from purely politically motivated ethics complaints that come \nagainst us.\n  If it is done purely for partisan reasons, we need to know that, and \ntransparency is, once again, the best way to find that out. All I am \nasking is for an up-or-down vote so the Senate can decide if it wants \ntransparency. It has been said that this bill is unrelated to the \nelectronic filing bill. I disagree. They are both about transparency. \nThey are both about the political process. We need to have this \namendment agreed to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader, in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 96, S. 223, under the following limitations: \nthat the committee-reported amendment be agreed to, and that the only \nother amendment in order be an Ensign amendment related to transparency \nand disclosure, with 20 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual \nform on the bill and the amendment to run concurrently, and that \nfollowing the use or yielding back of time, that the Senate proceed to \nvote in relation to the Ensign amendment, and that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the motion to concur with \nthe House amendments to the Senate amendments on SCHIP.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we are awaiting the arrival of the \nSenator from Kentucky. I do not see him yet so I will begin.\n  Nearly every American schoolchild knows the story told in Parson \nWeems' 1800 biography ``The Life of Washington.'' That is our first \nPresident. According to Weems, young George used his new hatchet to \nchop down his father's cherry tree. His father asked George what \nhappened. George was tempted to make up a story, but then in Weems' \nfamous account, young George ``bravely cried out, `I cannot tell a lie. \nI did cut it with my hatchet.'''\n  I wish all public servants kept the same standard of truthfulness, \nespecially in this debate. Regrettably, many of today's public servants \nappear all too tempted to make up a story. Many are failing to tell the \ntruth about the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Let me set the record straight.\n  President Bush has said that our bill ``would result in taking a \nprogram meant to help poor children and turning it into one that covers \nchildren in households with incomes of up to $83,000 a year.'' That is \nwhat our President said. That is not true. There is nothing in the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program bill that would change current law \nand allow States to cover children in families making $83,000 a year. \nThere is nothing in the current bill that would let that happen. \nNothing in current law; nothing.\n  On income eligibility levels, the bill maintains current law. It \ndoesn't change current law, it maintains current law on income \neligibility levels. Current law limits CHIP to the higher of 200 \npercent of poverty or 50 percent above the State's prior Medicaid \nlevels. Any State that wants to increase eligibility for CHIP above \nthose levels has to get approval from the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. That is current law, and that is the law under the CHIP bill \nbefore us today. It is unchanged.\n  In fact, our bill actually includes new policies to discourage States \nfrom increasing eligibility for kids above 300 percent of poverty. \nUnder our bill, States that increase eligibility above 300 percent--\nagain, they have to get approval from HHS to get a waiver--under our \nbill, those States that increase eligibility, if they get a waiver \ngranted by the Bush administration or not, would get the lower Medicaid \nFederal match payment for higher income children. Our bill would \ndecrease the incentive to cover higher income children relative to \ncurrent law. It decreases incentives relative to current law.\n  Our bill also includes new policies requiring any States covering \nchildren above 300 percent to meet a target enrollment level for \ncovering their lowest income children below 200 percent of poverty. \nThat is new. States that don't meet the target by 2010 risk losing all \nFederal reimbursement for their higher income children. So our bill has \nan even greater focus on low-income kids compared with current law.\n  Our bill will benefit low-income children. The Urban Institute found \nthat 70 to 80 percent of children helped by our bill are low-income \nchildren with family incomes below 200 percent of poverty. Our bill is \ntargeted to help exactly the low-income children for which we created \nthe CHIP program in the first place. Our bill continues that mission \nfor the next 5 years.\n  The administration has also said our bill would move too many \nchildren from private insurance into CHIP. Once again, that is not \ntrue. According to Congressional Budget Office Director Peter Orszag--\nhe is the top person in the independent Congressional Budget Office. \nHis job is to independently assess what we do. There is no partisanship \nat all. He said there is always some ``crowdout'' or substitution of \npublic coverage for private coverage whenever we create a new \nGovernment subsidy to help people. It always happens to some degree.\n\n[[Page S12208]]\n\n  A few years ago--this is important for everybody to remember, \nespecially the President--when we considered the Medicare prescription \ndrug bill, the so-called MMA, CBO then said about two-thirds of those \ngetting the new Government help would already have private coverage. \nTwo-thirds already had private coverage. I don't remember the \nadministration complaining about the crowdout then, complaining about \npeople who might leave private coverage to go to Medicare Part D.\n  When we enacted the CHIP program 10 years ago, the Congressional \nBudget Office projected there would be about a 40-percent crowdout \nrate, not two-thirds as the case in the Medicare Part D but about 40 \npercent. What happened? Our bill has a lower crowdout. It is about 40 \npercent lower than CBO projected would happen in the program 10 years \nago.\n  In fact, CBO Director Orszag said this year's Senate bill, which is \nvery similar to the final bill we are considering, was ``pretty much as \nefficient as you can possibly get for new dollar spent to get a \nreduction of roughly 4 million uninsured children.''\n  We went to CBO and said we want to reduce the so-called crowdout as \nmuch as we can; how do we do it. We talked back and forth. And his \nassessment is the final bill is ``pretty much as efficient as you can \npossibly get,'' lower than any other major crowdout results.\n  The President also said he has a better plan to help uninsured \nchildren. If he does, he is keeping it under wraps.\n  The President talked about both his plan to reauthorize CHIP and his \nplan to promote private coverage through tax credits. But independent \nanalyses of both plans suggest that under them, American children would \nfare far worse.\n  For the Children's Health Insurance Program, the President is \nproposing a $5 billion increase in Federal funds over the next 5 years. \nThat is his proposal. The President says that will be enough. The \nCongressional Budget Office disagrees. The analysis of the \nCongressional Budget Office, again, an independent analysis of the \nPresident's plans, indicates it would not even maintain coverage for \nchildren currently enrolled in CHIP today. it would not even maintain \nit. In fact, CBO projects that under the President's plan, 1.4 million \nchildren would actually lose coverage.\n  The President's tax credit plan does not do much better. The \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated only about 500,000 children \nwill gain new coverage under that plan. If we take CBO's estimates for \nthese plans together, over 5 years, there would still be a net loss \ncoverage for a million children--a net loss coverage for a million \nchildren compared with current law.\n  Causing a million children to lose health insurance is not a better \nplan to help uninsured children--not in my book, and I don't think it \nis in anybody else's book either.\n  I am not the only one who thinks what the administration is saying is \nessentially not true--in fact, not at all true. Go to the Annenberg \nPolitical Fact Check, a nonprofit media accuracy organization funded by \nthe Annenberg Political Fund. Go to their Web site: www.factcheck.org.\n  At the end of the day, our current President named George has a \nsimple choice. He can bring health coverage to 3.8 million low-income \nuninsured children who have no insurance today or he can cut it with \nhis hatchet, cutting coverage for at least a million children who would \notherwise get the doctor visits and medicines they need through CHIP.\n  The right choice is to stand bravely with America's children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in making the right choice. Support \nthe CHIP program. Call on the President to sign this important \nlegislation.\n  Support the CHIP bill because the truth is our bill focuses benefits \non low-income children. It is that simple. That is what the bill is, no \nmore. The truth is, in terms of preserving private coverage, our bill \nis ``pretty much as efficient as you can possibly get.'' And the truth \nis, the administration does not have a credible alternative.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in making the right choice because in \nthe end, this bill is about helping those who can least afford health \ninsurance now. This bill is about helping Americas parents who truly \nwant the best for their children. And as much as some may be tempted to \nmake up a story to say it is about something else, the truth is, this \nbill is about kids.\n  I yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I asked for 20 minutes. I thought the leader was going \nto come down and propose a unanimous consent request to lock in time. \nHe agreed to provide me 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There is no time limit. We have 6 hours allocated \ngenerally to this bill. The Senator can seek recognition.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask to be recognized for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe SCHIP compromise bill. I believe this agreement represents a good \nbalance and continues the historic bipartisan support for this program.\n  On Tuesday, the House passed this bill with wide bipartisan support, \nand I expect the Senate to do the same. I also rise today, Madam \nPresident, to ask and to strongly recommend that the administration \nrethink the threat to veto this important legislation. Simply put, this \nbill should not be vetoed.\n  Here in Washington, we often talk about the programs that directly \naffect our constituents back home. The State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or SCHIP is the acronym, is truly one of those \nprograms. SCHIP has long enjoyed bipartisan support, and I am glad we \nhave come to a strong bipartisan agreement on a program that is \ncritical for our low-income children.\n  In Kansas, our SCHIP is called HealthWave, and it supports over \n35,000 Kansas children. It is a critical tool for our hard-working \nfamilies who would otherwise struggle to provide health care for their \nchildren. Renewing this program has been a top priority of mine for the \n110th Congress. While our Kansas HealthWave Program has made great \nstrides in providing health care to low-income children, unfortunately \nwe still have 50,000 uninsured children in Kansas--50,000. There are \n35,000 now covered by the program but 50,000 who are not covered.\n  Many of these children are currently eligible for SCHIP but are not \nenrolled because of the lack of resources in the program. We can \nclearly do better. The bill before us would provide the necessary \nresources to Kansas and other States in order to reach these low-income \nchildren and finally provide them with the health care coverage they \nneed.\n  Unfortunately, instead of talking about achieving rare bipartisan \nprogress for these hard-working families and their children, this bill \nand this debate has turned into a political showdown. And, \nunfortunately, low-income children will be the ones to ultimately pay \nthe price.\n  I am very disappointed that before the administration even received \nthe final language their minds were apparently made up, and a line was \ndrawn in the sand opposing this compromise. Again, this was even before \nthe final language was in their hands. And, to my knowledge, there has \nbeen little, if any, willingness to come to the negotiating table to \nfind the solution. I think this is unfortunate, and I think this is \nirresponsible.\n  The administration is now threatening to veto this bill because of \n``excessive spending'' and their belief this bill is a step toward \nfederalization of health care. Now, I agree with those concerns. I \nagree with those concerns. I am not for excessive spending, and I \nstrongly oppose the federalization of health care. And if the \nadministration's concerns with this bill were accurate, I would support \na veto. But, bluntly put, they are not.\n  I do not believe the bill we are debating represents irresponsible \nspending. Instead, this bill provides necessary funding to States to \ncover children who should already be covered under the program. And I \nknow there are some who believe this bill is too expensive, but there \nare also others who believe this bill doesn't go far enough. Many of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle wanted a $50 billion to $75 \nbillion expansion of SCHIP. Many in my caucus would have preferred a $5 \nbillion increase. As a result, we had to try to find middle ground, and \nwe did just that. What we are debating today is something that is often \nhard to come\n\n[[Page S12209]]\n\nby these days in Washington. It is called a bipartisan, bicameral \ncompromise.\n  Now, the agreement provides $35 billion in new funding for SCHIP and \ntargets the program back to its original focus--low-income children. \nLet me repeat that. This bill targets the program back to its original \nfocus--low-income children. We should all understand that despite the \npartisan bickering and the rhetoric that has poisoned the Halls of both \nthe House and Senate, bipartisanship and compromise are absolutely \nnecessary to achieve--to achieve--good policy. And I know President \nBush understands this. In fact, the administration has been successful \nin working with my friends on the other side of the aisle on many \nissues during these two terms to achieve good legislation. One good \nexample is the historic tax relief we were able to achieve. Obviously, \nthat final compromise required give and take from both sides of the \naisle, and this tax relief is now putting money back into the \npocketbooks of our constituents back home.\n  I was a conferee on the No Child Left Behind legislation and know how \nclosely the administration and Senator Kennedy and Congressman Miller \nand others had to work to find any common ground. That bill was \ncertainly a great testament to bipartisanship, and we are trying to fix \nsome of the problems in that bill on a bipartisan basis.\n  The SCHIP bill is yet another example of hard work to come together \nand find common ground. Of course, I am not pleased with everything in \nthe bill, and I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle feel the \nsame. However, this bill represents a good bipartisan compromise, with \nthe ultimate goal of providing health care coverage to low-income \nchildren. The alternative that is proposed by the administration is \nthreatening a veto and insisting upon a larger health care reform \ndebate.\n  I appreciate the administration's passion and persistence on having a \nbroader health care debate. However, holding a children's health \ninsurance bill hostage is not the right way to achieve this goal. I \nsupport the goals of reforming the Tax Code to promote the purchase of \nprivate health insurance. Let me repeat that, Madam President. I \nsupport the goals of reforming the Tax Code to promote the purchase of \nprivate health insurance. But I have yet to see a plan from the \nadministration that can actually pass the Congress.\n  In fact, I have yet to see an actual plan from the administration. I \nhave yet to see bullet points from the administration. I have yet to \nsee any plan that can be articulated in some fashion to sell to the \nAmerican public or to the Members of this body. We don't even have an \nacronym for this plan. My word, you can't do anything around here \nwithout an acronym.\n  The administration has also raised concerns that this bill is a march \ntoward the federalization of health care. I would argue that is simply \nnot true. I would never support a bill to federalize health care. I \nremember that battle a decade ago. There is no way I want to go down \nthat road again.\n\n  I think it is important to point out what I think is a paradox of \nenormous irony in regard to the claim that this bill is a step toward \nthe federalization of health care. In reality, this administration has \napproved waivers--approved waivers--to cover adults under a children's \nhealth care insurance program. Let me repeat that. Under this \nadministration's watch, we now have 14 States covering adults under the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  Now, this administration and others expressed grave concern that \nSCHIP is the next step to universal health care. Yet this very same \nadministration is approving waivers to cover adults under a children's \nhealth program. And, unfortunately, a number of these States are \ncovering more adults through their SCHIP program than they do children, \neven while high rates of uninsured children still remain. This is not \nfair. This is not right. It is wrong.\n  I don't mean to pick on other States, but let's take a look at a few \nexamples. New Jersey now covers individuals up to 350 percent of the \nFederal poverty level and spends over 40 percent of its SCHIP funds on \nadults. This is even while over 100,000 low-income children in the \nState remain uninsured. This isn't right.\n  Earlier this year, Congress had to pass a stopgap funding measure to \nplug 14 State SCHIP shortfalls. Of the 14 States that got this \nemergency funding, five--five--cover adults. One of these States was \nIllinois, which spends over 50 percent of its SCHIP funds on adults. \nWisconsin covers more adults than children under SCHIP--75 percent to \nbe exact. And the administration just approved an extension of their \nwaiver to cover adults. Minnesota covers more adults on their SCHIP \nprogram than they do children. The same is true for Michigan, and the \nsame is true for Arizona.\n  Now, I am not trying to pick on these States. I can go on and on \nbecause, again, there are currently 14 that cover adults on a program \nthat was meant for children. And how are these States able to cover \nadults under the Children's Health Insurance Program? Again, through \nwaivers approved by this administration. This is certainly not fair to \nStates such as Kansas that have been playing by the rules and targeting \nour programs to low-income children. I am beginning to wonder if we \nhave the wrong name for the State Children's Health Insurance Program. \nI don't think it was intended to be the adult health care insurance \nprogram.\n  The greatest paradox of enormous irony, however, is that this bill \nactually stops the waivers this administration has been so generously \ngranting to States to cover adults by not allowing more adult waivers \nto be approved. Let me say that again. The greatest paradox of enormous \nirony is that this bill actually stops the waivers this administration \nhas been so generously granting the States to cover adults by not \nallowing more adult waivers to be approved. This means future \nadministrations that may want to use SCHIP as a means to expand \ngovernment health care to adults will be prevented by law from doing \nso. As a result, this bill ensures that the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram remains just that--a program for low-income children.\n  This bill also phases out childless adults currently being covered \nwith SCHIP funds and lowers the Federal matching rate for States that \ncurrently have waivers to cover parents and now must meet certain \nbenchmarks in covering low-income children. As a result, this bill \nbrings excessive spending on adult populations in check.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that spending on adults \nwould be over $1 billion higher under current law over the next 5 years \nthan it would be under this compromise. This bill is more fiscally \nresponsible than the administration's approach or an extension of this \nprogram by $1 billion.\n  Most importantly, this bill ensures that we are putting kids first \nand returns the program to its original purpose--providing health care \ncoverage to low-income children.\n  Now, on the income eligibility front, the administration \nunfortunately is claiming this bill does things that the bill simply \ndoes not do. It is sort of an ``SCHIP In Wonderland.'' For example, the \nPresident claimed in a speech last week that this bill expands SCHIP \ncoverage to families making over $80,000 a year.\n  I just have to ask the speech writer for the President, are you \nreading the same bill I am reading? Are you reading the same bill that \nwe are discussing on the floor of the Senate? You can twist the facts, \nbut facts are stubborn things, Madam President.\n  In fact, this bill reduces the matching payment incentives that \nStates have had for so long to cover individuals at higher income \nlevels. In addition, by the year 2010, this bill--this bill--denies \nFederal matching payments to States that cover children above 300 \npercent of the poverty level if the State cannot meet a certain target \nin covering low-income children in either public or private insurance \nplans. And let me emphasize private insurance plans.\n  I think it is important to remind the administration that a State can \nonly cover children above 200 percent of the poverty level if the \nadministration approves the State's application or waiver. I repeat: A \nState can only cover children above 200 percent of the poverty level if \nthe administration or any administration approves that State's \napplication or waiver. This is current law and this bill does not \nchange that.\n\n[[Page S12210]]\n\n  More importantly, this bill actually provides incentives and bonus \npayments for States to cover children under 200 percent of the poverty \nlevel in order to truly put the focus of this program back on low-\nincome children.\n  The bill also addresses the importance of including the private \nmarket in the SCHIP program. Let me repeat that for all those who want \na private approach in regard to private markets, in regard to \ninsurance: The bill addresses the importance of including the private \nmarket in the SCHIP program. In fact, the American Health Insurance \nPlans, also known as AHIP--that is their acronym--on Monday announced \ntheir support for this compromise bill. AHIP is the national trade \norganization which represents over 1,300 private health insurance \ncompanies.\n  The compromise makes it easier for States to provide premium \nassistance for children to get health care coverage through the private \nmarket--that is the goal of the administration and that should be our \ngoal as well--rather than relying on SCHIP. That is in this bill. This \nis an important choice for families who would prefer a private choice \nin health care.\n  This bill also requires the GAO and the Institute of Medicine to \nproduce analyses in the most accurate and reliable way to measure the \nrate of public and private insurance coverage and on best practices for \nStates in addressing the issue of something called ``crowdout.'' That \nmeans children switching from private health insurance to SCHIP. So we \nhave a study to determine exactly how we fix that.\n  In the ultimate paradox of enormous irony, it seems the \nadministration is threatening to veto a bill which does exactly what \nthey want us to do in focusing SCHIP on low-income children and making \nsure the program does not become the vehicle for universal health care.\n  This bill gets adults off the program. It targets it to low-income \nchildren. It ensures appropriate steps are taken to discourage crowdout \nand it encourages private market participation.\n  I am proud to support this important bill, and I hope those who have \nconcerns can instead focus on the positive benefits this bill will \nbring our low-income children and their hard-working families. I \nespecially thank our chairman, Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member \nGrassley, Senator Hatch, all of our House colleagues for their tireless \nwork on getting this bill together.\n  At the start of these negotiations I made a commitment to work with \nmy colleagues to find a bipartisan solution to renew this important \nprogram. I am holding to that commitment today and am pleased to \nsupport this bill.\n  I also state to the administration I will lend my support to override \nthe President's veto if he chooses to wield his veto pen. However, I \nhope--I hope--I hope the President heeds our advice and makes the right \ndecision for our children by signing this bill into law.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that following the cloture vote \non the motion to concur in the House amendments to the Senate \namendments to H.R. 976, there be 6 hours 10 minutes for debate with \nrespect to that motion and that the time so far consumed, frankly, be \ntaken out of that total time; the time divided and controlled as \nfollows: 2 hours under the control of Senator Baucus or his designee, \nand 4 hours 10 minutes under the control of Senator Grassley or his \ndesignee; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the matter be \ntemporarily set aside and the Senate then proceed to the consideration \nof H.J. Res. 43, the debt limit increase; that be 90 minutes of debate \nequally divided and controlled between the leaders or their designees, \nwith no amendment in order; and upon the use or yielding back of time, \nthe joint resolution be read a third time and set aside; and that the \nSenate then resume the message on H.R. 976; that the motion to concur \nwith amendments be withdrawn, and without further intervening action or \ndebate, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to concur; that upon \ndisposition of H.R. 976, the Senate resume H.J. Res. 43 and vote on \npassage of the joint resolution, without intervening action; and that \nupon the conclusion of that vote, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, and the Senate then proceed to \nH.J.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I am not going to \nobject, I wish further to lock in the time to each Senator on my side \nwithin the Republican time designated in the consent agreement the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee has just propounded, as \nfollows: Senator DeMint, 10 minutes; Senator Bunning, 15 minutes; \nSenator Lott, 10 minutes; Senator Grassley, 45 minutes--it is my \nunderstanding the Roberts time under the consent agreement would \nalready be counted. I will leave that out--Senator Hatch, 30 minutes; \nSenator Vitter, 10 minutes; Senator Coburn, 15 minutes; Senator Corker, \n10 minutes; Senator Smith, 10 minutes; Senator Snowe, 15 minutes; \nSenator Murkowski, 15 minutes; Senator Burr, 10 minutes; Senator Thune, \n10; and Senator Cornyn, 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, I assume \nthat is all within the time allocated.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I confidently assure my friend that is my desire and I \nthink I expressed that to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am going to proceed in my leader \ntime to speak on the SCHIP bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, 10 years ago a Republican Congress \ncreated a program that had a worthy and straightforward goal: health \ninsurance for kids whose parents made too little to afford private \ncoverage but too much to qualify for Government help. Millions of \nchildren were caught between rich and poor, we wanted to help, and \nthanks to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, we did.\n  The program has been a success. Since SCHIP's creation, the uninsured \nrate for children in families earning between about $20,000 and $40,000 \na year has dropped by 25 percent. Last year it covered more than 6 \\1/\n2\\ million kids. Today the number of uninsured children within the \nincome group we originally targeted is down to about one million \nnationwide.\n  Republicans were ready to finish the good work we started with SCHIP, \nand we approached its reauthorization this year as an opportunity to do \njust that, to reach out to the kids in our original target area who \nshould be covered by SCHIP but weren't.\n  Meanwhile, our friends on the other side had another idea: following \nthe lead of a number of State Governors, they decided to expand SCHIP \nbeyond its original mandate and bring us down the path of Government-\nrun healthcare for everyone.\n  These Governors started with adults and children from middle and \nupper middle-income families. Taking SCHIP funds that were originally \nmeant for children from poor families, they spent it on these other \npopulations instead. Then they turned around and said they didn't have \nenough money to cover the poor children in their States. Which is \nabsurd. This is a capped entitlement. The dollar amount is fixed. If \nyou are spending it on adults, you have already decided not to spend it \non the children who need it most. And that is wrong.\n  New Jersey, under the leadership of one of our former Senate \ncolleagues, helped lead the way. Rejecting a rule that limits SCHIP \nfunds to the poor children, New Jersey now uses SCHIP for adults, and \nfor children in families that earn as much as $72,275 a year.\n  For millions of hard-working Americans who have to pay for their \ninsurance, it doesn't seem right that they should have to subsidize the \nfamilies in New Jersey who can and should be paying for their own. And \na lot of poor\n\n[[Page S12211]]\n\nfamilies in New Jersey are also right to wonder why Trenton is suddenly \nenrolling middle-class families for SCHIP when their kids still lack \ncoverage--about 120,000 of them by one count.\n  This is the kind of SCHIP expansion that Democrats want in all 50 \nStates. They want to continue to expand it, pulling more and more \nmiddle-income children and adults off the private market and onto \npublic coverage, driving private insurance costs up, driving the \noverall quality of health care down.\n  Not every State is abusing the rules. Kentucky runs its version of \nSCHIP, KCHIP, in a financially responsible way. We even have money left \nover from years past. But under the Democrats' reauthorization plan, \nWashington would take those extra funds and send them to States like \nNew York and New Jersey that spend more than they get. As a result, \neven the expanded SCHIP program would leave Kentuckians with less SCHIP \nfunding in the coming fiscal year.\n  Kentuckians don't want the money they have targeted for poor children \ngoing to adults and middle-class families in other states that can \nafford insurance on its own. KCHIP's money goes where it should be \ngoing: to low-income kids who need it most.\n  Right now, KCHIP serves about 50,000 kids in Kentucky, but there are \na lot more who could be covered and aren't. We need to focus on them \nbefore expanding SCHIP program to new populations. And the Republican \nproposal I cosponsored with the other Republican leaders would do just \nthat.\n  Until this year, SCHIP had been a bipartisan program and a bipartisan \nsuccess. But in yet another sign that no good deed goes unpoliticized \nby Democrats in the 110th Congress, our Democratic friends accuse \nRepublicans who want to reauthorize SCHIP of shortchanging it, of \nshortchanging children. Which is also absurd. We want to improve the \nprogram we have got, not expand it into areas it was never meant to go.\n  Of course some of the news organizations are running with the story. \nThey seem to have forgotten that basic rule of politics that anytime \nsomebody accuses you of opposing children they've either run out of \narguments or they are trying to distract you from what they are really \nup to. And what our friends on the others side are up to is clear: they \nhave taken SCHIP hostage, and what they want in exchange is Republican \nsupport for Government-run healthcare courtesy of Washington.\n  They tried that about 15 years ago, the American people loudly \nrejected it when they realized it would nationalize about a seventh of \nthe economy, and they don't like Government health care any better now.\n  The first priority for Senate Republicans is reauthorizing SCHIP for \nthe kids who need it. And we have demonstrated that commitment. Early \nlast month, the Republican leadership proposed the Kids First Act, \nwhich allocates new funds for outreach and enrollment so SCHIP can \nreach 1.3 million more children than it already does. Our bill also \npays for this outreach, without gimmicks and without raising taxes.\n  When Democrats rejected Kids First, Republicans introduced a bill to \nextend the current program to cover kids at risk of losing coverage \nuntil the debate over its future is resolved. While our friends on the \nother side were issuing press releases and playing politics, \nRepublicans were looking for ways to make sure SCHIP funds didn't run \nout.\n  When this bill is vetoed, no one should feign surprise. They have \nknown since July the President would veto any proposal that shifted \nSCHIP's original purpose of targeting health care dollars to low-income \nchildren who need them most.\n  Our Democratic colleagues have no excuse for bringing us to this \npoint. But then again, this is the game they have played all year: \nneglect the real business of Government in favor of the political shot. \nDozens of votes on Iraq that everyone knows won't lead to a change in \npolicy. Three hundred investigations into the executive branch. And \nwhat is the result? We have less than 100 hours left in the current \nfiscal year, and Democrats haven't sent a single appropriations bill to \nthe President's desk. This ought to put the 110th Congress into the Do-\nNothing Hall of Fame.\n  Less than 100 hours before a health insurance program for poor \nchildren expires, and Democrats are counting down the hours so they can \ntee up the election ads saying Republicans don't like kids. Meanwhile, \nthey are using SCHIP as a Trojan horse to sneak Government-run health \ncare into the States.\n  This isn't just a Republican hunch. According to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, families that have private insurance are \nswitching over to SCHIP in States that allow it. The junior Senator \nfrom New York has proposed a plan that would raise the eligibility rate \nto families of four that earn $82,600 a year--this, despite the fact \nthat roughly nine out of ten children in these families have private \nhealth insurance already.\n  But of course that is not the point. The point is pursuit of a \nnationalized Government-run health care controlled by a Washington \nbureaucracy. Some Democrats have admitted what this is all about. The \nchairman of the Finance Committee recently put it this way: ``We're the \nonly country in the industrialized world that does not have universal \ncoverage,'' he said. ``I think the Children's Health Insurance Program \nis another step to move toward universal coverage.''\n  While Democrats are busy looking for ways to shift this program away \nfrom its original target, the deadline for reauthorization looms. \nRepublicans have made this reauthorization a top priority. If Democrats \nwant to expand Government-run health care, they should do it in the \nlight of day, without seeking cover under a bill that was meant for \npoor children, and without the politics. Republicans can take the \nshots. But the poor kids who we were originally trying to help \nshouldn't be caught in the middle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I have a couple of points. I don't want \nto prolong the debate. My good friend from Kentucky made a couple \npoints I wish to clarify.\n  I did say I think our country should move toward universal health \ncoverage. I think we should. In fact, our President, President Bush, \nhas said the same thing. He said we should have universal coverage of \nhealth care in America. I think most Americans think we should have \nuniversal coverage. What does that mean? That means everyone should \nhave health insurance. I did not say and do not mean we should have a \nsingle-payer system like Canada. I think we should have universal \ncoverage with an appropriate mix of public and private coverage so that \nevery American has coverage.\n  So I think for the Senator from Kentucky to make a charge that we are \nfor universal coverage, I am, as is our President. Most Americans want \nuniversal coverage. My point is, what form and what way?\n  I think it is important to remember one thing. What does this CHIP \nbill do compared to current law? The charge is that it expands \neligibility, it goes to upper income kids, and so on and so forth, it \nis another step in Government health care. That is the charge.\n  That is not the fact. This bill is more restrictive than current \nlaw--more restrictive than current law. Essentially, eligibility is, \nunder current law, determined by States and the Federal Government. \nStates determine eligibility--that is current law--and the \nadministration either does or does not grant a waiver. This Republican \nadministration has granted several waivers. In fact, one was to the \nRepublican Governor of New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman, when a major \nwaiver was granted. So this bill does not change current law. \nBasically, it provides and uses the purse to discourage States from \ngoing to higher coverage by lowering the match rate. Nothing in this \nbill expands eligibility--nothing. So the charge that this is \nincreasing eligibility to people other than children is just not \naccurate.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I see the Senator from West Virginia is seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee. I am \nvery happy that the chairman of the Finance Committee made the comments \nhe just did because I was absolutely bowled over by the comments\n\n[[Page S12212]]\n\nwhich preceded him from the other side of the aisle. It is sort of \nbasic when you say the word ``universal.'' It means everybody, but it \ndoes not necessarily mean it has to be run by the Federal Government, \nand anybody who makes that kind of an error is either really playing \npolitics or really needs to go to grad school.\n  In any event, this program is totally optional. And there is nothing \nabout it which--in fact, several of the previous speakers said that \nStates could do this and States could do that, but on the other hand it \nwas all Government run, so therefore how could the States do it on \ntheir own? It is sort of a sad argument.\n  Several months ago, four Senators--two Republicans and two \nDemocrats--stood in a room, shook hands, and made a promise to each \nother. It was a wonderful moment. It was a wonderful moment. We vowed \nnot only to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for \nmillions of kids who rely on it for basic medical care but also to \nreach out to millions more children. Today, these many months later, we \nare one step closer to making the promise into a reality for nearly 10 \nmillion children. I am very proud to be working with those Senators, \ngrandfathers and fathers themselves, Senators Baucus, Grassley, Hatch, \nand others, and what they have accomplished in the Senate on the CHIP \nbill.\n  The legislation before us today is the result of months of some of \nthe most bipartisan working by both the Senators and the staff of the \nSenators that I have ever seen. It went on for months, night and day. \nEvery day, the four Senators involved in this met for 2 hours so that \nwe could work out differences and make sure it was bipartisan, and I am \nso happy to say that it is.\n  Many Members of the House and Senate had hoped for something \ndifferent in this bill. Obviously, some wanted more, some wanted less. \nSome wanted to simply reauthorize the status quo, some wanted to even \ndecrease the children's health insurance funding, and others wanted to \nadd benefits. That is not necessarily evil. Because you did something \n10 years ago does not mean it has to stand written in stone forever, \nsuch as eye exams. Some wanted to restore coverage to the children of \nlegal immigrants. Some wanted to increase funding to $50 billion.\n  Individually, we all believed what we proposed was the right thing to \ndo, but ultimately we did not do those things because we compromised \nbecause we were determined to be bipartisan and we wanted this bill to \npass for the sake of 10 million children. So the promise of the \nhandshake brought us back to the table each and every time and to the \ncommon ground we walk today.\n  Each of us knows the statistics in our own State. I am proud that \nnearly 40,000 West Virginians were enrolled in our Children's Health \nInsurance Program last year. These kids can see a doctor when they get \nsick, they can receive necessary immunizations, and they can get \npreventive screenings. In fact, at the very beginning, it was very hard \nto get preventive screenings. Now they can. They will be able to, so \nthey can get a healthy start in life because of this important program. \nThe passage of this bill means thousands more of West Virginia's \nchildren will have affordable and stable health insurance, including \naccess to basic care.\n\n  A personal comment. This is all incredibly important to me. Four \ndecades ago, or more, I came to West Virginia as a VISTA volunteer. I \ndid not plan to stay; went to a community where nobody had any health \ninsurance, any job, any water, any sewer, any schoolbus. That was an \nexperience which turned me around, gave meaning to my life. It was a \nsmall mining community in southern West Virginia where I learned just \nexactly how important health care can be in the lives of people who \nwork hard every day to raise a family and to do right by their children \nand how painful it is when they don't have it. That experience has had \na profound influence on me, has influenced me every day of my public \nservice career since.\n  Providing children, especially those who are in the grips of poverty, \nwith health care is moral. It is a moral obligation. It speaks to our \ndeepest humanity and to the better angels of our Nation's character. It \nwas a promise that got started, in fact, with the recommendations of \nthe National Commission on Children, which I was proud to chair and \nhave since worked to implement its recommendations, many of which, \nincluding the earned-income tax credit and others, are in effect.\n  It was, as some remember, a very different time in 1997 when this \nCHIP program was begun. A decade ago when the debates on CHIP took \nplace, there was a genuine frustration that we could not solve broader \nproblems plaguing America's health care system. We were, in fact, the \nwisdom was, at the breaking point. That is when a bipartisan group of \nequally committed Senators at that time were in the finance executive \nroom with no staff and worked long into the morning to develop a CHIP \nprogram. It was one of the most glorious moments I can remember. People \nwho had never spoken about children suddenly rose, because we were all \nby ourselves around a table, and spoke about the importance of doing \nhealth insurance for children. It was moving. Some people actually \nstood as they spoke. We were all around a table and there was no need \nto stand, but their feelings were so deep and they poured forth because \nthere we were, by ourselves, with our consciences, with the future of \nchildren in our hands. We knew we could not solve the entire problem, \nbut we committed to trying to do our best by putting children first. \nThe time has come for Congress once again to put our children first, \nand the bill before us today does exactly that.\n  So having said what it exactly does, I want to say what it exactly \ndoes not do, this bill.\n  To start with, we keep our promise that all those currently enrolled \nwill keep their health insurance by investing $35 billion over the next \n5 years.\n  We give States the resources to reach out and enroll millions more \nkids, which, in fact, sounds very easy, but in rural areas--and I \nthink, of course, of Appalachia--it is a very hard thing to do where, \nin fact, many parents of children, and therefore the children \nthemselves, are scared of health care, scared of doctors, scared of \nclinics, scared of hospitals, and want to stay as far away from health \ncare as possible. So it is a very difficult thing to get them to join, \nbut we are determined to do that.\n  We have included, yes, expanded access to dentists and mental health \ncounselors. All of the history of health care shows those things are \nincredibly important for children. In fact, even as baby teeth come in, \nthey determine what mature teeth will be, and if you do not tend to \nthem early, the children are in for terrible problems. I have seen so \nmuch of that.\n  We have made it easier for States to identify those children who are \neligible but not enrolled in CHIP by reviewing food stamp records, \nschool lunch programs, WIC programs, and all kinds of things that \nStates will decide to do, every State being different, parts of States \nbeing different. So there are people--the Governors and those running \nthese programs as they do, not the Federal Government, but the \nGovernors of the States will decide how to do this.\n  We have maintained the unique public-private partnership that has \nbeen the hallmark of the CHIP program which has been universally \nrecognized as the most cost-effective and efficient way of reaching all \nthose children who desperately need access to something sacred called \nbasic medical care.\n  Most importantly, we have preserved the State flexibility, so the \nprogram fits the needs in every State--different in one State as \nopposed to another.\n  Now, let me be equally clear about what the bill does not do. It does \nnot raise eligibility limits to families making $83,000 dollars a year. \nIt simply does not do that. I challenge anybody to come on the floor \nand say otherwise. Our bill does not encourage people to give up \nprivate insurance to enroll in CHIP. It does not do that. It does not \nunfairly raise taxes on the poor and middle class to pay for CHIP. In \nfact, throughout, both looking backward and looking forward to the \npassage of this bill and hopefully the signing of this bill, 91 percent \nof all the children who are covered by the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram will be at 200 percent of poverty or below. That is not wealth. \nThey go out in the private market, and in some places it can be $12,000 \ndollars, and in others, $9,000. Families cannot afford that. This bill \nis incredibly important to them.\n\n[[Page S12213]]\n\n  This bill does not cover illegal immigrants. It does not expand \ncoverage to adults. In fact, it cuts adults off the program over the \nnext several years. It does not turn CHIP into some massive Government-\nrun health care program. The President knows this. He should know this. \nHe is a former Governor. And he has spoken about this favorably. So he \nshould understand this.\n  So what is the President's plan for children's health care? For \nstarters, provide a bare minimum of Federal funding to keep CHIP on \nlife support and at the same time throw 1.6 million kids currently in \nthe program out of the program. And what is his answer to those kids \nand the 721,000 who joined the ranks of the uninsured last year? Go to \nthe emergency room. That is the worst increase of health care known in \nthis country. So sit for hours to see a doctor, only to be prescribed \nmedicine that your parents cannot afford. It is not American. That is \nnot American.\n  Adding to the Nation's growing health care crisis is not a solution. \nIf anything, it would lead to the one thing the President is accusing \nus of: shifting the burden of paying for health care to taxpayers. We \ndo not do that.\n  Threatening to veto our bill is a mistake. The majority of Americans \nbelieve we need to live up to our obligations to provide children with \nhealth care.\n  How many people wandering around the streets of Washington or any \nother place in this country would ask: Don't you agree with me that \nchildren shouldn't have health care, children who can't afford it, that \nonly the rich should have it? You wouldn't get any takers on that. \nPeople care about children. They know they are the future. They want \nthem to have health care. So it is a moral obligation for our children, \nand the President is squarely on the wrong side of the issue.\n  All of us here, I know, will do the right thing by our Nation's \nchildren. I sincerely hope the President will look deep into his heart \nand do the same.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Chairman \nBaucus and Ranking Member Grassley as well as to the chairman and \nranking member of the Health Subcommittee, Senators Rockefeller and \nHatch, for their vital and resolute spirit of bipartisan cooperation \nand tireless perseverance in crafting an agreement with House \nnegotiators that will maintain health insurance coverage for 6 million \nchildren and reach nearly four million more. Their work demonstrates \nwhat we can accomplish when we set aside philosophical differences in \norder to do the right thing for children and their families. I am \npleased that we reached a veto-proof majority with the previous cloture \nvote, which shows strong support for extending and building upon this \nlandmark legislation.\n  As we all know, the problem of the uninsured touches communities all \nacross our country. Thankfully, we have made tremendous strides in \ndramatically lowering the number of uninsured children through SCHIP \nwhich, time and again, has proved to be both a successful program and a \nsaving grace for millions of American families who otherwise simply \ncould not afford to pay for their children's health care. The stakes \ncould not be more monumental. The quality of the health care that one \nreceives as a child can have dramatic implications later in life. And \nthere is not a family in America who does not want to provide the most \ncomprehensive health coverage possible for its children.\n  While some may mistakenly characterize SCHIP coverage as a welfare \nbenefit, what they may not realize is that nearly 90 percent of \nuninsured children come from families where at least one parent is \nworking. Today, fewer than half of parents in families earning less \nthan $40,000 a year are offered health insurance through their \nemployer--a 9 percent drop since 1997. And for many working families \nstruggling to obtain health care, if benefits are even accessible to \nthem, the costs continue to rise, moving further out of their reach. In \nmy own State of Maine, a family of four can expect to pay $24,000 on \nthe individual market for its coverage. For most families, taking this \npath is unrealistic and unworkable, especially when factoring the cost \nof mortgages, heating bills, and myriad other financial pressures.\n  That is why I am pleased that the compromise provides a significant \nincrease in federal commitment into the SCHIP program. With lives \nliterally hanging in the balance, we ought to be building on what \nworks. As we move to reauthorize the SCHIP program, states not only \nrequire sufficient Federal funding to ensure that children currently \nenrolled in SCHIP do not lose coverage and become uninsured, they also \nrequire additional funding to enroll more uninsured children--\nparticularly the 11,000 children in Maine who are eligible but \nunenrolled.\n  I am particularly heartened that the House and Senate negotiators \nrecognized that dental care is not a ``luxury'' benefit--but one that \nis paramount to the healthy development of children. A guaranteed \ndental benefit was included in S. 1224, the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram Reauthorization Act, legislation I introduced with Senator \nRockefeller in April.\n  In addition, as members of the Finance Committee, Senator Jeff \nBingaman and I sought to improve the quality of dental care through the \nprovision of an assured dental benefit for all SCHIP-covered children \nduring the committee process. Chairman Baucus was instrumental in the \ninclusion of a $200 million dental grant program as a first step \ntowards meeting our goal during the Finance Committee process. And I am \npleased that we were ultimately able to see such a strong dental \nbenefit in the package we are considering today.\n  Most dental disease is preventable with proper care up front, but \nwhen a parent cannot access routine care for a child, taking that child \nto the emergency room is often their only recourse. Yet that option \ncosts at least four times as much as seeing a dentist. Plus, the health \ncare a child receives in the emergency room does not even resolve the \nunderlying problem--they generally provide only pain relief and \nantibiotics for infection. The bill before us today provides States the \nchoice to either provide a dental benefit as contained in the SCHIP \nstatute or choose among three other coverage options--dental coverage \nequivalent to the coverage offered by the Federal Employee Health \nBenefit Plan, FEHBP, dental option--the largest dental plan in the \nState--or the State employees dental plan with the largest enrollment \nof children.\n  The compromise package also replaces the policy announced by the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services last month that would \nessentially prevent state SCHIP programs from enrolling uninsured \nchildren from families with household incomes above 250 percent of the \nfederal poverty level. To put this into better perspective, 250 percent \nof the federal poverty level for a family of four is $51,625. As I \nillustrated before, families in Maine faced with purchasing a policy on \nthe individual market could face a cost well in excess of $24,000 a \nyear. If States such as mine were prevented from expanding eligibility \nover 250 percent of poverty, families with a clear, demonstrable need \ncould be shut out.\n  Families could potentially spend nearly half their income on health \ncoverage yet still not qualify for assistance. That's why 2 weeks ago, \nSenators Kennedy, Smith, Rockefeller, and I introduced legislation to \nnullify these new restrictions. This compromise will rightfully block \nefforts to impose onerous and unreasonable restrictions on the States' \nefforts to reach every child requiring assistance--while at the same \ntime making sure States with more generous income-eligibility levels \nare meeting their commitment to lower income children.\n  I also want to speak briefly about the offset contained in this bill. \nThough some may vigorously disagree, I find that an increase in the \ntobacco tax is an appropriate avenue to help finance health coverage \nfor low-income children. The health complications caused by smoking--\nfor instance, the increased risk of lung cancer and heart disease as \nwell as the clear relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked \nduring pregnancy and low birth weight babies--could not be more \nevident. It is clear to me that investing in children's health, while \nat the same\n\n[[Page S12214]]\n\ntime discouraging children from starting to smoke in the first place, \nis the best form of cost-effective, preventative medicine.\n  Regrettably, this week we will hear a litany of reasons why we \nshouldn't cover more children through SCHIP. Some will express concerns \nabout the size and cost of the package. I would respond that it should \ninject a dose of reality on the magnitude of the problem. States have \nresponded to the call of families who are struggling every day with the \ncost of health insurance and are assuming a tremendous burden in the \nabsence of Federal action.\n\n  In addition, we should bear in mind that this bill is $15 billion \nbelow the amount we provided for in the budget resolution. Again, this \nbill is the product of compromise. Some of us wanted to go further. \nSenator Rockefeller and I introduced legislation to reauthorize the \nprogram at the full $50 billion--a bill that garnered 22 bipartisan \ncosponsors.\n  Although there were compromises made along the way on various policy \npositions, one point is not up for discussion--simply maintaining the \nstatus quo of current levels of coverage is unacceptable. And while the \nCongress and the White House argue over philosophical differences, \nchildren are either going without coverage, or their parents are \nfinancing their care on credit cards, hoping they can stay on top of \ntheir debt.\n  We are the wealthiest Nation on earth, and if we are unable to \nprovide health insurance and medical care to our young people, then \nwhat does that say about our values? Some of my colleagues will contend \nthat the SCHIP reauthorization we are considering is the first step \ntoward government-run health care and that we will substitute public \ncoverage for private insurance. The fact is that this SCHIP program \ncame into being ten years ago. We haven't seen that evolve from the \nSCHIP program. We didn't see it materializing into a government-run \nhealth care program, as many have alleged here today. It absolutely \nhasn't happened. What we did was identify a need and address it in a \nbipartisan manner.\n  These claims ignore the fact that today, 73 percent of the children \nenrolled in Medicaid received most or all of their health care services \nthrough a managed care plan. In fact, America's Health Insurance Plans, \nAHIP, a national association representing nearly 1,300 member \ncompanies, has recently endorsed this legislation, stating ``it repairs \nthe safety net and is a major movement toward addressing the problems \nthat States and Governors have been trying to address, which is how to \nget access for children.'' The bill also helps shore up employer-based \ncoverage by granting states the option to subsidize employer-sponsored \ngroup health coverage for families that find the coverage beyond their \nfinancial means.\n  Some have argued that SCHIP should reduce coverage for adults, \nespecially childless adults. While I believe that coverage for adults \ncan have a clear benefit for children, both in terms of enrollment of \nchildren as well as the simple fact that health problems for a working \nparent can lead to economic insecurity for the family, this approach \nrepresents an area where we had to compromise. But I find it \ncontradictory that the administration, which has been so vocal in its \nopposition to the cost and scope of the compromise package, granted the \nmajority of the 14 adult coverage waivers granted over the past ten \nyears and renewed a waiver for adult coverage in May!\n  Some will argue that reauthorization should be attached to a larger \ninitiative on the uninsured. We must acknowledge forthrightly that \nworking families are having a difficult, if not wrenching, time finding \naffordable, meaningful coverage--coverage not just in name only. Access \nto affordable, quality health care is the No. 1 one domestic priority \nof Americans, and the public will hold us all--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--accountable on delivering that goal. That is why I \nhave been engaged with my colleagues in an effort to address the \ncritical issues of extending coverage, reducing costs, and \nrevolutionizing care delivery. But while I agree with many of my \ncolleagues that legislative action to solve the problem of the \nuninsured is long-overdue, children should not be kept waiting. We \ncannot defer the urgency of providing health insurance for our children \nwhile we continue to procrastinate on the issue of the uninsured.\n  Frankly, I am outraged by the news that the President is considering \na veto of this legislation. I believe this seriously misjudges the \ngenuine concern Americans have about access to care, particularly for \nchildren. In a March New York Times/CBS News poll, 84 percent of those \npolled said they supported expanding SCHIP to cover all uninsured \nchildren. A similar majority said they thought the lack of health \ninsurance for many children was a ``very serious'' problem for the \ncountry.\n  SCHIP has been the most significant achievement of the Congress over \nthe past decade in legislative efforts to assure access to affordable \nhealth coverage to every American. Today, as we consider this \nreauthorization, we must not undermine the demonstrated success of this \nprogram over the past decade. Compromise on both sides of the aisle \nhelped us create this program ten years ago and hopefully a renewed \nsense bipartisan commitment will help us successfully reauthorize this \nvital program.\n  I would strongly encourage the President to reconsider his short-\nsighted veto threat and work hand-in-hand with Congress to extend \nhealth insurance to countless, deserving children. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Baucus, \nI yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, this Children's Health \nInsurance Program is universally acknowledged as having reduced the \nnumber of uninsured children in America. As the Senator from Maine has \njust said, we can be very proud we have seen a landmark compromise \nbetween Republicans and Democrats. With the talks going on between the \nHouse and the Senate, this compromise legislation is going to allow us \nto continue coverage for millions of low-income children and to expand \nthe coverage to millions more.\n  It is so popular because if we can attack poor health at a child's \nage, ultimately, not only is it going to benefit the quality of life of \nthat individual, but it is going to be less of a cost to society in the \nlong run, if you can get at their root problems of health while they \nare young. This is a simple economic fact, preventive health care.\n  In my previous life as the elected State treasurer and insurance \ncommissioner in Florida, I chaired the board of directors of the \nHealthy Kids Corporation. It was Florida's pioneering effort to insure \nlow-income children well before this Children's Health Insurance \nProgram started at the Federal level. We did it through the schools. We \nhad tremendous success. It works.\n  So there is a collective sigh of disappointment that the President is \ngoing to refuse to accept this compromise, which is what reflects the \ngeneral will, as expressed by that tremendous vote we just had a few \nminutes ago, allowing the bill to continue to go forward in this \nlegislative process. The President's looming veto threat calls into \nsharp relief all of those who stand to lose in the absence of fully \nreauthorizing and expanding this CHIP program.\n  Think back 10 years ago and what has happened since. The number of \nuninsured adults has increased, while the rate of low-income, uninsured \nchildren has decreased, and decreased not by a little but by a third \nlargely due to this program we are going to pass today.\n  These children have been afforded better access to primary and \npreventive care and a better quality of care. This reauthorization is \ngoing to provide $35 billion of additional funding over the next 5 \nyears.\n  Now, of course, that is a bone of contention for some people. If you \nare going out and finding $35 billion extra to fund something--at a \ntime there is not that money out there, particularly when we are going \nto have a supplemental request for Iraq of some $200 billion--under \nthat circumstance, that context, where are you going to get 35 billion \nnew dollars over 5 years to fund a program such as this? The tobacco \ntax.\n  There are those who do not want to tax tobacco. But where else would \nyou\n\n[[Page S12215]]\n\nlike to get it? You cannot make it up. You cannot go and print the \nmoney. You have to get it from some legitimate place. This is the place \nthat can withstand that additional tax. So there will be some who will \nvote against this program because they do not want to tax tobacco. \nWell, let their record be clear why they oppose this popular program.\n  The added investment in children's health is not only necessary, it \nis fruitful. It is common sense. Healthy children are more likely to \nstay healthy as they move into adulthood. Certainly, if they are \nhealthy, they are going to have more productive lives. On top of all \nthis, don't we have a moral imperative to ensure that children, \nregardless of their parents' income, are able to have a healthy life?\n  I think that is what makes up our moral fiber, our fabric, all of our \nteachings, our traditions. Our values say we want to have health care \nfor children regardless of their parents' ability to pay.\n  The President has argued that this expansion is going to take the \nCHIP program beyond its original intent of just helping poor children. \nSome people say it is going to be helping adults. Do I think that \npregnant women--pregnant adult women--ought to be helped? I would think \ncommon sense would say yes.\n  I believe this program would deepen and expand that initial promise \nwhich is helping those American families that struggle with those \nhealth care costs that are rising much faster than their wages.\n  Can you imagine being a parent and watching your child have a health \nproblem and you cannot do anything about it because you do not have the \nfinancial means to take away the pain of that health problem of your \nown child? Parents would get out and scrap and scrape, they would dig \nditches, they would clean latrines, they would do anything for their \nchild. But, sadly, because of the low income of some families, those \nchildren do not have that health care. Well, we can address that and \ncorrect that today.\n  The President has also said this expansion is going to bring us down \na path toward the federalization of health care. Well, that is simply \nnot so. There is wide latitude in this law to give that latitude to the \nStates. I believe, simply, children are too precious to be held hostage \nto an ideological debate. This program is more important than the \nrhetoric about government-run health care.\n  By virtue of me telling you my background, obviously, this bill is \nvery important for my State of Florida, where over 700,000 children \nalone are uninsured. This legislation is the best opportunity to expand \nthat coverage to a significant portion of those 700,000 children and \ncertainly across the land to millions of children.\n  We have seen the success. We are aware of how many more children need \nto participate. I humbly urge the President to reconsider his veto \nthreat. It is rare we have a chance to pass legislation that is so \noverwhelmingly positive, so completely necessary, and so morally \nunquestionable.\n  I am certainly going to cast my vote in favor. I hope a resounding \npercentage of this Senate will do likewise so we can send a very strong \nmessage of support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would like to follow on the comments of \nmy colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, in support of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program bill.\n  This week, the House of Representatives passed the bill \noverwhelmingly, 265 to 159. Of my 18 Ohio House colleagues, about two-\nthirds of them voted for this bill. It is clearly something we know \nworks in my State.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program was passed 10 years ago in \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate. It was established. \nPresident Clinton, a Democrat, with a Republican House and a Republican \nSenate, supported that issue, and it has clearly worked.\n  We have some 6 million children in this country now who benefit from \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. In my State, it is around \n200,000 children. We also know this legislation will mean about 4 \nmillion more children in the United States will benefit from this \nhealth care program.\n  These are sons and daughters of working families. These are not \npeople living in the lap of luxury. They are families making $20,000, \n$30,000, and $40,000 a year. They are families where they are working \nhard, playing by the rules, but they are not making enough money to buy \ninsurance. Their employers do not offer insurance. So this is what we \nneed to do.\n  Now, the President says he plans to veto this bill for two reasons \nthat I can understand. One of them, he said, is the cost. This is $35 \nbillion over 5 years; $7 billion a year. But just make the contrast: We \nare spending $2.5 billion a week--$2.5 billion a week--on the war in \nIraq. Yet the President does not want to spend $7 billion a year to \ninsure 4 million children. That is his first reason--the cost.\n  The second reason, the President says: I want private insurance to \ntake care of these children. Well, so do I. So does Senator Grassley, \nwho has been a major leader on this issue in the Senate on the other \nside of the aisle. We all do. But the fact is, private insurance is not \ntaking care of these children. Again, they are sons and daughters of \npeople with jobs paying $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year, \npeople without insurance and without the financial wherewithal to be \nable to take care of these children.\n  The President came to Cleveland a few months ago and said everybody \nhas health care in this country. They can get it at the emergency room. \nI want children in this country to get preventive care in their family \ndoctor's office, not acute care in the emergency room.\n  Before the President makes his decision, I would like him to meet \nthree families in Ohio, people who really speak to this whole issue.\n  I want him to know about Dawn and Glenn Snyder and their son Cody, \nliving in Bloomingdale, near Steubenville, near the Ohio River in \neastern Ohio. Dawn works in a doctor's office, and Glenn works \ntemporary jobs. Cody is 3 years old and has cerebral palsy. Until he \nwas a year old, Cody had bleeding in his brain and seizures. Sometimes \nGlenn has insurance and sometimes he doesn't. It depends on where he is \nworking. Dawn is going to lose the coverage for her family that she has \ngotten because they can no longer afford to buy it.\n  So even though Cody needs regular medical care from a neurologist and \nan eye doctor, as well as routine preventive care that all children \nneed, he is in danger of having no access to health insurance. However, \nthe Snyders will have coverage if this bill is signed into law.\n  If this bill passes, Cody will likely qualify for care under Ohio's \nnew Children's Health Insurance Program. I would add also, on a \nbipartisan note, Governor Strickland, the new Governor of Ohio, with a \nresounding bipartisan vote out of the legislature, moved the \neligibility to 300 percent of poverty so families making up to about \n$50,000 or $55,000 a year will have coverage.\n  If this bill passes, it means the Snyders will have a safety net for \nCody's coverage and will be able to live with the security of knowing \ntheir son will receive the care he needs.\n  Then there is the story of Evan Brannon. Evan is a 1-year-old from \nDayton in southwest Ohio. His dad Kenneth is currently not working, \nafter losing his job as a repairman for a telephone company. Angela, \nEvan's mother, stays at home with him and has a baby on the way.\n  Evan was diagnosed with a congenital hernia of his diaphragm and is \non a feeding tube, and he also receives medicine through a tube. He \nreceives physical, occupational, and speech therapy. His parents looked \ninto private coverage and learned they would never qualify for it \nbecause of Evan's preexisting condition. The family is faced with \n$5,000 to $6,000 a month in medical expenses. Angela can't go back to \nwork. Kenneth is looking for a job but can't get a position over a \ncertain income level or Evan will lose medical coverage. How is this \nfamily ever supposed to get ahead if they have to make sure not to make \ntoo much money out of fear of losing health insurance for their \nchildren? What kind of incentive is that to build into the system?\n\n  Passing this bill will fix that. This is just one way in which \nAmerica's families' opportunities are limited by our\n\n[[Page S12216]]\n\ncountry's inability to provide the insurance the children's health \ninsurance will provide.\n  One more story. David Kelley is a 13-year-old living in Erie County, \nright next door to where I live. He lives with his mother Heather and \nhis stepfather Timothy. David has been diagnosed as bipolar, mildly \nautistic, and suffers from Asperger's syndrome. He also has a rare form \nof asthma. David was born 2 months premature. His doctors believe that \na lack of oxygen and other complications may have caused the conditions \nhe has coped with daily for 13 years, although the causes are not \ncompletely known.\n  David's health conditions require him to regularly visit a \npsychiatrist, a psychologist, and a primary care physician. His \nmedications cost $2,000 each month, and Medicaid covers it. His mother \nHeather has said her greatest fear in life is of David losing his \nmedical coverage. She herself has multiple sclerosis and is unable to \nwork. No private insurance plan will ever cover David because of those \npreexisting conditions. Heather has made navigating the Medicaid and \nsocial service systems a nearly full-time job just to maintain David's \nbenefits. Here is another family in need of help from the Senate.\n  I hope our President will not leave the Kelleys, the Brannons, or the \nSnyders behind, without the health coverage their children so \ndesperately need. I hope he can have compassion for those families \nstruggling so hard to make ends meet and whose greatest wish is to \nprovide the most basic of needs for their children: housing, food, and \nhealth care. I hope the President can see what a sound investment this \nis. This isn't spending $7 billion a year; this is investing $7 billion \na year in the future of our families, the future of our children, and \nthe future of our country. Four million American children will receive \nhealth insurance if the President signs this bill. He must sign it into \nlaw. Too many people are counting on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, there is no doubt in anyone's mind that \nthe SCHIP program will continue. That is a certainty, as certain as \nanything can be. The question is whether the SCHIP program, the State \nchildren's insurance program, will remain true to its targeted \npopulation which was contemplated by Congress in 1997 when it passed \nwith strong bipartisan support or whether it will expand into a new \nburgeoning Federal program that has lost sight of its original mission \nand which, in the minds of some, represents another incremental step \ntoward a Federal Government takeover of our health care system in \nAmerica.\n  Let there be no doubt about it, a Federal, Washington-run health care \nsystem would be bad for the children and the people of this country. \nThere are at least three things you can guarantee if Washington takes \ncontrol of our health care. One is it will be incredibly expensive. In \nother words, taxes will have to go up to pay for it. Two, it will be \nincredibly bureaucratic, and some bureaucrat with a green eyeshade will \ndecide what kind of health care you or your family gets. Three, there \nwill be rationing of health care. That same Government bureaucrat will \ndecide whether you get a diagnostic test, whether you can be scheduled \nfor an operation when you need it, or what other kinds of health care \ndecisions you can make. In fact, the choices will be taken from \nindividuals and be given to the Government. That is a bad idea, \nalthough there are some who have advocated this for many years, \nincluding the leading Democratic contender for President of the United \nStates, who has advocated a government-run health care system since the \nearly 1990s.\n  This cannot be an expansion of a wildly successful program that has \nlost its focus on the poor children of America, and how in the world \ncould I possibly say that? Well, this bill we are debating now raises \nspending by 140 percent--140 percent--at a time when my constituents \ntell me they are very concerned that the Federal Government has lost \nits way when it comes to spending and are worried that they will see \nconsequential increases in their tax burden as a result of out-of-\ncontrol Federal spending.\n  Along with virtually everyone else in Congress, I strongly believe \nthe SCHIP program should be renewed, and it will be renewed. I voted \nfor a renewal bill called Kids First that provided $10 billion in \naddition to the $35 billion over 5 years and which would enroll 1.3 \nmillion new children in SCHIP. But the majority has rejected that as \ntoo miserly.\n  Whom do they want to cover with the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram? Well, No. 1, they want to cover adults in 14 States, and in \nNew York City they want to be able to cover up to 400 percent of \npoverty. A family making $82,000 a year would be--half of whom would be \ndisplaced from their private health insurance to get government-funded \nhealth insurance at the courtesy of the beleaguered American taxpayer. \nThat is wrong.\n  The other inadvertent consequence of this will be because government \ndoesn't know how to control health care costs except to ration access \nto health care, we are going to see more and more people now who will \nbe displaced from private health insurance to go on to government \ninsurance who will find low reimbursement rates--close the doors to \naccess to health care providers. In the city of Austin recently, there \nwas a story written that said only 18 percent of physicians accept new \nMedicare patients--18 percent. The question was, Why? Well, the Federal \nGovernment Medicare reimbursement rate is so low, doctors can't \ncontinue to accept new Medicare patients and keep their doors open. In \na similar fashion, the SCHIP rate is regulated by the Federal \nGovernment, as is the Medicaid rate. The only way many physicians and \nhealth care providers keep their doors open is to have a mix of \ngovernment-subsidized health coverage and private health insurance. We \nall know private health insurance carries the cost to allow many health \ncare providers to keep their doors open.\n\n  It is not conspiracy theories, it is not an exaggeration to say this \nis an incremental step toward that single-payer, Washington-controlled \nhealth care system. Right now, the Federal Government pays 50 percent \nof the health care costs in America today.\n  I think it is a bad idea to lose sight of the original target for \nSCHIP, which is children whose families make up to 200 percent of the \npoverty level, who have more money than they can make and still qualify \nfor Medicaid. But we should do everything in our power to recommit to \nthose children that we are going to make sure the money Congress \nappropriates, takes out of the pocket of the taxpayer and provides in \nterms of health benefits to them, is true to the vision Congress \noriginally intended and that that money which could go to expanding \nhealth care coverage to these kids who come from relatively modest \nincomes is not taken and provided for adult coverage or middle-income \ncoverage in places such as New York for up to 400 percent of the \npoverty level.\n  So there is a lot of misinformation and, indeed, downright \ndemagoguery going on in the media and elsewhere with regard to what is \nhappening here. I hope we will make one thing clear: that every Member \nof the Congress--certainly this Senator--supports a continuation and \nreauthorization of SCHIP. It is a canard to suggest that anyone is \ndenying access to health care to the children who have benefited \nhistorically and should benefit from SCHIP. But it is simply a Trojan \nhorse to suggest that we are merely reauthorizing this legislation \nbecause what is happening is we are seeing a dramatic expansion of \nFederal spending, losing sight of the targeted population, and taking \nanother incremental step toward a disastrous Washington-controlled and \n-run health care system which will be expensive to the American \ntaxpayer, which will be incredibly bureaucratic, and which will result \nin rationing of health care, which is something that is not in the best \ninterest of the American people.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I will try to use less \ntime. I know we have a lot of business today. I rise also to talk about \nthe SCHIP bill we just voted on for cloture, and hopefully, later this \nevening, we will have the opportunity to vote on final passage.\n\n[[Page S12217]]\n\n  I have been here a short amount of time, and I continue to be amazed \nat some of the rhetoric that ends up circling much of the legislation \nwe discuss in the Senate. I do not think the SCHIP bill is perfect. I \nam going to vote for the SCHIP bill. I haven't been in the Senate long \nenough in 8\\1/2\\ months to have actually ever voted for a perfect bill. \nChances are I may never vote for a perfect bill in the Senate. I know \nthis bill has been threatened to be vetoed. Again, I think about the \nirony of a bill such as this being vetoed by the administration.\n  The most recent health care legislation that I remember passing out \nof this body that was a large bill was Medicare Part D. As I remember, \nthat was a bill where nothing was paid for. We added $700 billion to \n$800 billion in deficits. There was no attempt whatsoever for that to \nbe paid for. It also created coverage for individuals who did not need \ncoverage. It didn't matter. We passed a massive bill. I was not here \nduring that time, but it passed several years ago.\n  The uniqueness of this bill is that there has been an attempt to \nactually pay for it--something unique in recent times as it relates to \nhealth care coverage. Secondly, it actually is health care for people \nwho need it, which is also very different from some of the things we \nhave focused on in the past. So I find it very ironic that this \nadministration has chosen this bill to veto.\n  I have heard a lot of comments about the frailties of this, and one \nof the most recent red herrings regarding this bill was that it would \nallow illegal immigrants to receive health care. That is absolutely not \ntrue. But based on the standard of this argument that was put forth \nrecently, we certainly need to ensure that immediately we would do away \nwith Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid because they would be \nheld, of course, to a standard that cannot be met. That is an argument \nwhich obviously is not true.\n  I also heard that this bill had earmarks in it. I have looked and I \ncan't find any earmarks in this bill. There is a hospital in Tennessee, \ndown on the Mississippi-Arkansas border, and it happens to deal with \nlow-income citizens who come there from Mississippi and Arkansas. So \nthis bill allows that hospital to be paid Medicaid reimbursement for \nthe patients it sees from Mississippi and Arkansas. If that is the new \nstandard for earmarks in this body, then I suppose every comment or \nstatement we make will now become an earmark.\n  I have also heard the comment that this is the backdoor to socialized \nmedicine. I really think that one is maybe the most humorous I have \nheard. I do wish to bring this body's attention to the fact that the \nBush administration--the Bush administration--since it has been in \noffice has approved these waivers and state plan amendments: in June of \n2004 to California, allowing them to go to 300 percent of poverty, \nagain above the intent of the original SCHIP bill; in Hawaii, in \nJanuary of 2006, allowed the State, through executive prerogative, to \ngo to 300 percent; in Massachusetts, in July of 2006, this \nadministration allowed that State to go to 300 percent; in Missouri, in \nAugust of 2003, this administration allowed them to go to 300 percent; \nin New York, in July of 2001, this administration allowed them to go to \n250 percent; in Pennsylvania, in February of 2007, just a few months \nago, to 300 percent; in West Virginia, in December of 2006, to 220 \npercent. But the one I have left is the one that is most recent.\n  This administration, without any legislative involvement, in March of \n2007--a few months ago--agreed to let the District of Columbia go to \n300 percent of the poverty level. So for those people to say this bill \nis a back door to socialized medicine, it seems to me they have not \ntaken into account the front door of the Bush administration, which all \nalong has allowed nine states to expand their programs beyond the \noriginal intent of the SCHIP program. This bill actually causes this \nout-of-control process that has been ongoing during the Bush \nadministration to actually be reformed. It actually causes reforms to \ntake place so this bill will more fully embrace its original intent.\n  So I rise to say there is a lot of rhetoric that is being used in \nthis SCHIP bill. This bill is not perfect. I know my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle would like to see changes in this bill. I would \nlike to see changes in this bill. I think it could have had a more \ncredible debate had the administration initially funded this in their \nbudget with an appropriate amount of money to even allow the program as \nit is to continue.\n  I will vote for this bill. I am not going to argue to any of my \ncolleagues as to what they should do. I will vote for this bill because \nI believe it focuses on those most in need--children--mostly poor \nchildren in our country.\n  What is actually moving our country toward socialized medicine is the \nfact that none of us in this body have yet taken the steps to make sure \nthat those most in need have access to private, affordable health care. \nI know there are a number of bills that have looked at that. I have \noffered a bill--again, it is not perfect--and I hope Members of this \nbody will actually cause it to be improved by adding amendments. But \nthe fact of the matter is, what will move our country toward socialized \nmedicine is not this SCHIP bill, which focuses on poor children in \nAmerica, but it will be the lack of action in this body to create \nmethodologies, which we could do, to allow people in need to have \naccess to private, affordable health care.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORKER. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. First, I thank the Senator for his comments on the \nfloor of the Senate, debunking what has been inaccurate statements that \nhave been made and also for laying out the realities of what is true \nabout this proposal. I think the Senator has done it in a wonderful \nway. I appreciate the Senator's willingness to stand up and talk about \nwhat is real, important, and the fact that this is such a strong \nbipartisan bill.\n  I wonder if the Senator might comment on the fact that aren't we \ntalking about working families, low-income working families, trying \nevery day to keep things together for their family, and they want to \nknow that the children have health care? Isn't that what this is all \nabout?\n  Mr. CORKER. That is exactly what the bill is about. There is no \ndoubt--and I think we should all acknowledge this--that there are some \ncases in some States where there has been an aggressiveness to actually \ncause some adults to be covered who should not be covered. In this \nbill, focusing toward 2010, there is an effort to reform that, to cause \nthe focus to return back to children.\n  Also, there is no question that this administration, which offers the \nfact that they are going to veto this bill, has done more to change the \ndynamics of SCHIP than any legislation that we could pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today is a momentous day. We have the \nopportunity to extend health insurance coverage to 10 million low-\nincome children, 4 million of whom, without this bill, simply would \ncontinue to be a statistic in the ranks of the uninsured. In Oregon \nalone, we estimate that at least 60,000 new young people will receive \nhealth insurance and possibly even more.\n  Because of the outstanding work of my colleagues, Senators Baucus, \nGrassley, Hatch, and Rockefeller, and because of their work, we have \nbefore us a proposal that will garner wide, bipartisan support. I \ncommend them for their efforts and thank them for their willingness to \nwork with me to incorporate a number of important policies not only to \nOregon but to millions of young Americans across this country.\n  When I first arrived in the Senate in 1997, I had the opportunity to \nlearn about an outstanding idea launched by two great colleagues, \nSenators Kennedy and Hatch. That idea was known as the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. When they described the details to me, I \nrecognized in it many of the features I had worked on as an Oregon \nState Senator in the development of the Oregon health plan. I told them \nto sign me up and let me know how a junior Senator on the Budget \nCommittee could help them. It was my privilege to do that with an \namendment on that year's budget.\n  But here we are, 11 years later; now I serve on the Finance \nCommittee, and I have had the opportunity to help craft\n\n[[Page S12218]]\n\na bill that will provide the authority and funding needed to continue \nSCHIP for another 5 years. It is a responsibility I took seriously then \nand still. I am pleased to have an opportunity today to renew it and \nimprove it.\n\n  As I think of the work we have done to advance this bill, I wish to \ntake a moment to highlight a number of critical policies I have worked \nhard to advance and which are now included in the bill before us.\n  First, and perhaps most important, I am pleased we will continue to \nutilize a 60 cent increase in the tobacco products excise tax to pay \nfor SCHIP reauthorization. Looking back on the debate over the budget \nthis past March, I didn't know, but I hoped at the time, my amendment \nto do this would garner the support necessary. It has done so. That \nsupport has held, and it is now the funding source for keeping the \npromise of SCHIP.\n  However, in my opinion, there is no better means to provide funding \nfor children's health care. I know some don't like this. It is, \nfrankly, the only tax increase I enthusiastically support and for which \nI have ever consciously voted. Not only can we extend health insurance \nto 10 million low-income children, we can do so while discouraging \nother young people from smoking. Studies show America's youth is \nstrongly discouraged from smoking if the price of the tobacco product \nis increased. I am hopeful we will discourage thousands of kids from \nsmoking, which will improve and perhaps save their lives. I see it as a \n``twofer,'' to discourage smoking, and you can connect the habit of \ntobacco with all the public health care costs it imposes. It is a sad \nstatistic that 20 percent of Oregonians who die each year die from \ntobacco-related illnesses.\n  I am also pleased to have been able to secure mental health parity in \nSCHIP. According to a report by the Urban Institute entitled ``Access \nto Children's Mental Health Services Under Medicaid and SCHIP,'' the \nhighest prevalence of mental health problems among all children, ages 6 \nto 17, is observed among Medicaid and SCHIP-eligible children at a rate \nsignificantly higher than for other insured children and uninsured \nchildren. Now, today, the Senate has taken a remarkable step forward to \nensuring that SCHIP treats ailments of the mind on the same level as it \ntreats ailments of the body. That is a notable achievement.\n  We are, as a Senate body, advancing the cause of mental health care \nas it has needed to be for some time but now hopefully soon. In this \nbill, and in the mental health parity bill earlier passed, we put \nmental health on parity with physical health.\n  This bill also reverses the harmful policy recently implemented by \nthe administration. While I understand the President has some authority \nto help guide the development of Federal programs, in this instance, \nthe policy released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nto restrict coverage of children with incomes over 250 percent of \npoverty simply goes too far.\n  Therefore, I strongly support the language in the bill that \nreinforces the Senate's position that States will be allowed to cover \nchildren with family incomes up to 300 percent of poverty. I also \nsupport the proposal to create a tracking system to more accurately \ndetermine who does and doesn't have insurance. This is vital as we \ncontinue to work to extend health insurance to all Americans.\n  Finally, I wish to note how pleased I am to see that States will be \nable to extend coverage to pregnant women through SCHIP. This makes \nsense. Prenatal care, when you are talking about children, is truly the \npoint at which they can get the healthier start. Their mothers deserve \nthis if we are serious about the children they bear. According to the \nNational Committee for Quality Assurance, every dollar spent on \nprenatal care results in a 300-percent savings in postnatal care costs \nand an almost 500-percent savings in long-term morbidity costs. This is \nan investment we need to make, and it is well worth making.\n  Ten years after SCHIP became law, we now have a chance to support a \nbill that will cover 4 million new children who are already eligible \nfor this program. This is not an expansion, though. This is simply \nkeeping the promise of SCHIP with those children who are currently \neligible but for whom we have not had the resources, the dollars, to \nfully fund this program.\n  While some have alleged we are expanding the program, expanding \ngovernment-run health care, that rhetoric could not be further from the \ntruth. We are not expanding the program, we are simply putting our \nmoney where our mouths have been. We are taking a step forward to give \nStates the money they need to cover the children who already are \nqualified for SCHIP but, for one reason or another, are not enrolled. \nWe also are not expanding government-run health care. SCHIP is a \nprogram that is delivered by private insurance companies. It is a \nprogram that requires families to pay premiums and copayments based on \ntheir income levels. It is for these reasons that SCHIP will garner \nstrong, bipartisan support today.\n  In closing, I know there has been a great deal of rhetoric back and \nforth between the White House and the Hill. In this instance, with \nhealth care for millions of American children on the line, I urge my \nfriend, President Bush, to take a fresh look at the details of this \npackage and realize it is worthy of his support. I urge him to put \naside the differences of this debate and sign this bill into law for \nthe sake of our children, America's children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. The Senator is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very \nimportant amendment I have filed to the SCHIP legislation that passed \nthe House and was sent back to the Senate. Unfortunately, the majority \nleader has decided not to allow any Republican amendments to this very \nimportant legislation. But I wish to take the opportunity, \nnevertheless, to discuss my amendment which is filed which is at the \ndesk. It is very straightforward.\n  It simply says American citizens only are eligible for SCHIP and that \nno funds will be used to expand health care benefits in SCHIP to \nillegal immigrants and others.\n  The legislation we are considering, as written, will do just that. It \nwill expand the program enormously without any regard for focusing on \nAmerican citizens, and it is very clear that in that expansion, the \nbenefit would go to many illegal aliens because of glaring loopholes \nthat exist in present law and in this legislation.\n  Congressman Jim McCrery of Louisiana has been looking into this issue \nfor several weeks. On September 21, he wrote the Commissioner of the \nSocial Security Administration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nCongressman McCrery's letter to the Social Security Administration.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2007.\n     Commissioner Michael J. Astrue,\n     Social Security Administration, Office of the Commissioner, \n         Baltimore, MD.\n       Dear Commissioner Astrue: As Congress prepares to debate \n     the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (SCHIP), I am writing to request your assistance in \n     clarifying an issue raised by a provision in the Senate \n     passed bill. Specifically, I would request that the Social \n     Security Administration provide technical assistance to \n     explain the impact of Section 301 of H.R. 976, which was \n     passed by the Senate on August 2, 2007.\n       Concerns have been raised that the implementation of this \n     provision could make it easier for illegal aliens to qualify \n     for government funded healthcare programs including SCHIP and \n     Medicaid. In order to better assess the accuracy of these \n     claims, I would request that you provide answers to the \n     following questions by no later than the evening of Monday, \n     September 24, 2007.\n       1. If implemented as written, would the name and Social \n     Security number verification process in section 301 of the \n     Senate SCHIP bill allow the Social Security Administration \n     (SSA) to verify whether someone is a naturalized citizen?\n       2. Would Section 301 require SSA to perform any \n     verification of a person's status as a naturalized citizen?\n       3. Would the implementation of this provision detect and/or \n     prevent a legal alien who is not a naturalized citizen (and \n     therefore generally ineligible for Medicaid), from receiving \n     Medicaid?\n       4. Would the name and Social Security number verification \n     system in Section 301 verify that the person submitting the \n     name and Social Security number is who they say they are?\n       5. Would the name and Social Security number verification \n     system in Section 301\n\n[[Page S12219]]\n\n     prevent an illegal alien from fraudulently using another \n     person's valid name and matching Social Security number to \n     obtain Medicaid or SCHIP benefits?\n       6. Would the name and Social Security number verification \n     system in Section 301 prevent an individual who has illegally \n     overstayed a work visa permit from qualifying for Medicaid or \n     SCHIP?\n       7. Based on the accuracy of your database, please comment \n     as to the volume of false positives or false negatives that \n     could occur under the Social Security number verification \n     process in section 301 of the Senate SCHIP bill.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. If you \n     should have questions about any of the requests in this \n     letter, please contact Chuck Clapton of the Ways and Means \n     Committee Republican staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jim McCrery,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, Congressman McCrery laid out seven very \nsimple and straightforward questions that go exactly to this point: Is \nthere any reliable way to ensure that this program is reserved for \nAmerican citizens, not illegal aliens in the country?\n  Unfortunately, the answers--all seven of them--came back: No, no, no, \nno, no, no, no.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Administrator's responses.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       If implemented as written, would the name and Social \n     Security number verification process in Section 301 of the \n     Senate SCHIP bill allow SSA to verify whether someone is a \n     naturalized citizen?\n       No, the name/SSN verification process only indicates \n     whether this information matches SSA's records. Our \n     understanding of Section 301 is that it would provide States \n     with the option of using a match as a conclusive presumption \n     that someone is a citizen, whether naturalized or not. Since \n     we have no data specific to this particular population, we \n     have no basis for estimating how many noncitizens would match \n     if this language were passed by Congress.\n       2. Would Section 301 require SSA to perform any \n     verification of a person's status as a naturalized citizen?\n       Section 301 would not provide for verification of \n     citizenship but would create a conclusive presumption based \n     on less reliable data that a person is a citizen. As we read \n     Section 301, it would not require use of DHS data to make a \n     verification of citizenship.\n       3. Would the implementation of this provision detect and/or \n     prevent a legal alien who is not a naturalized citizen (and \n     therefore generally ineligible for Medicaid), from receiving \n     Medicaid?\n       No. Our current name/SSN verification procedures will not \n     detect legal aliens who are not naturalized citizens.\n       4. Would the name and Social Security number verification \n     system in Section 301 verify that the person submitting the \n     name and Social Security number is who they say they are?\n       No.\n       5. Would the name and Social Security Number verification \n     system in Section 301 prevent an illegal alien from \n     fraudulently using another person's valid name and matching \n     SSN to obtain Medicaid or SCHIP benefits?\n       No.\n       6. Would the name and Social Security number verification \n     system in Section 301 prevent an individual who has illegally \n     overstayed a work visa permit from qualifying for Medicaid or \n     SCHIP?\n       The name/SSN verification system in Section 301 would not \n     identify individuals who have illegally overstayed a work \n     visa permit.\n       7. Based on the accuracy of your database, please comment \n     as to the volume of false positives or false negatives that \n     could occur under the Social Security number verification \n     process in section 301 of the Senate SCHIP bill.\n       Due to a lack of data specific to this particular \n     population defined in section 301, we have no basis for \n     projecting how many ``false negatives'' or ``false \n     positives'' would be produced by enactment of Section 301, \n     but they will occur.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the responses are very clear:\n\n       . . . we have no basis for estimating how many noncitizens \n     would match if this language were passed by Congress.\n       Section 301 would not provide for verification of \n     citizenship. . . .\n       Our current name/SSN verification procedures will not \n     detect legal aliens who are not naturalized citizens.\n\n  They will not detect illegal aliens who have gotten Social Security \nnumbers fraudulently.\n\n       The . . . verification system in Section 301 would not \n     identify individuals who have illegally overstayed a work \n     Visa permit,\n\n  And on and on.\n  The record is perfectly clear, including from the Social Security \nAdministration Commissioner, that there is nothing in the SCHIP \nlegislation to prevent this fraud, to prevent these very significant \ncostly benefits coming from the Federal taxpayers from going to illegal \naliens in the country.\n  Again, this is a glaring problem with this legislation. It is a \nglaring problem with many existing Federal benefits that we should \naddress head on. Absent a solution to look at this carefully in the \ncontext of this legislation, I do not think it should move forward.\n  Again, it is truly unfortunate that we have no ability to vote on \nthis amendment on the Senate floor. This is a significant issue, this \nis a significant bill, and yet no Republican amendments, either this \namendment or any other, can be considered on the Senate floor given the \nprocedures the majority leader has used to shut out debate, shut out \namendments, move forward, ignore a very serious concern of the American \npeople. I think that is unfortunate. I also think it is reason not to \nmove forward in passing this SCHIP legislation--one significant reason \namong others.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, in this Chamber, we are \nconsidering three critical issues that go to the heart of values we \nhave as a nation, three pieces of legislation that seek to honor these \nvalues by putting them into action. We have passed and I am proud to \nsupport a bill to strengthen our capacity to stop hate crimes by \nsupporting local law enforcement. We will be passing the largest \nexpansion of health care for children since we created the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program during the Clinton administration. Finally, \nincluded in this Children's Health Insurance Program legislation is a \nprovision I sponsored and authored with Senator Dodd to support injured \nservicemembers by giving their families more time off under the Family \nand Medical Leave Act. This is a banner day for the Senate and the \nCongress, and I am proud to join a bipartisan coalition in tackling \nthese challenges, from children without health insurance to military \nfamilies without the support they need.\n  We will pass the CHIP legislation by a wide margin, and so the choice \nwill then fall squarely on the shoulders of the President. Will he join \nus in helping injured servicemembers and in providing health care to \n3.8 million children who right now don't have it or will he put \nideology ahead of military families and vulnerable children? We in this \nChamber know what the right choice is. The American people also know \nwhat the right choice is. I hope our President will put progress over \npartisanship and join the bipartisan majority and the vast majority of \nAmericans in believing we can no longer treat these challenges and the \npeople who face them as though they were invisible.\n  I believe every child deserves health care. Yet far too many children \nin our Nation--more than 9 million--do not have access to quality, \naffordable health care. That is a moral crisis which should be \nimpelling us to act, and this Congress has done so.\n  A few weeks ago, I met Amy McCutchin, who was struggling to find \nhealth insurance for her 2-year-old daughter Pascale--a healthy, lively \n2\\1/2\\ year old. Amy works as a contractor while also going to school \nfor her master's degree. She is divorced. She lost her insurance \nbecause of the divorce. She is not offered insurance through her \nemployer because she does freelance work. Unfortunately, Pascale and \nher mom are among the millions for whom the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram is currently unavailable.\n  When I met Amy, she stressed she is trying to do the right thing. She \nworks hard. She is what we would call barely middle class. In fact, she \ncan't miss a day of work or she doesn't get paid. But she is also going \nto school full time, and she has to balance that with her work and the \ncare of her daughter. She is falling through the cracks, and so is \nlittle Pascale.\n  This is a story which is being told 9 million times every day by the \nparents\n\n[[Page S12220]]\n\nof the children without health insurance. Today, we can tell a \ndifferent story and create a different outcome.\n  I was proud to help create the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram during the Clinton administration. I worked on that legislation \nduring my time as First Lady. In fact, after the bill was passed into \nlaw--a bipartisan majority in this Congress made that happen--I helped \nto get the word out to tell parents that help was on the way and to \nsign up children for the program in the first few years. In the Senate, \nI have continued that effort, fighting to ensure health care for \nchildren has the priority in our budget it deserves, and I am proud of \nthe progress we have made.\n  The CHIP program provides health insurance for 6 million children. In \nNew York alone, almost 400,000 kids benefit from CHIP every month. With \nthis strong bipartisan, bicameral agreement, hammered out in this \nChamber by Chairman Baucus and Senators Grassley, Rockefeller, and \nHatch, an additional 72,000 children in New York will have access to \nhealth care coverage.\n  It will also help enroll many of the almost 300,000 children in New \nYork who live in families who are already eligible for CHIP or for \nMedicaid because they make less than $52,000 a year, which is 250 \npercent of the poverty level for a family of four. Now, I know that \nsounds like a lot of money to some people around the country, but it \ndoesn't go very far in New York, and it is one of the reasons why so \nmany children in New York don't have access to health care and why we \nare fighting so hard in New York to extend health care to those who \nneed it and can't yet afford it.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, 3.8 million children \nwho are uninsured nationwide will gain coverage. That will reduce the \nnumber of uninsured children by one-third over the next 5 years. Now, \nif we can afford tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and \ntax cuts for oil companies making record profits, I think we ought to \nbe able to find it in our hearts and in our budget to cover the \nmillions of children who deserve a healthy start.\n\n  I want to be very clear. If the President vetoes this bill, as he has \nthreatened, he will be vetoing health care for almost 4 million \nchildren and he will be putting ideology, not children, first.\n  Earlier this year, I was proud to introduce legislation with Chairman \nJohn Dingell from the House of Representatives to reauthorize and \nexpand CHIP, and I am very pleased that a number of the ideas in our \nbill are included in this legislation, such as cutting the redtape and \nbolstering incentives to get eligible children into the program. The \nlegislation also improves access to private coverage and expands access \nto benefits such as mental health and dental coverage.\n  Some of my colleagues have heard me tell the story about the young \nboy living in Maryland whose mother wasn't on Medicaid, wasn't on CHIP, \nand was struggling to get some kind of health care coverage for her \nchildren when her 12-year-old son came down with a toothache. Medicaid \nand CHIP don't cover dental care in many cases, anyway, so even though \nshe eventually got coverage, she couldn't find a dentist who was \navailable to actually provide the dental care. Her son continued to \ncomplain, the toothache turned into an abscess, the abscess broke, and \nthe next thing you know, the little boy is in the emergency room and \nbeing admitted to the hospital. But because the poison had already \nspread into his bloodstream, he had to be put on life support, and \nDemonte didn't make it. So for the lack of a visit to a dentist, which \nmight have cost $80, $85, a little boy lost his life. And this is why \nexpanding access to mental health and dental coverage is absolutely \ncritical.\n  I also commend the authors of this bipartisan agreement for their \nwork and for bringing forward a practical, fiscally responsible \ncompromise. It represents the culmination of a lot of hard work. I see \nsome of the staff from the Finance Committee here on the floor, and I \nthank them because I know how much they did to make this possible.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report includes the support for \nthe Injured Service Members Act of 2007, legislation Senator Dodd and I \nintroduced to provide up to 6 months of job-protected leave for \nspouses, children, parents, or next of kin of service members who \nsuffer from combat-related injuries or illness.\n  This amendment implements a key recommendation of the Dole-Shalala \nCommission, chaired by former Senator Dole, who served with great \ndistinction in this Chamber, and Secretary Shalala, who served for 8 \nyears under the Clinton administration as the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. Their Commission on Care for America's Returning \nWounded Warriors came up with a number of recommendations, and those \nrecommendations are supported by a broad bipartisan coalition in \nCongress.\n  The families of our service men and women face extraordinary demands \nin caring for loved ones who are injured while serving our Nation. \nCurrently, the spouses, parents, and children receive only the 12 weeks \nof unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. But, as the \nDole-Shalala Commission found, all too often that is just not enough \ntime. An injured servicemember usually grapples with not only the \nphysical injuries but having been, just a few weeks or months before, a \nhealthy, fit young person and now, with the loss of a limb or being \nblinded or burned, having to come to grips with all of that. That takes \ntime as well as medical care.\n  These new injuries our service members are suffering--the traumatic \nbrain injuries--that we are only now focusing on are especially \ndifficult.\n  I remember being at Walter Reed a few months ago, and I met a young \nArmy captain who had been in a convoy hit by one of those improvised \nexplosive devices, resulting in the loss of his right arm and the ring \nfinger on his left hand because he had his wedding band on his finger \nand the explosion had caused his wedding band to melt into his finger, \nunfortunately causing him to lose that finger.\n  I asked him: Captain, how are you doing?\n  He said: Oh, Senator, I am making progress. Folks are helping me get \nused to the prosthetic, and I am learning how to use it. But where do I \ngo to get my brain back? I never had to ask people for help before. Now \nmy wife has to make a list for me, telling me where I have to go to \nmeet my appointments and what I have to do when I am there. Where do I \ngo to get my brain back?\n  Well, these wounds--some that you can see, some that you can't--are \nextremely serious and require family members to be available. The \nlanguage included in the bill expands leave to 6 months. It is a step \nwe can take immediately that will make a real difference in the lives \nof these wounded warriors and their families, and I hope the President \nwill think about that before he vetoes this bill.\n  Now, I am disappointed that the CHIP bill doesn't include the Legal \nImmigrant Children's Health Improvement Act, which I introduced with \nSenator Snowe and have been working on with her for a number of years. \nThis bipartisan bill would give States the flexibility to provide \nMedicaid and CHIP coverage to low-income legal immigrant children and \npregnant women. I want to underscore that. We are talking about legal \nimmigrant children and pregnant women.\n  The current restrictions prevent thousands of legal immigrant \nchildren and pregnant women from receiving preventive health services \nand treatment for minor illnesses before they become serious. Families \nwho are unable to access care for their children have little choice but \nto turn to emergency rooms. This hurts children, plain and simple, and \nI think it costs us money. A legal pregnant woman who cannot get \nprenatal care may have a premature baby, who ends up in a neonatal \nintensive care unit, which ends up costing us hundreds of thousands of \ndollars. So I hope we are going to be able to lift this ban and make it \npossible for States to access Medicaid and CHIP for legal immigrant \nchildren and pregnant women.\n\n  But I could not be more proud that the Senate is voting on expanding \nhealth care to 3.8 million children. There is no debating the \nimportance of this and the way the Senate has come together in order to \nproduce this result.\n  Finally, I am proud to support the bipartisan legislation which we \nhave passed to strengthen our tools against crimes motivated by hate on \nthe basis\n\n[[Page S12221]]\n\nof a victim's race, ethnic background, religion, gender, sexual \norientation, disability, and gender identity. These are crimes not just \nagainst an individual but against a community. What we have done by \nmoving this legislation forward means we are taking a stand on behalf \nof those individuals and communities affected.\n  Hate crimes are an affront to the core values that bind us one to the \nother in our country. We should dedicate the resources needed to \nprosecute these crimes to the fullest extent of the law. I am very \nproud of our country. I think we rightly hold ourselves up as a model \nfor the ideals of equality, tolerance, and mutual understanding. But we \ncannot rest. We have to continue to fight hate-motivated violence in \nAmerica. With today's vote, the Senate is proclaiming loudly that the \nAmerican people will not tolerate crimes motivated by bigotry and \nhatred, that we will punish such crimes and the bigotry they represent.\n  I commend Judy and Dennis Shepherd for their extraordinary dedication \nand leadership when it comes to the prosecution of hate crimes. The \nmurder of their son Matthew was a tragic event for a family, but a \nmotivating cause was created. No parent should ever have to bear what \nthe Shepards have borne, but their grace and their grit in going \nforward is inspirational. The Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement \nHate Crimes Prevention Act is a step toward honoring their son's \nmemory, and honoring everyone who has ever been afflicted by hate-\nmotivated violence and harassment.\n  I commend my colleague Senator Kennedy for his long-time leadership \non this important matter.\n  The Matthew Shepard Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act \ncondemns the abhorrent practice of victimizing people and authorizes \nthe Justice Department to help State and local governments investigate \nand prosecute these appalling offenses. I commend my colleague and \nfriend Senator Hatch.\n  Today is a good day for the Senate. We are doing good work. It may be \nat a glacial pace in the eyes of some of us, but I have faith in our \nsystem and I have the utmost respect for this body. It is an honor to \nbe part of it, especially on a day such as today when we make progress \non behalf of the values America stands for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I remember it so vividly.\n  I remember it as if it were yesterday.\n  But it was 10 years ago that Senator Kennedy and I stood outside this \ngreat building, we stood on the Capitol lawn under a great oak tree, \nand announced final passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program \nlegislation.\n  History was made that day, and it has been made every day since.\n  A true, bipartisan partnership--forged on the strength of good \nintentions, motivated by a simple desire to help our country's most \nvulnerable citizens, and nurtured in a politics-free atmosphere--led to \nenactment of CHIP, arguably the most significant advancement in \nchildren's health in this modern era.\n  Ten years ago, Senator John Chafee and Senator Rockefeller, Senator \nKennedy and I, began a partnership that led to the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. That legislation, enacted in under 5 months--to show \nyou its potency--was founded on a very basic premise: that we needed to \nprovide incentives to States to help them design plans to provide \nhealth insurance to the poorest of the poor families not eligible for \nMedicaid.\n  Senators Rockefeller and Chafee argued for a Medicaid expansion. \nSenator Kennedy and I argued for a State-directed block grant. The \nfinal law was an innovative, workable blend of the two.\n  Since that time, almost 6 million children have become insured under \nCHIP. They are leading healthier, more productive lives.\n  Their parents can sleep at night, resting easy that their children \nwill be taken care of if they become ill.\n  That peace of mind, that giant step toward a healthier population, is \nthe mark of a compassionate, caring Congress. It was a mark toward \nreassuring the American people that the Government hears their concerns \nloud and clear and stands ready to act.\n  Let us hear that same message today and let us provide our \nconstituents with that same measure of reassurance as we consider this \nbipartisan agreement to extend CHIP for another 5 years.\n  This year, as Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, Ranking \nRepublican Chuck Grassley, Subcommittee Chairman Jay Rockefeller, HELP \nCommittee Chairman Kennedy, and I began our discussions of the Child \nHealth Insurance Program Reauthorization Act--or CHIPRA--we agreed \nthere were several key principles that must be embodied in any \nextension of the original act.\n  The bill we consider today is built on those principles.\n  First, we agreed that the proposal must be fully financed or else it \nwould be irresponsible for us to legislate.\n  Next, it must retain the original character of CHIP--that is, it must \nbe a flexible, State-directed program. Senator Kennedy talked about \nthat this morning.\n  We worked to see the budget resolution provide $25 billion in its \nbaseline to extend the current levels of coverage, and up to $50 \nbillion more if it were fully financed.\n  Indeed, this bill is fully financed.\n  The costs above the budget baseline have been certified by Joint Tax \nto be covered by an increase in the tobacco excise tax.\n  We agreed that we wanted to continue coverage for those who are \ncurrently eligible, but also to conduct extensive outreach to enroll \nthose who may be eligible but aren't enrolled.\n  Our bill provides health coverage to almost 4 million low-income, \nuninsured children through incentives to states to enroll these \nuninsured children in their programs.\n  We agreed that coverage of childless adults--a policy Senator Kennedy \nand I never intended nor envisioned when we wrote our original \nproposal--we agreed that policy needed to stop.\n  Under our bill, childless adults currently covered under CHIP will be \nphased out of the program and transitioned into Medicaid.\n  I cannot emphasize this enough. Today, 6 million children receive \nhealth care through the CHIP program--25,095 of these children are from \nUtah.\n  That would not have happened absent congressional action in 1997.\n  In addition, there are an added 6 million children in families with \nincome under 200 percent of the Federal poverty level--or FPL--who are \nuninsured and eligible for either CHIP or Medicaid.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan, \ncompromise bill covers close to 4 million of these children--3.7 \nmillion to be precise--a significant step by any measure. This is a \ncrucial, crucial part of the bill, an achievement that, while \nexpensive, really goes to the heart of what we are trying to achieve \nwith the original CHIP, and now CHIPRA.\n  For several weeks now, we have heard a crescendo of opposition to our \nlegislation from officials at the White House, and most recently, our \nPresident.\n  Needless to say, this is disheartening for me. It is difficult for me \nto be against a man I care for, my own personal President, on such an \nimportant bill. I have been and will continue to be one of the \nPresident's strongest supporters in the Congress. He is a good man. He \nmeans well, but he does have to listen to his staff--or at least does \nlisten to his staff, and I believe he has listened to them in a way \nthat throws barriers up to this bill.\n\n  I wish I had had an opportunity to persuade him on the merits of this \nbill before he issued a veto threat. I did send messages down there, \ntalked to top people in the administration, but I wish I had had a \ngreater opportunity.\n  Indeed, I am sympathetic to many of the concerns he raises.\n  When he says that we need to be careful about creating a one-size-\nfits-all health plan for our children, I believe he is right. When we \nwrote this program in 1997, we wrote it based on the foundation of \ngiving States the flexibility to design their own CHIP programs. Each \nState is different--what is good for Utah may not be good for \nCalifornia or Massachusetts.\n  It is important for States, not the Federal Government, to determine \nwhich benefits should be covered. After\n\n[[Page S12222]]\n\nall, CHIP is a State block grant program, not a Federal entitlement. \nThat is why we are debating its reauthorization today.\n  The President has also raised concerns about the Federal dollars that \nour bill spends on the CHIP program over the next 5 years.\n  I agree that $60 billion is a lot of money. But in comparison to what \nthe House passed bill proposed earlier this year--they started at $100 \nbillion and came down to $75 billion--it is much more reasonable.\n  And, as the Congressional Budget Office has told us, it is relatively \nmore expensive to find and cover the low-income children who still do \nnot have health coverage compared to those who are enrolled today.\n  That is why I was able to agree with the Senate number of $35 \nbillion, in addition to the $25 billion already built in the budget \nbaseline for CHIP--although, to be fair, it is higher than I would have \nliked. But this is a classic compromise and friends in the House wanted \nmore. Some of them.\n  It is unfortunate that the President has chosen to be on what--to \nme--is clearly the wrong side of the issue.\n  Indeed, this is not the bill I would have written if I had full \nlicense to draft. That is true for the original SCHIP law as well.\n  But, it is hard to envision any major law being written by one person \nand enacted without change. That is not how good legislation is made.\n  Indeed, 10 years ago, Senator Kennedy and I spent many, many hours \nproposing, arguing, compromising, and refining, in drafting session \nafter drafting session.\n  Some days it seemed we disagreed more than we agreed.\n  It was hard, hard work.\n  But it was a labor of love.\n  We had a full discussion. We explored all the issues together.\n  We found compromises where we needed to.\n  That is how good legislation is made. Sometimes even bad legislation, \nbut this is good legislation.\n  It pains me that we did not have this full discourse with the \nadministration on CHIPRA.\n  It pains me that some have been slow to recognize the realities of \nthis new Congress.\n  Indeed, what some political pundits termed The Trifecta--a Republican \nHouse, Senate, and Presidency, is no more.\n  I thought I should point out this fact for those in this body who may \nnot have noticed.\n  And so it is no secret, no surprise, that a Democrat-led Congress \nwould seek a more expansive program.\n  Yet it is to the great credit of our Democratic leaders that they \nrecognize our country's fiscal realities and that they held the line at \nthe additional $35 billion figure.\n  To be sure, I would have been comfortable with a lower number, just \nas Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Rangel and Chairman Dingell and Chairman \nBaucus and Chairman Rockefeller advocated for a much higher number.\n  So, again, we have that spirit of compromise which was the hallmark \nof CHIP in 1997.\n  I must say it has also been difficult to conflict with my good friend \nfrom Utah, Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt.\n  He was an expert in health care policy when he was Governor of Utah, \nand he is even more of a leader on the national level now.\n  I know the concerns he expressed to me about the CHIP bill in 1997.\n  I recall our many conversations when he advocated for a greater \nFederal role in health coverage for needy children. And I also recall \nhis admonitions that we could do better by the children and their \nparents if we were to provide the States with much-needed flexibility.\n  The final CHIP block grant reflected that flexibility I believe, and \nMike Leavitt's good counsel helped us improve the law. I hear Secretary \nLeavitt's concerns when he says that he is concerned about paying for \nthe reauthorization of this program through tobacco taxes. I am not \ncomfortable with raising taxes either. However, when we first created \nthe CHIP program in 1997, we believed that it was entirely fitting that \nthe bill be funded through incentives to decrease the use of tobacco, a \nleading killer of Americans young and old. And, therefore, I am \ncomfortable with raising tobacco taxes to pay for our CHIP program.\n  I understand his concerns about crowd-out and higher income children \ndropping their private health coverage in order to be covered through \nCHIP when CHIP was created to provide health care for low-income \nchildren.\n  And I agree with him 100 percent when he says that we are only fixing \npart of the problem by reauthorizing CHIP and not addressing what's \nwrong with the entire health care system.\n  He and I have visited on several occasions on these issues. I have \nbenefited by that guidance, and I sincerely regret that ultimately we \ndisagree on this bill. But I am willing to work with him to try to come \nup with an overall health care plan that will work.\n  I might add that I believe we have had an honest misunderstanding \nwhich has not only been raised by Secretary Leavitt but the President \nas well. They say that our legislation allows families with annual \nincomes of $83,000 to be covered under a State CHIP plan.\n  Let me be clear. Our legislation does not permit a State to cover \nthese families unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services \napproves the State's application to cover individuals at that income \nlevel.\n  We do not change current law and put Congress in charge. We leave \nthat decision in the hands of the Secretary.\n  We do not take away the Secretary's authority to make that decision.\n  I hope that point is clear.\n  At this point, it may be helpful for me to outline for my colleagues \nexactly what this bill does.\n  As I stated earlier, CHIPRA is a 5-year reauthorization which spends \nan additional $35 billion in Federal dollars on the CHIP program, in \naddition to the $25 billion in Federal dollars already built into the \nbudget baseline.\n  So, in total, we are spending $60 billion in Federal dollars over the \nnext 5 years on the CHIP program.\n  And I know that sounds very expensive, especially to my Republican \ncolleagues. In contrast, the bill passed by the House in August would \nhave spent an additional $50 billion on CHIP on top of the $25 billion \nin the budget baseline for a grand total of $75 billion.\n  As this chart indicates, we spend far more Federal money on Federal \nhealth programs then we are suggesting that we spend on the CHIP \nprogram over the next 5 years.\n  This chart compares projected spending in Medicare, Medicaid and the \nNational Institutes of Health to the spending that we authorize for the \nCHIP program from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2012.\n  For the Medicare Program, CBO projects that the Federal Government \nwill spend $2.6 trillion, yes, trillion dollars over the next 5 years.\n  For the Medicaid Program, CBO projects that the Federal Government \nwill spend $1.22 trillion over the next 5 years.\n  For the NIH, we project that the Federal Government will spend \napproximately $150 billion over the next 5 years.\n  In contrast, our bill authorizes $60 billion over the next 5 years. I \nthink these numbers speak for themselves. We can spend billions, even \ntrillions of dollars on programs for the elderly, disabled, very poor \nand for medical research but spending $60 billion to provide health \ncare for the children of the working poor causes the President to issue \na veto threat? Something here just doesn't add up, especially when you \nlook at these numbers on this chart. The spending for the CHIP program \nhardly shows up on this chart compared to the other three programs.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that this legislation is built on \ncompromise.\n  Is it perfect?\n  Far from it.\n  But does it cover more CHIP-eligible kids, our ultimate goal? \nAbsolutely.\n  And that's why I am a strong advocate for this bill and urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  This is a good compromise.\n  It is a $35 billion bill--not a $50 billion bill. The House \nultimately agreed with the Senate on this issue. I do not blame them. \nThey are very sincere in thinking you can just throw money at these \nthings and you will do more good.\n  It does not include Medicare provisions. The House also dropped its \ninsistence on this issue, even though\n\n[[Page S12223]]\n\nthere was tremendous pressure to include Medicare provisions such as a \nfix for the sustainable growth rate formula flaw, which is the \nphysician reimbursement rate, in 2008.\n  But let me be clear, all of us agree that these important Medicare \nissues must be addressed by the end of this year. Just not in this \nbill.\n  Before I continue, I would like to note that both the $35 billion \nlimit and agreement not to include Medicare provisions were huge \nconcessions by the House of Representatives.\n  Honestly, I never thought that the House leadership would agree to \nthose terms; and, trust me, those were the two conditions that were \nnonnegotiable as far as I was concerned.\n  The moderation on the part of House leaders is a true indication that \nthey are serious about getting a bipartisan CHIP reauthorization bill \nsigned into law.\n  Key provisions of this legislation are the tools and resources it \nprovides to enroll more of the CHIP-eligible children. As I previously \nstated, in addition to the 6 million children already covered by CHIP, \nthis bipartisan compromise bill would provide coverage to almost 4 \nmillion more uninsured, low-income children.\n  The bill no longer allows new State waivers for adults to receive \ntheir health care through CHIP. Childless adults will be phased out of \nCHIP and will be covered through Medicaid.\n  States that currently cover parents may continue to do so; but after \na transition period, States will no longer receive the enhanced CHIP \nmatch rate for covering parents.\n  The legislation rewards States for covering more low-income children \nby establishing a CHIP performance bonus payment for States that exceed \ntheir child enrollment targets.\n  We worked hard to make certain there will be no funding shortfalls \nwith this legislation.\n  The bill provides States adequate money in their CHIP allotments so \nthey will not experience funding shortfalls in their CHIP program.\n  As a safeguard, we created a Child enrollment contingency fund for \nStates that experience a funding shortfall as a result of enrolling \nmore low-income children.\n  Shortfalls have been a serious problem. They are something we want to \navoid.\n  In addition, the proposal clarifies that States will only have 2 \nyears to spend their CHIP allotments. Today, States have 3 years to \nspend their CHIP allotments.\n  It gives States a new option to provide coverage to pregnant women. \nToday, pregnant women are only covered in CHIP if the State has been \ngranted a waiver to cover pregnant women or through the \nAdministration's unborn child policy.\n  This is a proposal Senator Kennedy and I seriously considered \nincluding in 1997. We ultimately concluded that the cost of childbirth \nhospitalization was so expensive, then, about $4,000 a birth, that the \ngreater public good could be achieved if we focused those resources on \nproviding more insurance policies to needy children.\n  It was not a policy we undertook with great comfort. Indeed, Senator \nKennedy argued strongly for coverage of pregnant women. But ultimately, \nwe chose to advocate for the policy that covered the most children.\n  Today, we are both satisfied that the bill embodies the correct \npolicy, if I may speak for the Senator from Massachusetts on this \npoint.\n  CHIPRA provides beneficiaries and their families with coverage \nchoices. If the State provides premium assistance through its CHIP \nprogram, CHIP beneficiaries may choose to be covered through the State \nCHIP program or receive premium assistance to receive health care \nthrough a private health plan. And States like Utah that already have \npremium assistance programs for their CHIP beneficiaries would have \ntheir programs grandfathered in, in other words, their programs would \ncontinue to exist.\n  It also provides CHIP beneficiaries with dental benefits, states will \nhave a choice of four dental benchmark plans to provide to their CHIP \nbeneficiaries, the dental benefits included in the House-passed bill; a \nbenefit package equivalent to the federal employee health plan dental \nbenefit that covers the most children; a benefit package equivalent to \nthe State employee dental plan that covers the most children; or a \nbenefit package equivalent to the most popular commercial dental plan \nthat covers the most children.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I have a long record of advocating for \nbetter dental care for children. It alleviates so many health problems \nin the future.\n  In fact, in 2000, I introduced the Early Childhood Oral Health \nImprovement Act, which created grant programs to improve the oral \nhealth of children under 6 years of age. This bill was included in the \nChildren's Health Act which was signed into law on October 17, 2000.\n  So, I know how important dental health is for children.\n  At the same time, it is fair to say that I have been concerned about \nmandating that States provide dental coverage for two basic reasons.\n  First, the inherent nature of CHIP, and a primary reason it could be \nenacted in a Republican-led Congress, is that it was a State block \ngrant.\n  Mandates move us away from that important framework.\n  Second, the dental coverage that some advocated be included in this \nbill is more generous than most private-sector policies. Thus, \nincluding such coverage would be a giant incentive for crowd-out, that \nis, dropping private coverage in order to seek a more generous public \ncoverage.\n  Ten years ago we called it substitution. Today, we call it crowd out. \nBut it is the same thing.\n  I will not sugar coat it. It is a problem. It is a concern. And, we \nshould take every step we can to keep it from occurring.\n  I think the dental policy we adopted was a good compromise, and I \nappreciate my colleagues agreeing to my suggestion for this coverage.\n  Our legislation also limits the Federal matching rate that States \nwill receive for covering individuals with family incomes over 300 \npercent of FPL in their CHIP plans.\n  It clarifies the Administration's policy on crowd-out and provides \nStates with guidance on how to ensure that their low-income children \nare covered through the CHIP plan before expanding coverage to higher \nincome children.\n  Another key element of this bill is that it provides States with \nfunds for outreach and enrollment.\n  It gives States a time-limited option to speed up enrollment in CHIP \nand Medicaid by using eligibility information from designated express \nlane agencies.\n  The bill gives States the option of verifying citizenship for both \nMedicaid and CHIP by submitting names and Social Security numbers to \nthe Commissioner of Social Security.\n  It creates a new quality initiative through the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, in consultation with the States, to develop \nevidence-based pediatric quality measures in order to evaluate the \nquality of care for children.\n  I introduced legislation to develop pediatric quality measures with \nSenators Bayh and Lincoln and much of our bill is incorporated in this \nbipartisan compromise legislation.\n  The proposal includes mental health parity in the state CHIP programs \nso that if a State offers mental health coverage in its CHIP plan, it \nmust be on par with limits for medical and surgical services.\n  Senator Gordon Smith has done a stellar job bringing awareness about \nthe need for mental health benefits for children and this provision is \nmodeled after legislation that he introduced with Senator John Kerry of \nMassachusetts.\n  At this point, I would also like to refute some of the inaccurate \nstatements that I have heard the last few days regarding our bill.\n  First, some have alleged that our bill allows the Federal Government \nto continue covering childless adults and parents through CHIP.\n  Our bill puts the emphasis back on low-income, uninsured children. \nSimply put, our bill puts an immediate stop to States being granted \nfuture waivers to cover nonpregnant adults. In fact, the provisions \nincluded in the Senate-passed CHIP bill were included in the \ncompromise, bipartisan CHIP bill.\n  At the beginning of fiscal year 2009, States will receive lower \nFederal matching rates for childless adults and\n\n[[Page S12224]]\n\nin fiscal year 2010, childless adults will not be covered under CHIP, \nthey will be transitioned into Medicaid.\n  At the beginning of fiscal year 2010, only States with significant \noutreach efforts for low-income uninsured children will receive \nenhanced match rates for parents; others will receive the lower \nMedicaid match rate FMAP for adults.\n  Starting in fiscal year 2011, all States will receive a lower Federal \nmatch rate for parents. Those States covering more lower income kids or \nwith significant outreach efforts will receive a Federal matching rate \nfor parents covered under CHIP which is a midpoint between the Federal \nCHIP matching rate and the lower Medicaid matching rate. Other States \nwill receive the lower Medicaid Federal matching rate, known as FMAP, \nfor CHIP parents. Simply put, beginning in fiscal year 2011, States \nwill no longer receive the higher CHIP matching rate for covering \nparents.\n  Second, some criticize our bill and say it allows higher income \nchildren to be covered under the CHIP program.\n  Today, States may receive an enhanced Federal matching rate for their \nCHIP program through waivers for all income levels. Our bill \ndiscourages States from covering higher income individuals in the CHIP \nprogram.\n  After enactment of our bill, States with new waivers approved to \ncover those with family incomes over 300 percent of FPL would only \nreceive the lower FMAP payment for these higher income individuals.\n  In addition, States that cover individuals with incomes over 300 \npercent of FPL in their CHIP plans will have to submit a State plan to \nthe HHS Secretary to show how it is addressing crowd-out for higher \nincome children covered under CHIP.\n  The State plan must be approved by the HHS Secretary before October \n1, 2010; otherwise, the State will no longer receive Federal matching \ndollars for covering those over 300 percent of FPL in their CHIP plans.\n  Third, some say our bill makes CHIP an entitlement program and almost \ndoubles the Federal dollars spent on CHIP over the last 10 years.\n  CHIP is not an entitlement program, it is a capped, block grant \nprogram, where States are given flexibility to cover their low-income, \nuninsured children.\n  I admit that it works so well, nobody wants to abolish it, including \nthe President and most everyone in this body. As to its cost, as I \nnoted earlier, the 6 million children who are already covered by CHIP \nwere easier to find that the current 6 million, low-income, uninsured \nchildren under 200 percent of FPL.\n  CBO has explained it is much more expensive to find these uncovered \nchildren. That is why our bill gives States bonus payments for \nenrolling them. I hope their prediction does not prove true. If it \ndoesn't, we will save money in the program. But if their prediction \ndoes prove true, there is still no excuse for enrolling these kids.\n  I also believe it is important to note that, according to the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, in 2005, we spent a total $1.98 \ntrillion on our Nation's health care system.\n  Private expenditures were $1.08 trillion and Federal spending was \n$900 billion.\n\n  Total Medicare spending was $342 billion in 2005 and Medicaid was \n$177 billion in Federal dollars.\n  Our bill today funds CHIP at $60 billion over five years--a fraction \nof the cost to provide care for low-income, uninsured children. \nCovering these children is worth every cent.\n  Another common criticism is the myth that our bill allows States to \ncover children from families with annual incomes of $83,000.\n  I have addressed this before, but it bears repeating.\n  Our bill neither prevents, nor requires, States' coverage of families \nat higher income levels. Only the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices decides whether a State may cover families with incomes up to \n$83,000 per year under their State CHIP program, not Congress.\n  Many have suggested, in error, that our bill allows illegal \nimmigrants to be covered under CHIP.\n  In fact, during the House debate, I heard some state incorrectly that \nour bill provides benefits to illegal immigrants and opens the door for \nCHIP and Medicaid benefits for illegal immigrants by substantially \nweakening a requirement that persons applying for such services show \nproof of citizenship.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  In fact, our legislation has specific language stating that no \nillegal immigrants will be covered under CHIP.\n  For those who still don't believe me, it can be found under section \n605, entitled No Federal Funding for Illegal Aliens.\n  Let me just read what it says: ``Nothing in this Act allows Federal \npayment for individuals who are not legal residents.''\n  Finally, much has been said about the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services' recent guidance on crowd out.\n  I will include for the Record a letter dated August 17, 2007, to the \nState Medicaid Directors from Dennis Smith, the director of the Center \nfor Medicaid and State Operations for CMS.\n  The purpose of this letter was to give the State Medicaid Directors \nguidance on how CMS will review state plan amendments or waivers to \nraise income eligibility limits under the CHIP program in the future.\n  In this letter, CMS made it perfectly clear that the agency was very \nconcerned about crowd-out and wanted States to target low-income, \nuninsured children under 200 percent of poverty before covering higher \nincome children under CHIP.\n  So in order for States to cover higher income children, CMS made it \nclear that States must cover 95 percent of their children under 200 \npercent of poverty before expanding coverage to higher income children.\n  While I agree with the thrust of what the administration intended to \nachieve, I am not certain what Mr. Smith asks the States to do can be \nachieved.\n  States have told us it is virtually impossible for them to determine \nhow many of those low-income children are currently covered.\n  Currently, good, solid data on the uninsured simply do not exist. So \nit is almost impossible to find good, solid numbers on the uninsured. \nOn top of that, currently, States do not have to report income data to \nCMS.\n  Therefore, we knew that it would be impossible for States to \ndetermine how many low-income, uninsured children live in their States \nand whether or not those children were receiving health coverage.\n  We heard the States and we addressed their valid concerns in the bill \nby requiring that two studies will be conducted to study crowdout and \nfigure out what States are doing to successfully cover low-income, \nuninsured children. Once the data are available, States covering \nindividuals over 300 percent of poverty in their CHIP plans must submit \nto the HHS Secretary their plans for covering low-income children and \nreducing crowdout. If its plan is not approved by a certain date, a \nstate would no longer receive CHIP money for covering those over 300 \npercent FPL with limited exception. To me, that sends a very clear \nmessage to all 50 States about the intention of the CHIP program--to \ncover low-income, uninsured children.\n  Let me conclude by emphasizing to my colleagues that passing this \nlegislation is the right thing to do.\n  When we first wrote CHIP in 1997, our goal was to cover the several \nmillion children who had no health insurance coverage. These children \nwere in a no-win situation--their family incomes were too high to \nqualify for Medicaid, but their families did not have enough money to \npurchase private health insurance.\n  When Senator Kennedy, Senator Chafee, Senator Rockefeller and I \nworked on the original legislation in 1997, our goal was to cover the \nseveral million children who had no health insurance.\n  Coverage of these uninsured children is still our top priority, and I \nbelieve our bipartisan CHIP bill will make a dramatic difference by \ncovering almost 4 million additional low-income children.\n  The bill we are considering is very similar to the Senate-passed CHIP \nbill and captures the true essence of the 1997 law.\n  It is the true essence of bipartisan compromise.\n  To be fair, it does not make any of us Republicans comfortable to \nface a veto threat from our President.\n\n[[Page S12225]]\n\n  It does not make me comfortable to face a veto threat issued by my \ncolleague and good friend from Utah, Secretary Leavitt.\n  However, as Senator Kennedy and I have been fond of saying to each \nother over the years, if neither side is totally comfortable, we must \nhave done a good job.\n  This is a good bill. It accomplishes what we have set out to do--to \ncover low-income children without health coverage.\n  Yes, I admit, it is expensive. However, this is necessary spending \nwhen I think of the 6 million American children who are leading \nhealthier lives because of our vision and commitment.\n  And when I compare $60 billion to the trillions of dollars our \nGovernment will spend on health care, I believe it is a worthwhile \nbenefit.\n  We should not let the opportunity pass us by to build on that solid \nfoundation and do even better for the children, our future.\n  I will add one more point that I want my Republican colleagues to \ntake to heart. This is a bipartisan compromise bill. It is not the \nHouse-passed CHIP bill that would spend $75 billion over the next 5 \nyears on CHIP.\n  In my opinion, the $50 billion CHIP legislation before the Senate is \nthe better deal for the low-income children and the American people. It \nis my hope that my colleagues who disagree with me will take one more \nlook at this legislation.\n  On the House side, I would like to recognize the hard work of my \nHouse colleagues: Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell; \nHouse Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee Chairman Frank Pallone; \nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charlie Rangel; House Committee \non Oversight and Reform Chairman Henry Waxman; and of course, the \nSpeaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.\n  I also want to commend my Utah Governor, Jon Huntsman, Jr., for his \ncontinued support of legislation to reauthorize the CHIP program. In \nApril, Governor Huntsman presented me with a proclamation expressing \nhis and the Utah State Legislature's strong support for the CHIP \nprogram, which I greatly appreciated. In fact, Governor Huntsman and \nhis staff have provided me with invaluable advice throughout this \nprocess. Utah's program, which covers 25,095 children, provides well-\nchild exams; immunizations; doctor visits; hospital and emergency care; \nprescriptions; hearing and eye exams; mental health services; and \ndental care.\n  Finally, I must commend my good friends and colleagues from the \nSenate: Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus; Ranking Republican \nMember Chuck Grassley; Finance Health Subcommittee Chairman Jay \nRockefeller; and the Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n  I would also like to mention all of the staff who put many hours into \nthis bill and gave up time with their families to work on this bill--\nPattie DeLoatche, Patricia Knight, Karen LaMontagne, Peter Carr, Jared \nWhitley, Hanns Kuttner, Becky Shipp, Rodney Whitlock, Mark Hayes, Alice \nWeiss, Michelle Easton, David Schwartz, Jocelyn Moore, Ellen Doneski, \nRuth Ernst, Kate Leone, Bridgett Taylor, Amy Hall, Bobby Clark, Karen \nNelson, Andy Schneider, Wendell Primus, Ed Grossman and Jessica \nShapiro.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't mention some of the staff who laid the \ngroundwork on the original CHIP law in 1997, particularly Patricia \nKnight, Rob Foreman, Bruce Artim, Nick Littlefield, David Nexon, Laurie \nRubiner, Lisa Layman, Michael Iskowitz, Cybele Bjorklund and Mary Ella \nPayne.\n  Mr. President, I remember so vividly 10 years ago when Senator \nKennedy and I stood on this floor to argue for enactment of SCHIP. We \nhad two posters.\n  We had one of a little boy named Joey.\n  And we had one of Joe Camel, the mascot for one manufacturer of \ncigarettes.\n  We asked our colleagues, whom do you support? Joe Camel or Joey?\n  It is somewhat ironic, even amazing, or even more--a reflection of \nhistory repeating itself--that I stand here today to pose the same \nquestion to my colleagues.\n  Whom do you support: Joe Camel or Joey?\n  Joey? He's now almost 20.\n  The Camel? Haven't seen him for a while, have we?\n  So, we are making progress.\n  But there is much to do.\n  This bill represents the congressional commitment to one of the most \nimportant goals we can strive for: a healthy population.\n  We must start with the kids, and that is what H.R. 976 does.\n  I would like to close by reading an excerpt from a letter written by \nKaren Henage, the parent of children are covered by the Utah CHIP \nprogram. Kim Henage writes, ``I firmly believe the CHIP Program gave \nour family the financial assistance and more so the emotional security \n(peace of mind) to survive our new start, so that we were able to make \nit make it through. We are a success story because of this assistance. \nI cannot express in mere words how much this meant to us. When we \nneeded it, it was there for us. I wholeheartedly request your support \nof the continuation of this valuable program, that other families might \nsurvive as we did.''\n  I think Kim's letter says it all--we must pass this bill today so \nmore families without health insurance will be able to become a CHIP \nsuccess story like the Henages.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced letter from CMS \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Health &\n\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                                   Baltimore, MD, August 17, 2007.\n\n       Dear State Health Official: This letter clarifies how the \n     Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) applies \n     existing statutory and regulatory requirements in reviewing \n     State requests to extend eligibility under the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to children in \n     families with effective family income levels above 250 \n     percent of the Federal poverty level (FPL). These \n     requirements ensure that extension of eligibility to children \n     at these higher effective income levels do not interfere with \n     the effective and efficient provision of child health \n     assistance coordinated with other sources of health benefits \n     coverage to the core SCHIP population of uninsured targeted \n     low income children.\n       Section 2101(a) of the Social Security Act describes the \n     purpose of the SCHIP statute ``to initiate and expand the \n     provision of child health assistance to uninsured, low-income \n     children in an effective and efficient manner that is \n     coordinated with other sources of health benefits coverage.'' \n     Section 2102(b)(3)(C) of the Act, and implementing \n     regulations at 42 CFR Part 457, Subpart H, require that State \n     child health plans include procedures to ensure that SCHIP \n     coverage does not substitute for coverage under group health \n     plans (known as ``crowd-out'' procedures). In addition \n     section 2102(c) of the Act requires that State child health \n     plans include procedures for outreach and coordination with \n     other public and private health insurance programs.\n       Existing regulations at 42 CFR. 457.805 provide that States \n     must have ``reasonable procedures'' to prevent substitution \n     of public SCHIP coverage for private coverage. In issuing \n     these regulations, CMS indicated that, for States that expand \n     eligibility above an effective level of 250 percent of the \n     FPL, these reasonable crowd-out procedures would include \n     identifying specific strategies to prevent substitution. Over \n     time, States have adopted one or more of the following five \n     crowd-out strategies: Imposing waiting periods between \n     dropping private coverage and enrollment; imposing cost \n     sharing in approximation to the cost of private coverage; \n     monitoring health insurance status at time of application; \n     verifying family insurance status through insurance \n     databases; and/or preventing employers from changing \n     dependent coverage policies that would favor a shift to \n     public coverage.\n       As CMS has developed more experience and information from \n     the operation of SCHIP programs, it has become clear that the \n     potential for crowd-out is greater for higher income \n     beneficiaries. Therefore, we are clarifying that the \n     reasonable procedures adopted by States to prevent crowd-out \n     pursuant to 42 CFR. 457.805 should include the above five \n     general crowd-out strategies with certain important \n     components. As a result, we will expect that, for States that \n     expand eligibility above an effective level of 250 percent of \n     the FPL, the specific crowd-out strategies identified in the \n     State child health plan to include all five of the above \n     crowd-out strategies, which incorporate the following \n     components as part of those strategies: The cost sharing \n     requirement under the State plan compared to the cost \n     sharing required by competing private plans must not be \n     more favorable to the public plan by more than one percent \n     of the family income, unless the public plan's cost \n     sharing is set at the five percent family cap; the State \n     must establish a minimum of a one year period of\n\n[[Page S12226]]\n\n     uninsurance for individuals prior to receiving coverage; \n     and monitoring and verification must include information \n     regarding coverage provided by a noncustodial parent.\n       In addition, to ensure that expansion to higher income \n     populations does not interfere with the effective and \n     efficient provision of child health assistance coordinated \n     with other sources of health benefits coverage, and to \n     prevent substitution of SCHIP coverage for coverage under \n     group health plans, we will ask for such a State to make the \n     following assurances: Assurance that the State has enrolled \n     at least 95 percent of the children in the State below 200 \n     percent of the FPL who are eligible for either SCHIP or \n     Medicaid (including a description of the steps the State \n     takes to enroll these eligible children); assurance that the \n     number of children in the target population insured through \n     private employers has not decreased by more than two \n     percentage points over the prior five year period; and \n     assurance that the State is current with all reporting \n     requirements in SCHIP and Medicaid and reports on a monthly \n     basis data relating to the crowd-out requirements.\n       We will continue to review all State monitoring plans, \n     including those States whose upper eligibility levels are \n     below an effective level of 250 percent of the FPL, to \n     determine whether the monitoring plans are being followed and \n     whether the crowd-out procedures specified in the SCHIP state \n     plans are reasonable and effective in preventing crowd-out.\n       CMS will apply this review strategy to SCHIP state plans \n     and section 1115 demonstration waivers that include SCHIP \n     populations, and will work with States that currently provide \n     services to children with effective family incomes over 250 \n     percent of the FPL. We expect affected States to amend their \n     SCHIP state plan (or 1115 demonstration) in accordance with \n     this review strategy within 12 months, or CMS may pursue \n     corrective action. We would not expect any effect on current \n     enrollees from this review strategy, and anticipate that the \n     entire program will be strengthened by the focus on effective \n     and efficient operation of the program for the core uninsured \n     targeted low-income population. We appreciate your efforts \n     and share your goal of providing health care to low-income, \n     uninsured children through title XXI.\n       If you have questions regarding this guidance, please \n     contact Ms. Jean Sheil, Director, Family and Children's \n     Health Programs.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Dennis G. Smith,\n\n                                     Director, Center for Medicaid\n                                             and State Operations.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Utah for his \nremarks today, for his work on this bill, his work many months ago when \nthis work began in the Senate, and for his leadership 10 years ago in \n1997, when at that time, as today, we had bipartisan agreement on \nchildren's health insurance. I commend him and his colleague, Senator \nGrassley.\n  On the Democratic side we have a lot of great leaders: Senator Jay \nRockefeller and Senator Max Baucus, working mightily with Senator \nKennedy and so many others to get this done. We still have a long way \nto go. We know we had a resounding 69 votes in the Senate today, but we \nstill have one impediment to getting this done. That impediment is the \nPresident of the United States.\n  I want to talk about some numbers today, but I want to focus \ninitially on the benefits of this program. We are going to continue to \nhave debates within this body and with the President about this issue. \nI will get to that. But let's step back for a minute and think about \nwhat this program means to one single child or what it means to one \nsingle family. Here is what it means. I come from Pennsylvania. We have \nsome big cities in Pennsylvania: obviously, Pittsburgh and \nPhiladelphia. But what if this child is born in a rural area. I come \nfrom a State where a huge percentage of our population is, in \nstatistical categories, considered rural. The breadth of Pennsylvania, \nright through the middle of the State, out toward western Pennsylvania, \nwe have a lot of people who live in rural areas. We know the benefits \nof this program help a lot of our children in cities and towns and also \nin rural areas. In fact, one-third of rural children get their health \ncare from Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  We also know a lot of African-American and Latino children have \nbenefited tremendously in the 10 years this has been part of our law. \nLet's think about those children. No matter where they live, let's \nthink about what this means to them. It means they can get well-child \nvisits to the doctor during a year. The experts tell us you need at \nleast six of those in your first year of life to be healthy. We ought \nto make sure every child in America can have six well-child visits in a \nyear, but millions don't get that.\n  What happens to that child? That child would not grow. Their brains \nand cognitive development would not proceed as it should. They can't \nlearn as fast. They can't read as quickly. They don't do as well in \nschool. Down the road when they become part of the workforce, they have \nbeen shortchanged, if we don't do our job. It also means immunizations \nin the dawn of their lives and all of the preventative care a child \nshould receive.\n  We should be doing everything we can in this body, not just with \nchildren's health insurance but with early learning opportunities and \nother programs we have to help our children to do a number of things, \nbut principally to make sure children are healthy enough to learn. We \nknow if they learn more in the dawn of their lives, they will earn more \ndown the road. We have to make those investments. I don't see this as \njust a program, something that we are giving to people.\n  That is not what it is. The distinguished Senator from Utah said a \ncouple moments ago, this is a capped block grant program and a good \ninvestment in that child and his or her future. But it is also an \ninvestment in our economic future. We can do a lot with this program to \nhelp families. But let's think about a mother. What does every mother \nwant for their child, especially when they are very young? They want to \nnurture the child. They want to make sure the child has some kind of \nhealth care, has nutrition, and they want to shower that child with all \nthe love and care a mother can provide.\n  One of the benefits to reauthorizing this program and getting the job \ndone is that we can help a mother as she is trying to provide \neverything she can for her child, whether she lives in a farming \ncommunity in central Pennsylvania or whether she lives in one of our \ntowns in Pennsylvania or across the country or whether she lives in the \ninner city. Make no mistake, this comes down to a very simple \nquestion--maybe a couple, but one basic question--which is, does the \nPresident want to cover 10 million American children? There is only one \nanswer to that question, only one answer we can justify. There is only \none answer for which we can go back to our States and say we did the \nright thing. That answer is, absolutely, the President should want to \ncover 10 million American children because if he vetoes this and his \npoint of view prevails, 10 million children will not have health \ninsurance. By signing this legislation we are about to send to him, he \ncan make sure 10 million American children have health insurance.\n  What upsets me about the President--I have been very critical of him, \nand I will continue to be so when it is warranted--is not just his \nposition on this issue, not just his threat of a veto--that is bad \nenough. What upsets me and a lot of Americans, frankly, is the \nPresident had month after month after month to come to the Congress and \nsay: I think we should have a $5 billion increase over 5 years. That is \nwhat he says. There is an overwhelming consensus now in the Congress \nthat it should be a $35 billion increase. When you consider it over 5 \nyears, that is only a billion a year. We spend $7 billion a year on a \nlot of things. But let's consider what he said. If he was going to take \nthat position all those months ago, why didn't he come to the Congress? \nIf health care for children is such a priority, why didn't he come to \nthe Congress and say: We are far apart. The Congress is at $35 billion, \nand I am at $5 billion. We will work together.\n  He didn't do that. He just laid down his number and then he began, \nfrankly, to misrepresent the facts. That has made this argument an \nunfortunate episode in the debate.\n  I have another question for the President. The question about 10 \nmillion children is very important, but I have a question for the \nPresident. What is the choice you are making? You are saying on the one \nhand, Mr. President, that 10 million American children should not have \nhealth insurance at the same time that in 2000 we will give away $100 \nbillion to wealthy Americans. Is that right? I don't think so. That is \nimmoral in my judgment, to give $100 billion to wealthy Americans\n\n[[Page S12227]]\n\nand say children who could benefit from this program, 4 million more, \nthat they don't get health insurance.\n  It is equally immoral when the President of the United States and \nevery Senator and every House Member gets their health insurance paid \nfor. Yet some people say: No, we are going to wait on those children. \nThose 4 million children will have to wait, even though every Senator \ngets health care and this President gets health care every day of the \nweek. I think that is immoral. He should recognize that.\n  This is about numbers and budgets and a program. We will talk about \nthat a lot. That is important. I can justify every one of those \nnumbers. OK. I know a lot about cutting out waste and fraud. I did that \nfor 10 years in State government. I know that subject very well.\n\n  But this is a program that works. We have had a 10-year experiment \nwith it, and it works, and everyone here knows that. It works very well \nto make sure we cover our children. All these other arguments about why \nwe should not do it comes down to politics. The people who are \nsupporting the President on this should answer the questions I posed.\n  Why shouldn't 10 million children get health care? Why do you get \nhealth care in the Senate and those children do not get health care, \naccording to your point of view? They should answer that question when \nthey are supporting this President. Why should every Member of the \nSenate get health care and these 4 million children--plus the 6.5 \nmillion or so we can cover--why shouldn't they get health care? Why \nshould millionaires and multimillionaires and billionaires get tax cuts \nin 2008 and 2009 and on into the future and these children should not \nhave health insurance?\n  So when you come to the floor to talk about this program, and when \nthe President goes on television and preaches to us about why we should \nnot do that, I hope you would be honest enough--I hope the President \nand every Member of this body would have the integrity to stand up and \njustify why 10 million kids should not have health insurance, why they, \nas a Member of the Senate, should have their health care paid for, and \nwhy all those wealthy Americans should get their tax cut--tens of \nbillions this year--and these kids should not have health insurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the leaders of this bill for the \ntime to speak.\n  I am kind of flabbergasted at the last talk. I am one of the \nphysicians in this country who has cared for kids on Medicaid. I have \nactually delivered over 2,000 babies on Medicaid. I have actually done \nwell-child exams.\n  We have the Senate lecturing the President, and we should be \nlecturing ourselves. The debate on this bill is not about children. \nThere is not anybody in the Senate who does not want to cover and \ncontinue the present SCHIP.\n  What this debate is about is how do we move toward national health \ncare. That is what this debate is. So immoral? Is it immoral to spend \n$3,000 to buy $1,500 worth of care, like we are going to do in this \nbill? Is it immoral for the Senate to say it only costs $35 billion and \nthen totally take a program that is costing $12 billion a year 5 years \nfrom now and cut it down to $700 million and say we met the budget \nrules, when in fact we did not? That is immoral. What about the \nchildren who are going to pay for the deficit associated with this \nbill?\n  I have actually cared for these kids. My practice has been a \nMedicaid-based practice and a SCHIP-based practice. The holier-than-\nthou attitude that if you oppose this bill, you do not care about \nchildren is completely disrespectful to those of us who happen to \ndisagree, who maybe think a better way to cover children would be the \nBurr-Corker bill, which gives a tax credit to every kid in this country \nthat covers enough to give them insurance and takes that Medicaid stamp \noff their head, since only 40 percent of the doctors in this country \nwill cover SCHIP kids and Medicaid kids.\n  So the debate is not about the President being immoral. It is not \nabout tax cuts. The real immoral fact of this bill is we are winking \nand nodding again to the American people that we are going to spend \n$121 billion over the next 10 years--not $60 billion over the next 5 \nyears--$121 billion, and we have no way to pay for that. We had a $444 \nbillion deficit last year. We could have paid for the war and decreased \nthe deficit if this body would have had the courage to eliminate \nduplicative and fraudulent programs. There is no holier-than-thou \nattitude to go after those programs because they have an interest. As \npoliticians, we do not want to upset anybody.\n  So it is easy--the greatest pleasure in the world is to spend \nsomebody else's money and to claim it is in the name of children. I \nhave been on the ground with children. I have taken care of the poorest \nof the poor. We have a pregnancy component in this bill. Title 19 now \nis at 300 percent of the poverty level in this country. We have people \ndropping their insurance to qualify for title 19. We do not need \npregnancy covered in the SCHIP bill. It is already covered. But we \nclaim that to rationalize to make the bill better.\n  I have no disrespect for people in this body who claim they want \nnational health care, government-run national health care. Well, \nAmerican public--guess what--if you think health care is expensive now, \nwait till it is free. Wait till it is free. That is exactly what we are \ndoing with this bill.\n  We can reauthorize SCHIP, and we can make it higher than a $5 billion \nincrease to truly cover those kids who need it. This body rejected an \ninsurance contribution component amendment I offered that would \nactually expand further the number of kids.\n\n  The other point that is not being made is, for every kid you cover \nwho does not have health insurance today, you are going to drop another \nkid from health insurance that is being paid for by their parents, and \nthey are getting no benefit in terms of a reduction of their health \ninsurance. So what we are doing is shifting taxes to those same parents \nto pay for a program, twice as much money for the benefit we will get \nfor the kids.\n  I am not against well-child exams. I am not against immunizations. I \ngive them out of my pocket of my own practice now for free. They cost \nme an average of $146 a kid.\n  The claim of superiority that somehow if you do not want to have this \nbill you do not care for children is gobbledygook. What about the kids \nin the future who are going to pay for the mistakes we are making? What \nabout the kids who are born today who owe $400,000 on our unfunded \nliabilities? We have done that. If we care so much about kids, why \naren't we fixing that problem? They are never going to get a college \neducation or own a home, and they are never going to have health \ncoverage because we will have bankrupt this country by the way we do \nnot control how we spend money.\n  So to be lectured and lecturing the President because, finally, he is \nexhibiting some fiscal responsibility into the future, and us to play \ngames on the true cost of this program, that is what is immoral. It is \nnot the President being immoral. The fact is it is not our money, it is \nthe money of the people of this country, and we are going to decide we \nare going to spend money and not tell them what it is really going to \ncost because that is what this bill does in the outyears, the 6th \nthrough the 11th year of this bill if we cut this program to $700 \nmillion a year.\n  Now, nobody in their right mind will honestly say we are going to let \nthat happen. So if we are not going to let that happen, how about being \nhonest with the American people about the true cost of what we are \ndoing? It is $121 billion. It is not $60 billion. Even the staff admits \nthat. Both the Democratic and Republican staff admit that.\n  For us to sit up here and claim it is only a $35 billion increase--\nwell, only a $35 billion increase is a 120-percent increase in the \nprogram, just a 120-percent increase in the program.\n  We ought to have a debate about national health care and how we solve \nthe problems of health care in this country. There is a way to solve \nit. It is to make sure everybody in this country has access and give \nthem the freedom and the power to choose what is best for them rather \nthan us tell them what they have to have. That is the debate we ought \nto have.\n  This is a farce. This debate is a farce. It is a farce about saying \nwe want to\n\n[[Page S12228]]\n\ncover more children, when we are really taking children who are already \ncovered and putting them under a government program and then charging \nthose children's kids for the cost of the program. That is what we are \ndoing. It is not about caring for kids. It is about lying to the \nAmerican public about what this program does.\n  So I do not have any hard feelings about the fact that people want to \nhave national health care and a government-run program, but let's have \nthe debate about what it really is and not have a debate demeaning the \nPresident when he finally stands up and says we have an obligation, for \nthe next few generations, to start doing it right, and finally he is \nstarting to do it right. And now we are saying he is immoral. Of the 10 \nmillion kids, 5 million already have coverage. We are going to ask the \nAmerican taxpayer--in spite of what we are doing, in spite of the fact \nwe borrowed $434 billion--we are going to load that on them.\n  They already have coverage. They already have immunization. They \nalready have well-child care, and we are going to add that cost to the \nAmerican taxpayer. Do you know who that taxpayer is? That is that \nchild's child because we are not going to pay for it. We are going to \nrefuse to be responsible. We played the game of pay-go on this, the \ngreat pay-go rule, where we now bastardize our own ethics to say we \npaid for something, knowing we did not. Because nobody in this body \nbelieves this is going to go to $700 million 5 years from now. Nobody \nbelieves that. Everybody knows that. So everybody knows we are telling \nan untruth to the American people about the true cost of this program.\n  I care a ton about my patients. But I also care enough about this \ncountry to be able to speak the truth about what we are doing. And what \nwe are doing is absolutely untruthful in how we characterize the \nspending on this program. You can debate that. I will debate that all \nday with anybody up here. This body knows I know our numbers, and the \nnumbers on this bill are untruthful.\n\n  So what we ought to say is, we think we ought to expand the SCHIP \nprogram, and it costs $121 billion. Let's have a debate about what it \nreally costs. That is why the President says we should not do it. And \nwe should not go to 300 percent, and we should not have adults on a \nprogram where in many States it consumes 75 percent of the dollars.\n  I will readily grant you, we have a big problem with health care in \nthis country. One of the major reasons we have a big problem with \nhealth care in this country is government-run health care programs that \ndrive the cost and the overutilization in many areas where we cannot \nfunction properly.\n  What is happening today in our country with quality of care is \nbecause we have so much government run. We have physicians trying to \nsee too many patients. The one thing we are taught in medical school \nis, if you will listen to your patients, they will tell you what is \nwrong. Right now, 8 percent of the cost of health care in this country \nis associated with tests we order that no patient needs. It is because \nthis body will not look at the malpractice situation we have in this \ncountry and the liability situation and fix it to where it truly \nrepresents a system where people who are injured are taken care of. \nWhat we have is a system that games it. So consequently we are all \npaying 8 percent more for health care because providers have to order \ntests to cover their backside.\n  The other thing we know is another 3 percent of the cost of health \ncare is associated with tests that doctors are ordering because they \nare not listening well--$50 billion worth of tests that people do not \nneed because we will not take the time to listen to them.\n  I will summarize and finish my point with this: Washington has an 11-\npercent approval rating for a very good reason. Because we do not \ndeserve to be trusted, because we do exactly what we are doing on this \nbill. We are lying to the American people about what it costs, who it \nwill cover, and how it will be delivered.\n  Now, some other details of the bill are debatable, but those facts \nare not debatable, and the American people, hopefully soon, are going \nto wake up to the dishonesty and the farce that we perpetrate on them \nas we debate those issues.\n  Let's have a debate about national health care. Let's really debate \nit. Let's look at the options. Our bill, in several other places--the \nBurr-Corker bill, the Universal Health Care Choice and Access Act--\ngives everybody in this country an equal tax credit. Everybody gets \ntreated the same. You want to punish the millionaires? Take away some \nof their tremendous excess tax benefits from health care. But we would \nnot do that. We do not have one person who will come forward and say: \nLet's equalize the Tax Code on the other side. Let's equalize the Tax \nCode so everybody has the same shot. Let's let a market help us access \nthat. Let's make sure it is 100 percent access. If you do not have \naccess, you cannot have care.\n  This bill is not going to provide that much access. Fifty percent of \nwhat it does has to do with people who already have access. Those are \nnot my numbers. Those are Congressional Budget Office numbers.\n  So let's be honest about what we are doing. Let's talk about health \ncare. If we want to go to national health care, if we have the votes to \ndo it, then let's do it. But let's do not, under the guise of helping \nchildren, expand national health care. This Senator will vote to \nreauthorize a higher level of funding for SCHIP to cover kids who are \ntruly poor--those who don't have access. I will help anytime, any way \nto do that. That has been my practice. That has been my heritage. That \nhas been my history in caring for poor folks in Oklahoma. But I am not \nabout to go along with a lie, that what we are doing is something \ndifferent than what we say we are doing.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                              Veto Threats\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with 3 days to go before the start of the \nnew fiscal year, there is much inside-the-beltway chatter about \ncontinuing resolutions, omnibuses, minibuses, budget showdowns, and \nGovernment shutdowns.\n  Nowhere is that chatter louder than that which is coming from the \nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue. The President has threatened almost \ndaily that he will veto any appropriations bill that exceeds his budget \nrequest. These veto threats include all of the spending bills that \nprovide funding for our domestic programs--programs that, in one way or \nanother, benefit each American and every American. These bills help to \neducate our children, help to secure our homeland, help to support \nrural America, and help to promote a competitive economy. These \ndomestic spending bills provide the essential building blocks for the \nfoundation of our great country.\n  On the one hand, the President is seeking over $190 billion in \nemergency appropriations to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThat is $190 billion for the cost of the wars for 1 year--1 year--1 \nyear. At the same time, the President wants to veto critical domestic \nspending bills because they total $22 billion above his, the \nPresident's, budget request--less than 1 percent of our entire budget, \nand about what we spend in 2 months' time fighting an unpopular war in \nIraq. All the chatter from the White House even asserts that the $22 \nbillion for programs here in America means increasing taxes and putting \nAmerica's economic growth at risk.\n  This, of course, begs the question of the economic impact of the \nalmost $450 billion we have spent on the war in Iraq, a war which I \noppose.\n  The President characterizes the $22 billion above his request as \n``increased'' spending. In fact, $19 billion of the $22 billion \n``increase'' simply represents restorations of the President's--the \nPresident's--the President's relentless attempts to savage important \ndomestic initiatives.\n  This week, the FBI announced that violent crime is on the rise for \nthe second straight year. Yet the President proposes to cut State and \nlocal law enforcement funding by $1.5 billion.\n  Hurricane Katrina proved that the Government is not prepared to \nhandle major disasters, be they natural disasters or terrorist attacks. \nYet the President--our President--has proposed to cut first responder \ngrants by $1.2 billion. Those grants equip and train our police, our \nfire and emergency medical personnel to respond to a disaster.\n\n[[Page S12229]]\n\n  The President--our President--proposes over $3 billion in cuts for \neducation programs, including special education, safe and drug-free \nschools, and improving teacher quality.\n  Despite an aging population in this country, the President proposes a \ncut of $279 million for studying cancer, diabetes, and heart disease at \nthe National Institutes of Health. Under the President's budget, the \nNational Institutes of Health would have to eliminate 700 research \ngrants that could lead to cures for treatments for cancer, diabetes, \nAlzheimer's, and other diseases.\n  The President also proposes to cut $2.7 billion for elderly and \ndisabled housing and community development grants.\n  When the Interstate 35 bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River, \nit focused the Nation on the need to invest in our crumbling \ninfrastructure. Yet the President proposes to cut over $3 billion from \ninfrastructure programs, such as highway and transit funding, bridge \nrepairs, rural wastewater grants, levees and dams, clean water grants, \nand airport safety and improvements. The President--our President--even \nproposes to reduce funding for the highway and transit levels that are \nguaranteed in the highway law that he, the President--our President--\nsigned in 2005.\n  The President proposed cuts of $1 billion from health programs such \nas rural health, preventive health, and mental health grants, as well \nas over $300 million from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram.\n  Between 1998 and 2004, disease outbreaks in food produce have almost \ndoubled. In 2003, there were 870 food inspectors at the FDA. In 2006, \nthere were 640. The FDA lost 230 inspectors in less than 4 years. So it \nis no surprise food inspection dropped by nearly half during that time. \nYet the President--our President--does not propose to restore those \nreductions in the number of inspectors.\n  All of these foolish cuts have been restored in the bipartisan bills \nthat were approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee by nearly \nunanimous votes and, regrettably, that the President--our President--\nhas said he will veto. In the 12 bills that have been reported from the \ncommittee, we have significantly reduced funding used for \ncongressionally directed spending, and we have added unprecedented \ntransparency and accountability.\n\n  As one can clearly see, this White House standoff is not over some \nirresponsible plan for an expansion of Government or pork-barrel \nprojects. Rather, it is the President's--our President's--effort to \nprevent cancellation of his ill-conceived and poorly justified proposed \nbudget cuts. Congress wants to support vital core missions of \nGovernment, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Food \nand Drug Administration, and the Customs and Border Protection Agency. \nCongress wants to make reasonable choices and set important priorities \nfor our Nation.\n  There are consequences--yes, consequences--for failing to invest in \nAmerica's safety and in America's future. Hurricane Katrina proved \nthat. The collapse of the I-35 bridge proved that. Increases in violent \ncrime prove that. Increases in food-borne illnesses prove that. Every \nheadline about unsafe products being imported into this country proves \nthat.\n  Americans rightly expect their Government to work.\n  Regrettably, rather than recognizing the consequences of his budget, \nthe President--our President--is spoiling for a political fight. He \nrefuses to recognize the facts, even as those facts evolve in a \nchanging world.\n  According to the administration's latest National Intelligence \nEstimate:\n\n       We judge the U.S. homeland will face a persistent and \n     evolving terrorist threat over the next three years. The main \n     threat comes from Islamic terrorist groups and cells, \n     especially al-Qaida, driven by their undiminished intent to \n     attack the United States.\n\n  Yet the President threatens to veto the Homeland Security bill that \npassed the Senate 89 to 4 because it is $2.2 billion above his request, \nwith increases for first responder grants, for border security, and for \nenforcing our immigration laws.\n  The President--our President--is determined to veto 8 of our 12 \nappropriations bills over $22 billion. Some have argued that $22 \nbillion is not a lot of money. I don't share that view; $22 billion is \na lot of money. That is why we are fighting for the additional funding \nabove the President's inadequate request. This fight is about \npriorities.\n  This Congress passed a budget resolution that balances the budget by \n2012 and provides for the increase above the President's request for \ndomestic programs.\n  Consistent with the budget resolution, the Appropriations Committee \nhas reported all 12 bills. Four have passed the Senate, and with \npassage of the continuing resolution, we will continue to press for \npassage of the remaining bills. The President's veto threats \ninevitably--yes, the President's veto threats inevitably slow this \nprocess.\n  In the 12 bills that have been reported by the Appropriations \nCommittee, we invest the $22 billion in America's future. By \ncomparison:\n  In fiscal year 2008, the total cost of President Bush's tax cuts is \n$252 billion--11 times the amount of spending in question.\n  In fiscal year 2008, the cost of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 \npercent of taxpayers is almost $70 billion--three times the amount of \nspending in question.\n  In fiscal year 2008, special interest tax expenditures will cost $1 \ntrillion--45 times the amount of spending in question. Corporate tax \nexpenditures will cost $91 billion--over four times the amount of \nspending in question.\n  So $22 billion is, in fact, a lot of money; money that, if well \nspent, can help to make America be a safer, healthier, more prosperous \ncountry. We are committed to making those careful choices. We will root \nout waste. We will cut or eliminate ineffective programs. We will make \ncareful choices.\n  When President Bush came to town almost 7 years ago, he vowed to \nreach across the aisle for the common good of our Nation. Now is his \nchance. This is the President's chance to make good on that pledge. He \ncan continue his purely partisan fight over $22 billion in needed \nspending, or the President can work with the Congress to confront \nproblems that face Americans here at home.\n  It is my fervent hope the President will put away his veto pen so we \ncan get on with the business of adequately funding programs that \ncontribute to a safe and prosperous United States of America.\n  God bless America always.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today, as I did when we started \nthis whole debate on children's health insurance, on behalf of the \nNation's children and working families. I wasn't intending to come to \nthe floor, but as I have listened to the debate over the last several \ndays, I am amazed we have to defend a program that I cannot believe \nactually needs defending.\n  Today, we rise to protect the Nation's children. In this great \nChamber, I often hear Members say our children are our greatest asset, \nand they most certainly are, but they are also our most fragile asset. \nAnd nothing is more important in preserving that asset than preserving \ntheir health so they can fulfill their God-given potential.\n  The issue before us today is a matter of values. It is not just about \na law or about a program, it is also about a matter of values. Do we \nvalue our children sufficiently to ensure that those who otherwise do \nnot have the ability to insure themselves will have the ability to have \nhealth care coverage so no child in America goes to sleep at night \nworried that they not get ill because their parents cannot afford to \ntake care of them? That is the issue before the Senate, the issue \nbefore the country, and the issue that will be before the President.\n  If our values match our action, then this bill needs to be passed by \nthe Senate and signed into law by the President.\n  This is common sense to me. The bill before us today will keep 6 \nmillion children insured and will cover an additional 4 million \nchildren who presently go to sleep at night and, because they have no \nhealth care coverage, their parents worry over them; and if they get \nill, what happens? They wait longer and their illness gets worse. What \ndo they do? They go to an emergency\n\n[[Page S12230]]\n\nroom, which is far more costly to their lives, as well as to our \ncollective economic consequence. The deal the Senate has before it is \nto save children's lives and keep children healthy. Bottom line: It is \na deal that will keep millions of American children and families from \nbeing pushed into the ranks of the uninsured.\n  I find it interesting that my colleagues talk about fiscal \nresponsibility--now we are going to be fiscally responsible--when we \nhave supplementals that keep coming here without payment for them and \nwithout any limitation whatsoever--a blank check. But now we are going \nto be fiscally responsible on the backs of children.\n  I want to take a moment to look at the families who are actually \naffected by the Children's Health Insurance Program. We are not talking \nabout the poor, because if you are poor in this country, you get \nMedicaid. If you are wealthy, of course, you have the wherewithal to \npay for the insurance. We are talking about children whose families \nwork in some of the toughest jobs this country has. They work at jobs \nthat offer no health care, and they certainly don't make enough money \nto afford private health care coverage. This program is their last \nresort. I have been watching the floor this week and I have noticed \nthat my State of New Jersey has quite unfairly become the punching bag \nby some Members of this body for our successful Children's Health \nInsurance Program. On behalf of New Jersey families, I simply cannot \nlet that go unnoticed. On behalf of the families that the opponents of \nthis legislation say don't deserve to have a doctor or receive medical \nattention, I am insulted. On behalf of children who are asking for an \neyeglass to see a blackboard or get an immunization shot to ward off \nillness, I am offended.\n  I will tell you about one of these families in Keyport, NJ. They earn \njust over $50,000 a year and they have a 16-year-old daughter. They \ncannot afford private health insurance coverage in New Jersey, but \nthrough the Children's Health Insurance Program they can provide their \ndaughter with the much needed health care--health care that protected \nher when she came down with a flu that would not go away, and care that \nprovides relief to her parents, who don't have to worry about medical \nbills if their child gets sick.\n  Even on New Jersey FamilyCare they pay a premium of $74 a month \nbecause they are higher on the Federal poverty level. But that is far \nless than private insurance would cost them, which they could not \npossibly afford on that $50,000 income for that family of three.\n  Talking about premiums, let me take a moment to talk about families \nat 350 percent of the Federal poverty level in New Jersey, since that \nis a particular point of contention in this debate. Families at 350 \npercent of the Federal poverty level in New Jersey earn about $60,000 \nfor a family of three. These families, under New Jersey FamilyCare, are \npaying $125 each month in premiums and between $5 and $35 in copays. It \nis not a free ride. In fact, most federally elected officials, \nincluding my colleagues in the Senate, pay about $190 each month in \npremiums for their family coverage and their earnings are well above \n350 percent of the Federal poverty level. It is hard to see how it is \nOK for Members of this body but it is not OK for children in this \ncountry.\n  If the President made the decision, it seems he would say ``tough \nluck'' to these families, ``go ahead and roll the dice on your \ndaughter's health care.'' That is not an action that I think is \ndignified by a compassionate conservative. The President doesn't want \nto cover families above 200 percent of the Federal poverty level--this \nchild and so many others like her. I believe that is disgraceful and it \nshould be embarrassing to even threaten a veto of this bill.\n  Here is my question to those who oppose this bill: Is the greatest \nNation on the Earth going to permit its children to have no health \ncoverage?\n  The President gets some of the best health care coverage in the \nworld, paid by the taxpayers of this country. He can go, as Members of \nthis body can, to Bethesda Naval Hospital, or Walter Reed, or, in the \ncase of the Members of this body, to the Capitol doctor. That is \nsubsidized by the taxpayer. Talk about socialized medicine. It is good \nenough for Members of this Chamber but not for these children. The \nPresident gets the best health care coverage in the world. He deserves \nto have it, but so do the children of this country.\n\n  When you think about using your veto pen, Mr. President, think about \nyour health care coverage that we all pay for as taxpayers. Do these \nchildren deserve less?\n  In New Jersey there are 130,000 children depending on this program \nfor their health coverage. They, along with 6 million children \nnationwide, depend on this program to stay healthy and, in some cases, \nstay alive. Proper coverage is often the difference between life and \ndeath, between health and sickness, between compassion and \nheartlessness.\n  I urge my colleagues to act wisely as this is not a political game, \nnor is it time to make a point. This is about one thing only: the \nhealth of our Nation's children.\n  What troubles me is that the President is prepared to turn his back \nand close the doors but, simply put, if his priorities were different, \nwe could provide health care to all children in this country. If we \nwere to take what we spend in Iraq in one day--$300 million--and spend \nthat on children's health care, we could cover 245,000 children. In the \npast 41 days, we have spent over $12 billion on the war, and what \nchanged in Iraq during that time? But I can tell you what we can do in \nthe lives of children in this country.\n  Finally, I bristle when colleagues come to this floor and still bring \nup the red herring of immigrant children being covered who should not \nhave the right. The law has been clear--the law that exists, the law we \nare renewing. Undocumented immigrants have never--I underline \n``never''--been eligible for regular Medicaid or the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. This bill maintains that prohibition. It maintains \nthat. So to continue to come to the floor and bring the bogeyman of \nthose who are coming because they want the health care coverage that \nthis program would provide, it is not permitted under the law, has not \nbeen, and is not under this law, and won't be under this law.\n  I will tell you what is incredibly remarkable. During the immigration \ndebate, we heard a great deal that we should differentiate between \nthose who follow law and the rules and came here legally, and did the \nright thing and are living legally as permanent residents of the United \nStates versus those who do not. Guess what. We don't even cover the \nchildren of those legal permanent residents of the United States who \nhave obeyed the law, followed the rules, and ultimately are working \nhard in our country. Many of them, by the way--over 70,000--are serving \nin the Armed Forces of the United States. So to say that children are \ngetting covered who are not legal and who are not permitted under the \nlaw, that is outrageous. This bill doesn't do it, but we should cover \nthose children of legal permanent residents who have obeyed the law and \nthe rules and are contributing to our society. But we don't do that \neither. So I hope we stop using children, whether they be those who \ncannot afford, because of their status in life and because of their \nparents' hard work but they don't make enough money, to have insurance \nand ultimately don't get it at their workplace, or those children who, \nthrough no fault of their own, find themselves in this country but who \nare not covered under this provision anyhow under the law--stop using \nall of these images to try to undermine the very essence of what this \nbill is all about.\n  You either stand with children in this country who, through no fault \nof their own, have no health care coverage whatsoever, or you stand \nagainst them. You stand for the proposition that no child in America \nshould go to sleep at night without health care coverage; you stand for \nthe proposition that it is in the societal interest of this country to \nensure that the greatest asset we always talk about, our children--they \nare also the most fragile asset--can be protected; you stand for the \nproposition that in this great country of ours, among the high and \nmighty here, who have great health care coverage, well over 350 percent \nof the Federal poverty level, that we deserve no more than children in \nthis country do.\n  That is what this debate and vote is all about.\n  Before I close, there is one part of this bill that is missing and it \nleaves\n\n[[Page S12231]]\n\nthis entire bill and mission to increase children's health care \nunfulfilled. And that is the lack of language to provide health care \nfor legal immigrant children and pregnant women in this bill.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the bipartisan Legal Immigrant Chidren's \nHealth Improvement Act, also known as ICHIA, which would have repealed \nthe morally objectionable law that prohibits new legal immigrants from \naccessing Medicaid and SCHIP until they have lived in the United States \nfor 5 years. This bill today should have included a provision that \nwould have given States the flexibility to provide coverage to this \npopulation.\n  I am proud of my home State of New Jersey. They have taken it upon \nthemselves to use 100 percent State funds to cover over 8,000 legal \nimmigrant pregnant women and children--at a cost of over $22 million. \nMy State has temporarily fixed the problem but it is up to Congress to \npass the solution into law.\n  How can you tell a 7-year-old child with an ear infection he has to \nwait 5 years to see a doctor? We cannot bar these families from \naccessing our health care system simply because they haven't lived here \nlong enough.\n  During the immigration debate, our colleagues emphasized the \ndifference between those here legally and those here illegally, so it \nis appalling to me that a legal immigrant child, whose family waited \ntheir time, came here legally and obeyed the law, are still subject to \nrepublican criticism and are denied health care.\n  These fully legal, taxpaying pregnant women and their children \ndeserve to be covered under our children's health program. I am \ndisheartened that we could not agree to include this language but you \nhave my promise that I will work to pass ICHIA in coming months. This \nis not a question of if but a question of when it will pass.\n  In conclusion, a great Republican, Abe Lincoln, once said:\n\n       A child is a person who is going to carry on what you have \n     started. They are going to sit where you are sitting, and \n     when you are gone; attend to those things, which you think \n     are important. The fate of humanity is in their hands. So it \n     might be well to pay them some attention.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to now pay attention to our children and support \nthis important bill. I ask this for our children, for our families and \nfor the well-being of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, known as SCHIP. In Kentucky, it is known as \nKCHIP.\n  Several weeks ago, the Senate debated a bill that would reauthorize \nthis program. Now we are debating a bill that looks very much like the \nlast bill. I did not support the Senate-passed bill and, unfortunately, \nI cannot support this version presently on the floor.\n  The tobacco tax funding mechanism is an irresponsible way to pay for \nchildren's health care. The increased tax is fundamentally unfair, \nparticularly to my State and the States that surround Kentucky.\n  It pays for a government program intended for low-income kids--one \nthat I support and continue to support--by raising taxes. The bill \nexpands its coverage to middle-income adults and some illegal \nimmigrants in other States. It redistributes income from low-income \nsmokers to States with the highest per capita incomes. It could be \ncalled Robin Hood in reverse.\n  I have a chart that illustrates what this bill really does. It is \ncompiled from data drawn from a CDC database on tobacco consumption and \nprojections by Family USA concerning SCHIP spending.\n  As we can see, the States in red will pay more in tobacco tax over \nthe next 5 years than they will receive. In my State of Kentucky, we \nwill pay $602 million more in tobacco taxes than we will receive in \nSCHIP money under the same 5 years.\n  Virginians, our good friends from Virginia, will pay $576 million \nmore, and the citizens of Florida, our good friends down in the \npanhandle, will pay $703 million more than they receive.\n  California, our good friends out on the left coast, will receive a \nnet benefit--in other words, more than they pay--of $2.5 billion. How \nfair is this?\n  New taxes paid by low-income smokers in my State will go to pay for \nan extravagant expansion of SCHIP in California, New York, Texas, and \nall the States in light and dark green, and that includes New Jersey, \nNew Mexico, Arizona, California, New York, and many others.\n  Many people predict that the new Federal tobacco tax needed to pay \nfor this expansion of SCHIP is likely to cause the States to increase \ntheir own tax cigarette taxes to avoid State revenue shortfalls. This \nwill lead to artificially high-priced cigarettes that are irresistible \ntargets for foreign cigarette counterfeiters and bootleggers in the \nUnited States.\n  This is not just somebody's dream. There is new evidence of the \nabsolute folly of this plan to increase tobacco taxes by over 150 \npercent. We will not see the revenue projected, but you can be sure \norganized crime will profit from this situation.\n  In August of this year, the New York Police Department and Federal \nauthorities found 600,000 cartons of counterfeit cigarettes made in \nChina in a warehouse in Queens. In the same raid, the NYPD found \n125,000 phony revenue stamps. The counterfeiters planned to use these \nphony stamps to evade taxes in Virginia, New York, and Kentucky, \npassing them off as real stamps so that cigarettes can be sold in \nordinary stores.\n  This was not an isolated incident. There are many other similar \nincidents of fake cigarettes in the United States from countries such \nas China and Russia.\n  If you are concerned about lead in toys made in China, you should \nalso be concerned about this SCHIP bill because it will almost \ncertainly expose smokers, including some children, to the toxic \nsubstance in counterfeit Chinese and Russian cigarettes.\n  According to an article last week in the New York Times, chemical \nstudies of counterfeit cigarettes have shown that they contain high \nlevels of lead. Unlike the lead paint on toys, this lead will certainly \nbe consumed by smokers. It is much more dangerous. So much for \nimproving health care.\n  In addition to all the other problems, this new tax is a poor \nfoundation for the proposed expansion of SCHIP. We are matching a \ndeclining source of revenue with a growing Federal program. It doesn't \nmake any fiscal sense.\n  If we were honest and truly wanted to fully fund SCHIP spending with \na tobacco tax, the Federal Government would have to encourage people to \nsmoke. As a matter of fact, the Federal Government would possibly need \nan additional 22.4 million smokers by the year 2017 to pay for this \nbill.\n  Expanding SCHIP to cover adults, as well as kids, will lead to even \nmore tax increases in future years because no one will pay these \ntobacco taxes if smuggled cigarettes and cigarettes from Internet Web \nsites are freely available.\n  I also don't believe this bill focuses on those who need health care \ninsurance the most. When richer families are made eligible for SCHIP, \nkids will move from private coverage to Government health care. In \nfact, the Congressional Budget Office tells us that this bill will \nresult in 2 million children moving off private coverage. It is absurd \nto me that children above the 300 percent poverty level will be added \nto this program.\n  New York still has the possibility of covering families that will \nmake over $82,000 a year. It is not a fact, it is a possibility. These \nare families paying AMT taxes, a tax which is supposedly only affecting \nthe wealthy. This expansion of the bill is a push for Government-funded \nnational health care which is not the original intent of SCHIP.\n  The way the bill is funded also should raise great concerns to anyone \nif they care about fiscal responsibility. The budget gimmick used to \nfund it is irresponsible. It jeopardizes coverage under the program and \nbasically guarantees another tax increase 5 years from today or when we \npass this bill.\n  Under the bill, SCHIP spending from 2008 to 2012 totals over $27 \nbillion. However, for 2013, spending drops to $2.3 billion and falls to \nnegative amounts in each year after that until 2017, representing \nprojected cuts--I say that again, projected cuts--to the SCHIP program.\n  So what we have here is a 10-year tax for a 5-year program. Does \nanybody really think we will kick millions of kids off this program in \n2013 to accommodate this lowered spending? Of course we won't. However, \nwe will have\n\n[[Page S12232]]\n\nto find a new way to pay for it. If a private company ran its books \nlike this, the CEO would be fired or end up in the big house, in jail.\n  Another stunning example of how this bill undermines the original \npurpose of SCHIP is that it makes it easier for illegal aliens to get \nhealth care intended for poor children. This bill guts existing \nprotections put in place to stop illegal immigrants from getting \ntaxpayer-funded SCHIP and Medicaid benefits. Earlier this year, we \nspent nearly a month debating immigration reform. This bill is a step \nbackwards, and it certainly sends the wrong message. It takes money \nthat is supposed to go to our poor children and gives it to others who \nhave come to this country illegally.\n  Let me make it clear that I want to see the SCHIP program continued \nas it is, and I want to see it reauthorized. However, I want to see it \ndone responsibly. This bill does not do that. So I must oppose it and \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise for a few moments because I know \nthere are other people in this Chamber who have worked for many years \non this bill who wish to speak. Senator Kennedy is here. I wish to take \na few moments to rebut what was said about a half an hour ago. Our \ncolleague from Oklahoma was making some arguments, and I want to rebut \nsome of them. I know this has been a long debate, but it is important.\n  He and others have made the claim about government-run health \ninsurance over and over, and I think that is a White House talking \npoint. I understand where they get the line. This is a program which \nuses private insurance carriers to provide the services especially to \ndo the administration. So that argument really does not make a lot of \nsense.\n  Secondly, he talked about shifting costs and people paying more \ntaxes. It is very clear, just as the argument of our colleague from \nKentucky made clear, that the increase in this program, the $35 billion \nto cover 4 million more children, comes from tobacco tax increases. We \ncan have debates about whether it is right or wrong, but most people in \nAmerica support an increase in the tobacco tax to pay for this \nlegislation. We are not talking about an income tax or any other kind \nof tax.\n  Thirdly, fiscal responsibility. We heard people talk about that issue \ntoday. No one on this side of the aisle needs a lecture from that side \nof the aisle or anywhere else about fiscal responsibility. This \nadministration is the administration that brought us to a $9 trillion \ndebt level and huge deficits. I think that is disingenuous.\n  I want to read a quotation from a recognized expert from MIT, \nProfessor Jonathan Gruber, on private versus public:\n\n       I have undertaken a number of analyses to compare public \n     sector costs of public sector expansions such as SCHIP to \n     alternatives such as tax credits. I find that the public \n     sector provides much more insurance coverage at a much lower \n     cost under SCHIP than these alternatives. Tax subsidies \n     mostly operate to ``buy out the base'' of insured without \n     providing much new coverage.\n\n  That quote is from a recognized expert.\n  We heard discussions about the cost over 5 years. This is a 5-year \nreauthorization. The cost is not, as it was alleged before, some lie. \nThe cost over 5 years is very simple: $25 billion is in the program \nnow. We want to add $35 billion, so it is a $60 billion cost over 5 \nyears. It makes all the sense in the world to spend $12 billion a year \non health insurance when billionaires get $100 million in 1 year, or I \nshould say over $200,000 of income. They get $100 million a year if \nthey make that kind of money.\n  My last point is, he and others talked about this being a debate \nabout national health insurance. We can have that debate. We agreed on \nthat. That is one thing we all agree on, both sides of the aisle. We \nshould have a debate about health insurance. This is not national \nhealth insurance. This is not the debate about health insurance \ngenerally. This is a very focused debate about whether the President of \nthe United States is in favor of providing health care for 10 million \nchildren and whether he is going to make that commitment. It is very \nsimple. If you are supporting the President, then you are supporting a \npolicy which will lead to the failure of this country to provide health \ncare for 10 million children, and that would be a terrible mistake for \nthose kids, for their communities, but especially, over the long term, \nfor our economic future. We can't compete around the world unless our \nkids are healthy and they learn more now and earn more in the future.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram Reauthorization Act of 2007.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is a successful program that \nhas improved the quality of life for our Nation's children. According \nto the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Children's Health \nInsurance Program has reduced the number of uninsured children by one-\nthird since its enactment in 1997.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act will \npreserve the access of health care for the 6.6 million children \ncurrently enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program. It will \nalso expand health care access to an estimated 4 million children.\n  An estimated 5 percent of children in Hawaii do not have health \ninsurance. This is approximately 16,000 children. My home State of \nHawaii has continued to develop innovative programs to increase access \nto health insurance. The Hawaii State Legislature established the Keiki \nCare Program this year. The Keiki Care Program is a public-private \npartnership intended to make sure that every child in Hawaii has access \nto health care.\n  It would be irresponsible to reduce Federal resources to States for \nchildren's health care. Without access to insurance, children will not \nbe able to learn, be active, and grow into healthy adults.\n  I greatly appreciate the inclusion of a provision to restore Medicaid \ndisproportionate share hospital, DSH, allotments for Hawaii and \nTennessee. Medicaid DSH payments are designed to provide additional \nsupport to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured \npatients.\n  I developed this provision as an amendment with my colleagues, \nSenators Alexander, Inouye, and Corker. I am proud that we were able to \nhave this bipartisan amendment included in the Children's Health \nInsurance Program Reauthorization Act. Hawaii would be provided with a \n$10 million Medicaid DSH allotment for fiscal year 2008. For fiscal \nyear 2009 and beyond, Hawaii's allotment would increase with annual \ninflation updates just like other low DSH States.\n  We must enact this legislation so that Hawaii and Tennessee can \nreceive Medicaid DSH allotments in fiscal year 2008 and beyond. In The \nTax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, DSH allotments were provided \nfor Hawaii and Tennessee for 2007. The act included $10 million for a \nHawaii Medicaid DSH allotment. The Hawaii State Legislature enacted \nlegislation to provide the necessary matching funds required to utilize \nthe Federal resources.\n  Hawaii and Tennessee are the only two States that do not have DSH \nallotments. I will explain some of the history behind the lack of the \nDSH allotment for Hawaii and why it is so important that this \nlegislation be enacted. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, BBA, created \nspecific DSH allotments for each State based on their actual DSH \nexpenditures for fiscal year 1995. In 1994, Hawaii implemented the \nQUEST demonstration program that was designed to reduce the number of \nuninsured and improve access to health care. The prior Medicaid DSH \nprogram was incorporated into QUEST. As a result of the demonstration \nprogram, Hawaii did not have DSH expenditures in 1995 and was not \nprovided a DSH allotment.\n  The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection \nAct of 2000 made further changes to the DSH program, which included the \nestablishment of a floor for DSH allotments. However, States without \nallotments were again left out.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of \n2003 made additional changes in the DSH program. This included an \nincrease in DSH allotments for low DSH States. Again, States without \nallotments were left out.\n  Hawaii and Tennessee should be treated like other extremely low DSH\n\n[[Page S12233]]\n\nStates and be provided with Medicaid DSH allotments every year. Other \nStates that have obtained waivers similar to Hawaii's have retained \ntheir DSH allotments.\n  Hospitals in Hawaii are struggling to meet the elevated demands \nplaced on them by the increasing number of uninsured people. DSH \npayments will help Hawaii hospitals meet the rising health care needs \nof our communities and reinforce our health care safety net. All States \nneed to have access to resources to ensure that hospitals can continue \nto provide services for uninsured and low-income residents.\n  The President's expected veto of this legislation is detrimental to \nthe health of our Nation's children. It also will be very harmful to \nHawaii. The resources necessary to ensure that children have access to \nhealth care.\n  This administration fails to understand the health care needs of the \ncountry and especially Hawaii. This legislation will help the State of \nHawaii provide essential health care access to children that currently \nlack health insurance. It will also provide much needed assistance to \nour hospitals that care for Medicaid beneficiaries and uninsured \npatients.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the Children's Health \nInsurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, a bipartisan bill that \nwould provide health care insurance to millions of children who are not \nnow covered.\n  I hope the President will reconsider his position and sign the \nbipartisan compromise when it reaches his desk.\n  Currently, 6.6 million children are enrolled in CHIP. There are still \n9 million uninsured children nationwide, 6 million of which are \neligible for either Medicaid or CHIP. In Michigan, while 55,000 \nchildren are covered under CHIP, 90,000 Michigan children are currently \neligible for Medicaid or MIChild, Michigan's CHIP program, but are not \nreceiving services. In addition, according to the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation, the recent decline in employer-sponsored health care \ncoverage is threatening the access to private health care coverage for \nmany more children. In fact, the Census Bureau has reported that, \nbetween 2004-2006, the number of uninsured children has increased by \napproximately one million children.\n  Although the existing CHIP has been successful, it still fails to \naddress the problem fully. Too many children qualify for the program \nbut are unable to receive insurance because of inadequate funding.\n  Much like the Senate bill to reauthorize this successful children's \nhealth program, the bill we will pass today will reauthorize CHIP and \nincrease funding for the program by $35 billion over 5 years. The \nChildren's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, a \ncompromise worked out between the House and Senate, would ensure that \nthere is sufficient funding to cover the children currently enrolled \nand to expand the program to additional children in need.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 3.8 million uninsured \nchildren would gain health coverage under this plan and according to a \nstudy done by The Urban Institute, 80 percent of the children covered \nunder CHIP will come from families under 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty level.\n  We have a moral obligation to provide Americans access to affordable \nand high quality health care. No person, young or old, should be denied \naccess to adequate health care, and the expanded and improved \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is an important step toward \nachieving that goal.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, H.R. \n976. Reauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nSCHIP, before it expires is critical to ensure health care access for \nmillions of our Nation's children.\n  My home State of New Mexico has a terrible problem with uninsured \nchildren. Recent reports have New Mexico at the bottom in the Nation \nfor coverage of children. In 1997, while I was chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee, I helped to create SCHIP as part of the Balanced \nBudget Act. The program has been a success. Over the past decade, SCHIP \nhas helped reduce the number of children without insurance.\n  The bill we are voting on today is a compromise. In August, both the \nHouse and the Senate passed two very different versions of an SCHIP \nreauthorization. At that time, I came down to the floor and I said I \ndid not like what the House of Representatives was doing. I did not \nsupport the massive increases in spending and eligibility proposed by \nthe House and I did not want a reauthorization that included revisions \nto the Medicare Program. The conference committee listened to these \nconcerns, and I am pleased that the bill before us today closely \nresembles the SCHIP bill passed by the Senate 68-31 in August.\n  My comment to children's health care remains firm today. I support \nthe passage of the compromise SCHIP reauthorization. It is a good bill. \nIt provides $35 billion in new resources to provide health coverage for \nmillions more children in working families. It will strengthen outreach \nand enrollment efforts to make sure that all children who are eligible \nfor the program get the services they need. It also makes improvements \nto the program by including language on mental health parity and dental \nhealth coverage.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nlegislation that is critically important to more than 6 million \nchildren in the United States, including more than 14,000 South Dakota \nchildren, who are covered by the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, or CHIP.\n  I voted for this program when Congress created it 10 years ago and I \nhave watched with great satisfaction as the number of uninsured \nchildren in our country dropped. More children have health insurance \ncoverage today, which ensures that they have every chance to do their \nbest in school and live long, healthy, productive lives.\n  Congress originally authorized this program for 10 years in order to \nprovide an opportunity to evaluate the program and make sure that we \nare doing right by our children. Well, the studies are in with \nimpressive results: while the number of uninsured adults has steadily \nrisen since CHIP was enacted, the number of uninsured low-income \nchildren has dropped by nearly one-third.\n  Yet there is much more work to do. In my State alone, more than \n12,000 children are eligible for health coverage through either \nMedicaid or CHIP but remain uninsured. These uninsured children don't \nreceive their vaccinations, miss screening and other preventive \nmeasures, and access health care at much later stages of their \nillnesses than insured children. The fact that so many children, \nthrough no fault of their own, face these struggles with health care is \nsomething about which our Nation should be ashamed.\n  The President says he will veto this bill, which he calls ``an \nincremental step toward the goal of government-run health care for \nevery American.'' Nothing could be further from the truth. If the \nPresident's plan of providing private health insurance worked, we \nwouldn't have 9 million uninsured children in the United States today, \nincluding 18,000 South Dakota children. But the bottom line, as an \neditorial in one South Dakota newspaper put it, is this:\n\n       The uninsured children of families struggling to get by do \n     not need lectures about the encroachment of socialized \n     medicine or the virtues of personal responsibility. They need \n     health coverage.\n\n  During the past 9 months, I have received a personal lesson in the \ngreat value of health insurance. Our Nation's children shouldn't have \nto learn this lesson the hard way. I urge my colleagues to support the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, and I hope the \nPresident will do right by our Nation's children and sign this bill \ninto law.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to continue my support for \nthe reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program--an \nessential effort to ensure the health of our Nation's children. Since \nthe inception of this program, I have agreed with the goals of this \nprogram and strongly believe that it is necessary to meet our \nresponsibilities and fulfill our commitment to children.\n  Although I wholeheartedly support the compromise agreement on the \nreauthorization of this program, it is exactly that: a compromise.\n  For the past 10 years, the Children's Health Insurance Program has \nhelped\n\n[[Page S12234]]\n\nprovide health care for millions of children from working families that \ndo not qualify for Medicaid, but can't afford private insurance. These \nare the children of working families whose companies do not offer \nhealth insurance to their employees.\n  As the cost of health insurance rises and an increasing number of \nemployers are unable or unwilling to provide health insurance to their \nemployees and their families, the number of families who do not have \nhealth insurance has continued to rise.\n  While the number of the uninsured continues to rise, the percentage \nof low-income children without health insurance has dropped more than \none-third since the creation of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram.\n  Currently the Children's Health Insurance Program provides coverage \nfor 6.6 million children nationwide. This reauthorization would provide \nhealth care coverage for an additional 3.2 million children who are \nuninsured today. In California, an estimated 250,000 children will be \nadded.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program has always enjoyed the \nbipartisan support of our Congress, our Governors, and our President--\nand the legislation we are voting on today reflects that spirit of \ncooperation.\n  I am glad to see that we have worked with many of our Republican \ncolleagues on an issue so critical to the health of children across \nthis Nation.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral agreement is largely based on the \nlegislation passed by the Senate in July, which would fund outreach and \nenrollment efforts, allow States to use information from food stamp \nprograms and other initiatives for low-income families to find and \nenroll eligible children, and give States the option to cover pregnant \nwomen for prenatal care vital to healthy newborn children.\n  In desperation and defiance, opponents of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program have made outrageous allegations maligning the \neffectiveness and success of this program.\n  Critics have claimed that this program extends to eligibility to \nwealthy families in America--this could not be further from the truth. \nIn my own State of California, the average family income of children \ncovered by this program is just 163 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel--less than $34,000 a year for a family of four.\n  There have been claims that Children's Health Insurance funding goes \nto illegal immigrants--this is completely false. The reality is that \nundocumented immigrants have never been eligible for Medicaid or the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. Actually, there are restrictions \nwithin this program which deny health insurance to low-income children \nwho are legal immigrants.\n  The President is spending $10 billion each month in Iraq, but has \nthreatened to veto a bill that will provide 10 million children with \naccess to health care. Under the President's proposal, he is willing to \nfund the Children's Health Insurance Program with an increase of $1 \nbillion a year--the cost of 3 days in Iraq.\n  If we fail to renew this program or if the President vetoes this bill \nas he has threatened to do, it is the children who will pay the price.\n  As we near the September 30 deadline to reauthorize this program, I \nstrongly urge and implore that the President reconsider his position on \nthis bill. The need of children knows no partisan or political \nbarriers, and should not have to overcome the obstacles created by the \nPresident.\n  There is not a man or woman in this chamber who wouldn't do \neverything within their power to ensure the health of their own \nchildren--we should do no less for the children of our Nation.\n  The Members of this Congress have overwhelmingly expressed a \ncommitment to children's health. Earlier this year, we passed a budget \nresolution which set aside $50 billion for the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, reaffirming our commitment to the continued success \nof this program.\n  We can still do more and we will, but this bill is a step forward in \nthe right direction.\n  I would like to thank Senators Baucus and Rockefeller, Senators \nGrassley and Hatch and the members of the Finance Committee who worked \nso tirelessly to bring this legislation forward in a bipartisan way, \nand keep the focus of this bill where it should be--on the children.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today we are voting on the \nreauthorization of a program that has wide support in our country and \nthat has reduced the number of uninsured children nationwide by over 6 \nmillion. In fact, CHIP has helped lower the rate of noninsurance among \nlow-income children by one-third since its enactment in 1997. That is a \nhuge accomplishment, and has helped address a problem in our country \nthat is unacceptable--the millions of uninsured families.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, CHIP, known as BadgerCare, provides \nhealth insurance for over 67,000 families. Wisconsin has done an \nincredible job of covering uninsured children as well as their parents, \nand the positive effects of this program are felt at schools, in the \nworkforce, and at home. This bill helps support Wisconsin's efforts and \nprovides low-income families in my State with better access to \npreventive care, primary care, and affordable care. The end result is \nhealthier families. BadgerCare is vital to the well-being of many \nfamilies in Wisconsin and I am very pleased that this bill supports the \nprogram in my State, including Wisconsin's choice to cover parents of \nCHIP and Medicaid children.\n  We know from numerous reports that when we cover parents, we bring \nmore uninsured children into the program as well. States like Wisconsin \nhave proven time and again that covering parents means covering more \nkids. I worked hard with my colleagues and the Senate Finance Committee \nto make sure that Wisconsin could keep families in the CHIP program, \nand I am very pleased that those efforts have paid off.\n  This legislation is not perfect. I would like to be voting on a more \nexpansive package today that would offer health care access to more \nchildren and families. I am very disappointed that this legislation \ndoes not include language that would allow access to the program for \nlegal immigrants. Unfortunately, it appears that, because of Republican \nopposition to this policy, legal immigrant children will continue to \nhave to wait five years before they become eligible for CHIP and \nMedicaid. I will do my best to help change the discriminatory policy in \nthe future.\n  Despite the flaws in this legislation, the CHIP reauthorization bill \nmarks an important step forward in getting coverage to those who need \nit. I will support this bill's final passage, and I hope the President \nwill reconsider his ill-advised decision to veto it. I look forward to \nthe day that everyone in our country has access to the basic right of \nhealth care.\n  Mr. Dodd. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 976, \nthe Small Business Tax Relief Act. This is a bipartisan agreement to do \nwhat is right for our nation's children. There are few more important \nissues facing the senate than the health and well-being of our Nation's \nyouth. The vote to pass this legislation is a vote for children.\n  As the father of two young daughters, I keenly understand how \nimportant it is to know that if one of them gets sick they have the \nhealth insurance coverage that will provide for them. For millions of \nparents, every slight sniffle or aching tooth could mean the difference \nbetween paying the rent and paying for medical care. Today we have an \nopportunity to help give those parents peace of mind about their \nchildren's health.\n  It is our national shame that 9 million children wake up every day \nlacking any form of health insurance. Every day, this means millions of \nregular checkups are sidelined, dental exams go unscheduled, and early \ndiagnoses of chronic conditions such as asthma or diabetes are \npostponed. For families, such delays set the stage for children to grow \nup underperforming in school, developing preventable or treatable \nconditions, or worse, permanent disability or even premature death.\n  The lack of health insurance causes more than poor health outcomes. \nAccess to affordable health care is essential to alleviating child \npoverty. Low-income families without insurance often get stuck in an \nendless cycle of medical debt, a primary cause of bankruptcy filings in \nthis country. Parents already struggling to make ends meet\n\n[[Page S12235]]\n\nshould not have to choose between providing their children needed \nmedications and putting a roof over their heads or food on their table.\n  I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee \nfor working so hard with our colleagues in the House of Representatives \nto put together a bill that will benefit the lives of millions of \nchildren and their families. Their leadership over the years, and that \nof Senators Hatch, Rockefeller, Kennedy and many others, helped create \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, and reduce the number of \nuninsured children by one-third. Their persistence now to expand this \nbill in the face of considerable opposition shows their commitment to \nchildren's health. This bill is a tremendous investment in the health \nand future of our children.\n  Specifically, the bill continues providing coverage for 6.6 million \nchildren currently enrolled in CHIP and provides coverage for 3.1 \nmillion children who are currently uninsured today. It gives States the \nresources they need to keep up with the growing numbers of uninsured \nchildren. It provides tools and incentives to cover children who have \nfallen through the cracks of current programs. And it will prevent the \nPresident from unfairly and shortsightedly limiting States' efforts to \nexpand their CHIP programs to cover even more children. All together \nthese efforts will reduce the number of uninsured children by one third \nover the next 5 years.\n  In my own State of Connecticut, our CHIP program, commonly known as \nHUSKY B, has brought affordable health insurance to more than 130,000 \nchildren in working families since its inception in 1998. H.R. 976 is \nessential to States like Connecticut so that they may continue to \noperate programs like HUSKY B and build on their proven success to \ninsure even more children.\n  I am additionally very pleased that my Support for Injured \nServicemembers Act amendment was included in the final SCHIP bill. This \namendment provides up to 6 months of Family and Medical Leave Act, \nFMLA, leave for family members of military personnel who suffer from a \ncombat-related injury or illness. FMLA currently allows three months of \nunpaid leave. Fourteen years ago, FMLA declared the principle that \nworkers should never be forced to choose between the jobs they need and \nthe families they love.\n  If ordinary Americans deserve those rights, how much more do they \napply to those who risk their lives in the service of our country? \nSoldiers who have been wounded in our service deserve everything \nAmerica can give to speed their recoveries but most of all, they \ndeserve the care of their closest loved ones. That is exactly what is \noffered in the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act.\n  Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services \nDonna Shalala have been instrumental in this effort through the \nPresident's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded \nWarriors. It's not surprising that the Commission found that family \nmembers play a critical role in the recovery of our wounded \nservicemembers. The commitment shown by the families and friends of our \ntroops is truly inspiring. According to the Commission's report, 33 \npercent of active duty servicemembers report that a family member or \nclose friend relocated for extended periods of time to help their \nrecoveries. It also points out that 21 percent of active duty \nservicemembers say that their friends or family members gave up jobs to \nfind the time. Last week in a hearing of the Subcommittee on Workforce \nProtections, we heard from one of those families and there are \nthousands more to be heard. The House is moving forward with companion \nlegislation and I am grateful to my colleagues Congresswoman Woolsey \nand Chairman Miller and their cosponsors.\n  I am pleased that Senator Clinton is the lead cosponsor of my \namendment. In addition, I am pleased that Senators Dole, Graham, \nKennedy, Chambliss, Reed, Mikulski, Murray, Salazar, Lieberman, \nMenendez, Brown, Nelson of Nebraska, and Cardin are cosponsoring this \namendment. I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for accepting \nthis important amendment and appreciate the support of all of my \ncolleagues in this effort.\n  I am troubled by the comments by President Bush and members of his \nadministration about this bill. This legislation is vital to the health \nand well being of our children. The CHIP program is a model of success \nand this bill provides sustainable and predictable health care coverage \nfor low income children regardless of their health status. It \nrepresents the hard work and agreement of an overwhelming majority of \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. It is a testament to how important \nissues like children's health care can be addressed in a bipartisan \nmanner by a united Congress. The President's policy of block and delay \nwould mean Connecticut and other States would have to take away \nexisting health coverage for hundreds of thousands of children when \nthey should be covering more kids.\n  But despite the bipartisan agreement of this Congress, the President \nthreatens to veto this legislation. If he does, all Americans will know \nwhether the President stands for children or would rather stand in the \nway of children's access to critically needed health care.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation and I urge \nPresident Bush to do what is right and sign it into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12235-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12235-S12247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S. CON. RES. 21\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 301 of S. Con. Res. 21, the 2008 \nbudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for \nlegislation that reauthorizes the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, SCHIP. Section 301 authorizes the revisions provided that \ncertain conditions are met, including that the legislation not result \nin more than $50 billion in outlays for SCHIP over the period of fiscal \nyears 2007 through 2012 and that the legislation not worsen the deficit \nover the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the \nperiod of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.\n  I find that H.R. 976, the Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2007, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-\nneutral reserve fund for SCHIP legislation. Therefore, pursuant to \nsection 301, I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget \nresolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S. Con.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Carolina \nfor extending the courtesy of my being able to proceed. We have been \nmoving back and forth. I understand there is 20 minutes left for the \nDemocrats, and the Senator from Pennsylvania has taken 5; am I correct? \nHow much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen and a half minutes remains.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes, and I ask the Chair to remind \nme when there is 1 minute left.\n  Mr. President, I think this debate over the course of the day has \nbeen enormously constructive. I think the American people have been \nwatching it, and they have a much clearer idea about the alternatives \nthat are before us. They should know by this time that when all is said \nand done, this program, the SCHIP program, was fashioned to try to look \nafter the working poor, recognizing that Medicaid dealt with the very \npoor but that the working poor were finding increasing pressure and \nwere, in increasing numbers, unable to get any kind of health \ninsurance. That was basically the targeted area.\n  As we reviewed earlier in the course of the discussion, this was \nbasically a State-run program. Using the private sector, it has \nguidelines as to what the health care coverage should be in various \nareas, but the States make those judgments and decisions--quite a bit \ndifferent from Medicaid. So the origin of it, having listened to some \nof this debate, it is important to note this is very different from \nother kinds of Federal programs but not greatly dissimilar from what \nthe President has indicated that he supported in the prescription drug \nprogram. It was initially using the cigarette tax money that was a part \nof the settlement earlier, where we were using it, and therefore the \nrelationship with the increase in the cigarette tax at the present \ntime.\n  Now, Mr. President, I only have a few minutes here, and we have gone \nthrough these charts about how this is covering 6 million and we expect \nthat to go to 10 million. We have also reviewed the fact that when we \nlook at the comparison with adults and children, we can see under this \nprogram that uncovered children have gone down dramatically and the \nadults have gone up. So this has been an extraordinary success. CBO has \nindicated this is the best way. If we are interested in covering \nchildren, CBO has indicated this is the way.\n  The point I wish to make in the time I have remaining is that when \nall is said and done, when we vote--and we are going to vote in just a \nlittle while--the American families ought to realize a very important \nfact; that is, every single Member of the Senate, with the exception of \none, has comprehensive health care and our children are all covered. \nUnderstand that, America? All of our children are covered. All of our \nchildren are covered. The next thing to know, Mr. And Mrs. America, \nyour taxpayer money is paying for 72 percent of our health care \ncoverage cost. Do we understand that now?\n  For those who are saying: Well, I am not going to support this \nbecause it costs too much; I am not going to support this because it \nmay be 300 percent of poverty, we get paid $160,000. We are well above \nthe 200, the 300, the 400 percent of poverty level. Yet we are going to \nhave Members on the floor of the Senate this afternoon who are going to \nturn thumbs down to American families who are watching this debate and \nknowing that our premiums, our health insurance is being paid for by \nthe American taxpayers. I wonder how people do that. I wonder how they \ndo it. You would think, if they are so offended about Federal \nGovernment spending or a Federal Government program, they wouldn't use \nit themselves. But, no, they do. They will take it. But when it comes \nto looking out for working families, there are going to be many in this \nChamber who will say: No, we are not going to look out for working \nfamilies. You can go ahead and pay for mine--I get my children \ncovered--but we don't think the Federal Government ought to be \ntampering with this issue. We don't think the Federal Government ought \nto be looking into whether it is going to have a program to provide \ncoverage for the sons and daughters of working families who cannot \nafford a $10,000 health insurance program that would cover themselves \nand their families although the taxpayers are paying for ours.\n  Mr. President, this is extraordinary hypocrisy we are about to see \nhere on the floor of the Senate. How can people in good faith do this \nand still accept the Federal Government help? How can they be \ncomplaining all afternoon about a Federal Government program and then \nhave a better Federal program paying for their own--paying for their \nown. It is just hypocrisy of the greatest sort, and I think that is \nsomething that is important.\n  The most important point has been mentioned eloquently by many of my \ncolleagues; that is, the importance of covering those children. The \nmost important point is that too many parents will cry themselves to \nsleep tonight wondering whether their child is $200 sick because they \nmay have to go to the emergency room. That is the heart of this.\n  Before we all get worked up, Mr. President, it is important to note \nwhat the financial bottom line on this is too. What has been pointed \nout over the course of the past days, again, is the question of \npriorities. We see in this chart here what we are talking about--\npriorities. That is what this vote is. Do we want to say we can cover, \nfor 1 day in Iraq at a cost of $300 million, 246,000 children; for 1 \nweek in Iraq at $2.5 billion, 1.7 million children; or for 41 days at a \ncost of $12.2 billion, 10 million kids?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a choice. There are those who \nwant to continue the ongoing flow of resources to Iraq when we have \nasked our military to do everything they could, and they have done it \nwith great valor, and yet still the Iraqi politicians cannot get it \ntogether. They are holding American service men and women hostage--\nhostage. The blood of American servicemen is flowing in Baghdad, and \nthis is wrong.\n  This is an issue of priorities. I believe we ought to invest in the \nchildren, and I think we have benefited enough here in the Senate from \nour own largess from the Federal taxpayers in terms of supporting \nourselves that we should be ashamed if we cannot see the responsibility \nwe have to look after children of working families in this country.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BURR. I would ask the Chair to notify me when I have 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. President, I heard my good friend from Massachusetts talk about \nthe Federal system. Let me take a minute to talk about the Federal \nsystem.\n  I have been here for 13 years. The coverage I have is less and the \ncost is more than when I was in the private sector working for a \ncompany with 50 employees, but I accept that.\n  Last year, I learned something new, though. When my oldest son became \n22, I got a notice that under the Federal plan he automatically falls \noff our insurance. Well, it happens for every Federal employee, but \nwhat was my experience? That is what I wish to share with you.\n  I called to find out what the Federal Government had negotiated so \nthat my child could have health insurance. They said the exact same \ncoverage would now be $5,400 for that individual--a 22-year-old college \nstudent, healthy as a bull. I decided I would go to North Carolina and \nI would negotiate to see if I couldn't find similar coverage. Not only \ncould I find similar coverage, but I found the same coverage, and I \nfound it with the same company. I now pay $1,500 a year for the same \ncoverage with the same company my son was covered by under the Federal \nhealth care plan. Now, here is\n\n[[Page S12237]]\n\nthe glaring difference. From a standpoint of my insurance, the Federal \nGovernment still pays the same amount and I still pay the same amount. \nWhen you take a healthy person off insurance, the premium doesn't go \ndown.\n  So for the 6 million kids who are targeted in SCHIP expansion--and \neverybody agrees 3 million are uninsured and 3 million are currently \ninsured--I don't want anybody to walk away and believe we are reducing \nthe premium cost of the families who are currently privately insuring \nthese kids. As a matter of fact, the CBO statistics prove exactly what \nhappened with my son, in the fact that we will now transition to a \nprivate sector program for him. For those 3 million SCHIP kids, we \ncould access health care coverage for an average of $1,130 a year. But \nin this legislation, it says we will be paying $3,950 a year for the \nsame level of coverage for those kids. We will pay it for those who \nweren't insured and we will pay it for those who were insured. Their \nfamily insurance won't go down, and we will pay three times as much for \nthe coverage than if we went to the private sector and we negotiated \nthat coverage.\n  To some up here, that makes unbelievable sense. To those of us who \ncome out of business, to those of us who understand what the people in \nour States whom we represent struggle with day in and day out, it makes \nabsolutely no sense.\n  Forget the fact that adults will still be covered under this \nChildren's Health Insurance Program; that private coverage will be \nreplaced with government-run coverage; that within this bill, this \nchildren's health care bill, are hidden earmarks--earmarks that create \na health care center in Memphis and earmarks that deal with the pension \nsystem in Michigan. My God, is this about kids and health care or is it \nabout what we can hide in a bill and disguise and cover as a benefit to \nchildren? It overturns an administration rule targeting SCHIP for low-\nincome children. The bill would overturn an HHS directive that requires \nStates to focus first on covering low-income kids, thereby eliminating \nany State accountability to cover the neediest kids first.\n  Well, most of us have done oversight work. If we could trust the \nStates or people we give money to, we wouldn't need oversight \ncommittees. But they meet every day, all day long, because we can't \ntrust any single entity to follow the rules. We are basically taking \nthe rules and throwing them away. Will we cover adults? Sure, States \nwill make decisions to cover adults. States will make decisions that \nwill go far outside of low-income children.\n  Now, the speaker prior to Senator Kennedy said this was not a debate \nabout health care reform. He is right. It is one of the few things I \nhave heard on the floor today that is accurate. But it should be. This \nshould be about health care reform.\n  It is the belief of some that we should feel good about overpaying \nfor a program that will cover 3 million uninsured in this country and \nreassign 3 million who are insured to now be under the dole of the \nFederal Government and the American taxpayer when, in fact, we have 47 \nmillion uninsured in this country. That is exactly what we should be \ndebating on the Senate floor today--how do we reform health care to \nwhere we cover the 47 million who are uninsured in this country.\n  Well, when we debated SCHIP before it was conferenced, we talked \nabout this incredible new plan that had been introduced by a number of \nus--the Every American Insured Health Act--a plan that covered 47 \nmillion uninsured. It did it in a budget-neutral way. It eliminated the \ncost shift that exists in our system today. We estimate saving $200 \nbillion a year. That is for a plan that I suggest is very much targeted \nfor 47 million uninsured, and the CBO will verify that it is budget \nneutral. For those who might not be one of those 47 million \nindividuals, who might say I don't have skin in this game: If we are \nable, through the elimination of cost shifting because we are now \nproviding primary care for people who today do not have insurance, who \nwill not be in the emergency room accessing care at the most expensive, \nmost inefficient place--who actually have preventive care, who have \nwellness access, who have a medical home, who have a doctor for the \nfirst time, and we are able to squeeze out $200 billion of waste that \nwe can pump back into health care--an amazing thing happens. It brings \neverybody's premiums down.\n\n  For a person in the country who might be sitting there saying, I have \ninsurance, I am covered, I am OK; it doesn't make any difference to me \nwhether they have this debate about insurance reform--it should matter \nto you because it is unsustainable to continue the inflation rate of \nhealth care at the rate it is going. If you want to see that end, if \nyou want to see your premium come down, we have to reform health care, \nand I tell you it starts with insuring 47 million Americans, not 3 \nmillion kids. We should provide the resources so those 47 million can \naccess their care in their State with the most competitive products \nthey can find for the scope of coverage.\n  This plan is out there. We introduced it. We didn't ask for a vote. \nWe should have. But we have another opportunity and that opportunity \nis, let's reauthorize the current SCHIP plan, let's put the dollars in \nthat are needed to make sure nobody falls off the system, but let's \nchoose not to expand it to include, at three times the cost, 3 million \nkids and take 3 million kids off their parents' insurance and put them \nover on the Government insurance for the taxpayers to pay for.\n  Rather than do that, why not engage in an honest, real debate on the \nfloor and let's come up with a reform package that covers the 47 \nmillion. Let's come out with a bill on the Senate floor that doesn't \nleave anybody behind. If we are going to cover 3 million uninsured \nkids, what about the other millions we are not covering? The reason we \ndo not go higher is because the higher you go, the larger the \npercentage of kids you are pulling off of their parents' insurance.\n  What we have learned from my experience, and I think nobody would \ndisagree with me: It saved me no money. The Federal Government's share \nof my health care today is more than it was when my first child was on \nmy insurance plan. And in December, I have the great fortune that I am \ngoing to go through this again. I am going to have my second child who \nwill become 22, and this arcane Federal guideline, statute, whatever it \nis at OPM, will kick in and they will say we will no longer cover your \nhealthy 22-year-old son.\n  I will go to North Carolina and I will access insurance, probably at \n$1,500 like his brother has. I will now have $3,000 a year in \nadditional coverage, only to find out that the Federal Government, for \nmy plan for me and my wife, is paying more money than we were before.\n  There is a reason. It is because when you take healthy people out of \nthe pool, the actuaries look at us old folks and say: You know, they \nare a greater risk to us.\n  The reverse is true, too. If over time we allow adults to infiltrate, \nwhich we already have, the children's insurance program, amazing things \nare going to happen. The premium is going to go up because we are \nputting older folks, who are less healthy, in the pool.\n  This makes a lot of sense to me because it works the same one way as \nit does the other. I think the sad thing today is I have to stand up \nand say I am not going to support an expansion of SCHIP, but I will \nsupport reauthorization of SCHIP with dollars that say nobody falls \noff.\n  I will also commit today to be the most engaged Member of the Senate \nif we will come down here and have a health care reform debate. Bring \nthe proposals to the floor. But don't come if you are not willing to \nprove you are going to insure 47 million uninsured in the country. \nDon't come unless you are willing to get all the cost shift out of the \nhealth care system. Don't come unless you are willing to take $200 \nbillion and have that impact positively on everybody's premium in this \ncountry. Don't come to the floor unless you are willing to extend \nwellness and preventive care through the policies we are able to \ncreate. Don't come unless you are willing to reform insurance products \nso they are truly market based. Don't come if you don't want insurance \nproducts to be portable, when employees can take them from job to job \njust like the retirement benefits we have and that we fought so hard \nfor.\n  Today I am disappointed because we have an opportunity in this \nprogram.\n\n[[Page S12238]]\n\nWe can't extend this program, though, if in fact passing a bad bill is \nthe result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from North Carolina \nwho just completed, I am willing to work with him on all the goals he \nwants to do. Earlier in the writing of this legislation, back during \nthe months of March, April, and May, we tried to get the White House to \nget some other Democrats involved and helping Senator Wyden, who wanted \nto go in that direction, and the White House couldn't deliver.\n  When it comes down to doing something all at once, or doing it in two \nseparate pieces, sometimes you have to do it in two separate pieces. \nThis is one of those issues. We have to do the Children's Health \nInsurance Program first and then I am going to join people like Senator \nBurr. Only I am going to be working in a bipartisan way with Senator \nWyden, to see what we can do to take care of all of the uninsured in \nAmerica.\n  We can do that. The President wants to do it. There are Democratic \nleaders who want to do it. Senator Clinton has come out with a program \ndoing it through private health insurance. But we cannot do it on this \nbill. The people who have been talking for 6 months about doing it on \nthis bill had an opportunity, when it was up in the Senate, to offer an \nalternative. For all their talk, for months, nothing was offered along \nthe lines of what they wanted to do.\n  Don't come back complaining after we get a compromise between the \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate, and still complain, when you \nhad a debate on this 2 months ago and you didn't have a plan to offer. \nYou can't get anything passed in this Senate if you don't have it down \non paper and offer it to us for consideration. But now, after this job \nis done, let's all get together and do it right. And we will do it \nright.\n  I want to spend my time talking about some of the misinformation that \nwas spread about this bill when it was first considered in the Senate 2 \nmonths ago and is still being considered today, just as if the debate \nand all the explanations we gave two Mondays ago didn't make a bit of \ndifference. So let's go through it again. Let's get very basic and \nlet's say where the misinformation is wrong.\n  I am not here to embarrass any of my colleagues so I am not going to \nuse any names. But yesterday a Member of my party took to the floor \ntalking about this bill pending before the Senate. I wish to address \nsome of those issues that were raised by my friend and colleague.\n  This colleague repeatedly referred to the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram as leading to a national system of health care.\n\n       The goal here is to radically expand the size of a public \n     insurance program to families that are really doing quite \n     well, families making up to $80,000 that may not have \n     children, or the children may already be insured by the \n     private sector because you want to move more people onto the \n     public insurance system because you want to have a \n     nationalized system.\n\n  I have one simple question to ask all the critics of this bill who, \nwhen confronted with the actual policies in this compromise, respond by \nshrieking: 80,000 income, $80,000 income; and that question is: If this \nbill became law tomorrow, how many families earning $80,000 a year \nwould be eligible for this Children's Health Insurance Program? And the \nanswer is: None. None.\n  As they say in baseball: You can look it up.\n  I have one simple question to critics who, when asked to respond to \nwhat is actually in the black and white of this bill, react by \nscreaming, as we heard in that quote I just gave: National health care, \nsocialized medicine. And that question I ask those folks is this: Under \nwhat contorted reasoning is a capped block grant inclusive of policies \nthat prohibit new waivers for parents, phase childless adults \ncompletely off of this children's program, and limit matching funding \nfor higher income kids, nationalized health care? That is what this \nbill does. It takes care of problems that have developed over the last \n10 years. There have been legitimate criticisms of it. It fixes those \nproblems and doesn't do any of the things that people say are going to \nhappen, such as families of $80,000 being able to put their kids on \nthis program.\n  You can call all of this rhetoric something. You can call it anything \nyou want. But in Iowa you can't call a cow a chicken and have it be \ntrue.\n  I have some charts here I want people to see. This colleague of mine \nalso referred yesterday to what is ``budget gimmickry'' about this \nlegislation. I have this response to that colleague of mine. He said \nthis yesterday, ``There is the problem.''\n  He was pointing to this chart that he had up at that time. Let me \nstart the quote over again.\n\n       For example, there is the problem that there is a scam \n     going on, a scam in this bill as to how it is paid for. You \n     can see this chart I have in the Chamber. This reflects the \n     increased costs of the bill as it goes forward. But, in order \n     to make their own budget rules, which they claim so \n     aggressively to be following, such as pay-go--\n\n  meaning pay as you go--\n\n       they have to take the program, in the year 2013, from a $16 \n     billion annual spending level down to essentially zero. In \n     other words, they are zeroing out this program in the year \n     2013 . . . that is called a scam.\n\n  I end the quote of my colleague.\n  I am a proud member of the Budget Committee. I think I know how the \nbudget process works. I believe in fiscal discipline and spending \nrestraints. I agree that even under a Republican-controlled Congress, \nspending got out of control. Part of the reason why Republicans lost \ncontrol of the Congress last election is because we didn't show concern \nenough to control spending.\n  I believe part of the reason the President is threatening a veto of \nthis bill is he is trying to play catchup for failing to veto 6 years \nof spending bills when Republicans controlled the Congress. I agree \nthat fiscal discipline ought to be applied to spending bills and we \nshould pay some attention to the level of spending and how spending is \nfinanced.\n  From that standpoint, let me focus on the criticism that has been \nmade about how this Children's Health Insurance bill is financed. We \nneed to step back, and in stepping back we need to look at the whole \npicture. The Children's Health Insurance Program is a pretty small part \nof that picture. The thing about the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram is that it is not like Medicaid or Medicare. It is not a \npermanent program. This program expired after 10 years. We are working \non it now to reauthorize it. It will expire after 5 years. You never \nhear of Medicare or Medicaid expiring, sunsetting, so it has to be \nreenacted. It has been going on for 43 years.\n  SCHIP, then, is not an entitlement and I have heard my colleagues \nrecently refer to it as an entitlement.\n  Now, there were some who wanted to turn this Children's Health \nInsurance Program into an entitlement program. So it has been \ndiscussed, I admit. I am not one of those. And nobody in the Senate \nthat I know of spoke that way. But the House bill would have lifted the \ncap on the national allotment for the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram and extended the program forever.\n  The word ``entitlement'' may be applicable. I fought hard to maintain \nthe block grant concept, the sunset concept--as has been the case since \nthe program was started 10 years ago--- and to ensure that the program \ndid expire so that in the future, Congress would be forced to \nreevaluate it and maybe improve or cut back, whatever the situation is \n5 years from now, just as we have been doing this year with the sunset \nprogram.\n  So despite the best efforts of House Democrats, because in the House \nit is more partisan than the way we do business in the Senate, this is \na bipartisan bill. Regardless of the best efforts of House Democrats \nunder the compromise bill when the program expires, it truly ends. The \nday after the authorization ends, poof, no more Children's Health \nInsurance Program unless Congress reenacts it.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program before us is an expiring \nprogram. So let me say that again. It is an expiring program. It is not \nan entitlement. Why do colleagues keep trying to fuzzy the debate by \nusing words that are not applicable?\n  Well, I know most of us in this Chamber would no sooner let the \nDepartment of Defense expire then we would\n\n[[Page S12239]]\n\nlet the Children's Health Insurance Program expire. That is a simple \nfact. But that does not make it an entitlement any more than the \nDepartment of Defense programs are entitlements. Because it is an \nexpiring program, it is subject then to a very particular budget rule \nthat makes this chart not exactly intellectually honest.\n  The budget rule says the Congressional Budget Office must score \nfuture spending for programs based upon last year's program current \nauthorization. So the baseline for the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram right now, and for next year and next year, is $5 billion. For \nthe next 5 years, the baseline each of those years is $5 billion, and \nalso for the next 10 years. If you want to go beyond 5 years, and we do \nnot do it in this bill, but sometimes the Congressional Budget Office \ndoes it, the baseline is still $5 billion. It is actually $5 billion a \nyear forever as far as the Congressional Budget Office is concerned.\n  Does anyone in this Chamber think the budget rule governing the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is realistic? Well, it is obviously \nnot. But that is the way the Congressional Budget Office does business \naround here. So let's not kid ourselves.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, over 1 million children \nwould lose coverage if we simply reauthorized the Children's Health \nInsurance Program at the assumed baseline of $5 billion a year. Now, I \nhave never heard anybody around here saying they want to throw a \nmillion kids off of this program. So what do you do? You provide for \nwhere you are.\n  Well, you can throw them off if you want to, but I have not heard any \nof my colleagues, even the ones complaining about this bill, I have \nnever heard them complain that we ought to throw 1 million kids off the \nprogram.\n  Who would go home and tell their constituents that they voted to do \nthat? But over 1 million kids would lose coverage. That is not \npolitically viable.\n  During the consideration of this Senate Finance Committee bill, there \nwas a children's health insurance alternative that included an increase \nin the Children's Health Insurance Program by spending $9\\1/2\\ billion \nover 5 years.\n  Now, understand, the White House ought to hear that. Even Republicans \nin the Senate are telling the President: Your $5 billion will not do \nwhat you want it to do. Those are even the Members who oppose the \nFinance bill, acknowledging that $5 billion was not enough. Everyone \nknows the current baseline is not realistic, that it created a hole in \nthe budget that had to be filled.\n  So what do we do? If you do not want to throw kids off, you fill that \nhole. It is that simple. We had to comply, though, with the budget \nrule. That is the way you have to do business around here. You get a \npoint of order against your bill, and you have to have 60 votes to \noverride it. So we did.\n  Do those budget rules make sense? Well, that is a question for the \nBudget Committee, not for our Finance Committee. The Budget Committee \nsets those rules, and they are not for the Finance Committee to change.\n  There is another budget rule the Finance Committee was required to \nfollow. That rule is called pay-go, pay-as-you-go, which means that you \nraise revenue or cut spending someplace else to pay for the new things \nyou are doing. It means the bill needs to cover its 6-year cost, and \nthat makes sense. After all, this bill proposes new spending, and we \nshould pay for it. And this bill does it. This bill complies with those \nbudget rules. It complies with the pay-as-you-go requirement.\n  Now, the children's health reauthorization that we are debating is \nonly a 5-year authorization. And, as I think everyone knows, the bill \nis paid for by an increase in the tobacco tax, just like the original \nCHIP bill was paid for when it was created by a Republican-controlled \nCongress 10 years ago.\n  Now, just like in 1997 when the Republicans did it, we had a problem \nwith how the tobacco tax worked. The revenue from the cigarette tax is \nnot growing as fast as health care costs grow. So that means the \nrevenue raiser is not growing as fast as the costs of the program. So \nthe Finance Committee did what it was required to do to comply with \npay-go budget rules. The Finance Committee bill reduces children's \nhealth insurance funding to just below the funding that is in the \ncurrent baseline.\n  That means the Finance Committee, in 5 years, will have the same \nproblem we faced in putting this bill together today. They will have to \ncome up with the funds to keep the program running, if that is what \nthey decide to do 5 years from now.\n  We are covering even more low-income kids in this bill. That is a \ngood thing. Assuming that Congress does not tackle the increasing \nproblematic issue of health care costs across the board, as Senator \nBurr was begging us to do, the Finance Committee, in 5 years, will have \na bigger hole to fill. They will have more kids to keep covering, and \nhealth care costs will be even higher than they are today. That is for \nthe Finance Committee to face down the road 5 years.\n  That is just like the job the Finance Committee had today if we were \ngoing to continue the Children's Health Insurance Program beyond the \n10-year sunset. So what I am saying is, this is really nothing new. \nNow, my friend and colleague whom I have been quoting all the time, a \nperson for whom I have great admiration, has once again distorted the \nso-called cliff that he referred to on this chart. That is where the \nline goes down after the year 2012.\n  He has, once again, produced a chart that shows a dramatic decline in \nfunding of the program. Here is the chart used to raise the issue about \nfinancing the compromised bill, which is largely the Senate Finance \nCommittee bill. It shows only the funding in our bill.\n  The approach that this chart takes reminds me of the story of the \nseven blind men trying to describe an elephant. Each described \ndifferent parts of the elephant: one the tusk, another one the tail, \nanother one the ear, another one the leg, and none could describe the \nwhole elephant. They could not see the whole picture. So we have to \nlook at the whole picture.\n  As we all know, this program was created to supplement Medicaid. So I \nam going to show you the whole picture. You have to involve Medicaid. \nThe goal of the program was to encourage States to provide coverage to \nuninsured children with incomes just above the Medicaid eligibility: \nMedicaid for the lowest income people, SCHIP to help lower income \npeople who maybe could not afford private health insurance or their \nworkplace did not have it.\n  So to put my colleague's concerns into perspective, we need to look \nat the whole picture. We need, and we should, look at SCHIP spending as \nit relates to Medicaid spending. I would like to draw your attention to \nthis chart so everyone can fully appreciate the consequences of our \nSCHIP program that is a fiscal disaster to some of my friends, as you \nlisten to the debate, the consequences of the SCHIP program in the \ncontext of the Medicaid Program which it supplements. So I want you to \ntake a closer look.\n  Let's start with this tiny green line down to the bottom. That is the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program under current law, the straight \nline across the bottom. I know we have to squint to see it. But that \ngreen line represents the Children's Health Insurance Program baseline \nunder current law.\n  As I have already discussed, it is $5 billion each year for the next \n10 years, and maybe forever, depending on what Congress does in the \nfuture.\n  Now, let's look more closely and honestly at the actual problem we \nare facing. This massive orange area above that green line I just \nreferred to is Medicaid for several years into the future, 10 years \ninto the future. It is a lot bigger, isn't it, than the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program?\n  Then, on top of that, we are looking to add what is in this bill, new \nspending for the Children's Health Insurance Program. The new spending \nis represented by that narrow blue line across the top there labeled \n``funding in the compromise agreement.''\n  Again, you almost have to squint to see that blue line. And as you \ncan clearly see then, costs are growing at a rapid pace overall. The \noverwhelming driver of the cost is not the relatively small increase of \nthe blue line. And then the decline, you see a decline in that blue \nline on top in CHIP spending. That is just kind of a blip on the radar \ncompared to the massive increase we see in Medicaid spending.\n  We have a big problem. It is not going to go away. But it is not the\n\n[[Page S12240]]\n\nChildren's Health Insurance Program. It is the entitlement program that \nSCHIP is not a part of because I made a point--10 times in the last 2 \ndays--that this is not an entitlement, even though my colleagues still \ntalk about entitlement. Where are they coming from? What planet? I \ndon't know.\n  But entitlement spending is, in fact, ballooning out of control in \nfuture years if we do not act. We are going to struggle to keep these \nprograms afloat. When you look at the whole picture, this whole \npicture, it puts things about the SCHIP program and the criticism of \nthe SCHIP program in perspective. But the criticism is not justified.\n  Now, remember all of the fire and brimstone about the awful cliff on \nthe chart that we had before, the awful cliff of this compromise bill? \nThe way that it continues to be described, you would think the world is \nabout to end. And now looking at the big picture, where exactly is that \ncliff, you might ask? Again, you will have to squint to see that cliff. \nThat cliff starts downward after the year 2012. So you saw on the \nprevious chart, you see that big dropoff. That is what I raise about \nthe intellectual accuracy of that chart. OK?\n  If we go back to the other chart and look at the real program, that \nis how it goes down a little bit after 2012. It is not that dramatic \ncompared to what we are doing on Medicaid. You can see how this debate \nhas tried to distort what we are accomplishing.\n  So this little blue line is what this debate is all about. This \nlittle blue line is the funding in the compromise agreement. This \nlittle blue line is what all the fuss is about. It seems like a whole \nlot of hollering is going on over a dip that is hard to even see.\n  Let me tell you what the compromise agreement and this little blue \nline is not. This is not, as some people want us to believe, a \ngovernment takeover of health care. This little blue line is not \nsocialized medicine or nationalized medicine or anything like that. \nThis little blue line is not bringing the Canadian health care system \nto America. That little blue line is not the end of the world that we \nknow. To suggest that this little blue line and this tiny dip we see \nafter the year 2012 is the dismantling of the U.S. health care system \nborders on hysteria.\n  While I concede that allotments under our bill in the years beyond \nthe 5-year reauthorization in this legislation do behave as described \nin my friend's chart, the one with the big dropoff, I don't think it \nwarrants the heated rhetoric we are hearing today and yesterday. SCHIP \nis not a real fiscal problem. The problem is that issue nobody wants to \ntalk about. What are we going to do about entitlements? Nobody has \npolitical guts enough to agree with it, but they want to put this \nChildren's Health Insurance Program on the same par as those Medicaid \nissues.\n  My friend I have been quoting all day and I worked together a year \nago, now maybe 2 years ago, on the Deficit Reduction Act, to try to \nrein in this egregious Medicaid spending. I am proud of the work we \ndid. He praised me so much 2 years ago for the heavy lifting I did for \nthe entire Senate on saving some money--I should say Senate Republicans \nfor saving some money--but how times have changed. We also found out \nhow hard it is, at the time of the Deficit Reduction Act, to dial back \nentitlement spending. Even in a Republican-controlled Congress and even \nwith the special procedural protections of reconciliation, we only \nsucceeded in shaving $26 billion off that orange part of the chart. The \nproblem of entitlement spending is still out there, and SCHIP is like a \npimple on an elephant compared to the elephant that Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid are.\n  I am very hopeful that once we are done with the CHIP debate, we can \nroll up our sleeves and get down to the business of tackling health \ncare reform on a much larger scale, as Senator Byrd referred to, and I \nhave referred to Senator Wyden from Oregon working on it over a long \nperiod of time. I know Senator Wyden wants to take this on, and I am \ngoing to join him in that bipartisan effort.\n  As I have said many times, I had hoped we could have used this debate \non SCHIP to focus on these larger issues of health care reform and \nhelping the uninsured. I tried to engage my colleagues on the other \nside. I was repeatedly thwarted in that effort and told that SCHIP had \nto get done first. Well, hopefully we can get SCHIP done and then turn \nto the bigger issues so the next time the Congress has to tackle the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, this big orange block would not be \nso huge.\n  Before closing, another criticism we had of this bill in the last \ndebate 2 or 3 months ago was this. I will quote Senator Lott. I don't \nthink he will mind my using his name. He was quoted on July 31: The \nHouse is going to pass a bill at what, maybe $80, $90, $100 billion, \npaid for by taking money away from Medicare beneficiaries. We go on \nconference, what will happen? What always happens. You split the \ndifference. We are at 60. They are at 90. How about $75 billion. How is \nthat going to be paid for? Is it going to be paid for by cutting \nbenefits for the elderly or raising taxes of all kinds?\n  Well, it is paid for the same way we paid for it on July 31, 2007, \nwith the tobacco tax, not by Medicare money.\n  He went on to say: I fear what is going to happen in conference. I \ndon't know. Maybe the Senator from Montana and Senator Grassley can sit \nthere and say: Oh, no, no, no, we are not going above what we passed in \nthe Senate. But I think the reverse is going to be true. This is the \nbase. The $60 billion is the beginning.\n  Where did we come out? Exactly where Senator Baucus and I told the \nSenate we were going to come out. We came out with the $35 billion that \npassed this body. So all those people who are worried about the \nposition of the Senate being lost in conference by Senator Baucus and I \nrepresenting the Senate--and let's say Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nHatch as well--would you please tell me you were wrong?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today is truly an important day for \nAmerica's children. On Tuesday, the House passed the Children's Health \nInsurance Bill, and very soon, the Senate will vote. We will provide \n$35 billion over the next 5 years to expand health insurance coverage \nfor the children of America's working families.\n  We know that there is a crisis in health care in this country. More \nthan 46 million Americans don't have any health insurance coverage; 9 \nmillion of them are children, and most of them are in working families. \nThat is a disgrace.\n  Now there are many proposals out there to increase the number of \nAmericans with health insurance coverage. As Congress begins to \nconsider these proposals, there is something we can do today to \ndecrease the number of uninsured children by nearly 4 million.\n  Earlier this year, in February, I introduced to the Senate Finance \nCommittee a Baltimore family that has benefited from CHIP. Craig and \nKim Lee Bedford are working parents who own a small business and simply \ncannot afford health insurance for their 5 children through the \ncommercial market. Through the Maryland MCHP program, the Bedford \nFamily's 5 children receive affordable, quality health care.\n  We have the evidence that enrollment in the CHIP program improves the \nhealth of the children who are enrolled, their families, and the \ncommunities in which they live.\n  When previously uninsured children are enrolled in CHIP, they are far \nmore likely to receive regular primary medical and dental care, and \nthey are less likely to use the emergency room for visits that could be \nhandled in a doctor's office.\n  They are more likely to get necessary immunizations and other \npreventive care, and to get the prescription drugs they need.\n  But there are still millions of children who have not enrolled in the \nprograms offered by their States.\n  Our States are making progress--simplifying their enrollment \nprocedures, expanding outreach efforts, and using joint applications \nfor Medicaid and CHIP so that families can enroll together.\n  But this reauthorization bill, with $35 billion in added funding, is \nneeded to help them make real progress.\n\n[[Page S12241]]\n\n  I want to talk for a moment about Maryland's program.\n  It has one of the highest income eligibility thresholds in the \nNation, and this is important because of the high cost of living in our \nState.\n  It is at 300 percent not because our Governor wants to move people \nfrom private insurance to public insurance plans. It is at 300 percent \nbecause working families at this income level do not have access to \naffordable health insurance policies. Those families need CHIP.\n  Children under the age of 19 may be eligible for MCHIP if their \nfamily income is at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, \nor up to $34,000 for a family of three.\n  We also have an MCHIP Premium program, which extends coverage to \nchildren at moderate income levels--between 200 and 300 percent of \npoverty, or up to $51,500 for a family of 3.\n  The premiums, which are paid per family, regardless of the number of \neligible children, are between $44 and $55 a month.\n  Our program has been a true success. Enrollment has grown from about \n38,000 enrollees in 1999 to more than 101,000 today.\n  In my State of Maryland, the need has always exceeded the available \nfunds. The Federal match through the CHIP formula established in 1997 \nis not enough to meet all of the costs of the MCHIP program.\n  Some States do not use their entire allotment, while other States, \nlike Maryland, have expenditures that exceed their allotments. Congress \nhas addressed this problem by redistributing the excess to the \nshortfall States.\n  The 109th Congress passed provisions to address the Fiscal Year 2007 \nfunding shortfalls.\n  That bill didn't include any new money, but it allowed the \nredistribution of $271 million already in the program, and that was \nimportant for thousands of Maryland families.\n  Without that legislation, Maryland would have been forced to either \nfreeze enrollment or reduce eligibility for CHIP.\n  Now, we must move forward for future years. That is what we are doing \non the floor of the Senate today.\n  This conference report increases the allotment for Maryland for next \nyear from its current projected level of $72.4 million for fiscal year \n2008 to $178.8 million.\n  It also allows us to continue to cover children in families with \nincomes up to 300 percent of poverty. Maryland would also have access \nto a contingency fund if a shortfall arises and additional funds based \non enrollment gains. With this new money, Maryland can cover as many as \n42,800 children who are now uninsured over the next 5 years.\n  There is another vitally important part of this conference report \nthat I want to talk about. Title 5 ensures that dental care is a \nguaranteed benefit under CHIP.\n  According to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, dental \ndecay is the most common chronic childhood disease among children in \nthe United States.\n  It affects one in five children aged 2 to 4; half of those aged 6-8, \nand nearly three-fifths of 15-year-olds. Tooth decay is five times more \ncommon than asthma among school age children. Children living in \npoverty suffer twice as much tooth decay as middle and upper income \nchildren. Thirty-nine percent of black children have untreated tooth \ndecay in their permanent teeth; 11 percent of the Nation's rural \npopulation have never visited a dentist; an estimated 25 million people \nlive in areas that lack adequate dental care services.\n  I want to say a few words about a young man named Deamonte Driver. He \nwas only 12 years old when he died last February from an untreated \ntooth abscess. It started with an infected tooth. Deamonte began to \ncomplain about a headache on January 11. By the time he was evaluated \nat Children's Hospital's emergency room, the infection had spread to \nhis brain, and after several surgeries and a lengthy hospital stay, he \npassed away.\n  For want of a tooth extraction that would have cost about $80, he was \nsubjected to extensive brain surgery that eventually cost more than a \nquarter of a million dollars. That is more than 3,000 times as much as \nthe cost of the extraction. After Deamonte's death, the public took \nnote of the link between dental care and overall health that medical \nresearchers have known for years.\n  His death showed us that, as C. Everett Koop once said, ``there is no \nhealth without oral health.''\n  Deamonte's brother, DaShawn, is still in need of extensive dental \ncare, and, like him, there are millions of other American children who \nrely on public health care systems for their dental needs.\n  No child should ever go without dental care. I have said before that \nI hoped Deamonte Driver's death would serve as a wake-up call for the \n110th Congress. I believe that it has.\n  Earlier this year, I brought Deamonte's picture down to the floor. I \nhave it with me again today.\n  It is here because we must never forget that behind all the data \nabout enrollment and behind every CBO estimate, there are real children \nin need of care.\n  When I spoke about Deamonte right after his death, I urged my \ncolleagues to ensure that the CHIP reauthorization bill we send to the \nPresident includes guaranteed dental coverage.\n  This bill would make guaranteed dental coverage under CHIP the law of \nthe land, and I want to take this time to personally thank the members \nof the conference committee for ensuring that a dental guarantee is in \nthis bill.\n  One other tragic piece of Deamonte's story is that, once his dental \nproblems came to light, his social worker had to call 20 dental offices \nbefore finding one who would accept him as a patient.\n  The conference report includes a provision that will make it much \neasier for parents and social workers to locate participating \nproviders.\n  It requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to include on \nits Web site www.insurekidsnow.gov and the HHS toll free number, 1-877-\nKIDS-NOW, information about the dental coverage provided by each \nState's CHIP and Medicaid programs, as well as an up-to-date list of \nproviders who are accepting CHIP and Medicaid patients.\n  Parents will be able--with one phone call or a few mouse clicks--to \nfind out what their child is covered for and where they can receive \ncare. There is more work to do, as I have learned from working with my \ndedicated colleagues here on this issue, particularly Senators Bingaman \nand Snowe.\n  We still have to improve reimbursement for dental providers, and get \ngrants to the states to allow them to offer dental wraparound coverage \nfor those who may have health coverage, but no dental insurance. But \nthese provisions are a very good start.\n  I am deeply disappointed by the President's statements about CHIP. \nWhen he says that this is Government-run insurance, he is mistaken.\n  This program is administered by our States, with help from the \nFederal Government, to ensure that working families who cannot afford \nprivate health insurance, can enroll their children in private health \ninsurance plans.\n  I would hope that after today's vote in the Senate, he will \nreconsider his position on this bipartisan, responsible, and paid-for \nbill.\n  CHIP covers urban and rural children, who live in every state, \nwhether Democratic or Republican.\n  Congress has come together after months of work to reauthorize a \nprogram that's been a proven success and has served the needs of \nAmerica's working families. I urge the President to join us in this \ntruly bipartisan effort and sign this bill into law.\n  I thank the leadership for bringing forward this bill. We have talked \nabout the fact that we have 46 million people without health insurance, \n9 million children without health insurance. We can do something about \nit today. This bill will cover 4 million uninsured children. We can do \nsomething about the uninsured. During the course of the hearings in the \nSenate Finance Committee, I brought Craig and Kim Lee Bedford, \nconstituents from Maryland, to testify before the committee. These are \nworking parents with five children. They simply could not afford health \ninsurance. But the CHIP program has allowed us in our State to cover \nthese children. Mrs. Bedford said: I no longer have to decide whether \nmy child is sick enough to go to a doctor. That is the practical effect \nof this legislation. It is going to help families in our State.\n\n[[Page S12242]]\n\n  I heard the arguments about over 200 percent of poverty. In our \nState, we cover up to 300 percent of poverty. That is $51,500 a year. \nYou have to pay a premium. The premium is between $44 to $55 a month \nfor the entire family. But in Maryland, you can't afford health \ninsurance if you make that type of income for a family. This bill will \nallow us to cover those children. For my own State of Maryland, bottom \nline means we are going to be able to cover 42,800 more children. In \nMaryland, we had the tragic circumstances of Deamonte Driver, a 12-\nyear-old who died as a result of untreated tooth decay. That should \nnever happen in America. This bill will help us to cover American \nfamilies and our children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I am encouraged that the Senate is taking \nup the whole issue of health care in America. We know this is one of \nthe most important issues to the American people. We know a number of \nAmericans don't have access to health care, and it is very important \nthat we debate this as a Senate, not just children but the American \ngoal of how do we get every American insured. How do we make sure every \nAmerican has access to good health care throughout their life and their \nchildren do as well? We can agree on that goal. It is not just about \nchildren, it is about health care in America and figuring out as a \nCongress how do we make sure every American has access to good health \ncare.\n  The question today and the question we need to continue to debate is: \nDo we want the Government to provide that health care or do we want to \nfigure out how to make sure that individuals have access to a health \ninsurance policy that they can own and keep? Because we know the best \nand most efficient delivery of health care is going to come through \nindividually owned policies that people don't lose when they change \njobs, they don't lose when they retire. I hope our focus will turn from \nGovernment health care to helping individuals have a policy that they \nown and can keep. We should all question, do we want the Government \nthat ran the Katrina cleanup or runs the Post Office or spends $1,000 \nfor a hammer at the Pentagon and wastes billions, literally hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse every year, do we want \nthat Government to take care of our children, to take care of our \nseniors, and to run the health care system today?\n  We are talking about health insurance for children. A number of \npeople are saying individuals cannot afford to buy it. Before we \nconsider that, we need to realize this Congress has made it very hard, \nif not virtually impossible, for individual Americans to have a health \ninsurance policy they can own and keep. We need to be reminded that \nthis Congress has created a Tax Code that gives tax breaks to \nbusinesses who provide health insurance but not to individuals who want \nto buy it. That means the cost of individual insurance is higher and \nmany times unaffordable. We have proposed in Congress--unfortunately, \nmy Democratic colleagues have fought back--to allow small businesses to \ncome together and pool their resources so they can buy health insurance \nand make it available to their employees when they cannot afford it as \nindividual companies. But this Senate killed that idea. It would have \nmade it more affordable for individuals. Yet we complain about the \nuninsured.\n  We know a number of States have added so many mandates onto their \ninsurance policies, it is too expensive for citizens to buy it. Yet \nthis Congress will not allow Americans to buy health insurance anywhere \nthey want in the country. We have allowed individual States to create \nmonopolies, where someone in South Carolina can't buy a policy from New \nMexico unless it is certified in South Carolina. We know we could \ncreate a national market and make individual policies much less \nexpensive, but this Congress would not do it.\n  The fact is, this Congress has made individual health insurance \nunaffordable and unaccessible to Americans and now, today, we are going \nto ride in on our white horse and save the day with Government health \ninsurance.\n  Children should have health insurance. This whole plan of children's \nhealth insurance started for poor children whose families make too much \nfor Medicaid but were still under 200 percent of poverty. Today we are \nproposing not just to reauthorize and continue this program for poor \nchildren but to raise it so children and families with incomes up to \n$82,000 are going to get free Government health care. When this plan is \nfully implemented, about 75 percent of the children who live in America \ntoday will be on Government health insurance, which means we as a \nCongress have made a decision that we want America to have Government \nhealth plans and not to have individual plans they can own and keep. \nBecause if 75 percent of the children are on Government plans and our \nseniors are on Government plans and many of our military are on \nGovernment plans, there is no more room for private market health \ninsurance policies to work. In effect, what we are doing is deciding \ntoday that we want national health care in America when we vote for \nthis.\n  I have heard this bill talked about as a compromise and that we can \nsplit the difference. But colleagues, you can't split the difference \nbetween freedom and socialism. You can't split the difference between \nGovernment health care and individuals owning their own health plans. \nWe are talking about something that doesn't exist. What we have split \nthe difference between is spending $80 or $90 billion more than we need \nfor poor children, and we have brought that down a little bit. We have \nfunded it with some bogus funding, and we think we are doing something \nto help America.\n  This bill is not for children. This bill is selling out the future \nfor every child in America because we are turning this country into a \nsocialistic style of government, taking away people's freedom. We are \nhere, once again, pretending we are doing something we are not. We are \nnot taking care of children. We are selling their freedom away under \nthe pretense of children. We have learned in this body that all we have \nto do is do it for the children and come down and say it applies to \nchildren, and we dare anyone to vote against it. I am going to vote \nagainst it because this is not for our children, and it is not for our \ncountry.\n  We are selling out our future. If we would focus ourselves on helping \nindividuals access private policies, we could get every American \ninsured. If we made our Tax Code fair for everyone, if we allowed \nStates to partner with us, we could have every American with a health \ninsurance policy without the Government running this. We should not \neven pretend we expect this Government to run the health care system in \nan efficient way.\n  Colleagues, I appreciate the debate on health care. We need to have \nit. We need to have an American goal that every citizen is going to \nhave access to good health care and health insurance. This is not the \nway to do it. This is a decision to become more like socialized Europe, \nto sell out our freedoms, and to give Government control of our health \ncare.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to rethink this decision to vote for \nthis bill, and to vote against it.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I believe I have up \nto 10 minutes, and I yield myself that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have heard my distinguished friend \nfrom South Carolina, and have great respect for his thought process, \nfor the way he presents things. Frankly, I do not mind listening to \nhim, so I was here early, and I got to hear what he had to say.\n  But we have been working on this issue of SCHIP for more than a few \nmonths, in fact, for more than a few years. So some come in at the end \nand have a whole new theory about it, and others, like myself, who \nhappened to be the Budget chairman back a few years ago, when this \nprogram was born--and I remember making room for it in a budget \nresolution so it could be a reserve fund, and we could end up with this \namount of money. It kind of lived through 2 or 3 years of getting \nknocked around and not doing its job, and doing part of it, and as \nthings progressed I ended up supporting a proposal that involved SCHIP.\n\n[[Page S12243]]\n\n  This Children's Health Insurance Program Act of 2007 is now before \nus. I indicated my support for it when Senator Chuck Grassley and his \ncohort, the chairman of the Finance Committee from Montana, were \nputting together a compromise bill using this money that had been \nallocated for health care some 3 or 4 years ago. So I supported it as \nSenator Grassley and others put together a program.\n  New Mexico has a terrible problem with uninsured children. Nearly 25 \npercent of the children have no insurance--worst in the country. SCHIP \nwill help this problem, no doubt about it.\n  The bill we are voting on today--whether my good friend who spoke \njust before me agrees with the terminology--is a compromise. Many on \nthe other side of the aisle wanted $50 billion to $70 billion more in \nspending. On my side of the aisle, they wanted much less. Some wanted \nas low as $5 billion. This bill gave us $35 billion--right down the \nmiddle. Whether that means anything, it does to me. It means some \npeople worked very hard to try to get a bill we could support, that \nwould begin to get us somewhere with reference to changing the \ndirection of health care for children who might see light someday. The \nbill gave us $35 billion, I repeat.\n  In August, I came to the floor and made a statement. I said I did not \nlike what the House of Representatives was doing. I said I did not \nsupport massive increases in spending and eligibility proposed by the \nHouse. I made it very clear I did not want a reauthorization that \nincluded revisions to the Medicare Program.\n  Now, I am just one Senator, but it turns out that five or six or \nseven Republican Senators somehow or other all thought the same way. \nThey were thinking just as I was, that we were not going to let \nourselves get used so that this SCHIP was opening a crack in the door, \nand we did not know what we were talking about, and we would open the \ndoor, and we would spend three times what we had in mind.\n  Well, that was not going to happen. Senator Grassley came around and \nasked, and I said: $35 billion. That is it. If you put any more in, I \nam out.\n  I remember him coming to me and saying: Is that it?\n  Twice I said: That is it. Don't bother me anymore. I am your friend, \nbut anybody can understand $35 billion is $35 billion. It is not $38 \nbillion. It is not $50 billion. If you want to do any more, go look for \nsomebody else to make your majority.\n  He said: No, I don't want to do that. I want you. Is that all you \nwill do?\n  I said: Yes, that is all I will do.\n  So everything I did is not part of the record, but I am reflecting \nfor the Senate and for those on my side of the aisle who do not \nunderstand why I am doing what I am doing and want the President to \nveto this bill. I do not want him to veto it. I think it is a mistake, \nand I am saying it right now, and I will say it again.\n  But I did say I did not want massive increases in spending and \neligibility proposed by the House. I did say I did not want a \nreauthorization that included revisions to the Medicare Program. \nClearly, I made that point. I made it not only to Senator Grassley, but \nI made it to the chairman of the committee, Senator Max Baucus of \nMontana.\n  We got to where Senator Baucus would speak to me every 2 or 3 days \nand report to me what was going on. I was not on the conference. But \nthe reason he did that was he understood if he went to conference and \nchanged that $35 billion, which had become a very important number, he \nwould start losing me.\n  So I was just as effective as being at the conference, but so were \nabout seven or eight others who were still on board and who still think \n$35 billion is enough because the cheapest insurance around is \ninsurance to cover children. We all know that. Now, that is not \ndegrading. It is a fact. You can buy more insurance for children per \ndollar than for any other class of people. That is logical. Children do \nnot get sick as much as old people. They do not get sick as much as \nmiddle-aged people. So they are healthy. The insurance is cheap.\n\n  Now, the conference committee listened--the one that Senator Grassley \nand Senator Baucus were part of--they compromised the bill before us, \nand they did it in a fair way. What was fair? Thirty-five billion \ndollars--no more, no less--the amount we had agreed to that we said we \nwould help them with. If they wanted to dream about big dreams for this \nsmall program--that I remember vividly we started in the Budget \nCommittee, and it languished around. We started it some 4 years ago, or \n5. I have not been back as chairman of that committee for quite a \nwhile, so it was not done yesterday.\n  The conference committee, as I said, listened, and they did exactly \nwhat Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus had told us would happen. They \nprovided $35 billion in new resources to provide health coverage for \nmillions more children in working families.\n  Here we get into an argument: Who is working in families and who is \nnot? Well, I understand we could have that argument and extend it \nbeyond 8 o'clock. We could be here until morning. But we are not going \nto do that. It is established.\n  It strengthens outreach and enrollment efforts to make sure all \nchildren who are eligible for the program get the services they need. \nThat has always been a problem with children. The Presiding Officer \nknows that. We cover children, and then in 2 years they come back and \nsay: Yes, we covered them, but they did not get covered.\n  What do you mean?\n  Well, we did not find them.\n  Well, how do we find them?\n  Well, the best way is to wait until they go to the emergency room, \nand then you find them in the emergency room and you sign them up.\n  I thought: My, is that the best way we can do it? It turns out it is \nvery difficult, especially among our poor people, to get them to round \nup their children and come and get them lined up. The best way is if \nthey happen to go to a hospital. You get them then. You don't want them \nto go to a hospital, but I am telling you what it turns out to be. \nMaybe it has changed since I last worked on this. Years do go by. But I \nthink what I said is still right.\n  It also makes improvements to the program such as mental health \nparity, which I know a little bit about. I am glad this legislation \nensures plans that offer mental health services provide benefits that \nare equivalent to other physician and health services. This is one of \nthe most difficult areas of unfairness for American coverage we have \nhad, and we are making big strides toward resolving it. This bill makes \nits little contribution to resolving that problem.\n  The administration has issued a statement indicating the President \nwill veto this legislation. Mr. President, that is a mistake. Maybe you \nwill win; maybe you won't. I guess in the Senate you won't win, Mr. \nPresident. Maybe you will win in the House. I don't know. But this will \nnot go away. It is solved. It ought to be done. We ought to go on and \nlook somewhere else if we are going to try to find money to save. Those \nwho think this is a great veto item, I think what I have just explained \nis, it is not a very good one. We ought to go ahead and take care of \nsome of the children and get on to some other issues.\n  A majority of my colleagues have said they support this bill. Sixty-\nnine Members voted for cloture this morning--cloture meaning to cut off \ndebate and get on with the vote.\n  My commitment to children's health care remains firm today. It \nremains as firm as when I agreed to the first use of SCHIP money in a \nnew and different, innovative way so its asset value could multiply \nsignificantly. I support the passage of the compromise SCHIP \nreauthorization.\n  All in all, it is a pretty good bill. I hope it outlasts our debate \nand is voted on tonight. Then I hope it is not vetoed by the President.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Presiding Officer for recognizing me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I have listened intently to much of the \ndebate today on this SCHIP reauthorization. Let me preface my remarks \nby saying, first and foremost, I do support children. I like children, \ncontrary to the implication that has come out of this debate that \npeople who are not in favor of this particular piece of legislation are \nnot in favor of the children. I am very much supportive and in favor of \nhelping children. Furthermore, I also\n\n[[Page S12244]]\n\nsupport extending the SCHIP program. I would even support increasing \nfunding for the SCHIP program in a way that would cover those children \nwho are eligible but are not currently being covered.\n  That is a substantial number of children across the country, which is \nwhy I think it is essential if we are going to reauthorize this \nprogram, if we are going to extend this program, we do it in a way that \ntakes into consideration there are a lot of children in America today \nwho are eligible for the SCHIP program who are not being covered. So, \nfrankly, I support not only extending the program but also increasing \nfunding for the program.\n  We had a number of amendments that would have done that during the \ndebate in the Senate that would have increased it substantially and, \nfrankly, would have also, according to the CBO, covered more children \nthan this piece of legislation we are going to vote on today.\n  But I have to say for a lot of us who do support extending the \nexisting program and increasing funding to cover children who are \neligible but not currently covered, this is a bridge too far because \nwhat this essentially does is, it not only expands the scale of the \nprogram, it expands the scope of the program. That is where a lot of us \ntake issue with this legislation.\n  If you look at what the SCHIP program costs today, it is about $5 \nbillion a year. It has cost us $40 billion over the course of the last \n10 years. This legislation today would increase the 5-year cost to $60 \nbillion, the 10-year cost to $121 billion. So where we are paying $5 \nbillion a year today for the SCHIP program, this increases that to $12 \nbillion a year, $60 billion over 5 years, or a $35 billion increase \nover the existing program, and $121 billion over 10 years.\n\n  Now, that again is an expansion, not just of scale but also of scope, \nbecause this covers adults, it increases the income levels that are \neligible under the program that the States can incorporate up to 300 \npercent of the poverty level, and even allows and grandfathers in those \nStates which have asked for waivers to go to 300 percent or 400 percent \nof the poverty level. So it does substantially increase or expand the \nscope of the program.\n  I think the other thing which is important and which is a concern for \nme in this whole debate is the fact that when you get to the year 2012, \nit is no longer paid for. Nobody here is disputing that fact. This is \nfunded for the first 5 years or so of this program, but when you get to \nthe last 5 years of the program, there is a cliff, and there isn't \nfunding there to fund the program. In fact, the funding which is \nprovided in the form of a cigarette tax increase actually assumes there \nare going to be 22 million new smokers over the course of the next 10 \nyears. That would create a substantial number of problems for the \nhealth care system in this country and is certainly not something we \nwant to encourage. But the reality is that when you get to 2012, you \nhit a cliff, and this is not paid for. It is going to have to be paid \nfor in some form or fashion, which we all assume is going to be some \nsubstantial tax increase because it is going to be about $60 billion \nunderfunded during the last 5 years of the program.\n  The other thing I will say which is, again, of great concern to me is \nthis doesn't solve the underlying problem we have in this country. We \nhave a health care problem in this country that needs to be addressed, \nthat Congress needs to address head-on.\n  There are a lot of wonderful proposals and ideas that have been \ndiscussed, some of which have been proposed in the form of legislation, \nsome of which have been voted on, and some of which have been defeated \nin the Senate.\n  A small business health plan, something many of us have supported for \na long time, going back to my days in the House of Representatives, \nactually has been defeated on numerous occasions in the Senate. It is a \nproposal that would allow small businesses to form together, to \nleverage that group size they have and be able to lower the cost of \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  We heard my colleague from South Carolina talk earlier today about a \nnational market for health care.\n  We have had suggestions, bipartisan suggestions about allowing a tax \ndeduction that each individual could use in order to buy health \ninsurance.\n  There is the proposal for a tax credit that has been offered by a \ncouple of my colleagues on this side.\n  There are a lot of good ideas out there we ought to be adopting, or \nat least debating, and driving toward health care reform which empowers \nconsumers in this country, which puts more people in charge of their \nown health care, and which allows them to have access to coverage where \nthey own their own health care coverage and can make better and more \ninformed decisions and get the cost of health care in this country \nunder control. I don't believe this does that because what this \nlegislation does is it increases government-run, Washington-controlled \nhealth care. This is an expansion of the government component of health \ncare. It does nothing in the long run to address what is a very serious \ncrisis in this country; that is, the need to bring reforms to our \nhealth care system.\n  The other thing I will say which I, frankly, take issue with as well \nwith regard to this legislation is the fact that low-cost, efficient \nStates such as South Dakota--and we have a 200-percent Federal poverty \nlevel in our SCHIP program in South Dakota--end up subsidizing higher \ncosts in inefficient States. We have taxpayers in South Dakota who are \ncovered, as I said, up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, or \nabout $41,000 per family, who are going to end up subsidizing States \nthat choose to exercise the option to go to a higher level. Frankly, \nthere is no incentive for States not to go to the higher level, to go \nto the 300 percent, and those that already have requested waivers to go \nto 350 or 400, you are already talking about, in the case of 400 \npercent of the Federal poverty level, over $80,000 a year.\n  Now, what is ironic about that is the Federal Government is going to \nbe telling people in this country that not only are you poor--in other \nwords, you are eligible for this particular low-income health insurance \nprogram--but you are also rich, so rich that you are going to be \nsubject to the alternative minimum tax.\n  I offered an amendment to the debate we had weeks ago that would have \nprevented those who are subject to the alternative minimum tax because \nunder the Internal Revenue Code in this country they are considered \nrich--rich enough to pay the alternative minimum tax--that would have \nsaid that people who are subject to the alternative minimum tax cannot \nat the same time be eligible for a program that is designed to help \nlow-income families and low-income children. That was defeated in the \nSenate by a vote of 42 to 57.\n  So there are a lot of issues with regard to this legislation that \ngive me grave concerns, reasons that I can't support it. As I said \nbefore, an expansion of a government-run health care program in this \ncountry--it is not paid for after the year 2012--leads us toward \nnationalized, Washington-controlled health care and moves us away from \nwhat ultimately ought to be our goal; that is, providing access for \nmore Americans to coverage through our market-based system in this \ncountry.\n  It requires that low-cost, efficient States such as my State of South \nDakota are going to be subsidizing high-cost, inefficient States--\nStates such as in the New Jersey, New York area--that are already \ntalking about going to 350 percent or 400 percent of the poverty level, \nwhich, as I said earlier, in the case of New York, that would get you \nup to where you would have those in the income level of over $80,000 a \nyear qualifying and being eligible for a program that is designed to \nhelp low-income children and low-income families and, ironically, \nsubjects them to the alternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum \ntax was a tax put into place in the first place to tax people who are \nmaking too much money and not paying enough taxes. That, to me, seems \nto be a very conflicted message we are sending with this bill.\n  We need a strong, market-based health care system in this country. We \nneed to start that debate. This debate delays that debate because we \nare going to be adopting legislation that increases--adds to the \ngovernment-run component of health care in this country and moves us \naway from the debate we ought to be having, which is, how\n\n[[Page S12245]]\n\ncan we improve access for more Americans to affordable health care \ncoverage, where they can own their own coverage, where they don't have \nto rely on a government system that is inefficient, that is Washington-\nbased, and that is controlled by bureaucrats here in Washington, DC?\n\n  We want to put people and patients more in control of health care. \nThis particular bill does not do that. I will be voting no, and I urge \nmy colleagues as well to vote no. I hope we can get to the big debate, \nthe debate we ought to be having; that is, how do we reform the health \ncare system in this country?\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation that \nwill extend and increase funding for the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  One of the very first bills I cosponsored as a new Member of the \nSenate back in 1997 was the legislation that first established the \nSCHIP program. I remember Senator Hatch coming to talk to me about this \nbill and enlisting my support for it. I am very happy I was one of the \noriginal cosponsors of the SCHIP bill.\n  This program provides much needed health care coverage for children \nof low-income parents who simply cannot afford the cost of health \ninsurance and do not get health insurance through the workplace; yet \nthey make a little bit too much money to qualify for the State's \nMedicaid Program.\n  Since 1997, the SCHIP program has contributed to more than a one-\nthird decline in the number of uninsured low-income children. That is a \ntremendous success. It is hard for me to understand why anyone would \nvote against an extension, a modest expansion, of what has been such a \nhighly successful and effective program. Today, an estimated 6.6 \nmillion children, including more than 14,500 in the State of Maine, \nreceive health care coverage through this program.\n  Still, as this legislation recognizes, there is more we can do to \nfurther decrease the number of uninsured low-income children. While the \nState of Maine ranks among the top four States in reducing the number \nof uninsured children, we still have more than 20,000 children who \ndon't have coverage. Nationally, about 9 million children remain \nuninsured.\n  Unfortunately, the authorization for the SCHIP program, which has \ndone so much to help low-income children in working families obtain the \nhealth care they need, is about to expire. That is why I encourage and \nI urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  I commend the Senate conferees on this bill. They did a very good job \nof coming up with a very reasonable proposal--a proposal that costs \nless than the House version and yet will make a real difference to low-\nincome uninsured children. I would point out that this is a bipartisan \nbill. On the cloture vote earlier today, it had overwhelming support, \nas 69 Senators voted to proceed with the vote on this bill.\n  The legislation that is before us will increase funding for the SCHIP \nprogram by $35 billion over the next 5 years--a level which is \nsufficient to maintain the coverage for the 6.6 million children \ncurrently enrolled, as well as to expand the coverage so that we can \nreach more children who are currently uninsured. In the State of Maine, \nthe bill before us will allow us to cover an additional 11,000 low-\nincome children who are currently eligible for SCHIP but not enrolled.\n  The bill also improves the program in a number of important ways. \nLike Senator Domenici, I am very pleased that the bill includes a \nrequirement for States to offer mental health services through their \nSCHIP program. Treating behavioral and emotional problems and mental \nillness while children are young--early intervention--can make such a \ndifference. I know from hearings I have held in the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee that the current systems for \nproviding mental health care to children are woefully inadequate. The \nresult is oftentimes parents are faced with a horrible choice of giving \nup custody of their children in order to secure the treatment they need \nfor serious mental illnesses. That is a choice no parent should ever \nhave to make.\n  We also need to improve oral health care, dental health care for \nchildren, and this bill will do just that. Despite the demonstrated \nneed, children's dental coverage offered by States isn't always what it \nshould be. Low-income and rural children suffer disproportionately from \noral health problems. In fact, 80 percent of all tooth decay is found \nin just 25 percent of children--80 percent of the problems in 25 \npercent of the kids. That is simply because they don't have access to \noral hygiene, they don't have access to dentists and dental hygienists \nwho could help ensure their health. I am very pleased, therefore, that \nthe bill before us will strengthen the dental coverage offered through \nSCHIP to ensure that more low-income children have access to the dental \nservices they need to prevent disease and promote good oral health.\n  Finally, the bill will eliminate the State shortfall problems that \nhave plagued the SCHIP program as well as provide additional incentives \nto encourage States to increase outreach and enrollment, particularly \nof the lowest income children.\n  The bill before us today is the prescription for good health for \nmillions of our Nation's low-income children in working families. That \nis why I am so disappointed that the President has threatened a veto of \nthis legislation. I just do not understand his decision, and I think it \ncould be a terrible mistake. This important program can simply not be \nallowed to expire. I urge all of our colleagues to join me in \nsupporting it.\n  Let me make one final point. I have heard a lot of our colleagues on \nmy side of the aisle argue that we need a far more extensive debate on \nhealth care policy in this country, and they are right. But we should \nnot hold the SCHIP program hostage to that broader debate. We do need a \nbroader debate. We need a broader debate on how to lessen the number of \nuninsured Americans, which now exceeds 45 million Americans. We need a \nbroader debate on how to help our small businesses better afford the \ncost of health insurance for their employees.\n  We need a broader debate on how we can effectively use the Tax Code \nto help subsidize the cost of insurance for those who don't receive \ninsurance through the workplace.\n  I hope Senate leaders will charge the relevant committees to \nundertake a couple of months of hearings to bring together the best \nminds possible and then dedicate a month of debate on the Senate floor \nto a wide variety of solutions to both promote broader access to health \ncare, to help our uninsured better afford health coverage, and to \nimprove the quality of health care in this country.\n  That is an important and overdue debate. In fact, the Senator from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, and I have, for several Congresses, \nintroduced a broad health care bill with these goals in mind.\n  Let us not jeopardize the existence of a successful, effective \nprogram for low-income children because we want to have that broader \ndebate. Let's send this bill to the President. Let's urge him to sign \nit into law, and then let's turn our attention to this long, overdue, \nmuch needed debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to begin my remarks by noting that, \nalong with my colleagues, I support reauthorization of SCHIP. \nUnfortunately, the bill before the Senate today is not just an SCHIP \nreauthorization; it is an SCHIP expansion, based on the following \nmisguided principles:\n  First, it would turn a program for low-income children into a program \nfor adults as well.\n  Second, it expands SCHIP to cover children from higher income \nfamilies.\n  Third, it covers people already insured, not just the uninsured.\n  Fourth, it circumvents budget rules to hide a $41 billion cost not \npaid for under the bill.\n  I will address the first issue. When we authorized this program in \n1997, the Republican-led Congress intended SCHIP to provide health \ncoverage to low-income, uninsured children. Ten years later, the \nprogram created for children covers adults.\n  In fiscal year 2006, 14 States enrolled over 700,000 adults in SCHIP. \nIn fact,\n\n[[Page S12246]]\n\nthis year, 13 percent of SCHIP funds will go to adults other than \npregnant women. For example, Wisconsin covers almost twice as many \nadults as children under the SCHIP program, spending 76 percent of its \nSCHIP funds on adults. Illinois spends 62 percent on adults. Rhode \nIsland spends 54 percent on adults. New Jersey spends half of its money \non adults.\n  So what happens under the bill before us? It allows the States, with \nthese existing waivers, to continue enrolling new parents--adults, \nobviously--at a higher reimbursement rate than Medicaid.\n  There is no ``a'' in SCHIP. If Congress created SCHIP for low-income \nchildren, we in Congress should ensure that is where the funds go; \notherwise, we are being dishonest with the American people and we \nshould rename the program.\n  Second, when the program was created, in 1997, we targeted low-income \nchildren whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not \nenough to obtain private health insurance. We never intended for all \nchildren, regardless of the income of their families, to become \ndependent on a Government health insurance program. That is not what is \nhappening today.\n  Eleven States have income thresholds at or above 300 percent of the \nFederal poverty level. Rather than refocusing SCHIP on low-income \nchildren, nothing in the bill prohibits States from increasing \neligibility levels above 300 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  In fact, the bill grandfathers in the two States with the Nation's \nhighest levels and at a higher reimbursement rate than the rest of the \ncountry. Why should Arizonans, my constituents, pay their taxpayer \ndollars, which are intended for low-income children, to be sent to New \nYork and New Jersey to cover families earning up to $82,600 a year?\n  I have heard some say over and over again this will only happen if \nthe administration allows it. That is not true.\n  First, I direct my colleagues' attention to page 82, lines 3 through \n11 of the bill. It states there is an exception for any State with an \napproved State plan amendment or waiver--that is New Jersey--or a State \nthat has enacted a State law--that is New York. There is an exception. \nSo it is not that the President can stop this. The bill provides the \nexception.\n  To clarify the policy even further, page 82 includes new language \nthat was not in the Senate-passed bill. This new language reinforces \nthat States should have the flexibility to set their own income \neligibility levels, no matter how high, making it nearly impossible for \nany administration to reject such State requests.\n  Third, very importantly, the bill guts an August 17 letter issued by \nthe administration designed to make sure that States enroll low-income \nfamilies first and foremost. They said you have to make sure 95 percent \nof your low-income, eligible kids are enrolled in the SCHIP program \nbefore you can expand it to cover the higher income families. Well, \nthat has been taken out of the bill and the bill guts the provision.\n  From my analysis, nothing in this bill gives the administration the \nclear authority to prevent taxpayer dollars from being sent to higher \nincome families. Even the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan advocacy \ngroup, warns that the bill ``fails to target new entitlement spending \nat those most in need.''\n  Third, as a result of expanding SCHIP to children from higher income \nfamilies and some adults, the bill ``crowds out'' private health \ninsurance and substitutes that coverage with government-run, taxpayer-\nsubsidized insurance.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 2 million people will \ndrop their private coverage under this bill. For every two individuals \nadded to SCHIP, or Medicaid Program, one drops private coverage. This \nis why we say it is a step toward government-run health care--you take \npeople with good private health insurance and take them off of the \nprivate health insurance roll and substitute in the government health \ninsurance program.\n\n  For the newly eligible populations--the people not yet enrolled in \nthe program--CBO shows a one-for-one replacement, meaning that for each \n600,000 newly insured individuals, 600,000 individuals go off of \nprivate coverage. Is that what we are all about, what we should be \ndoing here? Should Congress not focus on ways to provide health care \ncoverage to the uninsured, rather than to those who already have \ninsurance? Of course, the answer is yes.\n  Finally, the SCHIP bill is not paid for. Under our rules, we are \nrequired to state the cost of a program such as this over 10 years and \npay for it over that time period. Under the bill, SCHIP spending goes \nup every year for 5 years and, all of a sudden, magically, \nartificially, the spending drops off precipitously, as if there is no \nmore need for it. It basically disappears. Obviously, the reason for \nthat is to circumvent the budget rules and avoid paying for the bill. \nThe assumption, obviously, is artificial and wrong and everybody knows \nit. The program is, in fact, going to continue out over the full 10 \nyears; it doesn't stop after 5. So you need to make up the last 5 \nyears.\n  How much does that cost? According to the CBO, $41 billion will be \nneeded to sustain the program for the last 5 years of the 10-year \nprogram. In other words, the bill has in it a $41 billion hole. If you \nfill in that hole over the course of the 10 years, the cost of the bill \nexceeds $110 billion. That is why some of us appreciate the President's \ndetermination to veto the bill as too much spending on a program that \nhas been expanded way beyond its original purpose and is substituting \nprivate health insurance coverage for a new government program.\n  A future Congress will have no other choice than to disenroll \nmillions of children, which will not happen, or more likely, raise \ntaxes to fill that $110 billion cost. Of course, it will be our \nchildren who will bear this bill's deficit.\n  I will conclude where I started. Like everybody else in the Chamber, \nI support the reauthorization of SCHIP. I don't support its expansion \nin the way it has been done under this bill. Republicans have offered a \nfiscally responsible alternative that reauthorizes SCHIP for 5 years, \npreserving health care coverage for millions of low-income children. It \nadds 1.3 million new children to SCHIP. It is offset without new taxes \nor budget gimmicks. It minimizes the reduction in private health \ncoverage by targeting it to low-income children.\n  We should pass an SCHIP extension and we should work toward a \nreauthorization, such as the Republican alternative, that is fiscally \nresponsible and upholds SCHIP's original intent. Doing so is a step \ntoward renewing our commitment to America's children.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since the Senate passed the bill the \nfirst time, the subject of ``crowd-out'' has become a lot more \nimportant in this debate.\n  Crowd-out is the substitution of public coverage for private \ncoverage. Crowd-out occurs in CHIP because the CHIP benefit is very \nattractive and there is no penalty for refusing private coverage if you \nare eligible for public coverage.\n  On August 17, CMS put out a letter giving States new instructions on \nhow to address crowd-out.\n  I appreciate the administration's willingness to engage on the issue. \nI think they have some very good ideas. But I also think there are some \nflaws in their policy.\n  States are supposed to cover 95 percent of the low-income kids. But \nit has been a month since they issued the letter and CMS still cannot \nexplain what data States should be using.\n  Personally, I think CMS should have answers before they issue \npolicies. And if they still can't a month later, I believe, as the \nsaying goes, they obviously aren't ready for prime time.\n  So the compromise bill replaces the CMS letter with a more \nthoughtful, reasonable approach.\n  The Government Accountability Office and the Institute of Medicine \nwould produce analyses on the most accurate and reliable way to measure \nthe rate of public and private insurance coverage and on best practices \nby States in addressing crowd-out.\n  Following these two reports, the Secretary, in consultation with \nStates, will develop crowd-out best practices recommendations for the \nStates to consider and develop a uniform set of data points for States \nto track and report on coverage of children below 200 percent FPL and \non crowd-out.\n\n[[Page S12247]]\n\n  Next, States that extend CHIP coverage to children above 300 percent \nFPL must submit to the Secretary a State plan amendment describing how \nthey will address crowd-out for this population, incorporating the best \npractices recommended by the Secretary.\n  After October 1, 2010, Federal matching payments are not permitted to \nStates that cover children whose family incomes exceed 300 percent of \npoverty if the State does not meet a target for the percentage of \nchildren at or below 200 percent of poverty enrolled in CHIP.\n  Simply put, cover your low-income kids or you get no money to cover \nhigher income kids.\n  Now I know some people are obsessed with the State of New York and \ntheir and their efforts to cover kids up to 400 percent of poverty.\n  It seems to come up in the talking points of every person who speaks \nout against our bill. This bill does not allow any State to go to 400 \npercent of poverty.\n  In fact, the bill makes it very difficult for any State to go above \n300 percent of poverty; it will make it very difficult for New Jersey, \nthe only State currently covering kids above 300 percent, to continue \nto do so if they don't do a better job of covering low-income kids.\n  If you are concerned about the State of New York, don't waste your \ntime looking at this bill. You will not find answers to New York's fate \nhere.\n  The answer is where it has always been--in the office of HHS \nSecretary Mike Leavitt. Only he has the authority to allow any State to \ncover children up to 400 percent of poverty. This bill does nothing to \nchange that authority. It is up to the Secretary.\n  I heartily encourage those of you who haven't to read the bill. It is \nall there in black and white.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12247-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I think we are ready for closing \ncomments by me as ranking member and Senator Baucus as chairman of the \ncommittee. Then we will be done with the debate on SCHIP.\n  Mr. President, first, I thank my colleagues for supporting the vote \nto move to the consideration of the children's health insurance \nreauthorization bill so we could avoid a lot of turmoil over getting \nhere where we are to get the business done because I think everybody \nknows how this is going to turn out.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senator Reid because he was an honest \nbroker in helping the House to understand what needed to be done in the \nSenate, and he held a lot of meetings on this subject.\n  I thank my good friend, the chairman of the committee, the Senator \nfrom Montana, Mr. Baucus, for his leadership in forging this compromise \nin a bipartisan way.\n  I also have to recognize people who sat in on a lot of these meetings \nand worked hard and are part of this compromise: Senator Hatch and \nSenator Rockefeller. In particular, Senator Hatch has been a stalwart \nthrough this process because he was the leader in creating the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program when it was first inaugurated 10 \nyears ago. The continued leadership he showed was very good and \nnecessary.\n  I realize some in the majority want to do more than we do in this \ncompromise. I know it wasn't easy for those on the other side of the \naisle to convince some of their colleagues that this was the right \ncourse. But we have a bipartisan bill in the Senate, and now we have a \nbill with strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. We \npicked up a massive number of Republicans who did not vote for it the \nfirst time in the House of Representatives.\n  Currently, the SCHIP program covers kids at incomes far beyond what \nwas considered low income in the original statute. It covers parents \nand, in some States, it even covers childless adults. With this \nreauthorization, this program will return to its original concept: \nhelping the lowest income kids and not helping adults as the program \nevolved beyond the perceptions that were there 10 years ago when this \nbill was written.\n  Childless adults who are presently on the program will be phased out \ncompletely because this is a children's program, it is not an adults \nprogram. States will not be able to get enhanced Federal funds if they \ndecide to cover parents. States will only be able to cover higher \nincome kids if they demonstrate that they took care of the purpose of \nthis legislation, which is to take care of the lowest income kids \nfirst.\n  Every financial incentive in this bill discourages States from \nspending a penny to cover anyone other than low-income children. And \nall the financial incentives are entirely focused on the lowest income \nchildren. All the rhetoric to the contrary notwithstanding, this bill \ndoes not expand the program to middle-income families. It refocuses the \nprogram on the lowest income children.\n  Some of the speeches I have heard on the Senate floor, I wonder what \ngood does it do to make these points over and over because it is just \nthat some of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle don't \nread this bill, don't care what we say. This bill does what they think \nit does, even if it doesn't do it, and they say that on the Senate \nfloor. Those who say otherwise than what I just said have not read the \nbill. This bipartisan compromise provides coverage for more than 3 \nmillion children who are without coverage today.\n  In closing, I encourage my Republican colleagues to think long and \nhard about what I said as this debate began and throughout this debate. \nIf this bill is vetoed--and this is what I would like to have the \nopponents concentrate on--if this bill is vetoed, if at the end of the \nday all we do is simply extend the program that has been in effect for \n10 years, what will we have accomplished? Will adults be gone from this \nprogram who were not supposed to be included in it in the first place? \nNo. Will States have a disincentive to cover parents? No. Will States \nbe encouraged to cover low-income kids before higher income kids? No. \nWill the funding formula be fixed so States are not constantly \nchallenged by funding shortfalls? No. And finally, will we have done \nanything to cover kids who don't have any coverage today? The answer \nis, again, no.\n  I quoted the President making a promise at the Republican Convention \nin New York. I did that yesterday. I want to state again what the \nPresident said. You can't say it too many times. I hope at some time \nthe President remembers what he said:\n\n       We will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of \n     poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the \n     government's health insurance programs.\n\n  An extension of law, which is what is going to happen if the \nPresident vetoes this bill, will not carry out what the President said \nat the Republican Convention in New York in 2004.\n  Faced with that, your answer today on this bill, Mr. President of the \nUnited States, should be yes. This bill gets the job done that you said \nin New York City you wanted to do.\n  I hope the President's answer will be yes because if he doesn't veto \nthis bill, then we will do those things he said he wanted to do. It \nwill help more than 3 million low-income, uninsured children. About \nhalf of the new money is just to keep the program running. The rest of \nthe new money goes to cover more low-income children.\n  It provides better options for families to afford employer coverage.\n  It takes even more steps to address crowdouts, so we don't move \npeople from private insurance to government-funded insurance.\n  It phases adults out of the program because this is a children's \nprogram, it is not an adults program.\n  It discourages States from covering higher income kids.\n  It rewards States that cover more of the lowest income kids.\n  It puts the lowest income children first in line for coverage.\n\n[[Page S12248]]\n\n  Here is what the bill does not do:\n  It is not a government takeover of the health care system.\n  It does not undermine our immigration policy.\n  It is not expanding the program to cover high-income kids.\n  It is not everything that people on my side of the aisle said it is \nin debate on the floor of the Senate. It is, in fact, a good bill. It \nis a compromise. I urge my colleagues to support this bill for kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a lot has been said in this debate. Much \nof it is not true, but much of it is true. One way to determine what is \ntrue and what is not true is, frankly, to listen to the Senator from \nIowa. I know of no man or woman whom I believe speaks straighter, more \nhonestly, and calls it like it is than the Senator from Iowa. I guess \nthat is why he is elected by such large margins every time he is up for \nreelection. It has been such a pleasure to work with the Senator from \nIowa because he is so straight, so modest. He tells it like it is, and \nhe has no ulterior motives.\n  All Senators, especially those on this side of the aisle, should \nlisten to him because what he says is true. When he describes what this \nbill contains and does not contain, he is accurate. So if a Senator is \ntrying to figure out who is right--because we have heard all kinds of \nclaims on both sides--it is my judgment that what you hear from the \nSenator from Iowa, you can take to the bank because that is the truth \nas to what is and is not in this bill.\n  As we close out this debate on the reauthorization of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, I wish to take the time to remind us all what \nour goals are--and not just our goals but what our duty is as Senators.\n  Today, the health of many of our Nation's low-income children is in \nour hands. It is that simple. We hear lots of stuff around here, but \nthe bottom line is, the basic point is, the health of many of our \nNation's low-income children is in our hands.\n  We are here today not only to make sure children who currently have \nhealth insurance keep it, but also to make sure that many more low-\nincome children get coverage. This is important because not having \nhealth insurance affects a child's life. Uninsured kids do not go to \nthe doctor. They do not have checkups. Uninsured kids remain \nundiagnosed for serious childhood conditions such as asthma and \ndiabetes. Uninsured children are not diagnosed with learning \ndisabilities, and they struggle through their classes. Kids who do not \nhave insurance do not see a dentist. They don't get cavities filled and \nrisk serious illness due to poor dental health.\n  Adequate health care is a critical foundation for a healthy life. \nInsuring our children is a smart economic investment for our Nation's \nfuture. It is the only choice if we wish to imbue future generations \nwith strong minds and healthy bodies. It is quite simple. Health \ninsurance has a direct effect on a child's performance in school. \nHealthy children are more likely to go to school, they are more likely \nto do well in school, and they are more likely to become productive \nmembers of the workforce.\n  Parents of children with health insurance are less likely to miss \ndays of work to care for their sick children. When America insures our \nchildren, we all benefit.\n  The bill before us reflects a lot of hard work. It represents \nDemocrats and Republicans working together, and I mean that. That is \nnot an idle statement. That is not a throwaway. Both sides are working \ntogether. This is one of the few times when both sides, on very \nimportant legislation, worked very well together. Why? Because it is \nthe right thing to do.\n  We worked together to craft legislation that will give millions more \nAmerican children the healthy start they need for a long productive \nlife.\n  I hope the President finds it in his heart to reconsider and make the \nright choice, the only choice. I hope he will join Congress in making \nour children's future and America's future a brighter one. I hope he \nthinks, reflects about our country, the greatness of our country when \nhe is trying to decide whether to sign the bill or to veto it.\n  I have faith, I have hope that when the President of the United \nStates makes that decision, he will realize discretion is the better \npart of valor; that he will realize the right thing to do is to help \nour Nation's low-income kids. Further debate about health care reform \ncan be pushed off into the future. That is a separate issue. That has \nnothing to do with this question.\n  This country will engage in national health reform. We have to. The \nPresident is talking about it. We in the Congress talk about it. That \nis an entirely separate issue. This is only maintaining a current \nprogram enacted in 1997, totally bipartisan. Senator Chafee from Rhode \nIsland and Senator Hatch from Utah worked together to get this bill \nenacted because it was the right thing to do.\n  It has been very popular. Nobody has had any questions about \nchildren's health insurance. It has worked. Now it has expired. The \nquestion is, what do we do about it? This legislation does not change \ncurrent law in any way. It just maintains the program and provides a \nfew more dollars for more low-income kids to get health insurance, and \nit does not do anything more than that. That is what this is. It is a \nseparate issue from the national health insurance reform debate, which \nwe will get into and must get into at a later date.\n  I hope the President of the United States, when he is faced with that \ndecision, will sign this bill and realize this is the right thing to do \nfor kids, and tomorrow is another day when this country appropriately \nwill debate national health insurance reform. But right now, let's help \nsome kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 11 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back that time, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12248-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12248-S12254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           INCREASING THE STATUTORY LIMIT ON THE PUBLIC DEBT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.J. Res. 43, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 43) increasing the statutory \n     limit on the public debt.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 90 \nminutes of debate equally divided between the leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the play ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' \nShakespeare wrote: ``There is small choice in rotten apples.''\n  I feel a little like that whenever we have to raise the debt \nlimit. It is a small choice in rotten apples. The choices are all bad. \nReally, though, there is no choice.\n\n  The legislation before us would increase the limit on the debt issued \nby the U.S. Government by $850 billion. The House has sent us this \nlegislation. Essentially, we have no choice but to approve it. If we \nfail to raise the debt ceiling soon, the U.S. Treasury will default for \nthe first time in its history. Plainly, especially in this credit \ncrisis, we cannot let that happen. If we don't raise the ceiling before \nMonday, Treasury Secretary Paulson will be forced to take special \nmeasures to prevent the default from occurring. He feels those actions \nwould create uncertainty in the financial markets. He thinks it would \nbe unwise to add any uncertainty to the financial markets right now, \nand I agree with that. The markets already have enough uncertainty \narising from the foreclosures on subprime mortgages. But there is no \nway around this. These are some rotten apples.\n  This increase in the debt ceiling will be the fifth increase during \nthis administration. It increased by $450 billion in 2002, it increased \nby $984 billion in 2003, it increased by $800 billion in 2004, and it \nincreased by $781 billion in 2006. Today's $850 billion increase in the \ndebt ceiling will be the third largest increase in our Nation's \nhistory. The largest increase was the $984 billion hike in 2003. Once \ntoday's $850 billion increase is enacted, the fourth largest rise will \nhave been the $800 billion in 2004. The fifth largest increase will \nhave been the $781 billion hike in 2006.\n\n[[Page S12249]]\n\n  There is no way around it. This is a poor fiscal record. When you add \ntoday's $850 billion increase to the previous increases since 2001, the \ndebt ceiling will have increased by almost $4 trillion during this \nadministration. The debt ceiling will have increased from about $6 \ntrillion at the beginning of this administration to about $10 trillion \nnow--$6 trillion at the beginning of this administration, the debt \nceiling, will be increased now to about $10 trillion. That is a two-\nthirds increase in the debt ceiling in 7 years.\n  Unfortunately, for us today, there is little choice at this moment \nright now. There are other choices we should be making in this Congress \nand in this country with respect to our fiscal situation, but today, at \nthis moment, with respect to the debt ceiling, there is little choice. \nThe Government has already borrowed the money that has caused its debt \nto reach the current ceiling. It has already been borrowed. To keep the \nGovernment running, the Treasury now needs to borrow more money. The \nTreasury cannot do that unless we raise the debt ceiling.\n  Why is it unfortunate the Government has gone into so much debt? The \nanswer is it lowers the standard of living for future generations of \nAmericans. That is hardly the legacy we should want to leave for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  If the U.S. Government borrows money, it competes for funds from the \nglobal financial markets. Unless Americans begin to save more, these \nfunds will come from foreign lenders. As a result, we will owe \nforeigners interest on those funds in future years. Because Americans \nwill have to pay that interest to foreigners, we will have less money \nto spend on goods and services, and the standard of living for \nAmericans in the future will be lower than it otherwise would be.\n  It is happening already. It is happening because the dollar is \ndeclining. It is declining quite precipitously. Why is the dollar \ndeclining? Probably because our fiscal policy has not been very sound. \nWe have been borrowing so many dollars from overseas. Our current \naccount deficit is so large. We have been consuming at such rapid rates \nthat, finally, the chickens are beginning to come home to roost. The \ndollar is starting to decline, and it is making it very difficult now \nfor Americans, on the margin, to live at the same living standard.\n  With the dollar declining--and, again, it is declining because \nforeign investors are starting to think maybe it is wiser to invest \ntheir dollars, on the margin, elsewhere--when the dollar declines, that \nmeans imports are more expensive and consumers have to pay more than \nthey currently have been paying for those same products. It means \nAmerican companies are now able to raise their prices to the levels of \nthe more expensive foreign imports. It means, frankly, that average \nAmericans are facing more costs for the same goods.\n  On the other hand, the most wealthy people in America can invest in \nforeign currency and take advantage of the dollar. But the average \nAmerican cannot do so. So what we are doing today, with our very high \ndebt, is essentially lowering our living standards.\n  Further, the amount of U.S. Government debt held by foreigners is \ntroubling. As of December, 2006, foreigners held an enormous $2.2 \ntrillion of debt issued by the U.S. Government. For example, Japan held \n$644 billion of U.S. debt, and mainland China held $350 billion.\n  I might add that a lot of these foreigners are starting to change \ntheir investment patterns. They are developing sovereign wealth funds. \nThey are diverting some of their currency holdings. China is a good \nexample. They are not just buying U.S. Treasury notes, bills and bonds, \nthey are starting to do more direct investing around the world. That \ntoo is starting to have, on the margin, a slightly negative effect on \nthe dollar.\n  In December, 2001, foreigners held a total of $1 trillion in U.S. \ndebt. Thus, foreign-held debt has increased from $1 trillion at that \ntime, December 2001, to about $2.2 trillion in December, 2006. That is \na 120-percent increase since 2001. Over time, the cumulative interest \npayments on these holdings will be very large.\n  The significant foreign holdings of U.S. debt create two more serious \nproblems. The first problem relates to a falling dollar, as I have \nmentioned. If the dollar falls, the value to foreign holders of U.S.-\nissued securities falls. If the dollar continues to fall, at some \npoint, foreigners may become scared of further drops. To protect \nthemselves, they may sell their holdings of U.S.-issued securities. And \na large sell-off could happen precipitously and cause interest rates in \nthe United States to rise immediately. A recession would likely follow.\n  I am not saying that is going to happen, but I am saying the \nprobability of that happening is getting greater and greater and \ngreater with the passage of each day.\n  Today, the dollar is at another all-time low against the Euro, and \nthe Canadian dollar has reached parity with the U.S. dollar for the \nfirst time since the 1970s. If the dollar continues to fall, we could \nsee foreigners selling off U.S.-issued securities at some point.\n  The second problem concerns our national security. Currently, almost \n60 percent of U.S. debt held by foreigners is in the hands of foreign \ncentral banks or other official foreign government institutions. That \namounts to about $1.3 trillion--clearly, an enormous figure.\n  So what happens if we get into a trade dispute with one of these \ncountries, or a military or diplomatic dispute? The government of one \nof these countries could prevail upon its official institutions to \nthreaten to sell off some or all of its holdings of U.S.-issued debt. \nIf such an action occurred, it would drive up interest rates in the \nUnited States and cause a recession. The threat of such action would \ngive the foreign country significant leverage in its trade or military \nor diplomatic dispute with the United States, which would be very \nunfortunate.\n  Again, I am not saying it is going to happen right away, or it is \ngoing to happen at all. But I am saying, given the deterioration of our \nfiscal situation, it is, on the margin, slowly, inevitably, irrevocably \ngiving these other countries more leverage over us in any policy \ndispute they may have with us.\n  The revenue and spending laws that have helped to create the need for \nthis huge jump in the debt ceiling were enacted some time ago. We piled \nup huge budget deficits in recent years by not having enough revenues \nto pay for our spending. So the Treasury had no alternative but to \nborrow funds to make up the difference, because we, obviously, had been \nspending more than we were taking in. The Treasury, therefore, had to \nborrow. And that is the problem; it is the added borrowing year after \nyear after year after year in the amounts I have already indicated.\n  The responsible thing to do right now is to raise the debt ceiling \nbecause we have to. This debt ceiling is similar to a credit card. The \nbill is due. You have to pay what is on the credit card. But the goal \nis to make sure there aren't future increases in that credit card bill. \nWe have to pay what the credit card bill is. That is the legal \nobligation. So there is no choice, and it is the responsible thing to \ndo. But it is also the responsible thing to do to reduce the need to \nraise the debt ceiling again in the future.\n  We need to stop running annual deficits in our Federal budget. We \nneed to stop cutting taxes when we cannot afford to do so. We need to \nstop increasing spending when we cannot afford to do so. It is easy \naround here to cut taxes, it is easy around here to raise spending. \nFortunately, we have these pay-go rules now which makes it that much \nmore difficult to do, and we have to basically heed the basic \nprinciples behind pay-go.\n  The beginning of the retirement of the baby boom generation next year \nwill create needs for even more spending. Our ability to achieve \nbalanced budgets will become more difficult. Nonetheless, we ought to \nbalance the budget. It is the right thing to do. It would send the \nright signals in so many ways all across the country and around the \nworld that we are getting our act together and living within our means. \nIt is such a powerful force, in my judgment. We have to do it, \notherwise we are going to keep piling up more and more debt and the \ndollar is going to potentially continue to fall, and living standards \nwill continue to fall for Americans. So let us raise the debt ceiling \nnow because we have no choice. But let us also work together to balance \nthe budget in years to come. That is the only way we can keep from\n\n[[Page S12250]]\n\nhaving to enact more increases in the debt limit in the future. When it \ncomes to that burden as well, there is no choice either.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the current law is that we have a \nstatutory limit on the amount of money the Federal Government can \nborrow, and that has to be reconsidered from time to time. The legal \nlimit applies to the money borrowed from individuals, private \ninvestors--such as banks and pension funds--as well as money borrowed \nfrom other governmental programs that are in surplus--such as Social \nSecurity and Medicare, or what we call intergovernmental borrowing.\n  Increasing the debt limit is necessary to preserve the full faith and \ncredit of the United States of America. Without an increase in this \nlimit, our Government will face a choice between breaking the law by \nexceeding the legal limit or breaking faith with the investors by \ndefaulting on debt. Neither of those choices is acceptable, and we have \nnever done them.\n  Critics sometimes object to raising the debt limit on grounds that it \nwill allow the Government to borrow more money, but refusing to raise \nthe debt limit is akin to refusing to pay your individual credit card \nbill after you have already gone shopping and bought something. We \ncannot pass tax bills and spending bills and then refuse to pay our \nbills. The time to control the debt is when we are voting on bills that \nactually create that debt.\n  Raising the debt limit is about meeting the obligations we have \nalready incurred, it is that simple. We must meet our obligations. So I \nurge my colleagues to support this increase.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering a measure to \nfurther increase the Federal debt limit. This is further confirmation \nof the Bush administration's failed fiscal record. It represents now \nthe fifth time the President has come to Congress asking for more debt.\n  We all know we have no choice in this matter. These are debts that \nhave already been accrued. The question before us is: Do we pay the \nbills of the United States or do we fail to do so? If we failed to \ncover our borrowing, if we failed to pay the bill, the creditworthiness \nof the United States would be called into question and there would be a \nrun on the dollar. There would be economic chaos. So we have no choice, \nand I hope that colleagues on both sides will take up this \nresponsibility.\n  We all remember that when the Bush administration came into office, \nthe President said this:\n\n       My budget pays down a record amount of national debt. We \n     will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. That \n     will be the largest debt reduction of any country, ever. \n     Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back money that \n     we have borrowed. We owe this kind of responsibility to our \n     children and grandchildren.\n\n  That is what the President told us then.\n  We are now able to look at the record. What we see is quite different \nfrom what he asserted then. Instead of paying down the debt, the debt \nhas exploded on his watch. Here are the increases in the debt that have \nbeen enacted and requested by this President.\n  First of all, perhaps it is instructive to go back to the period 1998 \nto 2001, during the previous administration, when there were no \nincreases in the debt. In fact, we were paying down the debt. Then, in \n2002, this President asked for and got a $450 billion increase in the \ndebt limit; followed in 2003 by the largest increase ever, $984 \nbillion; followed by $800 billion in 2004, $781 billion in 2006, and \nnow, this year, another $850 billion. This is the debt President. The \ndebt limit of the United States will have been increased, under his \ndirection, by almost $4 trillion.\n  This chart shows the dramatic deterioration in the budget picture \nunder the fiscal policies of this President. We were in surplus. In \nfact, we had even stopped, under the previous administration, taking \nSocial Security funds to pay other bills. Under this administration, \nthe deficit skyrocketed and the debt has grown geometrically.\n  Despite all the assertions of fiscal responsibility, this President \nhas increased Federal spending from $1.9 trillion to $2.7 trillion a \nyear, an increase of nearly 50 percent.\n  On the war alone--and this puts in perspective the war costs--you \nwill recall the President told us that the war would cost $50 billion. \nWe are at $567 billion and counting. Now we hear of a request for \nanother $42 billion on top of the $147 billion that was allocated this \nyear.\n  President Bush has indicated and his administration has told us that \nwe should expect a ``Korea-like'' presence in Iraq. Here is what this \nwould mean, according to the Congressional Budget Office. So far, the \nwar in Iraq and Afghanistan has cost $567 billion. CBO tells us a \n``Korea-like'' presence would mean an additional $1 trillion in the \nperiod 2009 to 2017, and from 2018 to 2057, another $1 trillion, for an \naddition of $2 trillion to the $567 billion already committed. So the \nwar that was supposed to cost $50 billion is now headed for $2.5 \ntrillion, if we maintain a ``Korea-like'' presence, as called for by \nthe President.\n  On the revenue side of the equation, where we hear so much from our \ncolleagues about the dramatic improvement in revenue, what you will \nnotice in all of their charts is they just look at the last couple of \nyears. They don't look back to when this administration started. But \nwhat you see is real revenues, adjusted for inflation, were $2.03 \ntrillion back in 2000. This year, real revenues are $2.13 trillion. \nRevenue has been basically stagnant in this country for 6 years.\n  So when you dramatically increase spending and revenue is stagnant, \nguess what happens. The debt soars. That is precisely what has happened \nunder this President--from $5.8 trillion in 2001 to a now anticipated \n$8.9 trillion at the end of this year. This President has run up the \ndebt in a record way. He truly will claim the mantle and the legacy as \nthe debt President.\n  Not only has he dramatically run up our debt domestically, he has \nalso dramatically increased foreign holdings of our U.S. debt. When he \ncame into office, there was just over $1 trillion of U.S. debt held \nabroad. In other words, it took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up $1 \ntrillion of U.S. debt held externally. This President has more than \ndoubled that amount in just 6 years, to almost $2.2 trillion. The \nresult of all of that is we now owe Japan over $600 billion, we owe \nChina over $400 billion, we owe the United Kingdom over $200 billion, \nwe owe the ``oil exporters'' over $100 billion, and on and on it goes. \nWe are now truly in need of the kindness of foreigners because if they \ndo not float this boat, if they don't provide the financing for this \ndebt, the United States would be in even deeper trouble. Can you \nimagine if all of a sudden the Chinese, the Japanese, the British, and \nthe rest decided not to extend us additional credit, additional loans? \nThe interest rates in this country would jump. It would put us into a \nrecession, and we would be in deep trouble. So we are in debt and we \nare beholden and we are dependent on the kindness of strangers.\n  Here is what the head of the Federal Reserve has warned us on the \ndanger of growing debt. He said this before the Senate Budget Committee \non January 18:\n\n       Ultimately this expansion of debt would spark a fiscal \n     crisis which could be addressed only by very sharp spending \n     cuts or tax increases or both . . . [T]he effects on the U.S. \n     economy would be severe. High rates of government borrowing \n     would drain funds away from private capital formation, and \n     thus slow the growth of real incomes and living standards \n     over time.\n\n  The recklessness of this administration in managing the fiscal \naffairs of this Nation is clear and compelling. It could not be more \napparent.\n  Tonight is one more confirmation of the disastrous consequences of \nthe fiscal policy of this President. He is the debt President. With the \naction that will be required to be taken tonight, he will have added \nnearly $4 trillion to the debt position of our Nation. That is a sad \nlegacy, and future generations are going to pay an enormous price for \nthis profligacy--spending without a willingness to pay for it, simply \nputting it on the charge card, shoving the debt off to future \ngenerations, and all the time claiming to be fiscally responsible.\n  The actions of Congress tonight, responding to the request of the \nPresident to once again expand the debt limit by hundreds of billions \nof dollars--in fact, tonight, by $850 billion in\n\n[[Page S12251]]\n\none fell swoop--should tell us all we must have a new direction for the \nfiscal course of this country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this evening we have a choice to make that \nis a true reflection of whether this body has been listening to the \nAmerican public. We are about to increase the amount of money we can \nborrow against our children's future by $850 billion. That is almost $1 \ntrillion. What does that say about us? That we can't do what we ask \nevery other American family to do, which is live within our means. It \nis not about parties. Both parties are guilty. But it is about \npriorities, and it is about choices.\n  Many of us know that our approval rating is at an alltime low--11 \npercent. We have a chance tonight to change that. We have a chance \ntonight to raise that. We have a chance tonight to prove to the \nAmerican people that we are listening.\n  A new Gallup Poll put it this way:\n\n       Americans now express less trust in the Federal Government \n     than at any time in the past decade and trust in many Federal \n     Government institutions is now lower than it was during the \n     Watergate era, generally recognized as the low point in \n     American history for trust in the Federal Government.\n\n  Think about that. How is it that we got ourselves to that position? \nHow did we slip to a level below the Watergate era?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like to finish my statement, and then I am be \nhappy to yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  One reason is Americans believe we are totally out of touch with the \nrealities they live with every day in terms of budgeting and spending. \nWhat I often hear in this body, both by statement and by action, is \nthat we really do not have to choose between two priorities because we \ncan do both. The American people can't do both, but we can do both. How \ncan we do both? What we do is we ignore the choices we have and lay our \nresponsibility on generations to come. That is how we do both. We do \nnot do what is required of us in terms of oversight, eliminating fraud, \neliminating duplicative programs, eliminating programs that do not \nwork, that have no metrics. That, by the way, comes to $200 billion \nworth of fraud, waste, and abuse which has been documented, every year, \nthat we spend, that we are not working on, we are not trying to \neliminate. But what we are about to do, because we failed to do that, \nwe are about to increase the amount which our children and \ngrandchildren are going to have to repay.\n  The problem is there is nobody outside this body who thinks that \nway--only inside. In the real world, people have budgets they have to \nlive within. Their choices have consequences, and we choose to make the \nconsequences happen to our children and grandchildren rather than \naccept the consequences. What has made this country great has been the \nheritage of sacrifice we have seen by multiple generations that have \ncome before us. We are now denying that heritage, as we in this body \nrefuse to accept the responsibility placed on us to make hard choices.\n  Tonight, we are going to have a vote and we are going to raise the \ndebt limit and we are going to really say: Children, we don't have the \ncourage to do what we need to do, whether it is raise taxes or cut \nspending or both. We don't have the courage to do that. But we are \ncowardly enough to shift it off onto you.\n  That is what it really is. We don't want to go against interest \ngroups that are invested in something that isn't working. We don't want \nto eliminate the $53 billion a year that is estimated to be fraud in \nMedicare and Medicaid. We don't want to do anything with the excess \n41,000 properties the Federal Government owns that cost us $18 billion \na year but we won't do anything with them. We will not do what is \nnecessary and sacrifice so that we can secure the future.\n  We are going to raise the debt limit because both parties, mine and \nthe leadership party, have refused to restrain spending.\n  This will be the sixth time since 1997 that the debt limit has been \nraised. At the same time, earmark spending has skyrocketed. It is over \nhalf a trillion dollars in the last 10 years. There are no competitive \nbids on earmarks, no accountability, no followup, just gifts. Some are \ngreat priorities, but there is no system of economic controls.\n  My own party did a lot to create this mess. In 2005, 82 of my \ncolleagues said building a bridge in Alaska was more important than \nrepairing the bridges in Louisiana.\n  We said that. This body said that. Last week I asked my colleagues to \nmake a number of choices. I offered an amendment that said until we fix \nour at-risk bridges and our high-risk highways that will account for \n13,000 deaths a year, we ought to delay earmarks until we make that a \npriority. We lost that vote 82 to 14.\n  I offered an amendment to prohibit funding on bike paths and horse \ntrails until we have done the same thing. We lost that amendment 80 to \n18. I also attempted to strike funding for a peace garden, construction \nof a new baseball stadium, and a visitor's center, bipartisan \namendments. We chose to say, no, we can do that rather than build and \nrestore our highways and bridges.\n  What is as bad as the choices we make are the choices we ignore. And \nthat is the very real need to do extremely heavyhanded oversight on the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse that occurs every day within the Government \nthat we supposedly have our hands on.\n  I know we could cut discretionary spending by at least 10 percent. \nOkay? That is $100 billion a year if we got together and said we are \ngoing to work on these programs together. But we are not going to do \nthat. What we are going to do is keep pointing fingers at one another \nrather than at ourselves and raise the debt limit.\n  We are not going to do that hard work. I believe the American people \nare sick of it. Families across America do not have the luxury of \nloaning themselves new money when they have maxed out their credit. But \nthat is what we are going to do. There is no credit limit for us. One \nis coming. It is coming as we have seen the price of the dollar fall \nrecently. We will certainly see it fall further in the future. There is \ngoing to be a cost.\n  What this vote means is, instead of using this year's appropriations \ncycle to trim waste, to decrease spending, reduce the national debt, \nall we have done is made the problem worse.\n  First, we have not passed any bills through Congress. The bills that \nare in conference, with the exception of one, are at 5 to 6 to 7 \npercent above last year's spending level. So we have admitted we cannot \ndo it. Only weeks after passing a brandnew ethics law, the Senate has \nnow decided it is okay to add new earmarks in authorizing bills. We \nhave also decided that instead of making sure we know the identity of \nearmarks, how much money it is, what is it going for, and who is going \nto get it, we only say: I am offering it, and I do not have any \npecuniary interest in it. What we told the American people was a sham. \nWe are not doing what we said we were going to do.\n  Instead of spending our time trying to figure out how to continue to \nraid the Federal Treasury without getting caught, I believe we ought to \nbe doing our job. Congress should pass individual appropriations bills \nat a level less than last year, with the waste, the fraud, abuse, and \nduplication out of them. But we are not going to do that.\n  The vote on the debt limit gives Congress another opportunity to \ndemonstrate to the American public that we do have the courage and the \nability to fix what is wrong with this ship. By voting for this debt \nlimit, what you are telling the American people is, you do not have the \ncourage to fix what is wrong here. We do not have the courage to do the \noversight that is necessary.\n  Whether it is the $40 billion worth of waste, at least, a year in the \nPentagon, or the $43 billion a year wasted on Medicare and Medicaid \nthrough fraud, or the $18 billion we are spending on buildings that we \ndo not want, we do not have the courage to do that.\n  What we should be doing is tearing up the credit card and, through \nnot passing an expansion or extension of the debt limit, start acting \nlike every other American family has to do and start making the hard \nchoices even if it offends some of our constituents, because the \nconstituents who matter the most, as we continue the heritage of this \ncountry of creating opportunity, are our children and grandchildren.\n  My real hope is this debt limit expansion does not pass tonight, that \nwe all get to reflect on that; we come together, Democrat and \nRepublican, and say: We have not done a good job. Let's\n\n[[Page S12252]]\n\nmake a pact that we are going to do the oversight, that we are going to \ncut the programs, that we are going to lower spending. It does not \nmatter what President Bush wanted. We have the power of the purse. We \ncan decrease spending.\n  Will we do that? Unfortunately, my belief is we will not because, \nquite frankly, we are interested in the next election more than we are \ninterested in the next generation, and to that, shame on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders.) The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a couple of comments. I will \nnot take a long time.\n  I have to observe that there was a time when there was substantial \ncourage in this Chamber. I recall we had some very large budget \ndeficits growing over a long period of time, and we passed a new fiscal \npolicy. I was here then some long while ago. It passed by one vote in \nthe Senate and one vote in the House. That took some courage. Some \npeople who cast those votes did not come back here, because they were \nvery controversial votes.\n  But we turned our fiscal policy around in this country by making \ntough choices. We turned the Federal budget deficit into a Federal \nbudget surplus and began paying down the Federal debt. In 2001, on this \nfloor, in this Chamber, we had a debate about fiscal policy again. A \nnew President came to the White House. President Bush said he was a \nconservative.\n  He said: Well, now, we have all of these surpluses. He and his \nfriend, Alan Greenspan, were worried that the biggest problem facing \nAmerica was that we were going to pay down our debt too rapidly. The \nPresident and the White House said: We have got all of these surpluses. \nLet's decide to give the wealthiest Americans some large tax cuts \nbecause I believe in trickledown economics. Put a lot in the top, and \nsee if some will drain down a bit.\n  Some of us stood on the floor of the Senate and said, you know what, \nwe have just finally turned this economy around, turned these huge \nbudget deficits around. The plan under the Clinton administration \nworked, and we turned big deficits into big surpluses and began to pay \ndown the Federal indebtedness.\n\n  Some of us stood on the floor of the Senate and said: Mr. President--\nto President Bush--maybe we ought to be a bit conservative. What if \nsomething happens? These big surpluses for the next 10 years do not yet \nexist. Yes, there is a surplus now, but we do not have a 10-year \nsurplus that exists. That is the projection. What if something happens? \nWhy do we not be a bit more conservative in how we deal with this?\n  The President and his supporters said: No. No. No. What we are going \nto do is we are going to give very large tax cuts to the wealthiest \nAmericans. We want to do it right now. They won. They had the votes to \nwin, and they turned this economy around, all right. They turned budget \nsurpluses, in a period where we were actually paying down the Federal \ndebt, into some of the largest Federal deficits in this country's \nhistory--once again, unbelievable.\n  So when I hear people talking about courage, let me say we had some \ncourage on the floor of the Senate. I am proud to have been one of them \nwho cast a vote that passed by one vote, that turned around this \ncountry's fiscal policy. And now we leave an example of a fiscal policy \nthat was reckless, one of the most reckless fiscal policies I can ever \nimagine, given to us in 2001 by a new President who said he was \nconservative but who was not.\n  In fact, my colleague just described what we are spending and not \npaying for. Yesterday in the Senate Appropriations Committee, President \nBush sent his Defense Secretary, he sent the Assistant Secretary of \nState, he sent the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to ask us for \nanother $189 billion to prosecute the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. And, \noh, by the way, the President said: I do not intend that we pay for any \nof that; put that right on top of the debt. We are going to charge it \nall.\n  That is the direction this White House is leading. That is what \nbrings us to the floor of the Senate tonight, with a fiscal policy that \nhas rung up an enormous amount of additional debt; the worst possible \nfiscal policy you can imagine.\n  You know what happened? Some of us said, maybe we ought to be a \nlittle bit conservative, a little bit careful. The President said: No. \nNo. No. We are not going to do that. We are going to take these 10 \nyears of estimated surpluses and we are going to spend them with tax \ncuts.\n  Here is what happened very quickly. We were in a recession. The \nPresident likes to say he inherited the recession. He did not. But very \nshortly after he took office, we experienced a recession. Then we \nexperienced the terrorist attack of 9/11, and then a war in \nAfghanistan, then a war in Iraq, then an economic slowdown.\n  Would not it have been smarter to have a fiscal policy that was a bit \nmore careful, one that would have given a bit more thought about how to \nbest care for this country's finances? I know it is easy to blame. I \nwatched today as we had people come to the floor of the Senate blaming \nthis, that, and the other thing. It is easy to take the negative. I \nunderstand that. Mark Twain was once asked if he would engage in a \ndebate. And he said: Oh, sure, as long as I can take the negative side. \nSomebody said: We have not told you the subject. He said: Doesn't \nmatter. If I take the negative side, it will take no preparation.\n  So I understand those who come to the floor of the Senate and tell us \nwhat is wrong. But I can tell you about a fiscal policy that was right, \nbecause I supported it and am proud to have done it some years ago, \nthat turned big deficits into budget surpluses and began paying down \nthe Federal debt. That is the kind of fiscal policy we need. It is the \nkind of fiscal policy we had, and this administration and those who \nsupported it in this Chamber turned their back on it 6 years ago. Now \nwe have paid the price for those votes.\n  I hope those who describe these issues remember, remember what a good \nfiscal policy was and how to recapture it once again. Yes, it take a \nlittle political courage. Those of us who supported a fiscal policy \nthat works understand how it worked when it happened.\n  We have a lot to be thankful for, living in this great country of \nours; only one spot like it on the planet. We have responsibilities \nthat are very significant here in this Chamber. There is plenty wrong \nwith this country, plenty of things that need fixing. But it is a \nwonderful place that requires our stewardship to do the right thing. I \nonly came to the floor as I listened this evening to point out that we \nhave seen good fiscal policy and bad fiscal policy. I, and I think many \nothers, recognize the difference. If all of my colleagues will \nrecognize that difference, we can put this country back on track once \nagain. That is what the American people deserve and expect from us.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before I discuss this legislation, I want to \nexpress my thanks to the distinguished minority leader, Senator \nMcConnell, as well as the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, Senators Baucus and Grassley, for their cooperation in \nfacilitating consideration of this legislation. I also want to thank \nTreasury Secretary Paulson for his leadership.\n  We are taking up this legislation at the request of the Bush \nadministration so that the Federal Government can meet its obligations \nand pay its bills. Secretary Paulson, in a letter to me earlier this \nmonth, indicated that it was essential that the Senate pass this \nlegislation as soon as possible. This will be the fifth increase in the \ndebt limit since President Bush came to office.\n  I find it distasteful and disturbing to increase the debt limit yet \nagain, but the alternative is simply unthinkable. Eventually, some \nSocial Security checks could not be sent. Government offices could \nclose. Interest rates could rise. And the economic impact on our\n\n[[Page S12253]]\n\ncountry could be profound. As a practical matter, therefore, we have no \nchoice.\n  Having said that, President Bush's failed policies put us in this \nbox, and as we consider the pending bill, I hope my colleagues will \nfocus on the importance of changing those policies. Over the past \nseveral years, the administration has completely abandoned fiscal \ndiscipline and dramatically increased our debt. Until we change the \npolicies that led down this path, we will be back year after year, \ndigging the hole ever deeper.\n  Let's review some history. When President Bush came to office, our \nNation was running record budget surpluses and our debt was on the \ndecline. In 2000, we ran a surplus of $236 billion, and the outlook was \nfor continued surpluses for years to come. In fact, the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve at the time, Alan Greenspan, was so optimistic about \nour fiscal condition that he thought we might quickly eliminate our \ndebt altogether.\n  Unfortunately, once President Bush took office, our fiscal situation \nrapidly collapsed. In 2001, our debt was $5.8 trillion. Today, it's $9 \ntrillion, an increase of more than $3 trillion. Compounding matters, \nall this new borrowing has come at the worst possible time, just as the \nbaby boom generation is about to retire.\n  Not only has our debt exploded, but increasingly we are borrowing \nfrom foreigners. In fact, since President Bush took office, our debt to \nforeigners has more than doubled. Many of our creditors are in places \nlike China and Japan. And as we borrow more and more from those abroad, \nwe also become more dependent on them. It is a trend that cannot and \nmust not be allowed to continue.\n  It's no mystery why debt has exploded. President Bush abandoned the \npay-as-you-go rules that proved so effective in promoting fiscal \ndiscipline. He increased spending by 50 percent. And he approved \nmassive tax breaks, disproportionately for multimillionaires and \nspecial interests.\n  Much of the spending has been for our disastrous occupation of Iraq. \nThe war has already cost the lives of almost 4,000 Americans. But while \nour brave men and women in uniform bear, by far, the greatest burden, \nall American taxpayers are paying a price. We have already spent \nroughly half a trillion dollars on President Bush's failed policy. Now \nthe President is asking for nearly $200 billion more.\n  How does the President propose to pay for all this new spending in \nIraq? He doesn't. He just wants to keep putting it on the national \ncredit card.\n  The same is true of the President's massive tax breaks for \nmultimillionaires. Next year, President Bush wants to spend nearly $50 \nbillion just to hand out tax breaks for those fortunate enough to earn \nmore than $1 million a year. These lucky few will get a windfall worth \nan average of $130,000 each. Most hard-working, middle-class families \nwould be grateful for a fraction of that.\n\n  And how will we finance all these lavish tax breaks for \nmultimillionaires? Again, by putting them on the national credit card. \nIn other words, our children will pay.\n  If only the President were as willing to provide kids with health \ncare as he is willing to load them with debt.\n  As you know, the administration claims to have seen the light on \nfiscal responsibility, and has cited the need for discipline to justify \ntheir opposition to the children's health bill. But how much would the \nlegislation add to the debt? $200 billion? $20 billion? No. The answer \nis: zero. Nothing. It is fully paid for.\n  In other words, the President is willing to borrow half a trillion \ndollars and more for Iraq. But he is opposing a children's health bill \nthat won't add anything to the debt.\n  To put it mildly, those priorities are wrong. The American people \nknow it. And most of my colleagues do, as well.\n  Clearly, we need to change course. And this debt limit bill is just \nanother reminder of that.\n  Fortunately, the new Congress already has made real progress in the \neffort to provide a new direction. Earlier this year, we passed a \nbudget resolution that balanced the budget without raising a penny of \ntaxes. The budget put the middle class first and focused on America's \nneeds here at home. All in a responsible way, while reestablishing \nstrong pay-as-you-go rules to enforce fiscal discipline.\n  Our new budget was an important first step. But we have a long way to \ngo to change fiscal policy to where it needs to be. Ultimately, it is \ngoing to take bipartisan effort, and I look forward to working with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to make it happen. Meanwhile, \nwhile it is not a pleasant task, we have no choice but to pay our \nbills.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment for having to vote yet again to increase the national \ndebt limit. The Senate has been forced to take this vote on five \noccasions under this administration. In the intervening 6 years, the \nnational debt has exploded by almost $3.4 trillion, or 61 percent.\n  The national debt now stands at $9 trillion.\n  To put this in terms that most of us can understand, this amounts to \nroughly $30,000 owed by every American.\n  Unfortunately, the debt forecast shows no signs of improving.\n  Over the next 5 years, the debt is projected to reach $11.3 trillion. \nBy 2017, the Congressional Budget Office projects this figure will \nhover around $13 trillion. In this year alone, our national debt is \nslated to increase by almost $600 billion.\n  Maintaining this debt is not free. The interest charged on the amount \nwe have borrowed grows each and every day. And, the more we borrow, the \nmore we pay in interest.\n   Over the next 10 years, the interest payments on the national debt \nare projected to total $2.8 trillion. This year, interest payments on \nthe debt will reach $235 billion.\n  This means less money for the programs that matter most for working \nAmericans.\n  Congressional Democrats have demonstrated a commitment to fiscal \nresponsibility by passing pay-as-you-go budget rules that require \nCongress to offset new spending.\n  This Congress has worked to find ways to pay for major priorities--\nsuch as the extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program, which \nI hope will pass today in the Senate with a bipartisan, veto-proof \nmajority.\n  The fact that the Senate must vote, yet again, to increase the \nnational borrowing limit begs the question: Why are we here?\n  Misguided tax policies are one of the reasons we are considering this \nmeasure today.\n  The President has presided over the greatest fiscal reversal in our \nNation's history. He inherited a budget surplus of $236 billion from \nPresident Clinton, the largest surplus in American history.\n\n  He took that surplus and sunk it into expensive tax cuts at a cost of \nmore than $1.3 trillion to date and $3 trillion over the next decade.\n  But what I find most frustrating, is that these tax cuts have come in \nthe midst of significant military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Never in the history of this Nation have we enacted significant tax \ncuts during a time of war.\n  We have dipped into the pockets of our children and grandchildren and \n``charged'' the costs of these wars to a National credit card.\n  When you combine the cost of the debt-financed tax cuts with spending \nfor the military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the global war on \nterror--currently approaching $610 billion--the inevitable result is \nthat our Federal budget is squeezed, while our crushing debt continues \nto grow.\n  The reality is, even under a best-case scenario, we are years and \nhundreds of billions of dollars away from a full redeployment of \nAmerican troops from Iraq.\n  The President will soon request another $190 billion in supplemental \nfunding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. And it is no longer \nunrealistic to suggest that operations there might cost upwards of $1 \ntrillion before all is said and done.\n  Year after year, supplemental after supplemental, we continue \nborrowing to pay for these wars.\n  In real terms, the cost is over $350 million per day. Almost $15 \nmillion per hour; $250,000 per minute; or $4,000 every second.\n  We must recognize the mistakes of the past few years and understand \nthat\n\n[[Page S12254]]\n\nyou cannot have your cake and eat it too.\n  As we approach a $10 trillion debt limit, it is essential to look \nforward for solutions. Where do we go from here?\n  We start with responsible spending. While I support targeted tax cuts \nto help working families, it is time to allow the tax cuts for the \nwealthiest Americans to expire.\n  It would be unfair and irresponsible to not do so.\n  We need solutions to shore up our strained entitlement programs, such \nas Social Security and Medicare, as the retirement of baby boomers \nlooms.\n  We need to adequately fund children's health and education programs \nand invest in the future of our young people.\n  We need to focus on foreign diplomacy to repair our reputation as a \nglobal leader.\n  We need to invest in homeland security and other domestic programs \nthat will keep America safe and increase productivity.\n  Most importantly, we need to start planning for the future today.\n  Every day that we wait, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent, \nthe debt increases, vital programs are under funded, and the cycle \ncontinues. We must do better.\n  I understand the political realities of this vote.\n  However, it is important to recognize the consequences of this \nmeasure failing. Not increasing the debt limit could result in the \ngovernment defaulting on its obligations, exacerbating already shaky \ncredit markets across the globe.\n  So while I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the measure to \nonce again raise the debt limit, it is also my hope that my colleagues \nwill join me in seeking real and permanent solutions to our Nation's \nfiscal problems.\n  Tax cuts, ``staying the course,'' and not addressing the future of \nour most critical entitlement programs are sometimes politically \nappealing policies, but they are also not responsible.\n  Responsible policies come from making the difficult choices that put \nAmerica's future first.\n  This Congress must exhibit leadership in breaking with the traditions \nof the last few years to put our Nation's fiscal house in order.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today we are again forced to consider \nlegislation to raise the Nation's debt limit. It is obvious to anyone \nthat we are here because of the grossly reckless fiscal policies that \nhave been advanced by the administration and Congress for nearly 6 \nyears.\n  Over those 6 years we have seen a dramatic deterioration in the \nGovernment's ability to perform one of its most fundamental jobs--\nbalancing the Nation's fiscal books. In January of 2001, the \nCongressional Budget Office projected that in the 10 years thereafter, \nthe Government would run a unified budget surplus of more than $5 \ntrillion. Nearly 6 years later, we are staring at almost a mirror image \nof that 10-year, $5 trillion surplus, except that instead of healthy \nsurpluses, under any reasonable set of assumptions, we are now facing \nimmense deficits and mounting debt.\n  We absolutely cannot afford to continue to run up these massive \ndeficits. Doing so causes the Government to use the surpluses of the \nSocial Security trust fund for other Government purposes rather than to \npay down the debt and help our Nation prepare for the coming retirement \nof the baby boom generation. Every dollar we add to the Federal debt is \nanother dollar that we are forcing our children to pay back in higher \ntaxes or fewer Government benefits.\n  But inside this dark cloud of dismal fiscal news there is a silver \nlining; namely, the restoration of the so-called ``pay-as-you-go'' \nbudget rule, known as pay-go, as part of the budget resolution we \nadopted this year. That rule was central to the ability of the Congress \nto balance the Federal budget in the 1990s, and the return of that \ncommonsense discipline gives us a better chance to clean up the fiscal \ndisaster the current administration created. Unlike the last time \nCongress had to raise the debt limit for this administration, we now \nhave pay-go back in place.\n  In some ways, today's vote to raise the debt limit ratifies the \nactions taken by the administration and Congress to stick future \ngenerations with an immense credit card bill. Had we not restored the \npay-go rule recently, I may well have decided not to support this \nmeasure.\n  Fortunately, pay-go has been reinstated, and we will be better able \nto return to the path of fiscal responsibility we abandoned a few years \nago. And because of that, I will support this measure, made necessary \nby the profligate policies of President Bush, and egregiously aided and \nabetted by the last three Congresses.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, all time for debate on the debt limit has \nbeen utilized. In the interest of giving Senators some notice to get \nhere in time for a vote, I alert all Senators that we will probably \nbegin the vote first on the children's health insurance bill and, \nfollowing that, the debt limit. That will begin sometime between 7:20 \nand 7:25. So within about 5 minutes we will begin voting on the \nchildren's health insurance plan.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 1585\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of H.J. Res. 52, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. \n1585 and resume amendment No. 2999; that the amendment be modified with \nthe changes at the desk, that there be 2 minutes of debate divided in \nthe usual form; that upon the use of the time, the amendment be agreed \nto and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the Senate \nthen resume Coburn amendment No. 2196, and there be 10 minutes of \ndebate prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; that no amendment \nbe in order to the amendments in this agreement; that the time be \nequally divided and controlled between Senators Levin and Coburn or \ntheir designee; and upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the amendment; that immediately after \ndisposition of the Coburn amendment, the Senate proceed to Menendez \namendment No. 2972, and that after the amendment is reported by number, \nthere be 6 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Levin and Menendez, or their designees; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time, without further action, the Senate proceed to \nvote with respect to the amendment; that upon disposition of the \namendment, that the managers' package which has been cleared by the \nmanagers, be considered and agreed to; that the Senate proceed to vote \non the motion to invoke cloture on amendment No. 2011, the substitute \namendment; that Members have until 8:15 p.m. tonight to file any \ngermane second-degree amendments; that if cloture is invoked on the \nsubstitute, then all time postcloture be considered expired at 5:30 \np.m. this coming Monday, October 1; that upon adoption of the \nsubstitute, the bill be read a third time, and without further action, \nthe Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; that the cloture \nmotion on the bill be withdrawn; that upon passage, the Senate insist \non its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not be objecting, I just wanted to ask the majority leader if I am \ncorrect in that if this is entered into, there will be no votes \ntomorrow, and the next vote will be late Monday afternoon?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. The first vote will be Monday at approximately 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on third reading of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.J. Res. 52, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 52) making continuing \n     appropriations for the fiscal year 2008, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n\n\n               extending the medicare section 508 program\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Casey  and I, along with our \ncolleagues, Senators Stabenow, Conrad, Lautenberg, Schumer and Dorgan, \nfiled an amendment to H.J. Res. 52, the appropriations continuing \nresolution for fiscal year 2008, to extend the Medicare section 508 \nprogram for 2 years. For a considerable period of time, there have been \na number of hospitals in Pennsylvania and across the country that have \nbeen suffering from low Medicare wage index reimbursement, which has \ncaused them great disadvantage in comparison to surrounding areas. \nHospitals in these counties are surrounded by MSAs--metropolitan \nstatistical areas--with higher Medicare reimbursements, and as a \nresult, a flight of critical medical personnel occurs as hospitals are \nnot able to provide employees with competitive wages.\n  During the consideration of the Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003, I met with Finance \nCommittee chairman Charles Grassley and ranking member Max Baucus about \nthe bill provisions, including the need for a solution to the Medicare \narea wage index reclassification problem in Pennsylvania. Section 508 \nwas included in the bill, which provided $300 million per year for 3 \nyears to increase funding for hospitals nationally to be reclassified \nto locations with higher Medicare reimbursement rates. As part of the \nTax Relief and Health Care Act, which was signed into law on December \n20, 2006, a 6-month extension of the section 508\n\n[[Page S12256]]\n\nMedicare wage index program until September 30, 2007, was included.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank my colleague, Senator Specter, for his important \nwork over the years on this issue, and I greatly appreciate our \ncollaboration since I have taken office to find both an immediate and a \nlong-term solution to the wage index problem. This issue is critical to \nensuring that health care is available to Pennsylvanians and all \nAmericans in areas that are being underfunded by the Medicare wage \nindex reimbursement system. Further complicating this issue are the \nexceptions to the Medicare wage index regulations. Since 1987, \nexceptions have been created to the wage index program for rural \nfacilities, new facilities and others. In fact, in 1999, Congress \npassed legislative reclassifications for specific hospitals to allow \nselected facilities to move to a new MSA and receive greater Medicare \nreimbursement. While these reclassifications have improved funding for \nthose hospitals, hospitals that did not receive improved funding are \nbeing further disadvantaged.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I, too, want to lend my support for a 2-year extension of \nthe Medicare section 508 hospital program. As the chairman and ranking \nmember well know, I worked within the Finance Committee during the \nMedicare Modernization Act to create this vital program. For too long, \nMedicare has shortchanged Rural States, like North Dakota, in the wage \nindex formula by not accurately reflecting real wages. Furthermore, the \nreclassification system has been biased towards urban areas and has \nfailed to take into account the rural health care system experience \nwhere service areas overlap and facilities routinely compete across \nseveral hundreds of miles for professional staff. The section 508 \nprogram has helped to somewhat level the playing field for these \nhospitals--allowing them to improve their wages and make other \nsignificant investments--but its continuation is critical to ensuring \nthe financial viability of many hospitals in North Dakota. The Congress \nmust pass Medicare legislation this fall that includes a 2-year \nextension of the section 508 program.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the leadership my colleagues have shown on \nthis important issue. Extending the section 508 program is a priority \nof the Finance Committee. Unfortunately, an agreement could not be \nreached to include this provision in this bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank my colleagues for introducing this amendment. \nThis program provides vital funding for many hospitals including those \nin Iowa, and I was very disappointed that the House blocked our attempt \nto extend this program. It is unfortunate. Extending this program, \nhowever, does not address fundamental problems related to the wage \nindex system. As mandated under the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of \n2006, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, released their \nreport examining an alternative Medicare wage index methodology. The \nlegislation also requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \npropose revisions to the wage index in the fiscal year 2009 Medicare \nhospital inpatient prospective payment system proposed rule. I look \nforward to considering this proposal as we continue our work to make \nMedicare hospital payments more equitable.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I also wish to thank Senators Specter and Casey for \nraising this issue. We have worked together to ensure the continuation \nof 508 while we work to ensure that Medicare reimbursement more \nadequately reflects our hospitals' true costs. Section 508 funding has \nprovided crucial assistance to a number of hospitals in my State, \nalthough I note that there are still inequities in the reimbursement \nsystem that must be corrected.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am, like my colleagues, strongly in \nfavor of extending the section 508 program. This is a critical program \nfor some New York hospitals, and I appreciate the chairman's commitment \nto include the extension in future Medicare legislation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would also like to thank the chairman and ranking \nmember for their leadership on this issue and Senators Specter and \nCasey for their continued support. Without an extension of the section \n508 program, hospitals in New Jersey stand to lose over $22 million. \nThese hospitals cannot afford to sustain this loss and still provide \nthe care needed to New Jersey residents. I look forward to working with \nmy Senate colleagues to provide an extension of this important program.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank Senators Specter and Casey for raising this \nissue. Extending the section 508 program is critical for many North \nDakota hospitals and is an important step to address the long-standing \ninequities in Medicare payment between urban and rural providers. I \nappreciate the commitment of the chairman and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee and look forward to working with them to see that \nthis extension is enacted.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee for their support on this issue. The House of Representatives \nhas already moved forward to pass legislation that would extend this \nprogram. This program is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2007, and \naction to extend the program for 2 years must be taken. Mr. Chairman, I \nappreciate our conversations about this issue in which you expressed \nyour commitment to working to pass an extension to the section 508 \nMedicare wage index program this fall that will also make hospitals \nwhole to the date of expiration.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand that the Senate is likely to take up \nlegislation which will include a number of Medicare provisions during \nthis session of Congress. I would appreciate the assurance of the \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee that any Medicare \nrelated legislation that is considered by the Senate this session \ninclude a 2-year extension of the section 508 program that is \nretroactive to October 1, 2007.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I assure my colleagues that I am committed to working to \naddress concerns about this issue as part of any Medicare related \nlegislation that may come before the Senate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I look forward to working with Chairman Baucus and \nother Finance Committee members to address this issue.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleagues and look forward to working with \nthem on this issue.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank my colleagues as well and look forward to \nresolving this issue.\n\n\n                                  eas\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, with regard to the fiscal year 2008 \ncontinuing resolution that the Senate is taking up today, I would like \nto pose a question to the Senators from West Virginia and Washington. \nIt is my understanding that the Commerce Committee has drafted a bill \nto reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, and that bill, \nS. 1300, should reach the Senate floor this session. That bill includes \nlanguage with regard to Essential Air Service, EAS, to extend the \nstate-determined mileage waiver. I thank the Committee for its work on \nthat provision as it affects an airport in my State, as well as \nairports in South Dakota and Pennsylvania. In the interim, I would like \nto clarify that it is the intention of the Appropriations and Commerce \nCommittees that EAS support continue for the airports in Hagerstown, \nMD; Brookings, SD; and Lancaster, PA along with the other airports \nnationwide that will continue to receive EAS funding through the \nContinuing Resolution today. I would direct this question to the \nchairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety & \nSecurity if it his intent to continue EAS support for airports in \nHagerstown, MD; Brookings, SD; and Lancaster, PA?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes. We do hope to pass the full FAA authorization \nthis session, and it contains the EAS mileage waiver. In the interim, \nit is the intent of the Committee that EAS funding should continue to \nthese airports.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I would further like to get the views of the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Related Agencies on this matter.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. This continuing resolution provides funding for the \nEssential Air Service program at the current rate with the expectation \nthat the program shall continue to function as it is functioning now. \nWe expect the Department of Transportation to avoid any major policy \ndecisions that can impact\n\n[[Page S12257]]\n\nthis program during the period of the continuing resolution--especially \ngiven the fact that there is already legislation reported out of \ncommittee and awaiting Senate action that addresses the continuation of \nair service to these communities.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I commend my colleague from Maryland for addressing \nthis issue. I am a member of the Appropriations Committee and I, too, \nunderstand that the Committee intends to continue EAS funding under the \ncontinuing resolution to airports in Maryland, South Dakota, and \nPennsylvania that currently receive it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. This issue also affects an airport in my home State, in \nLancaster, PA. Based on the provisions in the full FAA authorization, I \nagree that it is the intent of the committee that EAS funding should be \nextended to the airports currently affected by the EAS state-\ndetermination mileage waiver.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. An airport in Bookings, SD, is also affected by the \nstate-determination mileage waiver. So I am pleased to hear from all of \nmy fellow appropriators that EAS funding should continue uninterrupted \nto the affected airports.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank all of my colleagues--both those responsible for \nthe FAA reauthorization and those responsible for appropriating the \nfunding for EAS--for making it clear that they expect the airports in \nHagerstown, Lancaster, and Bookings to receive EAS funding under the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we are about to \nbegin the 2008 fiscal year without having enacted any of the \nappropriations bills for that year. I am even more disappointed that we \nare about to vote on a continuing resolution that provides tens of \nbillions of dollars to continue the misguided war in Iraq but does not \ninclude any language to bring that war to a close. We need to keep the \nFederal Government operating and make sure our brave troops get all the \nequipment and supplies they need, but we should not be giving the \nPresident a blank check to continue a war that is hurting our national \nsecurity. For that reason, I will be voting against this resolution.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to speak \nabout the continuing resolution on which the Senate will soon vote. The \nresolution itself is a reasonable product that is largely the result of \nbicameral, bipartisan discussions. The resolution will allow the day-\nto-day functions of our Government to continue and will provide at \nleast some of the additional funding that is necessary for our troops \nin Iraq and Afghanistan to execute the mission with which they have \nbeen tasked. It is also worth noting that the resolution does not \nattempt to use its inherent leverage to force any significant or \ncontroversial policy changes. I urge my colleagues to support passage \nof the resolution.\n  But as we come to the end of the fiscal year, I must express my deep \nconcern about the lack of progress toward enacting the appropriations \nbills. This lack of progress is not the fault of the Appropriations \nCommittee. Under Chairman Byrd's leadership, the committee reported all \ntwelve bills in ample time to be considered by the full Senate over the \ncourse of the summer. But for whatever reason, to date the Senate has \npassed only four of the twelve regular appropriations bills, and \nprospects for consideration of the remaining bills appear uncertain at \nbest.\n  Last year, under Republican leadership, the Senate failed to send all \nbut two of the appropriations bills to the President. We were roundly \ncriticized for this, and rightly so. As a result we left Federal \nagencies to limp along on a continuing resolution for 5 months, and \nwere then presented with a full-year, formula-driven joint funding \nresolution to which no Senator had an opportunity to offer amendments. \nThat is a process that I hope will not be repeated. No Senator should \nwant that.\n  We simply need to buckle down and do our work. It is true that the \nPresident has said he will veto many of the appropriations bills based \non his concerns about spending levels. It seems that there are people \non both sides of the aisle and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue who \nfeel strongly about that question, and who are quite anxious to have \nthat debate. But we can't have the debate if we don't call up the \nbills. The President can't veto what we haven't presented to him, and \nCongress can't vote to uphold or override a veto that never gets \nexecuted.\n  I understand that completing action on the remaining bills seems like \na daunting task. But I know of no better way to complete such a task \nthan to roll up our sleeves and get to work. I am pleased to hear the \nmajority leader suggest that next week we will consider the Defense and \nthe Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bills. This is good news. I \nurge my colleagues to offer their amendments promptly when these bills \nare called up and to recognize that the opportunity to offer amendments \nto the subsequent bills is dependent on completing action on the \npending bills.\n  It is particularly critical that we complete action on the Defense \nappropriations bill and the supplemental appropriations necessary to \nsupport the men and women in our Armed Forces and our diplomatic corps. \nWhile I am encouraged that we may consider the regular Defense \nappropriations bill next week, I am seriously concerned about reports \nthat Congress may not consider a supplemental appropriations bill for \nthe global war on terror until next year. While the continuing \nresolution we will pass tonight contains some ``bridge'' funding to \nsupport the troops through November 16, is an inadequate amount for the \nlonger term.\n  As directed by Congress, the President submitted an FY 2008 war \nsupplemental request in February. We expect to receive an amendment to \nthat request any day. The Appropriations Committee held a hearing on \nthese requests on Wednesday, and should be prepared in short order to \nact on legislation to fund our troops in the field. Delaying \nconsideration of such legislation until next year is simply \nunacceptable. We have spent the last 2 weeks, and much of this \nCongress, in earnest and often useful debate on Iraq war policy. \nAmendments have been offered and votes have been taken. Deeply felt \ndisagreements remain.\n  But the fact is that we have tens of thousands of American men and \nwomen in Iraq and Afghanistan performing the mission that their \nGovernment has assigned to them. The new fiscal year is upon us, and it \nis time for us to get on with the business of providing our men and \nwomen in uniform the resources they need to perform that mission \nsuccessfully. To try to change American policy in Iraq by slowly \nstarving our troops of those resources is unfair, and it is dangerous \nto American interests.\n  I urge the Senate to both forge ahead to complete action on the \nregular appropriations bills and to act promptly to provide our troops \nwith the supplemental funds that they need.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on the third reading of the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is on passage of the joint resolution.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), and the Senator from Illinois \n(Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me add my commendation to Senators Webb \nand McCaskill and the others who fought so hard for this amendment. The \nheart of this amendment has remained. There have been some changes in \nit. But the substance of this amendment, the crying need for a \ncommission to look into the contract abuses and waste and fraud is very \nstrong. This amendment is going to do some important work for the \ncountry and for the next time we are in a situation where we have such \nmassive spending as we have in this war.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--I have cleared this with my \nfriend, Senator Warner--that we vitiate the vote on the Menendez \namendment--that has been done? Fine.\n\n[[Page S12260]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that we \nmay have printed in the Record at this point such other statements \nrelative to the changes that we deem appropriate to support this \namendment, including a document dated September 25, 2007, by the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense subject: ``Management of DOD Contractors and \nContract Personnel Accompanying U.S. Armed Forces in Contingency \nOperations Outside the United States.''\n  This is a step by the Deputy Secretary to correct some of the \nproblems that this commission will be addressing. It underlies the \nnecessity for the commission that these two Senators and others have \nadvocated.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              The Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2007.\n\n  Management of DoD Contractors and Contractor Personnel Accompanying \n U.S. Armed Forces in Contingency Operations Outside the United States\n\n       Defense contractors fulfill a variety of important \n     functions for the Department of Defense, both inside the \n     United States and abroad. These functions encompass vital \n     support to our military forces engaged in combat operations \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan to include security for convoys, \n     sites, personnel and the like.\n       While investigations are still ongoing and no findings of \n     wrongdoing determined, recent events regarding non-DoD \n     contractors performing security service in Iraq have \n     identified a need to better ensure that relevant DoD policies \n     and processes are being followed. This review is applicable \n     for all policies and processes to manage DoD contractors \n     accompanying U.S. armed forces in contingency operations \n     outside the United States. DoDI 3020.41, ``Contractor \n     Personnel Authorized to Accompany the U.S. Armed Forces,'' is \n     the comprehensive source of policy and procedures concerning \n     DoD contractor personnel.\n       Geographic Combatant Commanders are responsible for \n     establishing lines of command responsibility within their \n     Area of Responsibility (AOR) for oversight and management of \n     DoD contractors and for discipline of DoD contractor \n     personnel when appropriate. Accordingly, addressees will \n     ensure the consistency of their implementing guidance for \n     policies outlined in DoDI 3020.41 and ensure contracts being \n     executed within an AOR require DoD contractors to comply with \n     the respective geographic Combatant Commander's guidance for \n     the AOR including, for example, Rules on the Use of Force \n     (RUF).\n       DoD contractor personnel (regardless of nationality) \n     accompanying U.S. armed forces in contingency operations are \n     currently subject to UCMJ jurisdiction. Commanders have UCMJ \n     authority to disarm, apprehend, and detain DoD contractors \n     suspected of having committed a felony offense in violation \n     of the RUF, or outside the scope of their authorized mission, \n     and to conduct the basic UCMJ pretrial process and trial \n     procedures currently applicable to the courts-martial of \n     military servicemembers. Commanders also have available to \n     them contract and administrative remedies, and other \n     remedies, including discipline and possible criminal \n     prosecution.\n       Under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act \n     (MEJA), federal jurisdiction exists over felony offenses \n     committed outside the U.S. by contractor personnel of any \n     federal agency or provisional authority whose employment \n     relates to supporting the DoD mission. Implementing guidance \n     under this Act is included in DoDI 5525.11, ``Criminal \n     Jurisdiction Over Civilians Employed by or Accompanying the \n     Armed Forces Outside the United States, Certain Service \n     Members, and Former Service Members,'' and military \n     department regulations. This instruction requires DoD \n     coordination with the Department of Justice for the return to \n     the U.S. of contractor personnel subject to MEJA for \n     prosecution.\n       Pursuant to these authorities, addressees as appropriate \n     will:\n       1. Ensure that all required clauses are included in DoD \n     contracts when contract performance requires contractors and \n     contractor personnel to accompany U.S. forces in contingency \n     operations.\n       2. Verify that all DoD contractors ensure that their \n     personnel authorized to carry weapons as security personnel \n     or for personal protection have been properly trained and \n     licensed for the weapons they are authorized to carry and \n     appropriately trained on the applicable RUF.\n       3. Provide appropriate discipline for unauthorized \n     possession, carrying, or discharging weapons.\n       4. Ensure that instructions have been issued to their \n     command and to their contractors to prevent contractor \n     personnel who are suspected of having committed a felony act \n     or of having committed an act in violation of the RUF from \n     being allowed to leave the country until approved by the \n     senior commander in the country or until an investigation is \n     completed and a decision is rendered by the flag officer \n     court martial convening authority. Officials of contracting \n     firms who arrange for, facilitate, or allow such personnel to \n     leave the country before being cleared will be subject to \n     disciplinary action under either UCMJ or MEJA.\n       5. Review periodically the existing RUF and make any \n     changes necessary to minimize the risk of innocent civilian \n     casualties or unnecessary destruction of civilian property.\n       6. Require DoD contractors performing security services to \n     provide to the Combatant Commander copies of their Standard \n     Operating Procedures (SOPs) and guidance to their contractor \n     personnel on escalation of the use of force, the use of \n     deadly force, and on the rules for interaction with host \n     country nationals who may be present and/or potentially \n     involved in a situation perceived by contractor personnel as \n     a potential threat to their mission or to themselves. Require \n     that such SOPs and guidance be modified as necessary to be \n     consistent with the RUF.\n       7. Review periodically the guidance and authorization for \n     DoD contractor personnel to possess and carry weapons.\n       Over the past several months, the Department has been \n     developing and staffing additional guidance regarding this \n     UCMJ disciplinary authority over persons serving with or \n     accompanying the armed forces during contingency operations. \n     The UCMJ authority referenced in this memorandum remains in \n     effect until modified by promulgation of such additional \n     guidance.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we are prepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment has \nbeen agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2196\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next question is on amendment No. 2196, \noffered by Senator Coburn. Ten minutes will be evenly divided.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. We voted \nto increase the debt limit. We have a project that the Department of \nJustice, the DEA, and all the other drug enforcement agencies say is \nineffective.\n  I am going to give you some quotes from the people who worked there \nand what they had said. Former official of the Drug Czar's office put \nit bluntly: ``We see nothing from this.''\n  The former, most recently resigned, Director: ``I recognize that many \nof the reports were god-awful, poorly written, poorly researched, and \nin many cases just plain wrong.''\n  Jim Milford, former NDIC Deputy, admitted: ``I have never come to \nterms with the justification for the NDIC, and the bottom line is we \nactually have to search for a mission.''\n  These are good people who work there. It is not about them. It is \nabout whether we are going to be prudent with the money we spend. They \nhave one program that is effective. It is called DOCX. The problem with \nit being where it is, is it cannot be applied there, it has to be \napplied at other drug intelligence centers and the other DEA centers \nthroughout the country.\n  The administration, the Department of Justice, the DEA and all the \nother drug centers, especially the one in El Paso, is where this \ninformation ought to be processed.\n  We have spent half a billion dollars and gotten very little return. \nIt is a recommendation that we have a chance to do something. We have a \nchance to eliminate a program that is not effective by any metric that \nthe Government has applied or the former Directors have applied or the \nDeputy Directors have applied who have worked there, saying it is not \neffective.\n  My hope is this body will approve this amendment and start us down \nthe road of eliminating programs that are ineffective.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will yield half the time in opposition to \nthe Coburn amendment to the two Senators from Pennsylvania, half to \nSenator Specter and half to Senator Casey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will you advise me when the 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes have expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, contrary to the arguments of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, the National Drug Intelligence Center has been \nfunctioning since 1993 and has never been challenged on this floor in \nany respect. It has not been challenged until today because it has \nperformed so well.\n  Yesterday I had printed in the Record the extensive compliments\n\n[[Page S12261]]\n\nwhich have been paid by the FBI in an expansive letter on November 21, \n2001, by DEA, the Drug Enforcement Agency; on June 21, 2006, by FBI \nfield offices around the country, including Tampa, Detroit, and \nCharlotte, by U.S. attorneys around the country. It has performed with \nvery strategic results. It is important to decentralize operations such \nas the National Drug Intelligence Center. Everything does not have to \nbe in Washington. It costs about a third to do it in Johnstown as it \nwould in Washington.\n  When the Senator from Oklahoma says it ought to be in El Paso because \nall the drugs come from El Paso, that is simply not true. Drugs come \ninto this country from Miami, from New York, from Detroit, from \nCalifornia. They come from everywhere.\n  It has been in existence for 14 years and is functioning \nsuccessfully. It is not a minor matter that it has 340 jobs. Johnstown \nhas become accustomed to having this. Johnstown, as is well known \nhistorically, has had its tough time with two major floods. It doesn't \ndeserve another flood by having this body saying the office ought to be \nremoved at this time.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Scranton, PA.\n  Mr. CASEY. I wish to reiterate much of what Senator Specter already \nsaid. This center is providing important law enforcement services right \nnow, helping out on international drug trafficking, which helps out in \nthe fight against terrorism.\n  If we came to this floor every week and talked about what some \nGovernment agency said about a particular facility such as this, we \nwould be having these votes all the time. I was the auditor of \nPennsylvania. I know a lot about waste, fraud, and abuse. I know how to \nfind it and root it out. But I also know you cannot take one Government \nagency's word for it. This center is providing an important service \nright now, in crime fighting, in keeping local law enforcement working \nwith the Federal Government.\n  It is an important facility in the State of Pennsylvania. There are \npeople there who are working hard in Johnstown, PA. This is a diversion \nfrom some other things we have been doing.\n  This is very important that we support this kind of facility. All the \nanswers do not reside in Washington, DC. There are some people out \nthere who know how to fight crime, some people out there who know how \nto root out and crack down on drug trafficking.\n  This center plays that role. I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. What you did not hear is what is the mission of the NDIC. \nIt has no mission. That is the problem. The agency running this center \nsays it should be closed--for very good reasons. It does not have an \ninternational mandate. They have had people fired because they are \ndoing things that are outside of what restricted mission they have.\n  The one program that works is DOSX, and those people who are \nfunctioning with DOSX have to go to wherever the information is, which \nthey are extracting in the investigation. None of that is done in \nJohnstown. So if they travel, it doesn't matter where they start.\n  The point is, the people who work there, who have run it, the people \nwho are managing it, and the rest of the Drug Enforcement Agency and \nthe rest of our drug intelligence says it has no mission. It has \naccomplished very little. I rest my case and would appreciate a vote.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware Mr. (Biden) the \nSenator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), and the Senator from Illinois \n(Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 26, nays 69, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 356 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--26\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Coburn\n     Cornyn\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Rockefeller\n     Sessions\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n\n                                NAYS--69\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Biden\n     Brownback\n     Clinton\n     McCain\n     Obama\n     The amendment (No. 2196) was rejected.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

personality disorder is \n     inappropriate pending diagnosis and treatment, and, if so, \n     whether initiation of medical board procedures for the member \n     is warranted.\n       (b) Secretary of Defense Report on Administrative \n     Separations Based on Personality Disorder.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than April 1, 2008, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall

order.\n       (D) A discussion of measures being implemented to ensure \n     that members of the Armed Forces who should be evaluated for \n     disability separation or retirement due to mental

LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP (LCS) PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The plan of the Chief of Naval Operations to \n     recapitalize the United States Navy to at least 313 battle \n     force ships is essential for meeting the long-term \n     requirements of the National Military Strategy.\n       (2) Fiscal challenges to the plan to build a 313-ship fleet \n     require that the Navy exercise discipline in determining \n     warfighter requirements and responsibility in estimating, \n     budgeting, and controlling costs.\n       (3) The 55-ship Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program is \n     central to the shipbuilding plan of the Navy. The inability \n     of the Navy to control requirements and costs on the two lead \n     ships of the Littoral Combat Ship program raises serious \n     concerns regarding the capacity of the Navy to affordably \n     build a 313-ship fleet.\n       (4) According to information provided to Congress by the \n     Navy, the cost growth in the Littoral Combat Ship program was \n     attributable to several factors, most notably that--\n       (A) the strategy adopted for the Littoral Combat Ship \n     program, a so-called ``concurrent design-build'' strategy, \n     was a high-risk strategy that did not account for that risk \n     in the cost and schedule for the lead ships in the program;\n       (B) inadequate emphasis was placed on ``bid realism'' in \n     the evaluation of contract proposals under the program;\n       (C) late incorporation of Naval Vessel Rules into the \n     program caused significant design delays and cost growth;\n       (D) the Earned Value Management System of the contractor \n     under the program did not adequately measure shipyard \n     performance, and the Navy program organizations did not \n     independently assess cost performance;\n       (E) the Littoral Combat Ship program organization was \n     understaffed and lacking in the experience and qualifications \n     required for a major defense acquisition program;\n       (F) the Littoral Combat Ship program organization was aware \n     of the increasing costs of the Littoral Combat Ship program, \n     but did not communicate those cost increases directly to the \n     Assistant Secretary of the Navy in a time manner; and\n       (G) the relationship between the Naval Sea Systems Command \n     and the program executive offices for the program was \n     dysfunctional.\n       (b) Requirement.--In order to halt further cost growth in \n     the Littoral Combat Ship program, costs and government \n     liability under future contracts under the Littoral Combat \n     Ship program shall be limited as follows:\n       (1) Limitation of costs.--The total amount obligated or \n     expended for the procurement costs of the fifth and sixth \n     vessels in the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) class of vessels \n     shall not exceed $460,000,000 per vessel.\n       (2) Procurement costs.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     procurement costs shall include all costs for plans, basic \n     construction, change orders, electronics, ordnance, \n     contractor support, and other costs associated with \n     completion of production drawings, ship construction, test, \n     and delivery, including work performed post-delivery that is \n     required to meet original contract requirements.\n       (3) Contract type.--The Navy shall employ a fixed-price \n     type contract for construction of the fifth and following \n     ships of the Littoral Combat Ship class of vessels.\n       (4) Limitation of government liability.--The Navy shall not \n     enter into a contract, or modify a contract, for construction \n     of the fifth or sixth vessel of the Littoral Combat Ship \n     class of vessels if the limitation of the Government's cost \n     liability, when added to the sum of other budgeted \n     procurement costs, would exceed $460,000,000 per vessel.\n       (5) Adjustment of limitation amount.--The Secretary of the \n     Navy may adjust the amount set forth in paragraphs (1) and \n     (4) for either vessel referred to in such paragraph by the \n     following:\n       (A) The amounts of increases or decreases in costs \n     attributable to compliance with changes in Federal, State, or \n     local laws enacted after September 30, 2007.\n       (B) The amounts of outfitting costs and costs required to \n     complete post-delivery test and trials.\n       (c) Repeal of Superseded Authority.--Section 124 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 \n     (Public Law 109-163; 119 Stat. 3157) is repealed.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2265, as modified\n\n       On page 299, line 7, strike ``fifth fiscal year'' and \n     insert ``fourth fiscal year''.\n       On page 299, line 9, strike ``fifth fiscal year'' and \n     insert ``fourth fiscal year''.\n\n\n                           Amendment no. 3087\n\n (Purpose: To require reports on the utilization of tuition assistance \n                benefits by members of the Armed Forces)\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 673.

REPORT AND MASTER INFRASTRUCTURE RECAPITALIZATION \n                   PLAN REGARDING CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN AIR STATION, \n                   COLORADO.\n\n       (a) Report on Relocation of North American Aerospace \n     Defense Command Center.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     submit to Congress a report on the relocation of the North \n     American Aerospace Defense command center and related \n     functions from Cheyenne Mountain Air Station, Colorado, to \n     Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado.\n       (2) Content.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) an analysis comparing the total costs associated with \n     the relocation, including costs determined as part of ongoing \n     security-related studies of the relocation, to anticipated \n     operational benefits from the relocation; and\n       (B) a detailed explanation of those backup functions that \n     will remain located at Cheyenne Mountain Air Station, and how \n     those functions planned to be transferred out of Cheyenne \n     Mountain Air Station, including the Space Operations Center, \n     will maintain operational connectivity with their related \n     commands and relevant communications centers.\n       (b) Master Infrastructure Recapitalization Plan.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than March 16, 2008, the \n     Secretary of the Air Force shall submit to Congress a master \n     infrastructure recapitalization plan for Cheyenne Mountain \n     Air Station.\n       (2) Content.--The plan required under paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) A description of the projects that are needed to \n     improve the infrastructure required for supporting missions \n     associated with Cheyenne Mountain Air Station; and\n       (B) a funding plan explaining the expected timetable for \n     the Air Force to support such projects.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the\n\n[[Page S12271]]\n\n     Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a \n     close debate on the pending substitute amendment to Calendar \n     No. 189, H.R. 1585, National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2008.\n         Mitch McConnell, C.S.

Inhofe, Thad Cochran, \n           Michael B. Enzi.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \nAmendment No. 2011, offered by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, in \nthe nature of a substitute to H.R. 1585, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, shall be brought to a close?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just 30 seconds. I hope the Senate will \nvote for cloture. Let me give the rundown of amendments we have now \nadopted.\n  One hundred ninety-one amendments have now been adopted through \neither clearance in voice vote or rollcall. We have a lot of amendments \nleft. We will be here tomorrow, and we will be here on Monday. If \ncloture is invoked, we will work the best we can to see if we can get \nsome germane amendments adopted, even those that we agree by unanimous \nconsent may not be germane but should be adopted. I hope cloture is \ninvoked. We will be here tomorrow and Monday to work on amendments.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support many of the priorities in this \nbill, and I do not think the Senate should extend debate on it \nindefinitely. But, if we invoke cloture on the bill, as it currently \nstands, we will be ensuring that it contains no language to bring our \ninvolvement in the Iraq war to a close. That would be a mistake. The \nwar in Iraq is taking a tremendous toll on our servicemembers and our \nmilitary preparedness--not to mention our national security and our \npocketbook. It is irresponsible for Congress to pass legislation \nauthorizing the activities of the Department of Defense that fails to \nbring our troops home and this war to an end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are mandatory under the \nrule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are now on the bill in a postcloture \nstatus. The distinguished chairman, Senator Levin, is here. I am here. \nWe are prepared to deal with whatever amendments come forward this \nevening and, again, we will be here tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nKennedy-Mikulski amendment, as amended by the distinguished majority \nleader.\n  I know the hour is late so I will not speak at length, but I will \nspeak with passion about what this amendment is all about.\n  This is about contracting out. I am here to join in an amendment that \nprotects our Civil Service, protects our taxpayers, and protects \nGovernment workers. I think we would all agree that America needs an \nindependent Civil Service and that our Federal employees are on the \nfront lines every day working hard for America. This administration's \nplan for privatization is a quota-driven plan that costs money, morale, \nand the integrity of the Civil Service. It forces Federal employees \ninto unfair competition and forces them to spend time and money \ncompeting for their jobs instead of doing their jobs. The \nadministration has stacked the deck against Federal employees with \ntheir A-76 competitions, but I am here to level the playing field along \nwith my colleagues.\n  This amendment is simple. It helps Federal employees compete for \ntheir jobs and at the same time, makes sure\n\n[[Page S12274]]\n\nthe Federal Government saves money. My other colleagues who are \ncosponsors will focus on different pieces of this amendment, but I am \nhere to talk about three specific parts.\n  First of all, this amendment saves taxpayers money. When the \nadministration passed these new quota-driven bounty-hunting A-76 rules, \ncontractors were not even required to show they would save the \nGovernment any money--but we thought that was the point of it--so we \nhad some private contracts that actually cost the Government more money \nthan if Federal employees were doing the work.\n  Now, the amendment that is pending would require that all contracts \nsave $10 million or 10 percent. You must save money: $10 million or 10 \npercent. So Federal workers will not be losing their jobs to contractor \nbids that do not even save the Government or the taxpayers money.\n  Second, it deals with the issue of health and retirement benefits. \nRight now, a private contractor can win a bid on Federal work simply \nbecause they provide either no health and retirement benefits or skimpy \nor Spartan benefits, this is bad for Federal employees and bad for the \ncontractors doing the work.\n  This amendment would prohibit contractors from winning a bid if the \nonly cost savings are from bad or no benefits. This is to prevent \nbagging benefits in order to win the contract. This helps level the \nplaying field for Federal employees who have to submit their own best \nbids, but they have to include these health and retiree benefits.\n  Number 3, really, this is what I think is crucial, and I hope my \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle will hear this. This \namendment eliminates privatization quotas. Remember, the new Bush rules \nare quota driven. It makes those who are pushing the A-76 in an agency \nthe equivalent of a bounty hunter.\n  Now, let's deal with the word ``quota.'' I have heard a lot about \nquotas in my day, usually from the other side in a very pejorative way. \nHey, what happened to goals and timetables? I thought we did not go for \nquotas in this Senate. I thought we were for goals and timetables. \nRemember discussions on affirmative action? ``We don't want no \nquotas.'' Well, I do not want quotas in privatization. Quite frankly, I \ndo not even want goals and timetables in privatization. But OMB imposes \nprivatization quotas on all Federal agencies, forcing them to conduct \nA-76 competitions on as many as 150,000 jobs each year. What a huge \nwaste of money. These quota-driven bounty hunters force these wasteful \nA-76 reviews, even on agencies that do not want to do them or in \ncategories that give them pause to pursue. It wastes time. It wastes \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  This amendment would stop OMB from using quotas to force agencies to \nconduct these privatization reviews. This would not prevent agencies \nfrom contracting out work. It would simply allow Federal agencies to \nmake their own decisions about when to use the A-76 process.\n  Now let me be very clear. I am not opposed to contracting out. I am \nnot opposed to privatization. In my own State it has worked well. Look \nat Goddard Space Flight Center. We have 3,000 civil service jobs, but \n9,000 private contractor jobs. In this way, we get incredible value for \nour space dollar. I am proud of them both, and they work well together. \nThey serve the Nation well.\n  But the way this administration is going about privatization does not \nwork. We need this amendment because the way contracting is being \npursued is irresponsible. It even puts our Nation's security at risk.\n  I want to give one specific issue--contracting out at Walter Reed. \nBefore my dear colleague Senator Paul Sarbanes left, we were on this \nfloor fighting an A-76 contract for contracting out facilities \nmanagement for people who handle the grounds and so on at Walter Reed. \nWe challenged that A-76 because there had been over three to six \nappeals. Each time the Federal employees won. However, the \nadministration pushed and pushed and pushed. As we were battling it out \non the floor, I read a letter from the colonel who said: If you \ncontract this out, I am concerned there will be a degradation of \nservice at Walter Reed.\n  Well--guess what--we lost the amendment. Walter Reed contracted out \nits facilities management. We went from 300 employees, who kept Walter \nReed tip top for our wounded warriors, down to 50 people, and we ended \nup with a national scandal.\n  Now, you tell me, what did we gain from that contracting out? How \ncould you look in the eyes of a wounded warrior at Walter Reed and at a \nhospital that was ridden with mold and rot, for which we all had to go \nout and pound on the table and pound on our chest about the outrage? We \ncould have stopped the scandal at Walter Reed if we had stopped that \ncontracting out--300 people to 50. Why did it take 300 people at Walter \nReed? Because it is an older building. It is several buildings. Our \nwounded warriors were in hospitals that made international headlines \nbecause we could not take care of our own.\n  Well, I am now taking care of this contracting out. So this amendment \nis the ``remember the Walter Reed scandal'' amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will join with me. Yes, we will privatize where appropriate. \nYes, we will privatize where we will get value for our dollar. But I \ndon't want any kind of privatization that ends up in a national scandal \nand a national disgrace.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the threat \nposed by Iran, but I voted against the amendment offered by Senators \nKyl and Lieberman because it could be interpreted as an authorization \nto keep U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely to police the Iraqi civil war \nand engage in a proxy war with Iran. Maintaining a significant U.S. \ntroop presence in Iraq is undermining our ability to deter Iran as it \nincreases its influence in Iraq, becomes bolder in its nuclear \naspirations, and continues to support Hezbollah. The administration \nneeds to end its myopic focus on Iraq and develop comprehensive, \neffective strategies for dealing with Iran and the other serious \nchallenges we face around the world.\n  Mr. President, I voted against Senator Biden's amendment because, \nwhile we should support a comprehensive political settlement in Iraq, \nthe U.S. Government shouldn't tell the Iraqi people how to run their \ncountry.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor Senator Biden's \namendment calling on the United States to actively support a Federal \nsystem of government in Iraq.\n  The brutal reality is that Iraq today is being torn apart by \nsectarian violence. The Maliki government in Baghdad is too weak and \ntoo corrupt to lead Iraq's Sunni, Shia and Kurdish communities to the \npolitical reconciliation they need to end the fighting. Iraq is being \ntorn apart by civil war, and U.S. military forces are caught in the \nmiddle.\n  It is clear to me that President Bush has no strategy for ending the \nwar in Iraq. It is up to Congress to provide the way forward to bring \nstability to Iraq and to bring our troops home. Our military has done \neverything we have asked them to do, valiantly and skillfully. But the \nexperts all agree: there is no military solution in Iraq. We need a \ncomprehensive political settlement that gives the Iraqi people control \nover their own fate and allows our troops to come home.\n  Senator Biden has proposed a plan to maintain a united Iraq by \ndecentralizing it. Rather than putting our troops between warring \nfactions, this plan would give the Kurds, Sunni and Shia control over \ntheir own land and people, while leaving a central government in \nBaghdad responsible for protecting common national Iraqi interests. \nThis plan has five major parts.\n  Step one is establishing three autonomous regions in Iraq with a \nfunctional central government in Baghdad. Each region would have \nauthority over its own domestic laws, administration, and internal \nsecurity. The central government would control border defense, foreign \npolicy, and oil revenues. This would give Iraq's sectarian groups \ncontrol over their own destiny and ensure that Iraq does not splinter \ninto pieces, creating regional chaos.\n  Step two of the Biden plan is to secure the cooperation of Iraq's \nSunni minority. The Sunni Arabs in Iraq do not have access to the same \noil wealth enjoyed by the Kurds in the north and the Shia in the south. \nUnder this plan, Iraq's central Government would guarantee the Sunni's \neconomic viability\n\n[[Page S12275]]\n\nby pledging 20-percent of Iraq's oil revenue. It would address Sunni \npolitical concerns by allowing former members of the Baath party to \njoin Iraq's national Government. Iraq's Sunnis must have confidence \nthat they can prosper and thrive in a peaceful Iraq, so they will lay \ndown their arms and end their destructive insurgency.\n  Step three of this plan is to call on the international community and \nIraq's neighbors to help stabilize Iraq by accepting this federal \narrangement and respecting Iraq's borders and sovereignty. Iraq will \nneed strong support from the international community to ensure that its \nneighbors do not try to expand their influence into any of the three \nautonomous regions created under this federalist system.\n  Step four calls for the withdrawal of most U.S. military forces from \nIraq. We would leave a small but effective residual force behind to \nhelp Iraq's security forces combat terrorism and protect Iraq's \nborders, but most U.S. forces would be out of Iraq before the end of \n2008. We know there is no military solution to Iraq's current problems, \nand we know the armed militias that are tearing Iraq apart will never \nlay down their arms as long as the U.S. military has a large presence \nin their country. Withdrawing most U.S. troops will demonstrate to the \nIraqi people that they must take responsibility for building a \npeaceful, stable Iraq. A small but lethal contingent of U.S. forces \nthat remains either in Iraq or nearby can help the Iraqis combat \nterrorism and deter mischief by Iraq's neighbors.\n  Finally, the Biden plan calls for robust international support for \nreconstruction in Iraq. This economic assistance must be conditioned on \nrespect for minority and women's rights. The international community \nhas an interest in seeing a vital, healthy Iraq, but we should use our \nresources to help Iraq build a society based on equality for all. By \nproviding economic opportunities for every Iraqi, we can help end the \nviolence and build a strong, stable Iraq.\n  We know that President Bush has no plan for stabilizing Iraq or \nending the war. The Biden plan can lead to a lasting political solution \nin Iraq that stops the violence and allows our military forces to come \nhome. I am proud to support it, and I am proud to cosponsor this \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to inform the \nSenate about amendment No. 2981. I greatly appreciate Chairman Levin's \nand Ranking Member McCain's cooperation in including it in the \nmanagers' package.\n  My amendment to the Defense authorization bill calls for a review of \nthe Department of Energy's strategic plan for advanced computing. This \nreview would be completed by the independent scientific advisory group \nand assess where the Department is headed in this important area.\n  The measure focuses attention on the essential role our national \nlaboratories play in advancing the state of the art for high \nperformance computing a vital area for our national security and \nscientific leadership.\n  Our laboratories have been instrumental in pressing the limits of raw \ncomputing power and creating more sophisticated simulation \ncapabilities.\n  Since the early days of scientific computing and continuing through \nthe development of today's advanced parallel computing systems, the \nlaboratories pioneered the development of high performance computing \nand software development. From developing advanced computing \narchitectures and algorithms to effective means for storing and viewing \nthe enormous amounts of data generated by these machines, the \nlaboratories have made high performance computing a reality.\n  These capabilities have become a requirement for certifying the \nnation's nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing. They also \nfind application far outside laboratory walls.\n  The Stockpile Stewardship Program was created as the alternative to \nunderground nuclear testing, to ensure that our nuclear weapons systems \nwould remain safe, secure and reliable. Doing so without nuclear \ntesting required significant investments in computer modeling and \nsimulation.\n  This investment has paid enormous dividends. Every year, computing \npower increases at a pace set by America's national laboratories. The \nworld's current fastest supercomputer is Lawrence Livermore's ``Blue \nGene,'' which recently exceeded 280 ``teraflops'' or trillions of \ncalculations per second. Oak Ridge's ``Jaguar'' system and Sandia \nNational Laboratory's ``Red Storm'' are second and third, each \nexceeding 100 teraflops.\n  The applications go well beyond security and basic science. The \nlaboratories have worked hard to transition these capabilities to \nacademia and industry, simulating complex industrial processes and \ntheir environmental impact including global climate change.\n  Collaborations with the private sector have also driven down the \ncost, so that now high performance does not mean high expense. This has \nhad an enormous impact, making advanced computing within the reach of \nan ever wider circle of users including the Department of Energy's \nOffice of Science.\n  At the labs today, not only do these computers run advanced \nexperimental models that give us confidence in our nuclear deterrent, \nbut they also help us decipher the human genome and develop improved \nmedicines. Advanced computing has also helped Sandia engineers \nunderstand the safety risks to the Space Shuttle, when the foam from \nthe fuel tank hit and damaged the heat tiles.\n  We will continue to use advanced computing to support engineering \ndesign work to ensure that our bridges and infrastructure are safe, as \nwell as filter massive amounts of data in an effort to predict where \nterrorists are planning to attack next.\n  These achievements did not happen by accident. They required \nplanning, commitment and follow through.\n  Unfortunately, I am concerned that we may be losing this focus and \ncommitment to support long term research on advance computing \narchitectures and continue the search for even greater simulation \ncapabilities. The Department of Energy and the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration appear not to have a coordinated strategy for \nadvancing the state-of-the-art in computing and instead propose to \nactually reduce computing capacity within the laboratory system. I \nbelieve this is a mistake.\n  In the Senate Energy and Water Development appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2008, Chairman Dorgan and I have proposed to establish a \njoint program office for high performance computing led by the NNSA \nAdministrator and the Under Secretary for Science. This office will \nhave the primary responsibility of ensuring a well balanced portfolio \nof computing platforms for the DOE and the Nation.\n  The proposed office will develop a high performance computing \ntechnology roadmap and acquisition strategy for the DOE. I strongly \nbelieve that DOE and NNSA must pool their resources and establish an \nadvanced computing R program. A long term, Department-wide strategy \nis necessary to ensure that the world class simulation capabilities \nwithin the complex are maintained and investments are made to drive \ninnovation. If the past success of the program is a predictor, there \nwill be amazing new technological innovations and the cost of computing \nwill fall like a stone. This will ensure that universities, \nlaboratories, U.S. businesses and law enforcement will have the \ncomputing capability necessary for their success.\n  We must continue to raise the bar, giving our best and brightest new \ntargets to aim for, ensuring that America will retain its technical \nleadership in advanced computing.\n  I would like to pay tribute to the men and women of Sandia, Los \nAlamos and Livermore National labs and their private sector \ncounterparts at Cray, IBM, and Intel, and the Department of Energy and \nthe NNSA. These individuals have worked extraordinarily hard to solve \ncomplex computing architecture and software challenges. This work has \npaid off and we must remain committed to future excellence in this \nfield.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a listing of the world's \nfastest computers be printed in the Record. I would like for my \ncolleagues to note that 8 of the top 10 computers are located at U.S. \nDepartment of Energy national labs and universities and this would not \nbe the case except for the investments made by the Department of \nEnergy.\n\n[[Page S12276]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Top 10 Fastest Supercomputers in the World (June 2007)*\n\n       Name, Location--Speed (TFlops/s).\n       1.

Mr. President, I wish to express my concern about the \ncurrent agenda of the U.S. Senate.\n  For about 16 days, we have been debating the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2008. I do not think that any Member \nof this Chamber believes this is an unimportant or throwaway piece of \nlegislation. This bill is about our troops and our veterans. It is \nabout their health care. It is about their equipment. It is about how \nwe treat those individuals who have put on the uniforms of our Armed \nForces and served our Nation.\n  The Defense bill before us authorizes $24.6 billion for the defense \nhealth program, including a $1.9 billion adjustment to fund TRICARE \nbenefits. The bill includes authorization for the purchase of upgrades \nto Bradley fighting vehicles and the purchase of Stryker vehicles. This \nlegislation authorized research into technology that will keep our \ntroops safer while they carry out their current missions and research \ninto medical technology that will help with battlefield diagnostics and \ncare for any wounded warrior.\n  In the midst of considering this troop-related bill, we are now \nconsidering amendments on items completely unrelated to the men and \nwomen in uniform. This kind of political gamesmanship is precisely why \ncongressional approval ratings are at an all-time low.\n  Are we going to provide the resources our men and women in the \nmilitary need by passing this Defense bill or are we going to stuff \nthis bill so full of nondefense policy and programs that the \nlegislation blows up like a makeshift terrorist explosive device? The \nmajority party is in charge of getting critical bills through, yet they \nare delaying passage of these bills by trying to empty their outbox \nfull of controversial issues. Unfortunately, the authors of these \nunrelated special interest amendments have chosen the latter.\n  The first amendment set to come before us for a vote is legislation \non hate crimes. When it is the appropriate time to be debating the \nmerits of a hate crime bill then I will debate that. Debating it in \nrelation to a bill we need in order to provide for our military is not \nthe appropriate time. We have also been told to expect amendments \nrelated to immigration. The Senate earlier this year spent weeks on \nimmigration legislation--that is where debate on that amendment should \noccur.\n  As my colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, stated, there is a time \nand a place for everything. A bill drafted to address our national \ndefense and our troops is not the place for these amendments.\n  Instead of focusing on the needs of our troops in the field, our \nwounded warriors needing medical attention, and our veterans who have \nserved us all, the authors of these amendments seek to distract our \nattention and delay progress on this bill.\n  I sincerely hope all Members of the Senate will put these issues \naside for a more appropriate time for debate and let us proceed on \nimproving the lives of our troops. Let's put our troops first on the \nSenate agenda.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I was pleased to join my co-chair of the \nSenate Tanker Caucus, the senior Senator from Utah, in introducing \namendment No. 2895. And I am very glad that the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee chose to join with our caucus in \npreparing a compromise amendment, No. 3104, that makes clear how \ncrucial recapitalizing our tanker fleet is to our national security.\n  I thank Senator McCain and Senator Levin for their leadership on this \nissue and their willingness to accept this amendment.\n  In October of last year, the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce made a very important announcement. They declared that their top \nacquisition priority for the future is the replacement of our Nation's \naerial refueling tanker fleet. This program could cost about $13 \nbillion over the next 5 years, and perhaps $100 billion over the next \nthree decades.\n  The senior Senator from Utah and I joined forces to form a caucus in \nsupport of this vital objective. We believe that updating our aerial \ntanker fleet is crucial if we are to continue to be able to project \nAmerican military power around the globe.\n  The U.S. national security strategy depends on a robust air refueling \ncapability, as do our coalition partners. No other nation in the world \nhas a comparable capability. The U.S. advantage in tankers is at the \ncenter of almost all the other strategic capabilities of our Air Force.\n  Yet today, our tanker fleet is the oldest part of the Air Force \ninventory making maintenance difficult and expensive. The KC-135 makes \nup over 90 percent of our refueling capability, but the average age of \nthat fleet is over 45 years. The ``E-Model'' aircraft have the oldest \nengines and are rapidly declining in utility. Their mission capable \nrates have dropped significantly, and their cost-per-flying hour has \nincreased.\n  Despite generations of meticulous maintenance, these tankers are \ngetting toward the end of their economic service life. Uncertainty \nabout corrosion problems creates a significant vulnerability--we could \nfind a serious problem in a few of these aircraft that could result in \nthe whole fleet being grounded.\n  And that would have catastrophic results, as General Michael Moseley \nmade very clear in comments on October 12. ``In this global business \nwe're in, the single point of failure of an air bridge, or the single \npoint failure for global intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, \nor the single point of failure for global strike is the tanker,'' he \nsaid. ``To be able to bridge the Atlantic, to be able to bridge the \nPacific, or to be able to let business in the theater be persistent \nbusiness in the theater, it's the tanker.''\n  To reverse that vulnerability, the Air Force is taking steps to \nreplace these tankers. The tanker caucus supports that effort. The Air \nForce is also taking steps to make sure that a portion of the current \ntanker fleet is kept viable as they work to develop and buy the next \ngeneration tanker. This amendment supports that effort as well, by \nspecifically referencing the Air Force's strategy to modify and upgrade \nan appropriate portion of the KC-135 fleet to ensure that it remains \nviable as the Air Force waits for new tankers to be delivered. Nothing \nin this amendment would further constrain the Air Force's ability to \nretire the oldest tankers as they deem necessary.\n  Finally, this amendment recognizes that the procurement of aerial \nrefueling on a fee-for-service basis may also end up being part of the \nsolution to preventing a temporary gap in tanker capability--though I \ndoubt that it will make up a major portion of our overall tanker \ncapacity.\n  The Air Force is working through two competing submissions for tanker \nreplacement in response to the request for proposals it issued last \nyear. This full, free and open competition will help to achieve the \nbest value possible for the taxpayer on this major program.\n  As General Moseley noted, ``It's important to get started'' on this \nimportant acquisition program. The time is right to begin \nrecapitalizing this vital national asset. The Air Force predicts that a \nfunding shortfall this year would likely lead to a 6 to 9 month delay \nin fielding the new tankers.\n  The original amendment that Senator Hatch and I offered was co-\nsponsored by Senators Dorgan, Gregg, Roberts, Sununu, Cantwell and \nInhofe. It simply expressed the sense of the Congress that timely \nreplacement of the Air Force tanker fleet is a vital national security \npriority, and presented the reasons for that judgment. The McCain-\nConrad amendment makes the same point in expressing\n\n[[Page S12277]]\n\nthat modernizing the tanker force is a vital national security \npriority.\n  While some members and some committees differ on the amount of \nfunding that they believe is required to carry out this program fiscal \nyear 2008, I believe that the Senate can agree that carrying out this \nprogram is a vital national security priority. I appreciate my \ncolleagues' support for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, is there any objection if we proceed to \nmorning business?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is no objection on this side. We \nwill resume the bill tomorrow morning, I presume, around 10 o'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12277-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, although we are in morning business, I wish \nto add some comments to what Senator Mikulski said about privatization \nbecause what we have seen throughout our Government--whether it is \nMedicare, the efforts to privatize, which, unfortunately, have been \npartially successful at privatizing but not so successful in serving \nthe public, serving seniors, and the totally unsuccessful effort to \nprivatize Social Security--what we have seen in public education, what \nwe have seen in the prison system in my State of Ohio, what we seen in \nseveral kinds of efforts to privatize have often resulted in more \ntaxpayer dollars being spent, a reduction in service, to be sure, less \nefficiency, and less accountability.\n  So her amendment is right on the mark. Her efforts in privatization \ngenerally are very important. I thank the senior Senator from Maryland \non that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12277-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12277-S12278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TRADE POLICY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, our Nation's haphazard trade policy has \ndone plenty of damage to Ohio's economy, to our workers--from \nSteubenville to Cambridge, from Portsmouth to Wauseon--to our \nmanufacturers--in Bryan and Cleveland and Akron, and Lorain--and to our \nsmall businesses in Dayton, Cincinnati, and Springfield.\n  Recent news reports of tainted foods and toxic toys reveal another \nhazard of ill-conceived and unenforced trade rules. They subject \nAmerican families, American children, to products that can harm them--\nthat in some cases can actually kill them.\n  Our trade rules encourage unsafe imports. Our gap-ridden food and \nproduct inspection system lets those imports into our country. Our lax \nrequirements for importers let those products stay on the shelves. And \nour foot dragging on requiring country-of-origin labeling leaves \nconsumers in the dark. It is a lethal--all too lethal, all too often--\ncombination.\n  With a total lack of protections in our trade policy, we do not just \nimport goods from another country, we import the lax safety standards \nof other countries. If we relax basic health and safety rules to \naccommodate Bush-style, NAFTA-modeled trade deals, of course, we are \ngoing to find lead paint on our toys and toxins in our toothpaste.\n  Just think of it this way: When we trade with a country, when we buy \n$288 billion of products from China, for instance--a country that puts \nlittle emphasis on safe drinking water, on clean air, on protections \nfor their own workers, on consumer protection, and then they sell those \nproducts to the United States, why would they care about products, \nconsumer products, toys that are safe or food products that are safe, \nwhen they do not care about that in their own country for their own \nworkers and for their own consumers?\n  Add to the fact that U.S. companies put tremendous pressure on their \nChinese subcontractors to cut the cost of production to cut their own \ncosts, and the Chinese are going to use lead paint because it is \ncheaper. They are going to cut corners on safety because it is cheaper.\n  At the same time, the Bush administration has weakened our Food and \nDrug Administration, Department of Agriculture, and Consumer Product \nSafety Commission rules, and that is compounded even further because \nthey have cut the number of inspectors. So why should we be surprised \nwhen we see toys in our children's bedrooms that are dangerous, or when \nwe see vitamins in our drugstores and food in our grocery stores that \nare contaminated?\n  Due to trade agreements, there are now more than 230 countries and \nmore than 200,000 foreign manufacturers exporting FDA-related goods--\nFDA-regulated goods--to American consumers.\n  Before NAFTA, we imported 1 million lines of food. Now we import 18 \nmillion lines of food. One million lines of food in 1993; today it is \n18 million lines of food.\n  Unfortunately, trade deals put limits on the safety standards we can \nrequire for imports and even how much we can inspect imports. I will \nsay that again. We pass a trade agreement with another country. It puts \nlimits on our own safety standards, and it puts limits on how much we \ncan inspect those imports.\n  Our trade policy should prevent these problems--not bring them on.\n  Now the President, though, wants new trade agreements with Peru, \nPanama, South Korea, and Colombia--all based on the same failed trade \nmodel that brought us China, that has brought us NAFTA, that has \nbrought us the Central American Free Trade Agreement.\n  This Chamber will soon consider--maybe even next week--a trade \nagreement with Peru. Some may wonder why we are entering into new trade \nagreements right now considering we have had five straight years of \nrecord annual trade deficits.\n  When I first ran for Congress in 1992, on the other side of the \nCapitol, to be a Member of the House of Representatives, our trade \ndeficit was $38 billion. Today, it exceeds $800 billion. Our trade \ndeficit with China was barely double digits 15 years ago. Today, it \nexceeds $250 billion.\n  The NAFTA/CAFTA trade model has driven down wages and working \nconditions for workers in Marion and Mansfield and Bucyrus and Canton \nand all across the United States and abroad.\n  This kind of trade has torn apart families' health care and pension \nbenefits. It undermines our capacity even to produce equipment vital to \nour national security.\n  Contrary to promoting stability in Peru and the Andean region, as \nthis trade agreement's supporters would say, these trade agreements are \nactually more likely to increase poverty and inequality.\n  This month, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \nissued a report warning developing countries--poorer nations that are \ndoing trade agreements with us--to be wary of bilateral and regional \nfree trade deals. The U.N. Report cited the North American Free Trade \nAgreement as an example of a trade agreement that may have short-term \nbenefits for poor countries but has long-term harm. We know what NAFTA \ndid to Mexico's middle class. We know what NAFTA did to its rural \nfarmers. Well over 1.3 million farmers were displaced since the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement in Mexico.\n\n  Let's look at Peru for a moment. Nearly one-third of Peru's \npopulation depends on agriculture for its livelihood. The development \ngroup Oxfam estimates that 1.7 million Peruvian farmers will be \nimmediately affected by this trade agreement. When those farmers can't \nget a fair price for wheat or for barley or for corn, they are forced \nto produce other crops--almost inevitably, including coca. That means \nmore cocaine production, it means more illegal drugs in the United \nStates. We have been there before. We have seen that before. We have \nseen the rural dislocation in Mexico, after NAFTA, and there is nothing \nto suggest the Peru trade agreement will be any different.\n  Scholars, including former World Bank Director Joseph Stiglitz, note \nthat rural upheaval from trade deals means more violence, more U.S. \nmoney spent on drug eradication.\n  An archbishop in Peru said:\n\n\n[[Page S12278]]\n\n\n       We are certain this trade agreement will increase the \n     cultivation of coca, which brings drug trafficking, \n     terrorism, and violence.\n\n  So if we are talking about combating terrorism around the world, the \nexactly 180-degree wrong thing to do is a trade agreement with Peru \nbecause it will mean, as the archbishop said, the increased cultivation \nof coca because we will put some of their corn farmers, their barley \nfarmers, their wheat farmers out of business. More coca, more drug \ntrafficking, more terrorism, more violence, more instability.\n  We need a new trade approach in our policy, one that benefits workers \nhere and promotes sustainable development with our trading partners.\n  This Peru agreement has some improvements in labor and the \nenvironment. It is important to note that this change in the \nadministration's view toward labor and environmental rules of trade \nagreements would not have happened without voters' demand for change \nlast year. But the demand for change in trade policy runs deep. We have \nheard workers in Ohio and around the country call for big changes in \ntrade policy, and we are hearing consumers in Avon Lake and in \nKettering demand accountability for the unsafe imports that are on our \nshelves. Passing a trade agreement with Peru is not the change we need. \nWe want trade. We want more trade. We want trade under different rules \nand, most importantly, our responsibility is to protect our family's \nhealth and protect our children.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12278-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING MR. WILLIAM W. WIRTZ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the life of \nWilliam W. Wirtz, a truly outstanding Illinoisan who passed away this \nweek.\n  Bill Wirtz was a businessman, sports fan, and philanthropist. He took \nover operation of Judge & Dolph in Illinois in 1950 and expanded that \nbusiness into the Wirtz Beverage Group, comprised of five \ndistributorships in four States. He also served as president of Wirtz \nCorporation, Director of First Security Trust and Savings Bank, and \nchairman of the South Miami Bank Corporation. But most Chicagoans will \nremember him as the owner and president of the Chicago Blackhawks \nhockey team.\n  The Wirtz family bought the Blackhawks in 1954, and Bill was named \npresident of the organization in 1966, a title he maintained for over \n40 years. Bill was a true hockey fan. During his lifetime, he helped \nnegotiate the merger between the NHL and the World Hockey Association, \nserved on the 1980 and 1984 Winter Olympic Committees, and was chairman \nof the Board of Governors of the National Hockey League for 18 years. \nIn recognition of his many contributions to the sport, Bill Wirtz was \ninducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n  Bill Wirtz also gave a great deal back to the community and the city \nof Chicago. Along with Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, he was a driving \nforce behind the construction of the United Center to replace the old \nChicago Stadium in 1994. He also established the Chicago Blackhawk \nCharities, which has donated over $7.5 million to worthy causes in the \nChicago area. Perhaps closest to Bill's heart was the development of \nthe Virginia Wadsworth Wirtz Sports Program at the Rehabilitation \nInstitute of Chicago. Named after his mother, this program is a year-\nround, cross-disability sports and recreation program.\n  Bill Wirtz is survived by his wife Alice, five children and seven \ngrandchildren. They have my condolences and those of so many who knew \nhim. Bill's many contributions to Chicago and Illinois will not soon be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12278-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DONNA L.

She previously served in many positions of responsibility for \nthe association. Ms. Pile was also president of the PIA of Kentucky in \n2000 and has been Kentucky's representative on the PIA National Board \nof Directors since 2000. Ms. Pile is also a member of the National \nAssociation of Insurance Women.\n  Active in her community, Ms. Pile is managing partner of the A.G. \nPerry Insurance Agency of Lexington.

She has taught PIA \nYoung Agents classes and also served on numerous strategic planning \ncommittees for Jessamine County Schools.\n  As president of the National Association of Professional Insurance \nAgents, Ms. Pile's dedication to the highest standards of her \nprofession has earned her the respect of friends, associates, business \ncolleagues, and the insurance industry as a whole. She took seriously \nher role to advocate for professional insurance agents across the \nUnited States and has left behind a stronger organization for her \nefforts.\n  I want to recognize today the many successes that Donna L.

Mr. President, next April, the people of Northern \nIreland will commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Belfast Agreement, \nwhich did so much to put Northern Ireland on the path to end the \nviolence that had afflicted the population for three decades, and \nachieve the longstanding goal of peace.\n  On September 20, the Irish Times published a perceptive article by \nTrina Vargo, President of the U.S.-Ireland Alliance emphasizing that \nmore remains to be done and urging the people of Belfast to this \nauspicious anniversary as an opportunity to remove the so-called \n``peace'' walls that continue to divide the Protestant and Catholic \ncommunities in Belfast.\n  The walls are still serving as physical and psychological barriers \nbetween the two communities, and Ms. Vargo's article offers a timely \nand creative idea that could have a widespread beneficial impact in \nNorthern Ireland. Analogizing it to the fall of the Berlin Wall, she \nsuggests that the simple act of removing walls can be a significant \ngesture in breaking down barriers in a community and promoting progress \nand unity.\n  Ms. Vargo was a member of my staff and did an excellent job on the \nissue of Northern Ireland for many years, and I believe her article \nwill be of interest to all of us in Congress, especially those who \nworked with Ms. Vargo on this issue. I ask unanimous consent that the \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Irish Times, Sept. 20, 2007]\n\n               Time To Tear Down These Walls of Division\n\n       With things settling down in Northern Ireland, isn't it \n     time to consider taking down the so-called ``peace'' walls \n     separating communities instead of erecting more, asks Trina \n     Vargo.\n       Everyone of a certain age distinctly remembers the fall of \n     the Berlin Wall in 1989. The sight of East and West Germans \n     joining in celebration on the wall, and the chipping away of \n     it over the following weeks, demonstrated to the world--in a \n     way that no other act could--that the cold war was truly \n     over. Can the walls come down in Northern Ireland? Next \n     April, Senator George Mitchell will return to Belfast to \n     participate in an event marking the 10th anniversary of the \n     Belfast Agreement. We have also invited Taoiseach Bertie \n     Ahem, Tony Blair and Bill Clinton to join him and other \n     negotiators of the agreement, as well as the DUP, to consider \n     Northern Ireland's divided past and its shared future.\n       We hope that the people of Belfast will consider using this \n     occasion to take down at least a part of the ``peace'' line \n     and send a message to the world, and to themselves. I\n\n[[Page S12279]]\n\n     recently visited Belfast to begin conversations about this \n     with community leaders, politicians, former paramilitaries, \n     and the police. While some expressed scepticism, a much \n     larger number were eager to begin the conversation. Some were \n     conjecturing, hoping that their interface community might be \n     confident by April. After all, many unexpected and welcome \n     things have happened this year in Northern Ireland. It would \n     be naive to underestimate concerns about the dismantling of \n     that which has provided physical and psychological protection \n     for many years. And walls coming down won't alone solve \n     Northern Ireland's many problems--disaffected youth, a \n     growing suicide rate, a parochial outlook, high levels of \n     economic inactivity, and an economy overly reliant on the \n     state.\n       It is also disheartening to see new walls going up in some \n     neighbourhoods at the very time the virtual walls between \n     Ireland and Northern Ireland are coming down. Progress at the \n     political level is slowed by a lack of confidence on the \n     street. The loyalist community, in particular, is still \n     reeling from political developments it didn't see coming. \n     What is now most necessary for Northern Ireland is economic \n     development. Foreign investment and increasing tourism can \n     play a part in that. While the political developments that \n     have occurred this year are truly incredible, they only \n     briefly and barely registered on the world's consciousness.\n       It is likely that there is only a small window of \n     opportunity with the business community in the U.S. \n     Disproportionate attention has been paid to Northern Ireland \n     for more than a decade and there is a sense that it's sorted. \n     Attention will wane.\n       In 1998, when I was Senator Ted Kennedy's foreign policy \n     adviser, I contacted a Massachusetts company with a call \n     centre in Northern Ireland, thinking the company might like a \n     photo opportunity with Senator Kennedy when he visited \n     Northern Ireland.\n       That was the last thing they wanted. Many of their clients \n     didn't know where the call centre was located.\n       They feared they would associate Northern Ireland with \n     disruption and that wouldn't be good for business. Northern \n     Ireland must dispel any remaining doubts that it is bad for \n     business. Nothing will say that like walls coming down.\n       It is no coincidence that the walls are in the most \n     economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods of Belfast and it \n     is these neighbourhoods that have so much to gain by their \n     removal.\n       It is worth considering how much the walls prevent problems \n     and how much they are an invitation to confrontation.\n       A fundamental shift in thinking about neighbours previously \n     not known, feared and hated is required. It won't happen \n     overnight. But there are some hopeful signs. There are \n     excellent cross-community projects at several interfaces.\n       The parades season went off peacefully. And those inciting \n     violence at interfaces are no longer paramilitaries but \n     alcohol-fuelled teenagers.\n       While such anti-social behaviour by teenagers can be found \n     in most American cities, the danger in Belfast is the \n     potential those otherwise minor incidents have to turn into \n     riots.\n       Many in interface neighbourhoods feel powerless, left \n     behind, and they know that the walls are holding them back, \n     economically as well as psychologically. But the removal of \n     walls is something they do have control over.\n       This will be for people there to decide. We are simply \n     providing a date on the horizon with the hope that it might \n     spur conversation and consideration. In order to most \n     accurately assess what the people at interfaces think, we \n     will soon commission a survey of people living at interfaces.\n       When will peace truly come to Northern Ireland? When walls \n     fall. There is nothing more evocative of Northern Ireland's \n     divided past, and nothing more indicative of a shared future \n     than their removal.\n       Trina Vargo is the president of the U.S.-Ireland Alliance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12279-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CELEBRATING THE 108TH BIRTHDAY OF THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF THE \n                             UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary \norganization with a membership consisting of the best and the bravest \nAmerica has to offer. On Saturday, September 29, 2007, we honor the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, more commonly known as \nthe VFW, by celebrating the organization's 108th birthday.\n  The VFW is defined by a record of service and commitment to our \ncountry and our veterans. From initially fighting to protect our \nfreedom overseas, to later ensuring that veterans have the compensation \nand care they deserve back home, the 2.3 million members in \napproximately 8,400 Posts worldwide deserve our thanks and recognition.\n  Since 1899, when a group of 13 Spanish-American War veterans convened \nto advocate for the benefits then denied to their comrades in arms, the \nVFW has worked tirelessly to protect the rights of fellow veterans \nwhile continuously honoring the service of those who made the ultimate \nsacrifice to protect our way of life.\n  One of the many privileges I have in serving New Hampshire is working \nwith representatives of the Granite State's VFW Auxiliary Posts. Never \nlosing sight of the organization's mission or obligations, the \nstraightforward approach of members serves as a breath of fresh air. \nThey ask direct questions and expect direct answers. New Hampshire's \nVFW members should be proud of their representation.\n  Nationally, the VFW is committed to its mission to ``honor the dead \nby helping the living'' through veterans' service, community service, \nand steadfast advocacy of a strong national defense. This dedication \ncan be witnessed through the organization's work to create the Veterans \nAdministration, its efforts to establish numerous memorials in memory \nof those who have served, and its devotion to improving the \neducational, health, and other benefits owed to returning veterans. \nMoreover, the VFW's efforts in the community, annually providing more \nthan 13 million hours of volunteerism and donating $2.5 million in \ncollege scholarships, further endears the organization and its members \nto all Americans.\n  At a time of ongoing conflict abroad, the VFW welcomes our returning \nservicemembers with support, guidance, and camaraderie as they readjust \nto life on the home front. Additionally, as they continue to serve the \ncommunities around them, VFW members act as role models whose \nexperiences and commitment to service provide a beacon of light in \ntoday's society. For their longstanding and continued contributions, \nthe VFW and its members deserve our immense respect and sincere \ngratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12279-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12279-S12280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   50TH ANNIVERSARY OF LITTLE ROCK CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL DESEGREGATION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this week marks the 50th anniversary of the \ndesegregation of Little Rock Central High School, a victory for \nequality in education that was only secured with the help of Federal \ntroops. The images that came out of Little Rock in September 1953 \nremain indelible: the National Guard literally standing in the way of \nequal education; a citizens' blockade threatening to break into mob \nviolence at the mere thought of sharing their school with Black \nstudents; and the quiet dignity and courage of the Little Rock Nine. \nTheir determination to claim their rights is still a source of \ninspiration, but the rest of the Little Rock crisis is a source of \nshame.\n  So we do two things on this 50th anniversary. First and foremost, we \nhonor the nine young students who integrated Little Rock and who gave \neloquent testimony that equality begins with education. We thank them \ntoday: Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence \nRoberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray Karlmark, \nThelma Mothershed, and Melba Pattillo Beals.\n  But second, we need to forthrightly face the truth this week: 50 \nyears later and 53 years after Brown v. Board of Education, the work \nthey helped begin is still incomplete. Segregation in law is over, but \nwho can doubt that it persists in fact? National Guard troops may no \nlonger be blocking children from the door to an equal eduation, but the \nforces that have taken their place, if less visible, are no less \npotent.\n  Whether an American child has good teachers, whether that child has \nup-to-date textbooks, whether that child goes to school in a safe, \nmodern building--all of these educational essentials depdend far too \nmuch on where that child happens to live. In fact, America--the country \nthat struck down segregation more than a half-century ago--ranks at the \nbottom of developed countries in the disparity of schooling it offers \nto the rich and the poor. Why doesn't that gap shame us just as much as \nanything that happened in Little Rock?\n  Mr. President, a textbook published in this millenium should not be a \nluxury. Modern school buildings and computers and libraries should not \nbe luxuries. Qualified teachers, competent guidance counselors, \nrigorous curricula, small classes--they should not\n\n[[Page S12280]]\n\nbe luxuries. Children should not be entitled to them because they \nhappen to live in affluence; they are entitled to them because they \nlive in America.\n  Let us look to this important anniversary for inspiration to \ndesegregate American education for good and for all--to complete the \nwork begun so bravely by the Little Rock Nine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12280-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COURAGE AND BRUTALITY IN BURMA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the past 10 days, people around the \nworld have watched with admiration and increasing trepidation as over \n100,000 courageous Burmese citizens, led by thousands of maroon clad \nBuddhist monks, have demonstrated peacefully in Burma's capital city in \nsupport of democracy and human rights. They have been calling for an \nend to military dictatorship and the release of Burma's rightful, \ndemocratically elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been either in \nprison or under house arrest for 11 of the past 18 years.\n  Today, there are reports that Burmese soldiers had cordoned off the \nstreets, fired tear gas, shot and killed several of the protesters and \na Japanese journalist, raided monasteries and arrested opposition party \nmembers and hundreds of monks. The vicious response by the Burmese \nmilitary against masses of peaceful, dignified, unarmed citizens, while \nnot surprising, is intolerable and should be universally condemned.\n  Earlier this week, President Bush made a forceful statement before \nthe United Nations General Assembly criticizing the repression of \nBurma's military leaders and announcing tighter sanctions and visa \nrestrictions. The President's announcement is welcome.\n  U.S. leadership is essential, but it can only go so far. Bringing \ndemocracy and human rights to the Burmese people will require far \nstronger pressure from its neighbors and trading partners such as \nChina, Thailand, Russia, and India. It will require these and other \nnations to disavow the failed policies of engagement with the Burmese \njunta.\n  I have long believed that engagement is most often the best policy, \nbut there comes a time when it has demonstrably failed, and there is no \nmore obvious example of this than Burma. A different approach is long \noverdue.\n  Burma's friends and allies must make unequivocally clear what \nPresident Bush and others have said, and what the brave citizens of \nBurma are calling for: Burma will suffer severe economic sanctions \nunless Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners are released and \nthe generals in charge agree to hand over power.\n  In his own speech at the United Nations, Secretary General Ban Ki-\nmoon voiced hope that the Burmese junta would ``exercise utmost \nrestraint'' and engage in a dialogue with ``relevant parties'' in \nseeking national reconciliation. Obviously, that has not happened. \nSince then, the Secretary General has sent his special envoy to Burma \nto try to convince the Burmese junta to resolve this crisis peacefully.\n  It is very disappointing that China, Burma's largest trading partner, \nhas once again put its economic interests, and Burma's corrupt \ngenerals, above the fundamental rights of the Burmese people. China, \nwhich has more influence over the Burmese junta than any other \ngovernment, blocked the U.N. Security Council from adopting a \nresolution condemning the violence.\n  It is a sad commentary on a country that the rest of the world \nentrusted to host the next Olympics. While China has urged the generals \nto exercise restraint, history has shown that in Burma words alone are \nnot enough. We hoped China would act differently this time, but so far \nwe have been mistaken.\n  Many times in the past, peaceful protests in Burma have been put down \nwith brute force. Countless Burmese citizens have been imprisoned or \nkilled for doing nothing more than speaking out in support of \ndemocracy.\n  The past 10 days of protests have attracted far greater crowds, and \nbecause of the Internet the whole world can see their numbers, their \nbravery, and the strength of their conviction. The people of Burma are \nan inspiration to people everywhere, and they are asking for our \nsupport. Without it they cannot succeed. If all nations stand united \nbehind them now, Burma's long nightmare can finally come to an end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12280-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL IMPROVEMENTS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. As the chairman knows, many rural hospitals are facing \nsignificant financial pressure and are finding it increasingly \ndifficult to operate under the Medicare prospective payment system. In \nresponse, the chairman and I have worked closely to support our rural \nfacilities and established the Critical Access Hospital Program in \n1997. This program was designed to help small, rural facilities remain \nfinancially viable in the face of inadequate Medicare reimbursement, \nand it has been tremendously beneficial to maintaining access to \nhospital care across North Dakota and other rural states.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I share my colleague's support for the Critical Access \nHospital Program. Like North Dakota, Montana struggles to maintain \nsufficient access to hospital care. The Critical Access Hospital \nProgram has been an important component in ensuring that our hospitals \ncan remain open and continue to serve Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Despite the successes that have been achieved under the \nCritical Access Hospital Program, changes made as part of the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003 have harmed the ability of certain critical \nhospitals, such as St. Joseph's Hospital in Dickinson, ND, to become \ncritical access hospitals. It is imperative that flexibility be \nreinstated in the program to allow States to deem hospitals as \nnecessary providers and, therefore, eligible for critical access \nhospital status. I have spoken with you about this issue in the past \nand am pleased that you are willing to consider this issue during \nconsideration of a Medicare package later in the year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I strongly support reinstating the ability of States to \ndeem necessary providers to be critical access hospitals. The Critical \nAccess Hospital Program has helped ensure that the doors stay open at \nmany hospitals in rural America. Without this program, many Medicare \nbeneficiaries in my State would have to drive hours to receive health \ncare. I think it is important to give States flexibility to deem \nnecessary providers as critical access hospitals and not rely on a one-\nsize-fits-all definition. If we don't address this issue, I am worried \nthat one of our hospitals in western North Dakota, St. Joseph's \nHospital, may not be able to survive.

Mr. President, this week marks the first-ever nationwide \nLearn and Serve Challenge, a series of events occurring across the \ncountry to raise awareness about the value of service learning and the \nrole of Learn and Serve America in supporting and promoting it.\n  Service learning is a way for schools, colleges, and communities to \ncombine community service and academic learning in ways that increase \nstudent learning, strengthen partnerships between schools and the \ncommunities they serve, and perhaps most importantly, tap into young \npeople's endless ideas and enthusiasm for solving problems.\n  We know that the real benefits of service learning go far beyond the \nevents of a week, or even a year. They last a lifetime, because \ncountless students who participate in service learning continue to \nserve throughout their lives.\n  As my brother Robert Kennedy said, each time persons stand up for an\n\n[[Page S12281]]\n\nideal, or act to improve the lot of others, or strike out against \ninjustice, they send forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each \nother from a million different centers of energy and daring, those \nripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of \noppression and resistance.\n  When young students create such ripples and see their effects, they \nremember them all their lives. They remember their own ability to help \nothers, and the joy and satisfaction it can bring. They develop a habit \nof service that follows them throughout their careers. And this is what \nmakes service learning so very important.\n  Through community service, all of us have the opportunity to make our \nown lives better by helping others. And through strong service \nlearning, schools are teaching generations of young people the joy of \nhelping others. We are also doing much more. We are making our \ndemocracy stronger. Our democracy depends on the active involvement of \ncitizens to shape our government and shape our communities.\n  There is no question that America needs students who are well-\neducated in every way. We are working to do better in this respect, but \nwe need to do much more. We need students who grow up understanding \nwhat it is to serve, to give back to their community, to help others. \nOur nation will always draw strength from a committed and engaged \ncitizenry. Service learning helps us build that better citizenry, one \nstudent at a time.\n  Seventeen years ago, I was the original sponsor of the National and \nCommunity Service Act of 1990. We reached across the aisle to recognize \nan important priority: to encourage and increase service in America. \nAmong the many accomplishments of that legislation was the creation of \nServe America, a new program to promote the practice of service \nlearning in American schools.\n  That program, now called Learn and Serve America, has exceeded the \nhigh expectations we had for it. Last year, 1.4 million students \nparticipated in service learning nationwide through Learn and Serve. \nSince the creation of the program, over 14 million students have served \ntheir communities because of it. It's an impressive accomplishment to \nhave touched so many lives. I congratulate all of those who have \nparticipated in Learn and Serve over the years, and especially those \nwho have guided the program so successfully.\n  The Learn and Serve Challenge events taking place across America this \nweek are an effective way to bring new and well-deserved attention to \nthe program and to the benefits of service learning, and I look forward \nto even more impressive successes of this unique program in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12281-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PROJECTS SPONSORSHIP--S. 1745\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true \npatriot and exceptional leader of our military, GEN. Peter Pace, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for his more than 40 years of \ndedicated service to the U.S. Armed Forces and to our country.\n  General Pace has devoted his life to service of his country. For him, \nduty, honor, and commitment have been more than words. They have been a \ncareer and a way of life. America is great because of the service and \nsacrifice of Americans like General Pace. We are deeply grateful for \nhis service.\n  General Pace has consistently put the military ideal of service to \ncountry before himself and has shown exceptional concern for the well-\nbeing of our men and women in uniform. Indeed, if there is one trait \nthat can be said to define the character of General Pace, it is that he \nhas been guided in all his decisions by an intense feeling of duty to \nthe soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who defend the freedoms we \nall enjoy.\n  This brave patriot is retiring October 1, marking the end of a long \nand distinguished military career.\n  GEN. Peter Pace began his service to America at the U.S. Naval \nAcademy. In 1968, after completing officer training at the Basic School \nin Quantico, Virginia, General Pace was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, \n5th Marines, of the 1st Marine Division in Vietnam.\n  In Vietnam, he served first as a rifle platoon leader and \nsubsequently became an assistant operations officer. He joined the \nplatoon during the battle for Hue City and was the unit's third platoon \nleader in as many weeks.\n  For his service and heroism, General Pace was decorated for valor \nduring his tour in Vietnam. Yet what mattered most to him were the \ntroops he led, some of whom, tragically, lost their lives for the \ncountry we love. General Pace holds as one of his most valued treasures \nthe photo of LCpl Guido Farinaro, the first marine he lost in combat. \nThe lance corporal's forever young likeness is under the glass on \nGeneral Pace's desk, each day reminding him of the impact of his \ndecisions as a military leader. General Pace has often been quoted as \nsaying that it is the duty of every soldier to live his or her life in \nan exemplary way and take on an extra measure of responsibility for \nthose fellow soldiers who have been killed and whose families now live \nwithout them. This dedication to the fallen, and to the survivors, is \ncharacteristic of General Pace.\n  Following Vietnam, General Pace was assigned to Marine Barracks, \nWashington, DC, where he served as security detachment commander at \nCamp David, a White House social aide, and platoon leader of Special \nCeremonial Platoon.\n  Over the next two decades, General Pace held command at virtually \nevery level and served our country throughout the world. While a \nbrigadier general, he served as deputy commander of Marine Forces, \nSomalia, from December of 1992 to February of 1993, and as deputy \ncommander of Joint Task Force--Somalia from October 1993 to March 1994.\n\n  On September 30, 2005, General Pace became the country's senior \nmilitary leader when he was sworn in as the 16th Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff on September 30, 2005. General Pace also made history--\nhe had the distinction of being the first marine to serve in this role \nand of being the first Italian American to do so.\n  I know from my personal conversations with him that General Pace took \nmodest pride from that last fact. And believe that General Pace--whose \nname means ``peace'' in Italian--knew full well that his was a fitting \nname for a soldier because the path to achieving peace, and to \npreserving it, is through the kind of strong and capable a military to \nwhich he devoted his career.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is always a challenging job but \nnever more so than at a time when the Nation is at war. He has been a \nrespected source of military counsel for our country's leaders. He has \nworked to help transform the military so that it will be able to \naddress the myriad of global challenges during this time of\n\n[[Page S12282]]\n\nwar. Now, he leaves his chairmanship knowing that our Armed Forces in \nIraq have been making new progress there, thanks to a new strategy put \nin place under his watch.\n  As has been his practice since he left Annapolis 40 years ago, \nGeneral Pace has always kept the best interests of our men and women in \nuniform in the forefront of discussions. General Pace is known for his \nthoughtful manner, his sense of humor, and above all his consummate \nintegrity. One Pace trademark we have all come to value is his constant \nreference to ``PFC Pace'' in all military-related discussion, his \nattempt to ensure that the President, the Secretary of Defense, the \nNational Security Council, the Homeland Defense Council, and the \nCongress consider the impact of their decisions on the most junior \nmembers of our military. General Pace's leadership has made a \nsignificant contribution to improving the security of the United States \nas we wage this war to protect our Nation and our liberty.\n  As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Pace has had a valued \npartner in helping to improve the quality of life for the family \nmembers who sustain our all-recruited force. His wife Lynne has \ndiligently worked with her husband to assist military families in quite \nliterally every clime and place. Throughout her husband's career, at \neach duty station, she focused on working to improve their quality of \nlife, both as a key volunteer, where she provided advice on family \nreadiness and financial assistance issues, and as a LINKS volunteer--\nLifestyles, Insights, Networking, Knowledge, and Skills--where she was \na mentor to other military spouses and helped them adapt to the unique \nchallenges of military life. In addition to serving on the boards of \nCARE, which works to eradicate world poverty through education, health, \nand economic programs, and the Armed Services YMCA, Lynne has worked \nwith the USO, Americans with Disabilities, and numerous other volunteer \ngroups. She also helped to develop a curriculum for spouses that became \nan integral part of the Commanders Course.\n  The Paces' proudest accomplishment undoubtedly is their two children, \nPeter, a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, and Tiffany Marie, \nwho is an accountant. This is truly a family that embodies the \ngreatness of our blessed land.\n  General Pace will indeed be remembered as a dedicated Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, a true patriot, a courageous warrior, a \ndistinguished general, and a dedicated leader with the highest \nintegrity and compassion for all who had the distinct honor of serving \nwith him.\n  When General Pace was appointed to become Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, President Bush remarked, ``To the American people, the Marine \nis shorthand for can-do, and I'm counting on Pete Pace to bring the \nMarine spirit to these new responsibilities.'' General Pace has always \nlived his life and served his country in the Marine spirit. A grateful \nnation extends her appreciation.\n  Semper Fi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12282-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       ALBUQUERQUE READS PROGRAM\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \nAlbuquerque Reads program and Pat Dee for the work he has done on this \nimmensely successful program.\n  Albuquerque Reads has helped thousands of students in the Albuquerque \narea gain proficiency in reading. Reading can expand a student's \nimagination and open their minds to new ideas. Reading is the gateway \nto attaining knowledge. This very basic skill can catapult students \ninto new levels of understanding and give them the tools they need to \nexcel. I have always been an avid reader, which has helped me become \nwhat I am today. I never stop learning, and I hope these students never \nstop either.\n  It was a pleasure to visit with Pat Dee when I was in New Mexico a \nfew weeks ago. The work he has done with this program has been noticed \nby many, including the President of the United States. Mr. Dee received \na Volunteer Service Award from the President for the many hours he has \ndedicated to helping students learn to read. He directs over 300 \nvolunteers who help facilitate the program and is looking to expand it \nwith an additional 200 volunteers. Albuquerque Reads places these \nvolunteers in underperforming schools to tutor kindergarteners. With \ntheir help, reading proficiency has increased 40 percent.\n  I want to say thank you to Albuquerque Reads and Pat Dee for all that \nyou have done for students in the area. I wish you much success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12282-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12282-S12283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF HIRO PAUL MIZUE\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on September 29, 2007, Mr. Hiro \nPaul Mizue, Chief of the Civil and Public Works Branch, Honolulu \nEngineer District, HED, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, will retire from \nU.S. Government service following 34 years of exemplary service to \nHawaii, the Pacific Region, the U.S. military, and our Nation.\n  Over the course of these 34 years, Mr. Mizue has served with \nintegrity and distinction. I have personally witnessed his conviction \nto duty and steadfast dedication to improving the lives of citizens and \nservicemembers.\n  Mr. Mizue has demonstrated the highest values and ideals over his \nyears of distinguished service, excelling at every assignment in his \ncareer, which covers every facet of civil and military planning and \ndesign management. He has exercised exceptional leadership and \nmanagement skills on behalf of the Army Corps of Engineers to achieve \nmuch lauded success.\n  His professional career in water resources began with the Los Angeles \nCounty Flood Control District in 1968 as a hydraulic engineer. Called \nto duty by the U.S. Army in 1969, he was assigned to HED as a civil \nengineer where he worked in the Civil Works Branch at Fort Armstrong. \nUpon discharge in 1971, he returned to the Los Angeles Flood Control \nDistrict. In 1974, he relocated to Hawaii, joining the Honolulu firm of \nBelt Collins and Associates as a civil engineer. He rejoined the \nHonolulu District in late 1975 as a hydraulic engineer, managing water \nresources feasibility studies.\n  In 1983, Mr. Mizue transferred to HED's military engineering division \nwhere he served as the Chief of the Family Housing/Hospital Division \nuntil 1995. During this period, he provided exceptional project \nmanagement support culminating with $271 million in construction of new \nfamily housing for our brave servicemembers on Hickam AFB, Wheeler AAF, \nSchofield Barracks, Aliamanu Military Reservation, and Fort Shafter. \nAlso of note are Mr. Mizue's efforts in managing $100 million in \ndesign-build contracts for a much needed expansion of the Tripler Army \nMedical.\n  Having demonstrated exemplary leadership and management skills, Mr. \nMizue was promoted to Chief of Planning Division in 1995; this office \nlater became Civil and Public Works Branch. In this capacity, Mr. Mizue \nprovided high-quality planning services to the State of Hawaii, Guam, \nCommonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and American Samoa. In addition, \nhe implemented comprehensive/holistic planning by having Corps planning \nstudies evaluate water resources problems broadly and at a watershed \nlevel. This approach formed the basis for Federal, State, and local \nagencies to implement integrated water resources development projects. \nMr. Mizue typified customer care by constantly striving to provide the \nhighest quality planning services and products in a responsive manner.\n  In 2006, Mr. Mizue led HED's response to assist the State and \ncounties with dam safety inspections after the Kaloko Dam failure and \nlater following a 6.7-magnitude earthquake. HED's responses to these \ndisasters demonstrated the exceptional working relationship with the \nState of Hawaii. Through his leadership, expertise, and experience, HED \nbecame recognized as the proven leader in project execution, \naccomplishment, and responsiveness.\n  During his 12 years as Chief of Civil and Public Works Branch for the \nHonolulu District, Mr. Mizue parlayed his extensive leadership skills \nto accomplish notable Branch achievements. A major civil works project \nbuilt during his tenure was the Alenaio Stream Flood Control project, \non the Big Island, completed in 1997 at a cost of $16\n\n[[Page S12283]]\n\nmillion. During the storm of November 2000, the improvement prevented \napproximately $13 million worth of damages and remains fully functional \ntoday.\n  More recently, Mr. Mizue successfully led the district through its \nbiggest civil works construction program in many years with highly \nvisible and vital projects, such as the $28 million Kaumalapau Harbor \nProject on the Island of Lanai, the $124 million Palau Compact Road \nProject in the Republic of Palau, and the $19 million Kikiaola Small \nBoat Harbor Project on the Island of Kauai. Under his tutelage, the \nHonolulu District has achieved the highest customer satisfaction rating \nfor its civil works program in its history. While these accomplishments \nattest to his commitment to client satisfaction, his nurturing, and \npragmatic management style earned him a reputation as a solid team \nplayer and a supportive, fair supervisor and mentor to his staff. Mr. \nMizue exemplifies not only an effective manager but, more importantly, \na dedicated and caring leader.\n  Mr. Mizue is a recognized representative of the Corps in the Pacific \nRegion. Under his management, the civil works and capital improvement \nprograms expanded in Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands, providing for the essential needs of these \ncommunities. Mr. Mizue's exemplary administrative and leadership skills \nhave always led the way. He has established lasting relationships with \nthe Hawaii congressional delegation, as well as the Governors of \nHawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern \nMarianas Islands. The assets that he brings to bear on behalf of the \nCorps of Engineers are considerable.\n  Born in Tokyo, Japan and raised in California, Mr. Mizue is a \nregistered professional engineer in California and Hawaii, a member of \nthe American Society of Civil Engineers, and a graduate of the CP-18 \nExecutive Development Program. He holds a bachelors of science degree \nin engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles and a \nmaster of science degree in Water Resource Engineering from Utah State \nUniversity. He received the Commander's Award for Civilian Service in \n1993 and 2002. Mr. Mizue is married to the former Ruby E. Ibaraki. They \nhave three children, Evan, Reid, and Cara.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Mizue's lifelong contributions to the Army are \nconsiderable. His recognized leadership and management skills, his \nability to forge lasting substantive relationships, and his clear \ndirection and vision point to a truly outstanding individual who has \ndedicated his life to service. The Honolulu Engineer District will \ncontinue to serve as ``America's Engineers in the Pacific.'' Paul \nMizues's legacy of unwavering dedication to duty to the U.S. Army will \ncarry on. Thank you, Mr. Mizue for a job well done. You have the \ngratitude of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12283-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN RECOGNITION OF PAUL WICE\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate \na radio legend in my home State of Nebraska. Paul Wice, who has been a \ntalk show host, news reporter, and news director at KGFW Radio in \nKearney, NE, for nearly 40 years, is retiring and will broadcast his \nfinal show on September 28, 2007.\n  Paul got his start in radio working part time, while earning a \nbachelor's degree in 1966 in speech and music from what was then known \nas Kearney State College. His first full-time radio job was at KWBE in \nBeatrice, NE, where he served as news director.\n  In 1967 Paul returned to Kearney as the afternoon announcer and news \ndirector at KGFW. Deciding to try something other than radio, he left \nthe station just a year later to join the Kearney Hub newspaper. He \nquickly found that his heart was in radio and returned to KGFW as its \nnews director in 1969. Paul has been there ever since and is now in his \n38th consecutive year of broadcasting on KGFW to the people of central \nNebraska.\n  While working full time, Paul went on to earn a master's degree in \nspeech communication in 1988 and has served as an adjunct instructor at \nthe University of Nebraska-Kearney since then. He is responsible for \nKGFW receiving the coveted Mark Twain Award from the Nebraska \nAssociated Press five times, including three consecutive years from \n1997 to 1999.\n  A past president of Nebraska Associated Press Broadcasters, Paul was \nalso the first recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the \nNebraska AP. He currently serves on the Freedom of Information \nCommittee of the Nebraska Broadcasters Association. He has covered it \nall for KGFW, including riding on the Robert F. Kennedy train in 1968, \njust months before the Presidential contender was assassinated. On the \nother end of the political spectrum, Paul attended a White House Radio-\nTelevision News Directors Association luncheon with then-President \nRonald Reagan. He also served as the Nebraska Broadcasters \nAssociation's official witness to the first execution in Nebraska in \ndecades.\n  Paul made his mark serving the people of Kearney and central \nNebraska, not only as a successful broadcaster but as a dependable \nsource of news year after year. It is highly unusual in this day and \nage for someone to be able to say they have worked for the same \nemployer for nearly four decades, especially in the highly competitive \nfield of broadcasting.\n  At every turn in my own political career, from my days as State \ninsurance director to my terms as Governor to my present role as a U.S. \nSenator, Paul has been there to cover the news, and I will miss \ninterviewing with him in the future.\n  Paul Wice has definitely been ``The Talk of the Town,'' as his radio \nprogram is called. His absence from the airways will leave a void that \nwill be tough to fill, but I am sure I join all Nebraskans in wishing \nhim well in retirement as he signs off the air for the very last \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12283-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12283-S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WEST VIRGINIA'S 2007 ANGEL IN ADOPTION\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

I would like to take a \nmoment to highlight his service to his community and congratulate him \non receiving the Congressional Adoption Caucus's Angel of Adoption \nAward.\n  As the CEO of Children's Home Society of West Virginia, Dennis Sutton \nhas dedicated his organization's program to securing loving homes for \nWest Virginia's children in need--a derivative from his belief that \nevery child is entitled to a loving family and home. Children's Home \nSociety of West Virginia's utmost priority of bringing children and \nfamilies together has been the result of more than 110 year experience, \nskilled and well-informed staff, certification by the National Council \non Accreditation, and readily available statewide service.\n  Dennis Sutton's commitment to our Nation's vulnerable children can be \nfurther seen in his participation as a founding member of Children's \nHome Society of America. A national organization, CHSA is comprised of \nthe leading child welfare agencies across the country and aims to \npromote the safety, nurturing, and well-being of vulnerable children. \nThis remarkable organization is working to make the adoption process \neasier for everyone involved but put children in the care of stable \nfamilies, give them the tools to succeed in today's world, and give \nthem hope.\n  To me, it is clear that this kind of work merits the Angel in \nAdoption Award. Because of Children's Home Society of America, more \nthan 250,000 children are now living in stable environments. That is an \nextraordinary accomplishment, one that will benefit our communities now \nand in the future. Dennis truly has been a passionate advocate for our \nchildren in need, has laid the groundwork for a better adoption \nprocess, and has put forth the bold vision to enrich and strengthen the \nfabric of this Nation.\n  I am delighted to have had this opportunity to highlight not only the \nwonderful cause but the person who is working on this in my State of \nWest Virginia. To Dennis and the Children's Home Society of America, I \noffer my most profound respects and deepest appreciation.\n\n[[Page S12284]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12283-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12283-S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WEST VIRGINIA'S 2007 ANGEL IN ADOPTION\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Children's Home \nSociety of West Virginia's utmost priority of bringing children and \nfamilies together has been the result of more than 110 year experience, \nskilled and well-informed staff, certification by the National Council \non Accreditation, and readily available statewide service.\n  Dennis Sutton's commitment to our Nation's vulnerable children can be \nfurther seen in his participation as a founding member of Children's \nHome Society of America. A national organization, CHSA is comprised of \nthe leading child welfare agencies across the country and aims to \npromote the safety, nurturing, and well-being of vulnerable children. \nThis remarkable organization is working to make the adoption process \neasier for everyone involved but put children in the care of stable \nfamilies, give them the tools to succeed in today's world, and give \nthem hope.\n  To me, it is clear that this kind of work merits the Angel in \nAdoption Award. Because of Children's Home Society of America, more \nthan 250,000 children are now living in stable environments. That is an \nextraordinary accomplishment, one that will benefit our communities now \nand in the future. Dennis truly has been a passionate advocate for our \nchildren in need, has laid the groundwork for a better adoption \nprocess, and has put forth the bold vision to enrich and strengthen the \nfabric of this Nation.\n  I am delighted to have had this opportunity to highlight not only the \nwonderful cause but the person who is working on this in my State of \nWest Virginia. To Dennis and the Children's Home Society of America, I \noffer my most profound respects and deepest appreciation.\n\n[[Page S12284]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12284-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12284-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12284-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRANSMITTING LEGISLATION AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE \n          UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT--PM 27\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit legislation and supporting documents to \nimplement the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (Agreement). \nThe Agreement represents a historic development in our relations with \nPeru, and it reflects the commitment of the United States to supporting \ndemocracy and economic growth in Peru. It will also help Peru battle \nillegal crop production by creating alternative economic opportunities.\n  In negotiating this Agreement, my Administration was guided by the \nobjectives set out in the Trade Act of 2002. The Agreement will create \nsignificant new opportunities for American workers, farmers, ranchers, \nbusinesses, and consumers by opening new markets and eliminating \nbarriers.\n  Under the Agreement, tariffs on approximately 80 percent of U.S. \nexports will be eliminated immediately. This will help to level the \nplaying field, since over 97 percent of our imports from Peru already \nenjoy duty-free access to our market under U.S. trade preference \nprograms. United States agricultural exports will enjoy substantial new \nimprovements in access. Almost 90 percent, by value, of current U.S. \nagricultural exports will be able to enter Peru duty-free immediately, \ncompared to less than 2 percent currently. By providing for the \neffective enforcement of labor and environmental laws, combined with \nstrong remedies for noncompliance, the Agreement will contribute to \nimproved worker rights and high levels of environmental protection in \nPeru.\n  The Agreement forms an integral part of my Administration's larger \nstrategy of opening markets around the world through negotiating and \nconcluding global, regional, and bilateral trade initiatives. The \nAgreement provides the opportunity to strengthen our economic and \npolitical ties with the Andean region, and underpins U.S. support for \ndemocracy and freedom while contributing to further hemispheric \nintegration.\n  Approval of this Agreement is in our national interest.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, September 27, 2007.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12284-4", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:38 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2693.

A bill to provide nationwide subpoena authority for actions \nbrought under the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund of 2001; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to the offer the Procedural \nFairness for September 11 Victims Act, a simple bill that ensures \nprocedural fairness for the parties to litigation arising out of the \nterrible events of September 11, 2001.\n  When we passed the September 11 Victims Compensation Fund of 2001, we \nestablished a Federal cause of action in the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of New York as the exclusive remedy for damages \narising out of the September 11 attacks. The Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure effectively limit service of a subpoena by a party to an \naction under the Victims Compensation Fund to within 100 miles of the \nSouthern District of New York. Litigating a Federal cause of action \nunder the Victims Compensation Fund is likely to involve the testimony \nand the production of documents by a substantial number of witnesses \nwho may not reside within 100 miles of the\n\n[[Page S12290]]\n\nSouthern District of New York. Neither the Victims Compensation fund \nstatute nor the Federal rules, however, currently provide an effective \nmeans for securing such testimony or documents.\n  The Procedural Fairness for September 11 Victims Act addresses this \noversight by allowing parties to Victims Compensation Fund actions to \nsubpoena witnesses and documents from anywhere in the U.S. The court \nretains its authority to quash or modify any such subpoena if it is \nunduly burdensome to the witness subpoenaed.\n  Justice requires that the parties to cases arising under the Victims \nCompensation Fund have access to all the testimony and documents \nrelevant to their claims, regardless of where in the U.S. the witnesses \nor documents are located. By granting the parties to such cases \nnationwide subpoena authority, administered by the Federal court, this \nact ensures that they do. As the bipartisan cosponsorship of the act \nattests, ensuring procedural fairness in these cases bearing on the \nterrible attacks of September 11 is not a Democratic issue or \nRepublican issue, it is an American issue. I strongly encourages my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me and the other \ncosponsors of this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Procedural Fairness for \n     September 11 Victims Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The September 11th Victims Compensation Fund of 2001 \n     (49 U.S.C. 40101 note) establishes a Federal cause of action \n     in the United States District Court for the Southern District \n     of New York as the exclusive remedy for damages arising out \n     of the hijacking and subsequent crash of American Airlines \n     flights 11 and 77, and United Airlines flights 93 and 175, on \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (2) Rules 45(b)(2) and 45(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the Federal Rules \n     of Civil Procedure effectively limit service of a subpoena to \n     any place within, or within 100 miles of, the district of the \n     court by which it is issued, unless a statute of the United \n     States expressly provides that the court, upon proper \n     application and cause shown, may authorize the service of a \n     subpoena at any other place.\n       (3) Litigating a Federal cause of action under the \n     September 11 Victims Compensation Fund of 2001 is likely to \n     involve the testimony and the production of other documents \n     and tangible things by a substantial number of witnesses, \n     many of whom may not reside, be employed, or regularly \n     transact business in, or within 100 miles of, the Southern \n     District of New York.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONWIDE SUBPOENAS.\n\n       Section 408(b) of the September 11 Victims Compensation \n     Fund of 2001 (49 U.S.C. 40101 note) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(4) Nationwide subpoenas.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A subpoena requiring the attendance of a \n     witness at trial or a hearing conducted under this section \n     may be served at any place in the United States.\n       ``(B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection is \n     intended to diminish the authority of a court to quash or \n     modify a subpoena for the reasons provided in clause (i), \n     (iii), or (iv) of subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of \n     rule 45(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2109. A bill to designate certain Federal lands in Riverside \nCounty, California, as wilderness, to designate certain river segments \nin Riverside County as a wild, scenic, or recreational river, to adjust \nthe boundary of the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National \nMonument, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the \nCalifornia Desert and Mountain Heritage Act. This bipartisan \nlegislation will protect nearly 200,000 acres of pristine and \necologically sensitive lands in Riverside County as Wilderness or \nPotential Wilderness, the highest level of protection and conservation \nfor Federal public lands in American law.\n  Over the past year, I worked with my colleague, Representative Mary \nBono, who represents the areas protected in this bill. Together, we \nworked to reach consensus with local officials, environmentalists, \nbusinesses, sportsmen, and Indian tribes. The result is this \nbipartisan, bicameral bill.\n  Riverside County contains some of California's, indeed, America's, \nmost spectacular desert and mountain vistas and landscapes. The \nbreathtaking lands protected in this bill also provide habitat for \nthreatened bighorn sheep and the desert tortoise, as well as many other \nspecies such as mule deer, mountain quail, and bald eagles.\n  Specifically, the bill protects 150,531 acres of lands as wilderness, \nhighest level of protection and conservation for Federal public lands \nin American law. Another 41,100 acres of land would be designated as \npotential wilderness. Once the final inholding claims are settled by \nthe National Park Service, these lands will become ``wilderness'' \nwithout the necessity of an additional act of Congress. In the \nmeantime, these lands will be managed by the Park Service as \n``wilderness.''\n  The bill also designates 31 miles of river as wild and scenic on four \nCalifornia Rivers: North Fork San Jacinto River, Fuller Mill Creek, \nPalm Canyon Creek, and Bautista Creek. These rivers are biologically \nimportant watersheds in this dry part of my State.\n  Many of these lands were included in my statewide wilderness bill, \nthe California Wild Heritage Act, which I reintroduced in February.\n  The bill has broad, local support including from Riverside County \nsupervisors, municipalities, chambers of commerce, environmentalists, \nsportsmen, and businesses. The bill includes important provisions \nclarifying that Federal agencies could use all the tools necessary to \nfight and prevent wildfires. The wilderness boundaries were drawn in \nconsultation with local communities and tribes.\n  I look forward to working with local interests and all of my \ncolleagues to see this important legislation enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2110. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 427 North Street in Taft, California, as the ``Larry \nS. Pierce Post Office''; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nhonoring a fallen hero, Army Staff Sergeant Larry S. Pierce.\n  This bill would rename a post office in Taft, California after Staff \nSergeant Pierce.\n  Staff Sergeant Pierce moved to Taft, California as a young child and \nattended Taft city schools and Taft Union High School, which my own \nfather graduated from in 1922.\n  Staff Sergeant Pierce would have graduated with the Taft Union High \nSchool class of 1959, but he chose to join the U.S. Army in 1958.\n  On September 20, 1965, Staff Sergeant Pierce was killed near Ben Cat \nin the Republic of Vietnam. He made the ultimate sacrifice to protect \nhis comrades, smothering the blast of an anti-personnel mine with his \nbody.\n  He was only 24 years old.\n  He left behind his wife, Verlin, and three children: Teresa, Kelley, \nand Gregory.\n  President Lyndon B. Johnson posthumously awarded Staff Sergeant \nPierce the Medal of Honor on February 24, 1966. The citation on his \nMedal of Honor reads as follows:\n\n       For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of \n     life above and beyond the call of duty. Sgt. Pierce was \n     serving as squad leader in a reconnaissance platoon when his \n     patrol was ambushed by hostile forces.\n       Through his inspiring leadership and personal courage, the \n     squad succeeded in eliminating an enemy machinegun and \n     routing the opposing force. While pursuing the fleeing enemy, \n     the squad came upon a dirt road and, as the main body of his \n     men entered the road, Sgt. Pierce discovered an antipersonnel \n     mine emplaced in the road bed.\n       Realizing that the mine could destroy the majority of his \n     squad, Sgt. Pierce saved the lives of his men at the \n     sacrifice of his life by throwing himself directly onto the \n     mine as it exploded. Through his indomitable courage, \n     complete disregard for his safety, and profound concern for \n     his fellow soldiers, he averted loss of life and injury to \n     the members of his squad.\n       Sgt. Pierce's extraordinary heroism, at the cost of his \n     life, are in the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and \n     reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of his \n     country.\n\n  Naming the Taft Post Office in Staff Sergeant Pierce's honor is a \nfitting commemoration and meaningful way for the community to remember \nthe\n\n[[Page S12291]]\n\ndedication and sacrifices of the members of our Armed Forces.\n  I would like to thank the members of the Taft City Council, who \npassed a resolution on September 4, 2007 to request that Congress \nrename the Taft Post Office the Larry S. Pierce Post Office.\n  I sincerely hope that my colleagues will support this resolution to \nhonor the service and sacrifice of Staff Sergeant Pierce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 2111. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to allow State educational agencies, local educational \nagencies, and schools to increase implementation of early intervention \nservices, particularly school-wide positive behavior supports; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide teachers an extra tool for the important work they do. This \nlegislation will expand an approach that is successfully improving \nstudent behavior and the climate for learning in thousands of schools \nacross the country: Positive Behavior Supports. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senators Durbin and Sanders in introducing the Positive \nBehavior for Effective Schools Act, and I urge other colleagues to join \nus.\n  Good school climate supports good teaching. Positive Behavior \nSupports are already being used in my home State of Illinois, where \nthere is a network to provide assistance for schools that adopt this \napproach. In these schools, students are taught about positive \nbehavior, teachers and administrators are supported in learning \nmotivational techniques, and adults set the same high standards for \nstudent conduct as they do for student achievement. Students are helped \nto see the importance of behaving in a way so that they and their \nclassmates can learn. The components necessary to do this on a school-\nwide basis include an agreement by the entire staff to define and \nsupport appropriate student behavior. Although this seems simple, it is \noften more effective than surveillance cameras, zero tolerance or other \nget-tough approaches to school discipline.\n  Positive Behavior Supports programs deal with discipline problems \nbased on one simple premise: stop problem behavior before it starts. \nThe specifics of the program are research-based, backed by both \nexperiment and experience. With Positive Behavior Supports, learning \ntime increases, and students do better. It makes sense that with fewer \ndisruptions, with less time in the principal's office, or out of \nschool, students can focus more, and so learn more.\n  Positive Behavior Supports are already established in many places. \nUniversities and resource centers work with over 6,700 schools in 38 \nStates. To help teachers teach our children, today I propose that we \nexpand this innovative program. The Positive Behavior for Effective \nSchools Act amends ESEA to allow Title I funds to be used for Positive \nBehavior Supports, and creates an office in the Department of Education \nto assist in these efforts. The act provides flexibility for schools \nand districts to use Title I funds, so that schools and teachers can \nchoose to receive assistance to improve school climate and thereby \nsupport teaching and opportunities for students to learn.\n  My good friend from Illinois, Congressman Phil Hare, has introduced \ncompanion legislation in the House, and I urge my colleagues to join \nour effort in the Senate. Let us give our teachers an additional tool \nto support their teaching. Let us give our children the benefit of high \nexpectations and supports for good behavior. Let us give our schools \nthe opportunity to adopt this approach. Let us help our kids by \nsupporting Positive Behavior Supports.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 2115. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nextend for 6 months the eligibility period for the ``Welcome to \nMedicare'' physical examination and to provide for the coverage and \nwaiver of cost-sharing for preventive services under the Medicare \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare \nPreventive Services Coverage Act of 2007. It has been ten years since \nCongress enacted the first comprehensive package of preventive services \nfor Medicare beneficiaries. At the time Medicare was created in 1965, \nit was modeled closely after the indemnity health insurance policies of \nthe time. As such, Medicare only covered the treatment of illnesses, \nand it paid for tests only when a symptom was present, but it did not \ncover preventive services. Over the next 3 decades, the medical \ncommunity learned a great deal about the importance of preventive care. \nAlthough as early as the 1970s, health maintenance organizations had \nbegun to cover cancer screenings and other wellness services, \ntraditional Medicare had not kept pace.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 changed that. Working across the \naisle, I introduced legislation that year to provide coverage for \nlifesaving screenings to Medicare beneficiaries. With strong bipartisan \nsupport, Congress added our language to BBA 1997, ensuring coverage for \npreventive services, including: an annual screening mammography for \nwomen over age 39; screening pap smear and pelvic examination for \ncervical cancer; prostate cancer screening; colorectal cancer \nscreening; bone mass measurement for osteoporosis; and diabetes testing \nsupplies and self-management training services.\n  Congress expanded this list of benefits in subsequent Medicare \nlegislation. Now traditional Medicare also covers cardiovascular \nscreenings to help prevent heart attacks and strokes; diabetes \nscreenings; flu shots to help prevent influenza, glaucoma screening, \nmedical nutrition therapy services, Hepatitis B vaccine, and ultrasound \nscreening for aortic aneurysm.\n  Medicare also now covers a one-time ``Welcome to Medicare Visit'' \nwithin the first 6 months of Part B enrollment. This is an initial \nphysical examination where beneficiaries can receive education and \ncounseling about their medical history and needs, have some preventive \nscreenings performed, and get referrals for other services.\n  Yes, over the past decade, Medicare has indeed made great strides \ntoward helping our seniors get screened for diseases. But we have far \nto go.\n  The participation rate for Medicare preventive benefits is low. One \nkey obstacle is financial. America's seniors still have the highest \nout-of-pocket costs of any age group. A 2007 Kaiser Family Foundation \nstudy compared out-of-pocket health care spending among age groups. For \nnonprescription drug expenses, it found that average spending for the \nover-65 population was nearly twice that for under-65 group. It also \nshowed that on average, seniors in one-person households are spending \n12.5 percent of their incomes on health care, versus 2.2 percent of \nthose under 65. This means that excluding prescription drug costs, \ndespite Medicare Part D, seniors will have very high medical bills that \nstretch their fixed incomes. It is no wonder that preventive services \nthat require cost-sharing will be delayed or not received at all.\n\n  Over the years, we have also improved the benefits. We have waived \nthe deductible for mammograms and colorectal cancer screenings. But \ncost sharing is still an obstacle for many seniors. They still must \nsatisfy the deductible before getting reimbursed for the physical exam \nand most other services, and they must pay coinsurance for all other \nservices except laboratory tests.\n  The bill that I am introducing today will waive the cost sharing for \nall preventive screenings and the Welcome to Medicare physical \nexamination. It will also grant the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices the authority to add additional benefits as he or she \ndetermines to be ``reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early \ndetection of an illness or disability.'' These determinations would \ntake into account evidence-based recommendations by the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force and other organizations. Finally, my bill would \nextend eligibility for the Welcome to Medicare Visit from its current \ntime frame of 6 months to 1 year.\n  This bill will mean the difference between early screening and \ndelayed diagnosis and treatment. It will mean the difference between \ndetecting a serious illness and providing hundreds of thousands of \ndollars of services later.\n\n[[Page S12292]]\n\n  Let me explain why. Preventive services such as mammography and \ncolonoscopy are important tools in the fight against serious disease. \nThe earlier they are detected, the greater the chances of survival. For \nexample, when caught in the first stages, the 5-year survival rate for \nbreast cancer is 98 percent. But if the cancer has spread, that rate \ndeclines to 26 percent. Similarly, if colorectal cancer is detected in \nits early states, the survival rate is 90 percent, but only 10 percent \nif found when it is most advanced.\n  Our seniors are at particular risk for cancer. The greatest single \nrisk factor for colorectal cancer is being over the age of 50, when \nmore than 90 percent of cases are diagnosed. In addition to increasing \nsurvival rates, identifying diseases early reduces Medicare costs. In \nthe case of colorectal cancer, Medicare will pay $207 for a screening \ncolonoscopy in a medical facility, but if the patient is not diagnosed \nuntil the disease has metastasized, the cost of care can exceed $60,000 \nover the patient's lifetime. Medicare pays $98 for a mammogram, but if \nbreast cancer is not detected early, treatment can cost tens of \nthousands of dollars more, depending on when the cancer is found and \nthe course of treatment used. One drug used to treat late stage breast \ncancer can cost as much as $40,000 a year. There can be no doubt that \nthese services are both life saving and cost saving. But if seniors \ncannot afford the copayments for these services, they may delay getting \nthem.\n  In addition to cancer, diabetes is another prevalent disease among \nseniors. The statistics associated with diabetes are staggering. Nearly \n20 million Americans are estimated to have diabetes. Approximately half \nknow they have diabetes and another half have diabetes but do not know \nit. But once diagnosed, the co-morbidities associated with diabetes can \nbe avoided. It is estimated that 90 percent of diabetes-related \nblindness is preventable, 50 percent of kidney disease requiring \ndialysis is preventable, 50 percent of diabetic-related amputations are \npreventable and 50 percent of diabetic-related hospitalizations are \npreventable.\n  Diabetes and its complications are not only disabling, but costly to \nMedicare as well. The cost of medical care of people with diabetes is \nabout $150 billion a year, according to data from the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. In its direct costs, diabetes was the most \ncostly of the 39 diseases reported. Despite the fact that 9 percent of \nthe Medicare population is diagnosed with diabetes, about 27 percent of \nthe Medicare budget is used to treat their diabetes.\n  Most of the cost for medical care of people with diabetes is for the \ntreatment of the complications, which are largely preventable with \nmodern treatment including blood sugar control. Clearly, prevention of \nthe complications of diabetes would reduce the costs of diabetes in \nlives and in dollars.\n  Numerous studies have found that once diabetes management training is \nprovided, populations see a nearly 50 percent reduction in emergency \nroom visits. In addition, the number of outpatient visits, doctor \noffice visits, and other medical expenses all decline. Diabetes can \nlead to amputations, blindness, heart disease, and stroke, all of which \ncan be prevented with training and management.\n\n  This bill also gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the \nauthority to add new preventive services based on the recommendations \nof the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. As we have seen, it can \ntake a very long time for Congress to change health policy in this \ncountry. In order to add new preventive services to Medicare, it now \nrequires legislative action. Under current law, as our researchers \ndiscover new, more efficient, and more accurate screening methods to \ndetect disease, Congress would have to pass new legislation authorizing \ncoverage for each one. This provision would enable Medicare to provide \ncoverage for new types of screenings based on up-to-date scientific \nevidence.\n  The Preventive Services Task Force has a long and distinguished \nrecord. It dates back to 1984, when the U.S. Public Health Service \nconvened a panel of primary and preventive health care specialists to \ndevelop guidelines for preventive services. From this panel, the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force's Guide to Clinical Preventive Services \nwas born. While many other respected professional and research \norganizations have issued their own recommendations, the Task Force's \npublication is regarded as the ``gold standard'' reference on \npreventive services. In December of 1995, a new Task Force released an \nupdated and expanded second edition of the Guide which includes \nfindings on 200 preventive interventions for more than 70 diseases and \nconditions. The Task Force employed a rigorous methodology to review \nthe evidence for and against hundreds of preventive services, assessing \nmore than 6,000 studies. The Task Force recommended specific screening \ntests, immunizations, or counseling interventions only when strong \nevidence demonstrated the effectiveness of preventive services. My bill \nwill give the Secretary the authority to use this gold standard to \nexpand Medicare's basic benefit package to include the tests that \nstudies have shown to be effective.\n  The newest benefit is the Welcome to Medicare Visit, an initial \nphysical examination for new beneficiaries. We know that large numbers \nof people in the 55 to 64 age group lack health insurance, so it is \nparticularly important for them to get a baseline examination and \nscreenings for diseases that affect elderly people But as of July 2006, \nonly 2 percent of all new beneficiaries, or about 8,000 people, have \nreceived this physical exam. Uptake has been slow for a number of \nreasons. You must get the exam within 6 months of enrolling in Medicare \nPart B. But many seniors don't learn about the benefit until they have \nbeen enrolled for a while, and even then it can take several months to \nschedule a physical examination with a doctor. So the vast majority of \nour seniors are missing out on this important benefit. My bill extends \neligibility from 6 months after enrolling in Part B to 1 year.\n  Finally, I want to address the matter of cost, and that is the \nappropriate thing to do under our budget scoring principles. The \nelimination of cost sharing for preventive services has been scored by \nthe Congressional Budget Office at $1.1 billion over 5 years. Based on \nCBO estimates from the 2003 Medicare law, extending the eligibility \nperiod for the Welcome to Medicare Visit from six months to one year \nwill cost approximately $1.2 billion over years. But I believe that the \nmembers of this body also understand that, although dynamic scoring is \nnot used by CBO, preventive health care will save money. If we detect \ndiseases earlier, the overall cost to our society will be less. Our \nseniors will save out of pocket costs and all taxpayers will save \nmoney.\n  This bill is supported by the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action \nNetwork, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal \nEmployees, the Center for Medicare Advocacy, the Colorectal Cancer \nCoalition, C3, and the Society of Vascular Surgeons. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort to get improve seniors' access to \nlifesaving preventive services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12292-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12292-S12293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 334--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n    DEGRADATION OF THE JORDAN RIVER AND THE DEAD SEA AND WELCOMING \n    COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PEOPLES OF ISRAEL, JORDAN, AND PALESTINE\n\n  Mr. LUGAR submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Res. 335\n\n       Whereas the incidence of prostate cancer in African \n     American men is 60 percent higher than any other racial or \n     ethnic group in the United States;\n       Whereas African American men have the highest mortality \n     rate of any ethnic and racial group in the United States, \n     dying at a rate that is 140 percent higher than other ethnic \n     and racial groups;\n       Whereas that rate of mortality represents the largest \n     disparity of mortality rates in any of the major cancers;\n       Whereas prostate cancer can be cured with early detection \n     and the proper treatment, regardless of the ethnic or racial \n     group of the cancer patient;\n       Whereas African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed \n     earlier in age and at a later stage of cancer progression \n     than for all other ethnic and racial groups, thereby leading \n     to lower cure rates and lower chances of survival; and\n       Whereas, according to a paper published in the Proceedings \n     of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from the \n     Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School have \n     discovered a variant of a small segment of the human genome \n     that accounts for the higher risk of prostate cancer in \n     African American men: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that prostate cancer has created a health \n     crisis for African American men; and\n       (2) urges Federal agencies to designate additional funds \n     for--\n       (A) research to address and attempt to end the health \n     crisis created by prostate cancer; and\n       (B) efforts relating to education, awareness, and early \n     detection at the grassroots levels to end that health crisis.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing a Senate \nresolution to raise awareness of the prostate cancer crisis that exists \namong African-American men. This resolution challenges Congress to \nprovide the funds necessary to increase research funding, prevent and \nfight the disease, and to encourage African-American men to get \nscreened.\n  For me, this is personal. I am a prostate cancer survivor, and my \nexperience opened my eyes to the horrific disparities in prevention, \ntreatment, and long-term prognosis for prostate cancer in the African-\nAmerican community. I learned a lot from my friend Tom Farrington. Tom \nand I are both lucky. We were diagnosed with prostate cancer--and we \ngot cured. Our fathers weren't so lucky. Prostate cancer took them away \nfrom us. But once I got well, and once T om got well, we started \nlearning more and more, and a statistic that stays with me and with \nTom, who is African American, speaks volumes. African-American men are \n80 percent more likely to die of prostate cancer than White men. \nProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death for \nAfrican-American men, who have the highest incidence and mortality rate \ndue to prostate cancer of any ethnic or racial group. African-American \nmen are dying at a rate of 140 percent--almost 2\\1/2\\ times--higher \nthan other groups. That is the largest disparity for any major cancer. \nI started digging more and discovered the unacceptable apartheid of \nhealth care in America-- and I believe that just as the doctrine of \n``separate but\n\n[[Page S12294]]\n\nequal'' was wrong in education, i t is wrong in health care. The \nquality of health care should never depend on the color of any \nAmerican's skin.\n  Epidemic levels of prostate cancer amongst African Americans have not \nchanged. We all need to work together to support those suffering from \nprostate cancer and to encourage regular screening and early detection. \nIt is a tragedy that so many Af rican-American men are dying today from \ntreatable illnesses they don't discover until it is too late--and \nrighting this wrong is a matter of social justice as well as public \npolicy.\n  I urge every Member of Congress to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/27/senate-section/article/S12294-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 336--RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE 20 YEARS OF SERVICE \n   AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF DR.

The inability \n     of the Navy to control requirements and costs on the two lead \n     ships of the Littoral Combat Ship program raises serious \n     concerns regarding the capacity of the Navy to affordably \n     build a 313-ship fleet.\n       (4) According to information provided to Congress by the \n     Navy, the cost growth in the Littoral Combat Ship program was \n     attributable to several factors, most notably that--\n       (A) the strategy adopted for the Littoral Combat Ship \n     program, a so-called ``concurrent design-build'' strategy, \n     was a high-risk strategy that did not account for that risk \n     in the cost and schedule for the lead ships in the program;\n       (B) inadequate emphasis was placed on ``bid realism'' in \n     the evaluation of contract proposals under the program;\n       (C) late incorporation of Naval Vessel Rules into the \n     program caused significant design delays and cost growth;\n       (D) the Earned Value Management System of the contractor \n     under the program did not adequately measure shipyard \n     performance, and the Navy program organizations did not \n     independently assess cost performance;\n       (E) the Littoral Combat Ship program organization was \n     understaffed and lacking in the experience and qualifications \n     required for a major defense acquisition program;\n       (F) the Littoral Combat Ship program organization was aware \n     of the increasing costs of the Littoral Combat Ship program, \n     but did not communicate those cost increases directly to the \n     Assistant Secretary of the Navy in a time manner; and\n       (G) the relationship between the Naval Sea Systems Command \n     and the program executive offices for the program was \n     dysfunctional.\n       (b) Requirement.--In order to halt further cost growth in \n     the Littoral Combat Ship program, costs and government \n     liability under future contracts under the Littoral Combat \n     Ship program shall be limited as follows:\n\n[[Page S12296]]\n\n       (1) Limitation of costs.--The total amount obligated or \n     expended for the procurement costs of the fifth and sixth \n     vessels in the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) class of vessels \n     shall not exceed $460,000,000 per vessel.\n       (2) Procurement costs.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     procurement costs shall include all costs for plans, basic \n     construction, change orders, electronics, ordnance, \n     contractor support, and other costs associated with \n     completion of production drawings, ship construction, test, \n     and delivery, including work performed post-delivery that is \n     required to meet original contract requirements.\n       (3) Contract type.--The Navy shall employ a fixed-price \n     type contract for construction of the fifth and following \n     ships of the Littoral Combat Ship class of vessels.\n       (4) Limitation of government liability.--The Navy shall not \n     enter into a contract, or modify a contract, for construction \n     of the fifth or sixth vessel of the Littoral Combat Ship \n     class of vessels if the limitation of the Government's cost \n     liability, when added to the sum of other budgeted \n     procurement costs, would exceed $460,000,000 per vessel.\n       (5) Adjustment of limitation amount.--The Secretary of the \n     Navy may adjust the amount set forth in paragraphs (1) and \n     (4) for either vessel referred to in such paragraph by the \n     following:\n       (A) The amounts of increases or decreases in costs \n     attributable to compliance with changes in Federal, State, or \n     local laws enacted after September 30, 2007.\n       (B) The amounts of outfitting costs and costs required to \n     complete post-delivery test and trials.\n       (c) Repeal of Superseded Authority.--Section 124 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 \n     (Public Law 109-163; 119 Stat. 3157) is repealed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3078.

traumatic brain injury) \n     resulting from service in a combat zone may exist in the \n     member which indicate that the separation of the member from \n     the Armed Forces on the basis of a personality disorder is \n     inappropriate pending diagnosis and treatment, and, if so, \n     whether initiation of medical board procedures for the member \n     is warranted.\n       (b) Secretary of Defense Report on Administrative \n     Separations Based on Personality Disorder.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than April 1, 2008, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall

order.\n       (D) A discussion of measures being implemented to ensure \n     that members of the Armed Forces who should be evaluated for \n     disability separation or retirement due to mental health \n     conditions are not prematurely or unjustly processed for \n     separation from the Armed Forces on the basis of a \n     personality disorder, and recommendations regarding how \n

Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Coburn, Mr. \nHagel, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Webb, and Mrs. McCaskill) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed to amendment SA 2011 proposed by Mr. \nNelson of Nebraska (for Mr. Levin) to the bill H.R. 1585, to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2008 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title XV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1535. SPECIAL INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR AFGHANISTAN \n                   RECONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A democratic, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan is \n     vital to the national security of the United States and to \n     combating international terrorism.\n       (2) Since the fall of the Taliban, the United States has \n     provided Afghanistan with over $20,000,000,000 in \n     reconstruction and security assistance. However, repeated and \n     documented incidents of waste, fraud, and abuse in the \n     utilization of these funds have undermined reconstruction \n     efforts.\n       (3) There is a stronger need for vigorous oversight of \n     spending by the United States on reconstruction programs and \n     projects in Afghanistan.\n       (4) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and \n     departmental Inspectors General provide valuable information \n     on such activities.\n       (5) The congressional oversight process requires more \n     timely reporting of reconstruction activities in Afghanistan \n     that encompasses the efforts of the Department of State, the \n     Department of Defense, and the United States Agency for \n     International Development and highlights specific acts of \n     waste, fraud, and abuse.\n       (6) One example of such successful reporting is provided by \n     the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \n     (SIGIR), which has met this objective in the case of Iraq.\n       (7) The establishment of a Special Inspector General for \n     Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) position using SIGIR as a \n     model will help achieve this objective in Afghanistan. This \n     position will help Congress and the American people to better \n     understand the challenges facing United States programs and \n     projects in that crucial country.\n       (8) It is a priority for Congress to establish a Special \n     Inspector General for Afghanistan position with similar \n     responsibilities and duties as the Special Inspector General \n     for Iraq Reconstruction. This new position will monitor \n     United States assistance to Afghanistan in the civilian and \n     security sectors, undertaking efforts similar to those of the \n     Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.\n       (b) Office of Inspector General.--There is hereby \n     established the Office of the Special Inspector General for \n     Afghanistan Reconstruction.\n       (c) Appointment of Inspector General; Removal.--\n       (1) Appointment.--The head of the Office of the Special \n     Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction is the \n     Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (in \n     this section referred to as the ``Inspector General''), who \n     shall be appointed by the President. The President may \n     appoint the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \n     to serve as the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \n     Reconstruction, in which case the Special Inspector General \n     for Iraq Reconstruction shall have all of the duties, \n     responsibilities, and authorities set forth under this \n     section with respect to such\n\n[[Page S12299]]\n\n     appointed position for the purpose of carrying out this \n     section.\n       (2) Qualifications.--The appointment of the Inspector \n     General shall be made solely on the basis of integrity and \n     demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial \n     analysis, law, management analysis, public administration, or \n     investigations.\n       (3) Deadline for appointment.--The nomination of an \n     individual as Inspector General shall be made not later than \n     30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (4) Removal.--The Inspector General shall be removable from \n     office in accordance with the provisions of section 3(b) of \n     the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE AIR FORCE LOGISTICS CENTERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Air Force Air Logistics Centers have served as a model \n     of efficiency and effectiveness in providing integrated \n     sustainment (depot maintenance, supply management, and \n     product support) for fielded weapon systems within the \n     Department of Defense. This success has been founded in the \n     integration of these dependent processes.\n       (2) Air Force Air Logistics Centers have embraced best \n     practices, technology changes, and process improvements, and \n     have successfully managed increased workload while at the \n     same time reducing personnel.\n       (3) Air Force Air Logistics Centers continue to \n     successfully sustain an aging aircraft fleet that is \n     performing more flying hours, with less aircraft, than at any \n     point in the last thirty years.\n       (4) The Global Logistics Support Center (GLSC) concept \n     represents an attempt to apply an enterprise approach to \n     supply chain management.\n       (5) The purpose of Global Logistics Support Center is to \n     eliminate redundancies and improve efficiencies across the \n     Air Force in order to best provide capable aircraft to the \n     warfighter.\n       (6) The Air Force is to be commended for attempting to \n     identify potential means to create further efficiencies in \n     the Air Force logistics network.\n       (7) While centralizing the execution and chain of command \n     for supply within the Air Force logistics network may add \n     value, the impact on integrated sustainment support may prove \n     detrimental and more complex and could negatively affect \n     delivery of deployment-capable aircraft to the warfighter.\n       (b) Reports Required.--\n\n[[Page S12303]]\n\n       (1) Periodic reports required.--In order to provide \n     Congress with appropriate insight into the impact on \n     integrated sustainment capabilities during the development of \n     the Global Logistics Support Center concept, the Secretary of \n     the Air Force shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees on a periodic basis (not less than every 120 days) \n     reports on the plans of the Air Force regarding the Global \n     Logistics Support Center.\n       (2) Elements.--Each report under paragraph (1) shall \n     include, current as of the date of such report with respect \n     to the development of the Global Logistics Support Center, \n     the following:\n       (A) Milestones, including criteria for achieving such \n     milestones.\n       (B) Planned or potential realignments of personnel through \n     either a change of reporting official or change in \n     geographical location.\n       (C) Proposed changes and potential impact to the integrated \n     aircraft sustainment process.\n       (D) Proposed changes to program management, product support \n     responsibilities, or both for fielded weapon systems.\n       (E) Proposed changes to the depot maintenance \n     responsibilities as such responsibilities relate to the \n     sustainment of weapon systems.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3093.

REDUCTION OF UNITED STATES FORCES IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Only a political solution amongst the Iraqi themselves \n     can end the violence and bring about lasting stability in \n     Iraq.\n       (2) The Iraqi political leaders have not met their own \n     benchmarks.\n       (3) The Iraq Study Group under the leadership of James \n     Baker and Lee Hamilton reported in December 2006 that ``the \n     United States should not make an open-ended commitment to \n     keep large numbers of American troops deployed in Iraq'' and \n     ``if the Iraqi government does not make substantial progress \n     toward the achievement of milestones on national \n     reconciliation, security, and governance, the United States \n     should reduce its political, military, or economic support \n     for the Iraqi government''.\n       (4) The Iraq Study Group also reported that ``[b]y the \n     first quarter of 2008, subject to unexpected developments in \n     the security situation on the ground, all [U.S.] combat \n     brigades not necessary for force protection could be out of \n     Iraq. At that time, U.S. combat forces in Iraq could be \n     deployed only in units embedded with Iraqi forces, in rapid-\n     reaction and special operations teams, and in training, \n     equipping, advising, force protection, and search and \n     rescue''.\n       (5) The Iraq Study Group also stated that the redeployment \n     of troops from Iraq should be ``subject to unexpected \n     developments in the security situation on the ground''.\n       (6) The Independent Commission on the Security Forces of \n     Iraq under the leadership of retired Marine General Jim Jones \n     recently reported that a number of Iraqi Army battalions that \n     are capable of taking the lead in combating violence and \n     sectarian conflict are not in the lead and recommended \n     further that the size of ``our national footprint in Iraq be \n     reconsidered with regard to its efficiency, necessity, and \n     its cost'' and that ``[s]ignificant reductions, \n     consolidations, and realignments would appear to be possible \n     and prudent''.\n       (7) The President stated in his speech to the nation on \n     September 13, 2007, that ``[o]ver time our troops will shift \n     from leading operations, to partnering with Iraqi forces--and \n     eventually to overwatching those forces. As this transition \n     in our mission takes place, our troops will focus on a more \n     limited set of tasks, including counterterrorism operations \n     and training, equipping and supporting Iraqi forces''.\n       (8) General David Petraeus has stated that progress is \n     being achieved at different rates in different provinces of \n     Iraq and that further progress is likely to continue to vary \n     from province to province.\n       (9) The precipitous withdrawal of all United States forces \n     from Iraq is not desirable and could have dangerous \n     consequences for the national security of the United States \n     and our allies.\n       (10) The United States must remain engaged in Iraq and the \n     Middle East region for the foreseeable future to protect our \n     national security interests.\n       (11) There are limits on the forces the United States has \n     available for deployment, and those limits necessitate a \n     reduction in United States forces in Iraq and a transition of \n     those forces to a focused set of missions.\n       (12) The Iraq Study Group recommended that ``[t]he United \n     States should not make an open-ended commitment to keep large \n     numbers of American troops in Iraq''.\n       (13) General Petraeus has stated that a reduction in the \n     number of United States forces in Iraq to approximately the \n     pre-surge level will be imminent as a result of security \n     gains in Iraq and the limits on United States forces \n     available for deployment.\n       (b) In General.--The Secretary of Defense shall commence a \n     reduction in the number of United States forces in Iraq not \n     later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (c) Implementation of Reduction Along With a Comprehensive \n     Strategy.--\n       (1) In general.--The reduction in the number of United \n     States forces required by this section shall be implemented \n     along with a comprehensive diplomatic, political, and \n     economic strategy that will include increased engagement with \n     Iraq's neighbors and the international community for the \n     purpose of working collectively to bring stability to Iraq.\n       (2) Larger international role in political strategy.--In \n     carrying out the strategy described in paragraph (1), the \n     President shall instruct the United States Permanent \n     Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, \n     and influence of the United States at the United Nations to \n     seek the appointment of a senior representative of the \n     Secretary General of the United Nations to Iraq, under the \n     auspices of the United Nations Security Council, who has the \n     authority of the international community to engage political, \n     religious, ethnic, and tribal leaders in Iraq in an inclusive \n     political process and to promote the engagement of Iraq's \n     neighbors.\n       (3) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     in carrying out the strategy described in paragraph (1), the \n     President should--\n       (A) work with the United Nations to continue the efforts \n     initiated at Sharm El Sheikh in May 2007 and implement fully \n     the terms of the International Compact with respect to Iraq; \n     and\n       (B) support the decision of the United Nations Security \n     Council on August 10, 2007, to strengthen the mandate of the \n     United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq in areas such as \n     national reconciliation, regional dialogue, humanitarian \n     assistance, and human rights.\n       (d) Limited Presence of United States Forces After \n     Reduction and Transition.--After the completion of the \n     reduction of United States forces that commences pursuant to \n     subsection (b), the Secretary of Defense may deploy or \n     maintain United States forces in Iraq only for the following \n     missions:\n       (1) Protecting United States and coalition personnel and \n     infrastructure, including by targeted border security \n     operations.\n       (2) Training, equipping, and providing logistic support to \n     the Iraqi Security Forces, including Iraqi security forces \n     operating against extremist militia groups, such as Jaish al \n     Mahdi, that conduct attacks against\n\n[[Page S12305]]\n\n     United States forces and Iraqi security forces.\n       (3) Engaging in targeted counterterrorism operations \n     against al Qaeda, al Qaeda affiliated groups, and other \n     international terrorist organizations, including providing \n     support to Sunni operations that oppose such groups and \n     organizations.\n       (4) Providing personnel and support to Provisional \n     Reconstruction Teams, until civilian personnel can be \n     recruited to fill positions on such teams.\n       (5) Sharing information and intelligence as necessary with \n     Iraqi Security Forces to achieve the missions described in \n     paragraphs (1) through (4).\n       (e) Completion of Transition.--The goal for the completion \n     of the transition of United States forces in Iraq to a \n     limited presence and missions as described in subsection (d) \n     shall be a date not later than 15 months after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n       (f) Report on Reduction and Transition.--Not later than 90 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act and every 90 \n     days thereafter, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to \n     Congress a report setting forth the following:\n       (1) The plan for carrying out the reduction and transition \n     of United States forces in Iraq to a limited presence whose \n     missions do not exceed the missions specified in subsection \n     (d), including the associated force reductions, adjustments, \n     and expectations with respect to timelines.\n       (2) A comprehensive description of efforts to prepare for \n     the reduction and transition of United States forces in Iraq \n     in accordance with this section and to limit any \n     destabilizing consequences of such reduction and transition, \n     including a description of efforts to work with the United \n     Nations and countries in the region toward that objective.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3097.
