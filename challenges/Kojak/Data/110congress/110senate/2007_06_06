Mr. President, in reading this morning's paper, I was \nreminded of the times I would read Dr. Seuss to my boys and my girl. In \ntoday's New York Times, Tom Friedman quotes Dr. Seuss as follows:\n\n     Then he shut the Things\n     in the box with the hook.\n     And the cat went away\n     with a sad kind of look.\n     ``That is good,'' said the fish.\n     ``He has gone away. Yes.\n     but your mother will come.\n     She will find this big mess!\n     And this mess is so big\n     And so deep and so tall,\n     we can not pick it up.\n     There is no way at all!''\n\n  Mr. President, some would say that is what we have in the Senate \ntoday--a big mess. But if you go back and read Dr. Seuss, the cat \nmanages to clean up the mess. And as big of a mess as we have with \nimmigration in the United States, we have the opportunity to clean up a \nbig mess. If we work on a bipartisan basis in the next couple of days, \nwe can clean up this mess. If we cannot, then we are back with the cat \nwho didn't clean up the mess and the Senate didn't clean up its mess \nwith immigration.\n  We have known for 3 months the time set for doing immigration. People \nworked in good faith trying to come up with legislation, and they were \na week short. They said: We need more time. So they got more time. They \ncame up with a bipartisan bill. Ten Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, came up with an immigration bill. Is it a perfect bill? Of \ncourse, not. Is it a good bill? It is not bad at all. It does some \nthings that I think are extremely important, something I have talked \nabout for a long time based on my experience in Smith Valley, NV, with \na girl who couldn't go to college. She was Hispanic. Her parents were \nhere illegally, and this young girl couldn't go to college even though \nshe was the best student in her class. So we have in this bill the \nDREAM Act. It is a dream for many young Americans.\n  AgJOBS. We have been talking about an AgJOBS bill for years. This \nbill has one in it.\n  Border security. We have talked about the need for border security. \nThis bill provides border security.\n  Employer enforcement, employer sanctions. This legislation has good \nemployer sanction language. Good enough? Well, we will have to see. \nSome want to improve it. Maybe that is the way to do things.\n  Pathway to legalization. For millions of people here illegally with \nimproper papers, a path to legalization is a way to bring them out of \nthe shadows. That is in this legislation.\n  This year's legislation builds on the bill passed by the Senate last \nyear after extensive committee considerations and many floor \namendments. This year, there were lengthy bipartisan negotiations \ninvolving about 10 Senators and a number of Cabinet officers, in \naddition to other people from the White House. The negotiators asked \nfor additional time. We talked about that. It was agreed upon.\n\n  We started the floor debate the week before Memorial Day recess. \nDuring that week, we disposed of more than a dozen amendments and \nallowed an additional 14 amendments to become pending to the bill. \nProponents of the\n\n[[Page S7098]]\n\nbill asked for an additional week of floor debate. I agreed. The \nminority leader said this time this is a 2-week bill. I agreed with him \nand scheduled a second week of debate, and that is where we are now.\n  This week, we have conducted four rollcall votes, adopted four other \namendments by voice vote, and we probably would have done more but for \nthe unfortunate death of our colleague and friend, Senator Thomas. \nYesterday morning, in memory of our friend, we decided not to work \nhere, and that was the right thing to do. This morning, we have two \nmore votes that are scheduled already on the Cornyn and Kennedy \namendments regarding eligibility for the legalization program. We have \nproposed a unanimous consent agreement. We did that yesterday, and I \nunderstand the managers have that fairly well worked out on the 12 \npending amendments to have votes on those later today. That was not \naccepted last evening, but I am hopeful that agreement can be worked \nout soon.\n  So it is clear we are working in good faith to process amendments and \nmove forward on this bill. My decision about cloture last night was \nsimply a way to ensure that we finish this bill in a timely manner. By \noffering to postpone the cloture vote, as I did yesterday, until \ntomorrow night, I am offering an additional full day of amendments \nbefore the cloture vote and, of course, germane amendments are \nconsidered postcloture.\n  I had a meeting in my office just a few minutes ago with a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators. I believe there is a good-faith effort being made by \na majority of Senators, Democrats and Republicans, to move this bill \nforward. That is what we are going to try to do.\n  There are some people, rightly or wrongly--and that is all in the \neyes of the beholder--who feel they have not had an opportunity to deal \nwith this legislation. If that is the case, let's see if we can come up \nwith some amendments that will make them happy. We do a lot of business \nin this body by unanimous consent--in fact, most everything. The \ncloture vote is scheduled for tomorrow morning, an hour after we come \ninto session. We can change that. It is my hope that we can finish the \nbill this week. I am very confident we can.\n  I personally feel an obligation to go to the funeral in Wyoming. \nCraig Thomas was a Republican with whom I worked very closely on a \nnumber of issues, and I had great appreciation and admiration for him. \nOut of respect for him and Susan, I feel that I need to go to that \nfuneral, and I am sure many others feel the same way. So that is going \nto change our schedule. It is my understanding that funeral is going to \nbe Saturday. I have notified my caucus, and I have explained to the \ndistinguished Republican leader that we may have to work longer hours \nthis week. But let's try to finish this bill.\n  There are some, and it is a small number of people, who don't want \nthis bill finished under any circumstances. That happens on a lot of \nbills, and we have to try to work our way through that.\n  I hope people understand that I would like to get a bill passed. We \nhave responsibilities as Senators to not only deal with immigration, \nwhich is a system, as I have tried to explain with a little vignette \nfrom Dr. Seuss, that is badly in need of fixing, but we have a lot of \nother problems in this country that are badly in need of fixing. So we \nmay have to work hours the Senate hasn't seen very often. We may have \nto work into the night, tonight and tomorrow night and maybe even \nFriday and Friday night, and who knows if that will be enough time to \nget us over the hump.\n  I hope people will understand that it is not a question of how much \ntime we spend on the bill, it is a question of whether people feel they \nhave had the opportunity to change the provisions that are in the bill. \nI have gone over most of them: AgJOBS, DREAM Act, employer enforcement, \nlegalization, border security.\n  I hope we can get this bill done. We can debate this bill all year \nand end up right back where we are. The American people did not send us \nhere to pontificate; they sent us here to legislate. That is what I am \ntrying to do and most are trying to do.\n  Recognizing that this immigration system is broken and that we need \nto fix it, I extend my appreciation to Senators--Democrats and \nRepublicans--who believe this is the time for us to do something \nimportant for the country.\n  I have said on a number of occasions that this bill, when it comes \nout of this body, is not the last word. We have other ways of working \non this bill. We, as Senators, are going to be fully involved in the \nlegislation until it comes out of conference, which is after the House \npasses a bill which will have the imprint of the White House on it.\n  So I hope we can move forward in good faith and understand that \neverything we do in life has deadlines, even our legislation in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank our leader, someone who has been \ninterested, along with many others, in the immigration issue, for the \nleadership he has provided in making sure the Senate was going to take \nup this issue. He had announced in January of this year that he was \ngoing to take a time for the Judiciary Committee to consider this \nlegislation but that he was going to allocate 2 weeks of time, which \nwas basically the time we took on the last bill, but it was a major \nperiod of time to consider the people's business regarding this issue. \nHe has been accommodating in terms of working through the Senate's \nschedule. For all of us who are interested in getting a bill, we thank \nhim for all he has done in terms of encouraging us to reach judgments \non these various measures.\n  As he has mentioned, we have made very important and significant \nprogress, and I think there is a strong mood in the Senate, as there is \nin the country, that this is an extremely important issue. We are \nincreasingly close to trying to at least make a recommendation to the \ncountry about what the Senate's judgment will be on this issue.\n  I join with him, as others, to say we are eager to move ahead during \nthe day today and tomorrow and to work with the leadership. I know they \nhave full schedules. I do think we are making significant progress and \nit is being done in a bipartisan spirit with a desire that those who \nhave differing views about this issue can come together and do the \nNation's business. When we achieve that, hopefully by the end of this \nweek, both the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Kentucky will \nbe very much appreciated for their support in helping this legislation \nmove ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7098-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as I think my good friend, the majority \nleader, already knows, we are ready to work with the other side to \nschedule votes on pending amendments. I think the two managers are \nworking together this morning to set up a schedule of votes for this \nafternoon. All of that is a step in the right direction.\n\n  Many of the amendments we hope to schedule, however, for the \nafternoon are amendments that were offered prior to the recess. My \nconcern with cloture being filed last night is that we do not want to \ndeny Members who have yet to offer--and many of them have been denied \nthe right to offer their amendments this week--and those who have been \ndenied the right to offer their amendments should still get their \nopportunity prior to being shut out.\n  Now, I am counting progress on this bill not by calendar days--that \nis one way of looking at it--but by the ability of Senators to debate \nand to vote on their respective ideas is the way that I would consider \nprogress on the bill. So I hope we can clear out the amendments that \nare currently pending and that we will also work together to schedule \ndebate and votes on additional amendments that are going to be offered.\n  Let me remind everyone again, on the day my conference elected me \nleader I said that I thought we ought to do two big important things, \nat least, in this Congress. And one of the issues I mentioned was \nimmigration. So I am among those in the Senate who would\n\n[[Page S7099]]\n\nlike to see us accomplish something on a very difficult, some days \nseemingly intractable, issue. Nevertheless, I am in favor of trying to \npass an immigration bill. But there is going to be widespread \nreluctance on this side of the aisle to support cloture and thereby \nbring the bill to a conclusion unless amendments, a significant number, \nare being allowed to be considered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7099-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Sergeant James W. Harlan\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, while I am in my leader time, I rise \ntoday to honor the heroic sacrifice of a fellow Kentuckian, a brave \nsoldier who served multiple tours in Iraq. He was also a proud father \nand grandfather who sought to protect the people and the land he loved.\n  SGT James W. Harlan was tragically killed on May 14, 2004, when a \nsuicide bomber detonated a car bomb next to his humvee at Camp Anaconda \nnear Balad, Iraq. Sergeant Harlan was a native of Owensboro, KY, and a \nmember of the 660th Transportation Company's 88th Regional Readiness \nCommand in the U.S. Army Reserve. He was 44 years old.\n  For his heroic service, Sergeant Harlan was awarded the Silver Star \nand the Purple Heart, among many other awards and medals of \ndistinction.\n  I mentioned that Sergeant Harlan was brave; let me elaborate on that. \nWhen he was 11 years old, his older sister Doris was assigned the \ndaunting task of babysitting young Jimmy. ``Jimmy was mischievous. He \nwas always into something,'' she recalls. Sensing a window of \nopportunity to display his courage, Jimmy declared that he would jump \noff the roof of their family's house while his parents were away. At \nfirst Doris protested, but realizing that his intentions were probably \nonly to rankle her, she told Jimmy: ``Fine, you go ahead and do it.'' \nShe even went so far as to set out pillows for him to land on. Sure \nenough, brave young Jimmy jumped off that roof, and to this day Doris \nis surprised that he escaped without major injury.\n  Jimmy's love of adventure carried over into his adulthood. He enjoyed \nthe outdoors and would often take his kids fishing and hunting. A \ncompassionate and loving father to his five children, Jimmy always made \nsure to spend quality time with his family. ``When everyone else was \nsitting around with their bellies full on Thanksgiving, he would be \noutside throwing the football,'' his brother Kenny Likens recalls.\n  One of his favorite things to do was to coach baseball with his \nbrothers. When he spent time indoors, he enjoyed watching old Western \nmovies with his kids.\n  His sons, James Bryan Harlan, David Shane Harlan and Jacob Alexander \nRoberts, and his daughters, Tara Strelskey and Amanda Prout, as well as \nhis two stepchildren, Bobby and Brittany Gray, will miss his caring and \ngenerous spirit.\n  Jimmy will also be missed by two girls who might not yet realize the \nextraordinary sacrifice their grandfather made, but who will learn it \nas they grow older. He was especially proud of them. Jimmy often said \nof his granddaughters, Jaidyn Main and Abigail Prout, ``Aren't they \njust the prettiest things you have ever seen?''\n  Jimmy's civilian career was partly spent as a truck driver. He \nenjoyed the opportunity to work on the big rigs and to see different \nparts of the country. He would often drive with his brother Kenny \nLikens. Through all that driving across the country, though, the two \nnever did find a place they liked as much as their hometown of \nOwensboro, KY, where Jimmy was born and raised. When Jimmy left for his \nfinal tour in Iraq, he was working for the streets department in \nOwensboro.\n  Having served for two decades in the military and Reserves, Jimmy was \na seasoned soldier. His patriotism and sense of civic duty compelled \nhim to reenlist after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and \nhe served two tours in Iraq.\n  While there, Jimmy supervised truck drivers who transported supplies \nto the troops at Camp Anaconda. His son James Bryan Harlan offered some \nperspective when he remarked:\n\n       Nobody wants to see their father die . . . but to have it \n     be while doing something of this significance, we're proud of \n     him.\n       I would like to take this opportunity to say that not only \n     is his family proud of him, but all of America is proud of \n     Jimmy's heroism and sacrifice.\n\n  SGT James W. Harlan drove a rig across the highways of the United \nStates, and he traversed the desert sands of Iraq. He had an \nadventurous spirit, and his far travels and his exemplary service were \na natural fit for that little boy who once jumped off his parents' \nroof.\n  Jimmy Harlan left an inspirational example for his children and \ngrandchildren, his brothers, Kenny Likens and DeWayne Likens; his \nsister, Doris Taylor; his step-brothers, Randall Wingfield, Steve \nWingfield, and the late Michael Calloway; his fiancee, Carol Gray; his \nmother, Doris Marie Gray; and his late father, William Arthur Harlan.\n  I ask the Senate to keep the family of SGT James W. Harlan in their \nthoughts and prayers.

Mr. President, I am requesting just 30 seconds to make a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that we call up three amendments, Nos. 1187, \n1188, and 1201, and then we be returned back to the pending amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just for the benefit of the Members, we \nhave tried to establish a way of moving along today. We are going to \nconsider the Cornyn amendment, and then there is an amendment that I \nwill place at the desk. We will have a 2-hour time allocation equally \ndivided, though I am not sure we will take all the time, and then we \nwill have an opportunity to vote on that measure.\n  We are trying to set up a series of votes through the morning, \nthrough the afternoon, and through the evening. What we are going to \ntry to do is to give Members as much time as possible on these items, \nrotating back and forth through the course of the day, and we will work \nwith our colleagues to try to accommodate their schedules. We have a \nrigorous program, and we will announce that.\n  We have talked with the floor managers, Senator Specter, Senator Kyl, \nand others, on these measures, and we will proceed in that way. So \nMembers need to understand that we will have a busy and full day, and \nwe will start off with the amendment of the Senator from Texas, No. \n1184, as I understand.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1184\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this amendment we will vote on this morning is an \nimportant amendment. It was first filed 2 full weeks ago, and it has \ntaken this long to be able to get a vote on this amendment, for which I \nam grateful, but I must say that, as the Republican leader indicated \nthis morning, the rate of progress with getting amendments debated and \nvoted on is not promising. And the fact that the majority leader has \nnow filed cloture, potentially cutting off the opportunity for full and \nfair debate and an adequate number of votes on this bill, again, is not \nencouraging at all.\n  I am one of those who would like to see a solution to this problem, \nbut I think it is important that we reflect on what kind of solution we \nwill accomplish if we are successful. To me, the goal is simply to \nrestore law and order to our immigration system. It is important to our \nnational security because we have to know who is coming into our \ncountry and why people are here in a post-9/11 world. It is important \nto public safety because we know the same broken borders that can allow \npeople who are economic migrants to come across can also allow common \ncriminals, drug traffickers, and even terrorists. And it is important \nto our prosperity in this Nation that we reestablish our heritage as a \nnation that believes in the rule of law. We simply cannot have people \nchoosing to obey some laws and disobeying others. That is not adherence \nto the rule of law. That is picking and choosing, cherry-picking what \nlaws you find convenient and what laws you find inconvenient.\n\n  To my mind, and based upon my experience with my constituents across \nthe State of Texas last week, this is the cause for so much distrust of \nthe Federal Government when it comes to this issue. The basic objection \nto this underlying bill is not that people don't believe there is a \nserious problem, it is not that people are racist or anti-immigrant or \nnativists or know-nothings or any of the other names that sometimes \npeople are called. It is that the American people believe we have been \nhere before.\n  In 1986, they gave their trust to the Federal Government to actually \nfix this problem by granting a one-time amnesty and then providing for \nan enforcement system that would actually be enforced against employers \nwho hire people who cannot legally work here. They were sold a bill of \ngoods. It didn't work. We got an amnesty, and we got no enforcement. \nThat is why people are so distrustful.\n  So if we are serious about restoring the rule of law, I believe the \nfirst place to start would be by passing this amendment, amendment No. \n1184, on the floor of the Senate.\n  What does this amendment do?\n  Well, first of all, this amendment would mandate that gang members \ncannot obtain legal status. It is well documented that members of MS-13 \nand other gangs, ultra-violet gangs emanating from Central America, \nhave come across our broken borders and committed terrible crimes of \nviolence in the United States. In the underlying bill, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security could actually grant a waiver that would allow a gang \nmember legal status.\n  That just cannot be. Congress should draw a line about whom we are \nwilling to allow in and whom we are not, and we shouldn't delegate this \nto the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security or the Attorney \nGeneral or anyone who might hold those positions in the future.\n  The next thing my amendment would do is it would address the \ndefinition of ``good moral character.'' We would allow only people with \ngood moral character, as defined in the bill, to obtain legal status. \nThe underlying bill does not contain a prohibition on those who are \naffiliated with terrorist organizations. My amendment makes the \ncommonsense change that would bar them. The amendment also requires \nthat those who apply for legalization under the bill must generally \nshow they have good moral character.\n  Third, my amendment makes the failure of sex offenders to register in \nhigh-speed flight crimes grounds of ineligibility for Z visas.\n  Fourth, my amendment makes repeat DWIs, driving while intoxicated or \ndriving under the influence, an aggravated felony. It is a simple fact \nof life that repeat DWI offenders are a substantial threat to a \ncommunity's safety.\n  They have a proven history of involvement in various serious \ncollisions that kill, maim, and otherwise seriously injure innocent \npeople.\n  When I was in Texas this last week, I met with representatives of \nMothers Against Drunk Driving and told them about the gaps in this \nunderlying bill and received the assurance, at least of that \nrepresentative, that this was an issue she cared passionately about. I \nsuggest all of us who care passionately about public safety and \ndecreasing the incidence of drunk driving and driving under the \ninfluence, that are a threat to public safety, that those who care \nabout decreasing that threat should vote for this amendment. \nDesignating a third DUI offense as an aggravated felony recognizes the \nacute danger that repeat DUI offenders present to the American people \nand the strong need to remove from the United States those who \nrepeatedly commit DUI offenses.\n  The fifth category is the one on which I believe there is the biggest \ndisagreement. This has to do with so-called absconders and identity \nthieves. This gets to the essence of this bill and whether we are \nserious about restoring the rule of law to our immigration system and \nwhether we are going to send a message, loudly and clearly, that while \nwe might be willing to consider those who have entered our country \nwithout a visa, who are by definition guilty of a misdemeanor, or those \nwho have come in legally and who have overstayed, who are guilty of a \nstatus violation under our immigration laws--while we might be willing \nto consider them for a path to legalization and citizenship under some \nconditions, we should not allow a path to legalization and citizenship \nfor those who have openly defied our courts, the lawful orders of our \ncourts, and who have shown themselves as having no regard for the rule \nof law.\n  What kind of citizens can we expect these individuals to be, \nindividuals who have been ordered deported, who have had their day in \ncourt and who simply defied that court order by going on the lam and \nmelting into the American landscape, or those who have been ordered \ndeported and who have actually\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\nbeen deported but then who have reentered the country? Both of those, \ngoing on the lam after you have been ordered deported and reentering \nafter you have been actually deported, are felonies under section 243 \nof the Immigration and Naturalization Act--a felony.\n  If we are serious about restoring respect for the rule of law, then \nwe should, at the very least, prohibit felons and repeat offenders from \ngetting the Z visa or path to legal status, including the opportunity \nto apply for legal permanent residency and citizenship. We should be \nwilling to draw a bright line there.\n  I have to say, with all due respect, if we do not adopt this \namendment, then we might as well retitle that section of this bill, \n``No Felon Left Behind.'' It is clear, whether it is gang members, \nterrorists, sex offenders or repeat drunk drivers, these people have \nthumbed their noses at the law. While there is some common ground, and \nI congratulate Senator Kennedy for moving our way on this issue, it \ncompletely omits the category of felons who have shown no regard for \nour laws and who have shown themselves unwilling to live in peace with \nAmericans in this country. We ought to draw a bright line there. My \namendment would do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 2 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I know we have a number of colleagues who not only are \nMembers of the Senate but are also running for the highest office in \nour land, running for the office of President of the United States. I \nknow there have been a number of debates on the Democratic side and \nRepublican side. I believe this amendment and the vote on this \namendment is a defining issue for those who seek the highest office in \nthe land, for them to demonstrate their respect for the rule of law and \nto demonstrate their desire to return law and order to our immigration \nsystem. A ``no'' vote on the Cornyn amendment will demonstrate that we \nare not serious, that we do not believe the rule of law deserves \nrespect because, unfortunately, under the Kennedy amendment, the \nalternative is literally a figleaf that has been offered to give people \nthe sense they voted for something so they will have an explanation, \neven knowing they have not voted to exclude these felons. A failure to \nvote yes on the Cornyn amendment will indicate we are not serious about \nrestoring the rule of law through our immigration system and will \nindicate we are willing to allow felons and people who have no desire, \nbased on their experience, to comply with our laws and live in peace in \nthis country, to become part of America. I think we need to send a loud \nand clear message as to where that line should be drawn.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time on this side and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator about a hypothetical that \nis not a hypothetical. It is a real case that has come through my \noffice in Chicago. I ask the Senator from Texas if he would consider \nthe facts in this case and tell me how his amendment would apply to the \ncase.\n  In a family in Chicago, the father is a citizen of the United States \nand the four children that he and his wife have are all citizens of the \nUnited States. The mother is undocumented. The mother came into the \nUnited States illegally. She was married, raised a family--and her \ngrandmother died in Mexico. She went back over the border and, when she \ntried to reenter the United States, produced identification that was \nfalse. They caught her. They deported her back to Mexico, but she made \nit back to the United States. She is now with her family in Chicago.\n  It is a case that has had a lot of publicity because she was deported \n2 days before Mother's Day. She has been allowed to return to the \nUnited States on a humanitarian waiver to be with her family.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Texas, how would you treat her \nunder your amendment? What would her status be? Would she be \ncharacterized as an aggravated felon? Could she, under any \ncircumstances, be given any opportunity to become legal under your \namendment?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will be glad to try to answer the \nquestion. Similar to a lot of hypotheticals, it has a lot of twists and \nturns. Let me give it a try.\n  Under this amendment, people who entered the country illegally and \nwho are guilty of illegal entry, or who come in legally and overstay, \nwould not be rendered ineligible, not under the Cornyn amendment. Those \nwho are repeat offenders--in other words, people who have entered \nillegally, then exited the country and reentered; exited, reentered--\nare guilty of a more serious offense because they are multiple \noffenders.\n  I am not sure, under the hypothetical the Senator asked, whether this \nindividual would be barred. But people who are serial offenders and \nviolators of our immigration laws would be barred under this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So if I might ask the Senator from Texas: The Senator \nfrom Texas would suggest, then, that this mother of four citizens, \nmarried to a citizen of the United States, who has lived here for more \nthan 10 years, should be deported?\n  Mr. CORNYN. What my amendment would do would not order her deported. \nWhat it would do is say she is ineligible for a Z visa.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Texas--let's get down to the \nreality of the situation. As far as this family is concerned, where the \nmother has gone through the experience I described, you would say that \nfamily has to either break up or leave?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I disagree with the characterization of \nthe Senator from Illinois. As this hypothetical individual is married \nto a U.S. citizen, she could get a waiver on that ground because she is \nmarried to a U.S. citizen. She would not, under existing law--she could \nget a waiver and would not be deported necessarily.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might ask one last question, is that a provision in \nyour amendment? Or is that in the underlying bill?\n  Mr. CORNYN. In response to the question, that is a provision of \ncurrent law that my amendment does not touch.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \nraising that issue. I think our language makes it extremely clear. I \nthink there is a real question. We are looking through the language of \nthe Senator from Texas about whether that would necessarily define that \nindividual as an aggravated felon and therefore would deny the judge \nthe opportunity to make a humanitarian finding on it, but we can come \nback to that.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1333, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1333, as modified.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1333, as modified, to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will make a comment. I see my friend \nfrom Rhode Island. I would like to make a brief comment on the \namendment of Senator Cornyn and a brief comment on our amendment. Then \nI hope the Senator from Rhode Island will speak to it.\n  It is always interesting to listen, when we are talking about the \nimmigration bill, to those who go back to the 1986 bill. I remember it \nvery clearly. I voted against it. That was an amnesty. That was a real \namnesty. We hear a great deal in the public about what is amnesty, what \nis not amnesty. That was amnesty. This legislation is not amnesty. That \neffectively said those people who were undocumented, who came here, \nwere forgiven. They followed the basic recommendations of a report by \nthe distinguished president of Notre Dame, the Hessberg Report. I \nremember it clearly.\n  There were enforcement provisions in there. They were completely \ninadequate. I might remind my friend from Texas, from 1986 to 1992, we \nhad a Republican administration, a Republican President, and they \ndidn't enforce it, as they have not enforced the recent legislation. \nThey have had three investigations in terms of investigating \nundocumented aliens--three. They are the great defenders of the \nAmerican border? Great defenders about immigration reform?\n  Please.\n  We always have to go through the little dance about the 1986 bill and \nthe enforcement. I wish, during that period of time--1986, 1987, 1988, \n1989--I wish all during those years we had the enforcement. But we did \nnot. So we are where we are today. The real question is, is this \nlegislation that we have now the downpayment on national security, on \nsecurity internally? Does it provide the opportunity for those who are \nhere to pay the fine, go to the back of the line, demonstrate a good \nworking relationship and be able to emerge out of the shadows--the \nAgJOBS bill, the DREAM Act, and other provisions of the temporary \nworker program?\n  With regards to the Cornyn amendment, we have an immigration program \nin this legislation that is strong, practical, and fair. One of the \nessential elements is to bring the 12 million men, women, and \nchildren--hard-working families--out of the shadows into the sunlight \nof America. We know we are not going to conduct massive roundups and \ndeport 12 million people. We don't have the means to do it. It would \ndisrupt our economy, inflict untold hardships on millions of hard-\nworking people. It is estimated it would cost more than $250 billion. \nWe would have buses all the way from Los Angeles to New York and back \nto trying to do this, if it were even possible.\n\n[[Page S7104]]\n\n  But the Cornyn amendment would make vast numbers of these families \nineligible for our program. We are trying to deal with a key element of \nthe program and that deals with the families who are here. It would \nkeep them in the shadows, where employers abuse and underpay them. That \nhurts the immigrants, but it hurts American workers, too, by depressing \nwages.\n  That is what we see that is out there now, with undocumented--the 12 \nmillion with a work record which is even better, in terms of \npercentages, than native born Americans, people who are willing to work \nand want to work hard. But there is exploitation of those individuals \nbecause every one of them knows all the boss has to do is go down and \ncall the immigration service.\n  Work 80 hours a week.\n  Well, I don't want to.\n  Well, I'm going to call the immigration service and you're deported.\n  They do that. That individuals are exploited in this country is well \nunderstood. We are trying to free ourselves from that kind of a \ncondition. But the Cornyn amendment would still make vast numbers of \nthese families ineligible for our programs, keep them in the shadows \nwhere employers abuse and underpay them, which hurts the immigrants but \nit hurts American workers, too, by depressing their wages.\n  The Cornyn amendment does this by classifying an array of common \ngarden variety immigration offenses as crimes that would make them \nineligible for the program. For example, the Cornyn amendment says that \nif you come here, have been ordered out of the country by immigration \nauthorities, but if you fail to leave or you come back, you are \nineligible. That is exactly what has been going on with our broken \nimmigration system; people have come to work, employers want them to \ncome, and they have benefitted our economy.\n  Immigration officers may find them and order them home, but our \nemployers beg them to come back. Our broken borders make that possible.\n  Cornyn says: If you have used false identification, you may be found \ninadmissible and may be deported. But in our broken system, the people \nwho have wanted to work have been forced to use the false \nidentification. That is the reality of where we are today. Cornyn says \nhe wants to be tough on gang members, sex offenders, individuals \nconvicted of domestic violence. So do we. We have addressed any \nprovisions not covered by the current law. Our amendment goes even \nfurther than the bipartisan compromise bill.\n  He wants to exclude gang members. Our amendment does that too. Nobody \nwho has engaged in illegal activity as part of a criminal gang will be \nallowed to enter or stay in this country. He says we should bar sex \noffenders from coming here. Our amendment does that. Any convicted sex \noffender who fails to register will not be allowed back in the country; \nif already here, then those offenders will face deportation.\n  Cornyn says immigrants who commit acts of domestic violence or \nendanger their families should be punished. Our amendment does that. He \nsays drunk drivers should be deported. Our amendment does that. Any \nimmigrant with one felony conviction for drunk driving will not be \nallowed to enter this country. If convicted here, then the drunk driver \nwill be deported.\n  He says there should be consequences for individuals engaging in \nfraud. Our amendment does that. Our amendment punishes anyone who \ncommits perjury or makes false statements when seeking immigration \nbenefits. If any person lies on their application, then this individual \nwill be prosecuted and subject to criminal penalties.\n  He says we should go after immigrants convicted of firearms offenses. \nOur amendment does that, too. Who are the people we want to apply under \nour program? Who are the people the Cornyn amendment would condemn to \nthe shadows of abuse? We know that the vast majority of the families \nwho have come over here are hard-working people who care for their \nchildren, go to church, and contribute to their communities.\n  In America, we respect hard work. Hard work built America. So our \nprogram says: If your only offense is that you came here to work, you \ncame here to provide for your family, we will proceed in a way that you \ncan atone for that offense and earn the right to stay and work legally. \nIf you are a criminal, then we will arrest you. If you are a threat to \nour national security, a terrorist, then we will lock you up. If you \ntry to cheat your way into the program through fraud, we will deport \nyou. But if you came here to work and build a life, then you can stay. \nBut first you have to meet the tough requirements: You have to pay the \n$5,000 fine, show a steady work history, learn English, get to the back \nof the line to get your green card, behind all those who have been \nwaiting legally to get theirs.\n  The Cornyn amendment creates harmful barriers for refugees fleeing \npersecution. In America, we have had a long and proud tradition of \nproviding refuge to people who have faced persecution and oppression in \ntheir lands, whose lives are at risk because they stood up for their \nbeliefs.\n  We took in refugees from Cuba and from Vietnam as they fled \ncommunism. We have helped people from Somalia and Bosnia and other \nareas of conflict and oppression. Now we are beginning to help people \nwhose lives are at risk because they helped our troops in Iraq.\n  But often these persecuted refugees have no choice but to cooperate \nwith their oppressors in order to save their families' lives and enable \ntheir escape. The Cornyn amendment says: If you do that, if you provide \nwhat is called material support to these oppressors and terrorist \ngroups, then we are not going to rescue you from the hands of your \noppressors. You have to take your chances and hope your oppressors do \nnot persecute you or even kill you or your family.\n  Consider the case of Helene from Sierra Leone, Revolutionary United \nFront rebels attacked her home, hacked one of her family members to \ndeath with a machete; they set her son on fire, leaving him near dead \nwith severe burns. They held her family captive, raping her and her \ndaughter and forcing them to cook, forcing her to cook and wash their \nclothes.\n  The Cornyn amendment would bar legitimate refugees who were forced to \nassist their oppressors under duress. Under the Cornyn amendment, \nHelene would be ineligible to come to America as a refugee because she \ncooked for the rebels and washed their clothes. Under the Cornyn \namendment, she and her family are ineligible because they provided \nmaterial support for a terrorist group.\n\n  If that is not bad enough, the Cornyn amendment says she can be \nexcluded based on secret evidence, evidence that neither she nor anyone \nelse outside the Government can see. She may never know why she was \nexcluded. The Cornyn amendment even bars her from going to court to \nexplain her situation and appeal the denial of her case. The decision \nof the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General is final.\n  Helene would never get her day in court to explain the tragic \ncircumstances of her case. The door to freedom in America would be \nclosed shut, end of the discussion, you go back into the hands of your \npersecutors.\n  Madam President, surely by now, we have learned that closed \nproceedings conducted by executive branch officials based on secret \nevidence without any possibility of court review are inconsistent with \nAmerican traditions and inconsistent with the search for justice; let's \nnot go down that road again.\n  The amendment makes all of its changes retroactive. They apply to the \npast and future conduct. The Cornyn amendment would change the rules in \nmidstream. That is frowned on in American jurisprudence; it is \nunconstitutional in criminal law and disfavored elsewhere. People whose \nconduct would not have affected their immigration status at a time it \nwas committed, will suddenly suffer severe consequence. The \nretroactivity provisions simply bring home the punitive nature of this \namendment. It is not designed to contribute to creation of a tough but \nfair and practical system of immigration, it is designed to be harshly \npunitive.\n  This amendment would exclude hundreds of thousands from benefits of \nthis bill and undermine the bipartisan compromise that members of this \nbody worked so long and so hard to produce. We will have an opportunity \nto vote for an alternative, the amendment I have offered. The amendment \nexpands the\n\n[[Page S7105]]\n\nalready tough criminal gang provisions contained in the bill.\n  If you are associated with a gang, and that gang is known to be \nengaged in violent crimes, drug crimes, crimes involving firearms or \nexplosives, alien smuggling or trafficking, you are not going to \nqualify for benefits. If you are associated with a gang and the gang \nhas been engaged in crimes of violence, including murder, arson, \npossession, kidnapping, bank robbery, sexual exploitation, abuse of \nchildren, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, burglary, \nracketeering, among other crimes, you are not going to be entitled to \nreceive lawful status in this country, and you are not going to qualify \nfor benefits.\n  This amendment expands the already tough grounds of inadmissibility \nand the criminal penalties in the current immigration law. We target \nessentially the same provisions as Senator Cornyn but in many instances \ngo further. This amendment bars the admission of sex offenders who \ndon't register as required and makes them subject to deportation as \nwell.\n  It ensures that wife beaters, child abusers, stalkers, and others who \nprey on the vulnerable are inadmissible to the United States. It \nensures that a drunk driver who is sentenced to 1 year of prison cannot \nbe admitted to the United States and can be removed as well. Our drunk \ndriving provisions, which require only one felony conviction, are even \nmore restrictive than Senator Cornyn's, which requires three \nconvictions before a drunk driver becomes inadmissible. We increase the \npenalties for illegal entry. We ensure that immigration fraud is \nsubject to perjury charges. We toughen the penalties for firearm \noffenses. We are tough, but we are practical too. That is where this \nside by side differs from Senator Cornyn. His provisions are bright-\nline rules. He turns many of these criminal offenses into aggravated \nfelonies. That is ``immigration speak'' for: You will never, ever be \nforgiven.\n  For many offenses, such as murder, that is more than a reasonable \nconsequence. Murderers should not become U.S. citizens. Under the \ncurrent law, they can never become a citizen. But most immigrants are \nnot murderers, they are people who have entered the United States \nillegally. Under the Cornyn amendment, they could be aggravated felons \ntoo.\n  As a practical matter, Senator Cornyn does not want us to distinguish \nbetween murder and illegal entry; but that is not practical, nor does \nit reflect our criminal justice system. So it is true that we build in \nsome small but important waivers that in extraordinary circumstances \nwould give someone a second chance, not murderers but someone who had \nlong ago made a mistake.\n  This week, I received a letter about a young man named Adrian, a \nformer gang member in Massachusetts who has turned his life around. \nAdrian went from a life of juvenile delinquency to that of a dedicated \nstudent; one who works full time now in hopes of going to college. \nAdrian's principal and his teachers praise him for his hard work, his \ncommitment to family, his newfound motivation to go to college. They \nwant him to have a chance to stay in this country.\n  The author of the letter then says: ``It is a very, very hard thing \nto leave the gang life behind. There are other Adrians out there as \nwell who have made the same decision regardless of difficulty. Is the \nmessage this country wants to send them, that what they have done is \nunforgivable regardless of whatever changes they may have courageously \nmade? Wouldn't the country gain by having an incentive in law that \nmight attract young people to leave gang life and move their lives \nforward a very different way? Wouldn't it be helpful to the country to \nhave a waiver that a person could apply for if they can prove they have \nleft a gang and provided evidence on how they have moved on?''\n  Every change in our immigration law represents a statement about whom \nwe are as a country. Are we a country that takes individual \ncircumstances into account or are we a country that punishes with no \nregard for individual circumstances? We can be tough on crime and yet \nretain a level of discretion in our immigration laws? This is the crux \nof the difference between what I am suggesting to the Senate and what \nSenator Cornyn has proposed.\n  That a measure of discretion is every bit as much a tool of law \nenforcement as the strictest ban. I see my friend who has been waiting \nhere. I yield time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would ask the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts if we may go back and forth across the aisle. I have \na speaker on our side as well who would like to be recognized for 10 \nminutes. Is that acceptable?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I would like to follow that. The good Senator was \nhere even before I was this morning. Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I would yield to the request of the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank all my colleagues for their courtesies.\n  Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Cornyn amendment and \nin opposition to the much weaker, watered-down Democratic alternative.\n  This amendment illustrates a lot about this debate. The Cornyn \namendment is clear. It is necessary. It is common sense. It is \nabsolutely necessary we pass amendments such as this and have the \nability to debate and vote on amendments such as this in the important \nimmigration debate.\n  This amendment is very straightforward. It prevents terrorists, gang \nmembers, sex offenders, and other folks who have broken the law in \nsignificant ways, committed significant felonies, from receiving \nimmigration benefits and citizenship in the future. How can any of us \nin the Senate oppose a straightforward and necessary commonsense \namendment? How can any of us be comfortable with an underlying bill \nwhich has these gaping loopholes? We must address these gaping \nloopholes. How can we tell families across America that we are going to \nallow sex offenders and gang members to become legal residents, \npossibly citizens? The Cornyn amendment would prevent this. It would \naddress all of these significant loopholes.\n  Again, terrorists, gang members, violent gang members, those who have \ncommitted other significant felonies, those who have been detained for \ncoming into the country illegally and have absconded, those who have \nbeen deported from the country for coming into the country illegally \nand have reentered illegally--all of those categories of illegals \nshould be prevented from gaining the benefits of this bill. The Cornyn \namendment clearly does that.\n  The Democratic alternative clearly does not. It has significant \nomissions from the Cornyn amendment. It allows absconders, those who \nhave been detained and have gone underground, to receive the benefits \nof the bill. It allows those who have been deported from the country \nand who came back in illegally to get the benefits of this bill. It \nallows others who fall into the category of gang members and those who \ncommitted serious felonies to gain the benefits of this legislation. \nThat is simply wrong. We must support the commonsense, straightforward \nCornyn amendment.\n  I also want to spend a portion of my time urging my colleagues to not \nvote for cloture on this bill as it presently rests before us, because \nwe have many important amendments to consider. Two of those are the \namendments I will humbly offer to the Senate. They are important \nissues; they are important amendments. I urge us to pay careful \nconsideration to them and to have an opportunity for debate and vote.\n  In that spirit, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending \namendment and to call up my amendment No. 1338.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. I am sorry to hear that. Let me try my second amendment \nwhich is also at the desk. It concerns a significant provision in the \nbill which we need the opportunity to debate and vote on. That is \nVitter amendment No. 1339.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S7106]]\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, unfortunately, this illustrates the \npoint about the inappropriateness of cloture. These are two significant \namendments which go to important provisions of the bill. All of us--and \nmore importantly, the American people--deserve to have these matters \ndebated and voted on. Let me explain what these amendments are about. \nEverybody--certainly the majority side--has been given the amendments.\n  My first amendment only requires what Congress originally mandated \nback in 1986; that is, the entry/exit system known today as US-VISIT. \nWe must have that fully operational before all aspects of this bill are \nallowed to go into effect. It was authorized 10 years ago, but it is \nnot near to fully operational now. We must make sure that it is a part \nof this bill's enforcement trigger.\n  Without the US-VISIT system's completion, we can't be sure that we \nknow what individuals are in the country. In fact, we can be sure we \nwill not know because how can we possibly have a grasp of who is in the \ncountry and who is not in the country without this system which tracks \npeople as they exit? There are a lot of folks on visas here for a \nlimited period of time. Under that visa, they, of course, need to exit \nthe country before their visa is up. The US-VISIT system allows us to \nknow if they are doing that. How can we possibly be ready for the full \nimplementation of this legislation, how can we possibly say we have the \nenforcement system we need in place without the US-VISIT system, \nwithout knowing who exits the country and when, without knowing whether \nthey have overstayed their visa?\n  As of 2006, the illegal population included 4 to 5.5 million \noverstays, people here illegally because they are overstaying the time \nlimits of their visa. The US-VISIT system is absolutely necessary to \nget to the heart of the problem and to enforce against overstays. How \ncan we say we have adequate enforcement, how can we trigger the other \nprovisions of this bill without making sure we have that in place, \nfunctioning, fully operational?\n  The US-VISIT system is not any part of the triggers now in the bill. \nIt must be. That is what my amendment 1339 goes to.\n  As I mentioned, I have another amendment, No. 1338, that would \ncorrect a provision in the bill which doesn't allow for a catch-and-\nrelease program anymore but simply changes that to a catch, pay, and \nrelease program. In this legislation, those in this country illegally \nwho are caught and who are not from Mexico don't have to be kept in \ncustody. They can be released on a $5,000 bond. For months, and indeed \nyears, we on the Senate floor and those around the country have decried \nthe catch-and-release program, a program that has been in place where \nillegals are caught but are released into our country and simply given \na piece of paper that says: Show up to court on such-and-such a date. \nGuess what. They never do. This bill merely changes that to a catch, \npay, and release program. It allows catch and release to continue, only \nwith a $5,000 bond.\n  Why is that a problem? Because many of the folks we are talking \nabout, particularly those who are among the most dangerous, those \ninvolved in illegal drug activity, those in other organized crime, can \nget the $5,000 bond. If they are already paying human smugglers to get \nthem across the border, in many cases thousands and thousands of \ndollars, one has to assume they can get the resources to pay this bond. \nChanging catch and release to catch, pay, and release is completely \ninadequate. Yet that is what the underlying legislation does.\n\n  Amendment No. 1338 would close that loophole, would say: No, we are \ngoing to end catch and release forever, and we are not going to allow \ncash, pay, and release. When we catch these folks coming into the \ncountry illegally who are not from Mexico, so we can't simply send them \nback to Mexico at the southern border, we are going to detain them. We \nare not going to let them into the country on a bond or anything else. \nWe are going to detain them until they are deported, and we are going \nto work very hard to deport them as quickly as possible.\n  Again, I believe my two amendments, which have not been allowed to be \noffered, clearly illustrate why we are not ready for cloture on this \nbill. This is a significant debate on a massive, 800-page bill. This \nbill, if enacted, will affect our country in major and significant ways \nfor decades to come. Everybody admits that, no matter what side of the \ndebate they may be on. Yet we have only been allowed to have a modest \nnumber of votes on the bill, something on the order of 12. That is \nridiculous. We need these sorts of amendments considered and voted on, \nand we must oppose cloture until that happens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have tried to work out an orderly \nprocess as we have proceeded. We are going to have plenty of time to \ndeal with a range of different amendments, as we did with the Vitter \namendment previously.\n  I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 39\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator from Rhode Island 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                    remembering senator craig thomas\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, this is my first time speaking on \nthe floor since the passing of our colleague, Senator Thomas. I know we \nare all very conscious of the desk draped in black across the way, next \nto Senator Cornyn. I extend my condolences to his many friends, my many \nesteemed colleagues who knew and admired Senator Thomas and mourn his \nloss and know he will be sorely missed by his friends in the Senate and \nhis friends and family in his native State of Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1184\n\n  I rise today to address amendment No. 1184 offered by my friend from \nTexas, my former attorney general colleague, Senator Cornyn.\n  I will oppose this amendment. It is not entirely without merit in \nevery one of its many dimensions, but it would undercut the fundamental \nprinciples of due process which are a longstanding and vital hallmark \nof our legal system. I fully support the creation of new grounds for \ninadmissibility to the United States for convicted sex offenders, gang \nmembers, repeat DUI offenders, and for individuals who have been \nconvicted of firearms offenses and domestic violence. I have prosecuted \nthese crimes. I have a firsthand understanding of how dangerous these \ncriminals are. Simply stated, America's doors should not be opened to \npeople who commit such crimes. If Senator Cornyn believes there are \nloopholes, I am happy to plug them, although I would note that the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, the President, \nand others seem satisfied.\n  For that reason, I will support the alternative amendment offered by \nSenator Kennedy which would add these offenses and others to the \ngrounds for inadmissibility.\n  There is a right way to ensure dangerous criminals don't enter the \ncountry and there is a wrong way. Unfortunately, the amendment we are \ndebating goes about it the wrong way. Let me explain.\n  Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, good moral character is a \nprerequisite for a variety of benefits and privileges, the most \nimportant being naturalization. Therefore, the law lists a series of \ncharacteristics which exclude a person from the definition of ``good \nmoral character'': for example, a person whose income is derived \nprincipally from gambling or one who has given false testimony for the \npurpose of obtaining benefits or one who has been convicted of an \naggravated felony. This, of course, makes perfect sense. These \nindividuals as a general rule should not get on a path to \nnaturalization.\n  But this amendment would change the definition of ``good moral \ncharacter'' in a very novel and unsettling way: It would exclude from \nthat definition one who the Secretary of Homeland Security or the \nAttorney General determines, in the unreviewable discretion of the \nSecretary or the Attorney General, to have been at any time an alien \ndescribed in section 212(a)(3) or 237(a)(4). These sections list a \nseries of security-related grounds under which\n\n[[Page S7107]]\n\nan alien is excludable or deportable. Those grounds, sensibly enough, \ninclude espionage, sabotage, terrorist activity, and any other unlawful \nactivity. Anyone convicted of such offenses or even indicted for such \noffenses should be, of course, excludable. But that is not what this \namendment says. This amendment would give the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity and the Attorney General unreviewable discretion to make a \ndetermination as to good moral character.\n  First, as I have previously said, I am not inclined to expand the \npowers of the current Attorney General in any substantive way, much \nless to expand his power to make important unreviewable decisions. \nSetting aside my grave hesitation about this particular Attorney \nGeneral, as a general rule, I don't believe we ought to prevent judges \nfrom reviewing important decisions which can affect life, liberty, and \nproperty. This would violate one of the most fundamental principles of \nAmerican democracy--judicial review, a principle we have honored for \ncenturies.\n  The second issue is even more unsettling. That is, under the proposed \namendment, a person could be determined to lack ``good moral \ncharacter'' if the unreviewable decision is made that he or she is \n``described in'' these two specific sections of the immigration code.\n  ``Described in,'' what exactly does it mean to be ``described in'' a \nstatute? Not ``convicted'' under a statute, not ``in violation'' of a \nstatute, not ``indicted'' under a statute but merely ``described in'' \nit.\n  Who knows what it means? I have found no precedent for this \nformulation. Is it consistent with American values to grant the \nAttorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security the \nunreviewable discretion to say that a person is ``described in'' those \nstatutes; the unreviewable power to say that somebody is engaged in \n``unlawful activity''; and the unreviewable power to then deny them the \nbenefits and privileges of American law?\n  That is not my experience as a prosecutor. I found due process to be \nimportant and valuable.\n  The amendment does not stop there. It would allow this unreviewable \ndiscretion to be based on evidence which the accused would never have \nthe opportunity to confront.\n  Madam President, like you, I have spent my professional life in the \nAmerican legal system, a good deal of it I spent as a U.S. attorney and \nas an attorney general. My experience is that our American system of \nlaw stands on some fundamental principles, among them that people can \nbe aware of the charges brought against them, that people have an \nopportunity to confront the evidence used against them, that the \nprosecution and the judge are not rolled into one, and that we have \njudicial review of important decisions affecting people's rights and \nprivileges. These are basic principles, and they represent core \nAmerican values.\n  I do not know why we have to keep getting up to defend this. This is \nbedrock stuff. From the suspension of habeas corpus, to the \nadministration's legal defense of torture, to ``extraordinary \nrendition,'' and so on, we have seen relentless efforts to chip away at \nbedrock principles of American law. With this amendment, there they go \nagain.\n  Of course, we must do everything proper and necessary to protect our \nborders and keep Americans safe. But to throw out the separation \nbetween prosecution and judge, to throw out the opportunity to \nunderstand and explain evidence used against you, to throw out our \nancient principle of judicial review, to allow Government officials to \ntake away rights and privileges without answering to anyone? I do not \nthink so.\n  These principles are too dear to be thrown away so lightly. Our \ncountry has been through a lot over the years, and these principles \nhave survived and flourished, to lie today in our hands, in our \nstewardship, to protect and to pass on, as they were passed on to us.\n  I do not think this immigration issue is so terrifying that we need \nto throw these principles away now over immigration. We are made of \nsterner stuff than that.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose Senator Cornyn's amendment No. 1184.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I yield the Senator from Alabama 10 \nminutes from our allotted time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator's comments \nabout American law and principles. As a former U.S. attorney and \nattorney general, I share the general view. He mentions the historic \nprivileges we have in America. But let me tell you, no one has a right \nto enter the United States of America. We decide who comes in and who \ndoes not.\n  That is a core principle of sovereignty. Every Nation in the world \nmakes those decisions, if they are a functioning state, and you then \nallow people to enter on your terms, on whatever conditions they may \nbe. The condition may be, you can enter as long as you are enrolled in \na college, you can enter for a certain period of time, you can enter on \na tourist visa to do a certain number of things.\n  But those conditions are not such that if you say someone cannot come \nhere you violated the laws of America. If you say you can come to \nAmerica but not if you have a history of being a sexual predator, what \nright does that violate? What principle of American law does that \nviolate? I suggest none. We have every right to insist and ensure the \nimmigration system of the United States serves the national interest. \nThe national interest means you do not allow people to continue to stay \nin our country or to come to our country who have repeat DUIs or who \nsell drugs or who are associated with terrorists. How basic is that? \nNobody has a constitutional legal right to demand entry into the United \nStates of America. How much more basic can it be than that?\n  So that is where we are confused. It amazes me the lack of \nunderstanding and comprehension of what it is all about. We set the \nstandards. We have the most generous immigration laws of almost any \ncountry in the world. It has been a big part of our heritage. We are \nnot going to end immigration. Nobody wants to do that, or to act \nirrationally, and so forth.\n  But to set reasonable standards, as Senator Cornyn is attempting to \ndo with his amendment, only makes common sense. For example, I have \nmentioned some of the loopholes. He fixes them. I give him every bit of \ncredit for this: for standing firm, for insisting on this vote, after \nhe has been objected to and objected to and blocked from getting his \nvote. But he stood firm on this issue. He is going to fix a number of \nthe problems I wish to briefly mention.\n  Some aggravated felons who have sexually abused a minor are eligible \nfor amnesty under this bill. They have no entitlement to amnesty. \nNobody has entitlement to amnesty, whether they are perfectly wonderful \ncitizens and all that. They are not entitled to that. This is a gift we \ngive. So why would you want to give that to somebody who sexually \nabused a minor?\n  Well, the child molester who committed the crime, before this bill is \nenacted, is not barred from getting amnesty if their conviction \ndocument omitted the age of the victim. If the conviction document did \nnot put the age down, then they are to be admitted under this bill. \nAfter there was some objection to it, they fixed that language for the \nfuture but did not fix it for the past or current convictions. So I \nthink Senator Cornyn is correct. I support that portion of his \namendment very strongly.\n\n  Another provision is that aliens with terrorism connections under \nthis legislation are not barred from getting amnesty. They do not have \na right to stay here. If we have any suggestion that someone in this \ncountry, now here, or someone who wants to come here is connected to \nterrorists, they do not have to be admitted. What kind of right do they \nhave to demand to be admitted? If our State Department, in some country \naround the world, has information that a person is connected to \nterrorism, they do not have any right to demand to come here. They come \nat our pleasure, our sufferance.\n  So one of the things this bill, as written, does is it says an \nillegal alien seeking most of the immigration benefits must show good \ncharacter. But last\n\n[[Page S7108]]\n\nyear's bill--let me say this on the terrorism question--specifically \nbarred aliens with terrorism connections from having the required good \nmoral character to enter the United States. That is one of the things \nwe say. You cannot come here unless you have good moral character. You \ncannot come here if you are a felon, a thief, a drug dealer or a child \nmolester. Surely, that would make sense. So this bill eliminated that.\n  Another example, surprisingly, of this bill being weaker even than \nlast year's fatally flawed bill: The bill's drafters have ignored the \nBush administration's request that changes be made to the asylum, \ncancellation of removal, and withholding of removal statutes in order \nto prevent aliens with terrorist connections from receiving relief. The \nbill drafters were told about this by the Bush administration and were \nurged to put different language in, and they refused to do so, for \nreasons I cannot fathom.\n  But it begins to show a certain mindset. I think that mindset is we \nare somehow here to represent people who want to come into our country \nand stay in our country instead of representing the American people and \nthe interests of the United States.\n  Last year, we had good moral character as a requirement. Good moral \ncharacter involved not being connected to terrorists. But according to \ncurrent law, an alien cannot have good moral character if they are a \nhabitual drunkard, a majority of their income comes from illegal \ngambling, giving false testimony for immigration benefit purposes, they \nhave been in jail for 180 days, they have been convicted of an \naggravated felony or they have engaged in genocide, torture, or \nextrajudicial killings. That is current law we have. But this year's \nbill is completely missing these new terrorism bars that were in last \nyear's bill, and the bill no longer requires good moral character. That \nis a matter that leaves us at greater risk than we need to be. It \nconcerns me.\n  Another example. Instead of ensuring that members of violent gangs, \nsuch as MS-13, are deported, the bill will allow violent gang members \nto get amnesty as long as they renounce their gang membership on their \napplication. That is the current law. Under the bill, being in a \nviolent gang is not going to prevent you from qualifying for amnesty. \nThe bill requires amnesty applicants to list--to list--you are required \nto list that gang membership on your application. Then you get a blank \nthat says ``renunciation of gang affiliation.'' So if you check that \nblank and say you renounce it, then you get to stay in, perhaps.\n  So why don't we allow this: If an illegal alien has been a member of \na violent international gang, such as Mara Salvatrucha 13, MS-13, why \ndon't we say that blocks him or her from being eligible for the amnesty \nin the bill? Loyalty to the United States should be the requirement, \nnot loyalty to some outside gang that is violent.\n  The night before last, I happened to turn on C-SPAN and catch a \nNational Press Club conference by a series of law enforcement officers \ninvolved in the Border Patrol, the former chairman of the Border \nPatrol. They were ferocious in their criticism of this bill. I was \nsurprised how strongly they felt about it.\n  Hugh Brien, himself an immigrant, was Chief of the Border Patrol from \n1986 to 1989. He called the bill a sellout, a complete betrayal of the \nNation, a slap in the face to millions of Americans who have come here \nlegally like he had done. In 1986, he recalled: ``Our masters, our \nmandarins promised it would work.'' Of course, the 1986 bill did not. \nHe also said, based on his experience in many years with the Border \nPatrol: ``It's a disaster.''\n  Kent Lundgren, the national chairman of the Association of Former \nBorder Patrol Officers, said this: ``There are no meaningful criminal \nor terrorist checks'' in the legislation. He noted that the ``screening \nwill not happen.'' He added Congress is lying about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Chair and support the \nCornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-one minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  First, I salute my colleague from Massachusetts for his undaunted, \ncourageous, and effective leadership on this issue, which is one of the \nmost difficult issues we face. I think he has the respect of everybody \nin this body for that--the Senator from Massachusetts does--whether \nthey agree or disagree with the bill.\n  Now, I rise in opposition to the Cornyn amendment and in support of \nthe Kennedy alternative amendment No. 1333. There certainly are \nattractive parts of the Cornyn amendment, but the good parts of the \namendment are buried in complicated language that strikes at the heart \nof the comprehensive immigration bill many of us are working hard to \npass. At a minimum, my colleague's amendment would have the effect of \nstripping the path to citizenship, one of the mainstays of the \ncompromise--one of the two mainstays of the compromise--out of the bill \naltogether. This body has already rejected that approach outright. It \nought not do it now by stealth. It is a Trojan horse--nothing short of \nan attempt to kill the whole bill in the guise of tough enforcement.\n\n  My colleagues know when it comes to tough enforcement, whether it is \non immigrants, citizens, or anyone else, I don't yield to anybody. I am \na tough-on-crime guy. I come from an area that was ravaged by crime, \nand the works of the Federal Government, State government, and city \ngovernment helped make the communities I represent much safer.\n  What we do in the Kennedy amendment is keep the tough enforcement \nwithout killing the bill. Let me repeat that. What we do in this \namendment is keep the tough enforcement--it is all there--but we don't \nkill the bill. We don't eliminate the path to citizenship which is, of \ncourse, what the Cornyn amendment does and may well be intended to do.\n  If we are serious about passing the best possible bill and passing a \nbill that makes good sense, we should support the Kennedy amendment and \nnot throw out the baby with the bathwater. We all want a bill that is \ntough on people who have broken the law, and we all want a bill that \nkeeps people who should not be let into the United States in the first \nplace from coming here.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment is both tough and smart. It changes the \nlaw to prevent the worst criminals from getting into the country and \nkicks out people who shouldn't be here, and it picks out the best parts \nof the Cornyn amendment and leaves out the worst.\n  Like Senator Cornyn's amendment, Senator Kennedy's amendment says any \nnew immigrant who has participated in a criminal gang in any way, \nshape, or form can't come live in the United States, period. It doesn't \nwait for a felony conviction or anything else. If you are in a gang, \nyou can't come in, and you can't become a citizen. Any immigrant in the \nUnited States who has been a member of a gang can be deported. That is \nhow it should be. Also, Senator Kennedy's amendment cracks down on gang \nmembers who violate our gun laws.\n  Under Senator Kennedy's amendment, aliens who have committed the \nhorrible crimes of domestic violence--stalking, child abuse, child \nneglect, or child abandonment, and who have been sent to jail for a \nyear--are barred from moving to the country or from attempting to \nnaturalize as citizens. The amendment provides that sex offenders who \ndon't register can't immigrate or come work here, and convicted sex \noffenders who don't register get deported.\n  The amendment would keep drunk drivers from immigrating to the United \nStates. Just one felony conviction for drunk driving and you are out. \nPeople who try to sneak into the country, illegally cross the border, \nor lie to immigration agents will face steep fines and jail time, as \nthe bill provides, as this body ratified last week.\n  The amendment has tough penalties for repeat offenders. An alien who \ntries\n\n[[Page S7109]]\n\nto enter the country after being convicted of a serious penalty can \nface up to 20 years in jail under the amendment.\n  So this is one tough amendment. But, again, it doesn't seek by \nstealth, as the Cornyn amendment does, to eliminate the bill \naltogether. Some of the things in this amendment are exactly like the \nlanguage in Senator Cornyn's amendment. Senator Kennedy's amendment \ntakes the best of the Cornyn amendment and leaves out the parts that \nwill gut or decapitate the bill. A vote for the Kennedy alternative is \na vote for tough enforcement but also smart policy.\n  Madam President, I yield back the remaining time to my colleague and \nfriend from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, customarily, as a manager of the bill, \nI control time, but I think now the time is in whose hands? I ask for \n12 minutes of time, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, may I inquire whether the Senator \nintends to speak for or against the--\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I think that takes care of it. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I was about to say some nice things \nabout the Senator from Texas, and I still will. He has been a very \nactive and constructive participant in the consideration of immigration \nreform. In the 109th Congress he was very much involved and contributed \ngreatly. We didn't always agree on a number of items, but he is very \nsincere, very studious, very thoughtful, and very constructive, and he \ncontinues in that role, although as is evident, there are some \ndifferences as to our approach. But I commend the Senator from Texas \nfor what he has done and for what he continues to do here.\n  I am in favor of the alternative to the Cornyn amendment. I say that \nbecause we have structured the bill with a great many compromises. \nWhile I might be inclined to agree with the Senator from Texas on some \nof the specifics that he has enumerated which would be a bar to \ncitizenship, there was a tremendous amount of give-and-take in the \nstructuring of this bill so that I am standing with the committee \nbill--strike that. We don't have a committee bill. I wish we did. But I \nam supporting the bill which came out of the lengthy consultation with \nabout a dozen principal Senators participating. There are a number of \nspecifics, in the amendment which is side by side, which I think are \npreferable to the amendment by the Senator from Texas.\n  Illustrative of this preference is that the Senator from Texas makes \na third conviction for drunk driving a crime of violence. Well, it may \nbe a crime of violence, or it may not be a crime of violence. The \nalternative which has been proposed would make drunk driving a grounds \nfor inadmissibility and deportability, providing the alien serves at \nleast a year in prison. From my days as district attorney, I have seen \nquite a number of cases involving drunk driving, for example, and while \nI don't condone multiple convictions, I think it is a more appropriate \nground that there be inadmissibility or deportability where the drunk \ndriving was serious enough to call for a year in jail.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas also strips judicial \nreview of findings that an alien is barred on national security \ngrounds. From what we have seen about this issue in many contexts, \nthere needs to be judicial review, although in a different context. In \nthe last few days we have seen the Military Commission conclude that it \nhad no jurisdiction because of problems with the indicting procedure \nwith respect to whether one is an enemy alien or an unlawful enemy \nalien. This points to the necessity for judicial review, which would be \nexcluded by the Cornyn amendment.\n\n  The Cornyn amendment also would deport or prevent citizenship for \nsomeone who has ever violated a protective order. Well, it is a good \nbit more complicated than that. The alternative amendment provides that \nthere would be an analysis. It would exclude people convicted of a \nfelony domestic violation, but there would be a consideration about \nwhether, on a protective order, the alien was acting in self-defense, \nalong with other considerations, in fact. Most fundamentally, the \nCornyn amendment would strip the authority of the Departments, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, to waive \ncertain grounds which would warrant deportation or inadmissibility. \nThat discretion, which is lodged in the alternative, enables a fuller \nreview of the facts. It gives a chance to really look beyond some of \nthe technical categorizations which might appear ominous on their face, \nbut which, after there is a detailed review of what has happened on the \nunderlying factors, might reveal there ought not to be inadmissibility \nor deportation. That discretion ought to remain with responsible \nofficials in the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of \nJustice.\n  It is for those reasons, but fundamentally because the pending \nlegislation was crafted with a great many compromises, that I favor the \nsubstitute and oppose the Cornyn amendment.\n  I would like to address something which is more fundamental and very \nserious, as we have had a statement by the majority leader that if \ncloture is not invoked tomorrow at 6 o'clock, he will take down this \nbill.\n  I think that would be grossly erroneous. I think that would be very \nbad procedure. If you compare what was done last year in the 109th \nCongress with what we have done in this Congress, you would see there \nwas much more consideration in the last Congress than has been afforded \nthis bill at this time.\n  For example, in the 109th Congress, we worked the bill through the \ncommittee. We did not work this bill through the committee. That was a \nleadership decision. I have stated on the Senate floor on several \noccasions the concern of not having gone through committee; that it was \nprobably a mistake. Well, if this bill is taken down because we haven't \nmade sufficient progress in the eyes of the majority leader, there is \nno doubt it would be a mistake because had we gone through committee, \nwe would have worked through so many of these issues which we have had \nto legislate on the floor.\n  In the 109th Congress, the Judiciary Committee, which I chaired, had \n6 days of committee markups. They were tough and laborious days, and we \ndealt with 59 amendments. We returned one Monday after a recess when \nthe majority leader said he would proceed with the substitute bill, and \na Monday back after a recess is a very tough day. But on March 27, \n2006, the committee made a special effort to reconvene. We had a \nquorum, believe it or not, by 10 o'clock in the morning, and we worked \nthrough, laboriously, until the evening when we reported out a bill. \nThat is what happened during the markup, 6 days of markup in the \ncommittee where, as I say, we considered some 59 amendments.\n  Then, when we moved to the floor of the Senate, we had 12 days on the \nbill. We had 4 days before cloture failed, and then we came back with 8 \ndays more and considered in excess of 50 total votes--some rollcall, \nsome voice votes--in passing the bill out of the U.S. Senate.\n  Now, contrast that with what we have had up to the present time. We \nhave been on the bill 8 days, and 3 of those days were Mondays or \nFridays pro forma without voting. We have only had 5 days where we have \nbeen involved in voting. Even on those days, they have not been as \nproductive as voting days were on the bill in the 109th Congress \nbecause we have been in quorum calls. We have been negotiating. We have \nbeen trying to work through issues that, had this bill gone through \ncommittee, would have been resolved some time ago.\n  So you have a comparison of, really, 5 days, plus 3 days of pro \nforma, 8 at the most, contrasted with 12 days before. It is more \naccurately a comparison of 12 to 5--12 in the last Congress where we \nlegislated and where we passed the bill. Here, where we have voted on \nonly 21 amendments, contrasted with more than 50 we voted on in the \nlast Congress.\n  We have also had a tremendous amount of Senators' time and time of \nthe Secretary of Commerce and the\n\n[[Page S7110]]\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security. We met for 2 hours on Tuesdays, \nWednesdays, and Thursdays, and sometimes on Mondays and Fridays as \nwell, over a 10-week period.\n  It is hard to calculate how many hours were put in by Senators, but I \nthink it goes into the thousands. It is hard to calculate how much time \nwas put in by the two secretaries, but I think that goes into the \nhundreds. If you talk about staff time, it is incalculable. The staff \ndirector, Mike O'Neill, worked for about 20 days solid, including \nweekends, and that was sort of par for the course.\n  So to pull this bill tomorrow at 6 o'clock--I think it would be hard \nto find the right word that is appropriate in strength and not \noverboard. But I think ``outrageous'' would be a modest comment; it \nwould be outrageous to pull this bill tomorrow.\n  One of my staffers said this bill has been the result of blood, \nsweat, and fears--paraphrasing Churchill's blood, sweat, and tears--and \nmaybe more fears than blood and sweat. But we have come a long way. We \nhave already seen a lot of finger pointing on this floor. We seem to be \na lot better in the Senate at finger pointing than at legislating. But \nif this bill is pulled down, then you may even see toe pointing, \nbecause 10 fingers won't be sufficient for Republicans blaming \nDemocrats and the majority leader for pulling down the bill, and \nDemocrats blaming Republicans for a lot of dilatory amendments.\n  The majority leader has said these amendments are designed to kill \nthe bill, that the people offering the amendments don't have any \nintention of voting for the bill. Senators who offer amendments don't \nhave to have intentions of voting for the bill. Senators can offer \namendments because they are Senators and because they think their \namendments may pass, and because, who knows, they may even think their \namendments could improve the bill. I think Senator Cornyn sincerely \nbelieves his amendment will improve the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ordinarily keep better track of time, \nbut I am a little wound up and concerned about where all of the work we \nhave done may end up if this bill is pulled and, more importantly, \nafter the work that has been done, where it would leave the immigration \nmess in the United States. We have 12 million undocumented immigrants; \nwe don't know where they are or what risks they face. We cannot deport \nthem all. We have a porous border. If we don't have comprehensive \nimmigration reform, we are not going to put up all the fencing, the \nbarriers, and stop the additional people. The administration has made \ncommitments, and there will be more about how the funds will be spent. \nWe are not going to go through with employer verification. We are not \ngoing to spend the money on foolproof identification so employers can \nsee who is legal and who is not legal, so that we have the basis for \nimposing tough sanctions, including jail. We are not going to eliminate \nthe magnet to bring more people in. It will be a colossal failure.\n  I think it is safe to say the Senate would be the laughingstock of \nthe country, after all of the hyperbole and publicity and all of the \nproposals and objections, if we are not able to finish this bill. It \ndoesn't have to be finished this week. There is next week. We are not \nknown for necessarily using the full week. We vote very infrequently on \nMondays, almost never on Fridays. The evening session is not really \npracticed around here. When I came to the Senate with Howard Baker, we \nused to have a lot of all-night sessions. One night in 1982 or 1983--I \nask for 4 more minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 more minutes to the Senator. How much time \nwill I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will have 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, we had a tax bill on the Senate floor, \nand it was 11:45. Howard Baker, the majority leader, was consulting \nwith the Finance chairman, Senator Dole. There were 63 amendments \npending. Senator Baker said we are going to work through the night. He \nsaid amendments, like mushrooms, grow overnight. So we worked through \nthe night. There were some amendments taken, some amendments withdrawn, \nand some voted upon. It is amazing how much shorter the debate is at 3 \na.m. It is also amazing how many more Senators there are on the floor \nat 3 a.m. There were a lot of people on cots in the cloakroom, but a \nlot of Senators were on the floor. The insomniacs outnumbered the \nsleepers by 2 to 1. We had a lot of comments like you heard in \nParliament. Someone would be making an argument and there would be \ncries of ``vote, vote.'' At 3 a.m. the cries of ``vote'' and the lack \nof decorum carried the day.\n  The point is that a few more days in the Senate will not impede the \naction of this body. Some of the items that are coming up on the agenda \nmay not merit the kind of time and attention the immigration bill does.\n  The American people are obviously sick and tired of the bickering in \nthe Congress and in the Senate, sick and tired of the kind of finger \npointing, and there will be an awful lot of it if we fail to legislate \non this matter. The bill may be voted down. I think the bill will pass \nif we stick with it. Certainly, we ought to carry it through to \nconclusion.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding me the extra \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I rise today to discuss amendment No. \n1313, an amendment that I will offer to the immigration reform bill, \nwhich will address what I believe are two crucial flaws in this \nlegislation. The first flaw relates to what some people may call \namnesty, wherein the bill legalizes almost everyone who entered this \ncountry by the beginning of this year. The second flaw relates to an \nunworkable set of procedures applicable to those who are properly \noffered legal status. It is important to the health and practicality of \nour system that these two flaws be addressed.\n  My amendment would achieve three critically important goals: it \ncreates a fair and workable path to legalization for those who have \ntruly put down roots in America; it protects the legitimate interests \nof all working Americans; and it accords honor and dignity to the \nconcept of true American justice.\n  If one accepts the premises of these three goals, then I strongly \nbelieve that this amendment is the best way forward.\n  As a general matter, I agree with my colleagues that the time has \ncome for fair and balanced reform of our broken immigration system. \nWhen I say ``fairness,'' I mean a system of laws that is fair to \neveryone here in the United States and especially our wage earners.\n  I strongly support the provisions in this immigration bill that \nstrengthen our Nation's borders. Our porous borders are a threat to our \nnational security, and we have waited far too long to fix this problem.\n  I also support the sections of the bill that create tough civil and \ncriminal penalties for employers who unfairly hire illegal immigrants, \ncreating both a second-class population and undercutting American \nworkers. The bill's employment verification system will help ensure \nthat illegal workers cannot get employment in the United States and \nwould therefore face little choice but to return to their homelands.\n  As a point of reference, I do not support this bill's creation of a \nmassive new temporary worker program. Two weeks ago, I voted to support \nSenator Dorgan's two amendments to strike and sunset that program, and \nI find it regrettable that the Senate did not adopt those amendments.\n  We have seen a good bit of analysis on the Senate floor in recent \ndays to the effect that the temporary worker program will be largely \nunworkable. To the extent that it would work, it would create a wage-\nbased underclass and a bureaucratic nightmare. Furthermore, as I stated \non the floor 2 weeks ago, I believe that guest worker programs--aside \nfrom purely temporary, seasonal work--drive down the wages of hard-\nworking Americans and of those who came here by following the law.\n  With those points in mind, I now turn to my amendment, which regards \nthe other major component of this bill--the legalization program.\n\n[[Page S7111]]\n\n  My amendment reflects a proposal that I have been discussing with \nVirginians ever since I began my campaign for the Senate. I have always \nsupported tough border security and cracking down on large employers \nwho hire illegal workers. I also have always supported a path to \nlegalization for those who came here during a time of extremely lax \nimmigration laws but who have laid down strong roots in their \ncommunities. I do not, however, favor this path to citizenship for all \nundocumented persons.\n  Under the provisions of the immigration bill we are debating, \nvirtually all undocumented persons currently living in the United \nStates would be eligible to legalize their status and ultimately become \nU.S. citizens. Estimates are that this number totals 12 million to 20 \nmillion people. This is legislative overkill. It is one of the reasons \nthat this bill has aroused the passions of ordinary Americans who have \nno opposition to reasonable immigration policies but who see this as an \nissue that goes against the grain of basic fairness, which is the very \nfoundation of our society.\n  By contrast, my amendment would allow a smaller percentage of \nundocumented persons to remain in the United States and legalize their \nstatus, based on the depth of a person's roots in their community.\n  Under my proposal, undocumented persons who have lived in the United \nStates at least 4 years prior to enactment of the bill could apply to \nlegalize their status. I note that this 4-year period is even more \ngenerous than the 5-year threshold that was contained in several bills \nin the past few Congresses--bills that were supported by Senators from \nboth parties and by immigrants' rights groups.\n  After receiving the application, the Department of Homeland Security \nwould evaluate a list of objective, measurable criteria to determine \nwhether the applicant should receive a Z visa and thus be allowed to \nget on the path to citizenship.\n  The statutory criteria to be considered would be work history, \npayment of Federal or State income taxes, property ownership and \nbusiness ownership in the United States, knowledge of English, \nattendance at U.S. schools, immediate family members in the United \nStates, whether the applicant has a criminal record, and whether the \napplicant wants to become a U.S. citizen.\n  Like the underlying bill, applicants would be given probationary \nstatus while the DHS considers their Z visa application and could \nlawfully work during this probationary status period.\n  I believe these provisions are fair to our immigrant population and \nalso that they will help us avoid the mistakes this Congress made in \n1986 with the Simpson-Mazzoli amnesty bill, which resulted in a tidal \nwave of illegal immigration.\n  My amendment would also make the underlying bill more practical.\n  It strikes the bill's unrealistic ``touchback'' requirement. Few \nimmigrants would have the money or the ability to return to their home \ncountries on other continents. Most of these persons would lose their \nU.S. jobs, leaving their families in turmoil and placing further strain \non our communities. Basic fairness dictates that these persons be \nallowed to apply for a green card from within the United States.\n  I believe that my amendment sets forth an equitable system that not \nonly recognizes the contributions of immigrants to our society but also \nintroduces practical measures that will help us avoid the same mistakes \nour country made in 1986 with the Simpson-Mazzoli amnesty bill.\n  I have heard loud and clear from Virginians, and I have talked with \npeople on all sides of this issue. What I hear over and over again is \nthat Congress should find a fair system that both protects American \nworkers and respects the rule of law. This amendment represents the \nfairest method I know to do so and to do so realistically.\n  I ask you all to support amendment No. 1313 when it comes for a vote \nin the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield as a point of interest?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think I have 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am trying to get some information to the Senators who \nwill follow along. Does the Senator plan to use the remainder of his \ntime? I am not trying to hurry him; it is only for information \npurposes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I agree it is a good idea to try to give \nour colleagues notice as to when a vote will occur. I am happy to agree \nwe can have the vote at 11:45. I probably will not use all of my time, \nbut it depends on how wound up I get.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Why don't we sort of move along but indicate to our \ncolleagues that we are reaching a conclusion and we expect votes fairly \nsoon. Then we will have follow-on amendments with Senator DeMint and, \nhopefully, Senator Bingaman. If we can work those out in the next 20 \nminutes or so, we can get stacked votes; otherwise, we plan to have \nthese two votes reasonably soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the information of Senators, the vote will \noccur at approximately 11:55 if some time is not yielded back.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we have a number of speakers who have \ncommented. I appreciate the wise comments of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, and I am not talking about the part where he was \ncomplimentary of me; I am talking about his comments on the process and \nthe difficulty, since this bill came to the floor without going through \ncommittee, of providing an adequate opportunity for debate and \namendments. We have all tried to work our way through this.\n  I do concur it is a terrible mistake in judgment to seek to close off \ndebate on this bill before an adequate opportunity for votes occurs. We \nhave had, by my count--and I could be off one or two--nine rollcall \nvotes on this bill. By way of comparison, when the McCain-Kennedy bill, \nwhich later became the Hagel-Martinez bill, was on the floor last year, \nwe had 32 rollcall votes, I believe. We need to have an adequate \nopportunity to flesh this out. As we have seen here, some of these \ndetails get very technical, but they have a profound consequence in \nterms of the outcome.\n  Let me speak to some of the specific items that have been raised \nhere. As we pointed out, first, there will be a vote on the Kennedy \namendment, and then there will be a vote on the Cornyn amendment. With \nall due respect, I call the first one a watered-down version of the \nsecond one. I will point out the differences now, in part.\n  The Kennedy amendment would still allow waivers to allow members of \ngangs to become legalized under the provisions of this bill. The \nKennedy bill would still allow sex offenders to not be barred if they \nwere sentenced to less than 6 months. The Kennedy bill would still \nallow waivers for firearms offenses; that is, allow people who have \nbeen convicted of firearms offenses to get a waiver and to be allowed \nlegal status.\n  My amendment covers those who are associated with terrorist \norganizations. Those innocents referred to under the material support \nprovisions are covered by a waiver executed by the Department of State \nand Department of Homeland Security.\n  As we can see, this gets exceedingly technical. Let me focus on sex \noffenders, by way of example, to point out why these differences are \nimportant. My amendment would bar those who have failed to register as \nsex offenders from becoming eligible for a Z visa and legal permanent \nresidency status and a path to American citizenship. We have spoken in \nCongress on this issue through such legislation as the Adam Walsh Act. \nWe have made it clear we will monitor and lock up those sex offenders \nwho don't follow the rules and bar sex offenders from bringing \nindividuals into the country whom they may also harm.\n  Yet the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, would still give those sex offenders \nwho fail to register a loophole to exploit if they can plea bargain \ntheir case to less than 6\n\n[[Page S7112]]\n\nmonths. The maximum penalty for the underlying offense is no more than \n1 year. All of us who have had experience in the legal system, \nparticularly with the criminal law system, understand plea bargains are \na way of life and it may well be a very serious sex offender will have \nplea bargained an indictment against him or her to less than 6 months, \nand still be allowed entry into the United States under the Kennedy \namendment.\n  Here is what the Kennedy amendment does. On page 20 of the amendment, \nit modifies the exceptions to the criminal bars admissibility by adding \nfailure to register as a sex offender and firearm offenses to the list \nof offenses excepted from the criminal bars to accessibility.\n  Why would we allow this loophole? We just got this amendment last \nnight, of course. We have not been able to survey the sex offender \nregistry laws of all 50 States. We know there is at least one State--\nNew York--where first-time failure to register a conviction is a class \nA misdemeanor, punishable by up to 1 year.\n  My simple question is: Why would we want to employ a loophole for sex \noffenders and allow them to gain the benefits under this bill by being \neligible for a Z visa, with a path to legal permanent residency, \npotentially, and American citizenship?\n  My amendment makes clear--unlike the Kennedy amendment--that all \nthese loopholes are closed and this is not possible. I cannot imagine \nthat the American people would feel, among the many other people who \nare arguably worthy of gaining benefits under this bill, we would want \nto demean what we are doing here by providing these benefits to people \nwho so clearly have shown themselves unworthy of getting those \nbenefits.\n  I will point out that I know we have had a big debate in this country \nand in the Senate about what constitutes amnesty. I think the problem \nis the American people--many of them--don't feel we are serious about \nrestoring the rule of law when it comes to our broken immigration \nsystem. I don't mean for a minute to impugn the good faith of Senators \nwho have labored long and hard to try to bring this bill to the floor, \nand those of us who are trying to improve it, to make it better. But by \nway of example, these are the sorts of offenses that ordinarily would \nbe punishable under our laws but which are completely ignored when it \ncomes to applicants for a Z visa--and that is the 12 million or so who \nare here--who have committed these acts.\n  Anyone who has entered the country without being inspected or \nadmitted; that is, who came across the border before January 1, 2007, \nthis bill would make eligible for a Z visa.\n  Any alien who failed to show up for his or her removal proceeding \nwithout just cause would be eligible for legal status under this bill.\n  Any alien; that is, any noncitizen, who, through fraud or willful \nmisrepresentation, got a visa or other document or admitted to the \nUnited States would be eligible for a Z visa.\n  Any individual who makes a false claim to U.S. citizenship--this is \nan independent offense against our criminal laws--would be eligible for \na Z visa.\n  Any noncitizen who was a stowaway who made their way into the United \nStates, anyone who is the subject of a civil penalty for document fraud \nwould be eligible under this bill for legalization and a Z visa.\n  Any alien who, when trying to enter the country, did not have the \nproper documents, visa, passport, border-crossing card, et cetera; any \nalien who remained unlawfully in the United States for less than a \nyear, left the United States before removal, and then tried to reenter \nin a 3-year period would be eligible for a Z visa under this bill, or \nwas in the United States unlawfully continuously for more than a year, \nthen tried to reenter the United States within 10 years after leaving \nor being removed from the United States. It gets a little convoluted, \nbut that person would be eligible for a Z visa or legalization and \npotentially a path to legal permanent residency and American \ncitizenship.\n  Under this bill, any alien who, after previously violating \nimmigration laws, for example, crossed the border multiple times and \nremained unlawfully in the United States for an aggregate of a year or \nmore under this bill would be eligible for legalization under a Z visa, \npotentially eligible for legal permanent residency and American \ncitizenship.\n  Any alien who came with another alien who is not admissible to the \nUnited States who is certified as helpless due to sickness, disease, \nand disability and requires the protection or guardianship of an alien. \nThat is one more example of the kind of offenses which ordinarily we \nwould punish under our laws which are waived and not considered when it \ncomes to eligibility of the Z visa.\n  I don't think it is particularly productive on the floor of the \nSenate to talk about what is amnesty and what is not, but let me talk \nabout the more basic consideration and one reason I think my \nconstituents in Texas have expressed such strong concerns about it. It \nis really exemplified in the debate we are having on the Cornyn and \nKennedy amendments. Are we serious about restoring respect for the law \nor are we going to simply turn a blind eye to violations in the future?\n  What we are being told by the proponents of this bill--and I believe \nthey in good faith believe this, but it is unfortunate that the bill \nlanguage itself does not appear to bear out that optimism and hope when \nit comes to the enforceability--is that this is, as in 1986, the last \ntime we are going to do this. If we deal with the 12 million people who \nhave come into the country without a visa or who have entered legally \nand who have overstayed their visa, if we give them an opportunity to \nget a Z visa, this is it, last time, it will never happen again. That \nsounds ominously similar to what the American people were told in 1986 \nwhen there were 3 million people in that category. Now we have 12 \nmillion in that category.\n  So the question people have, logically--these are not racists, these \nare not bigots, they are not nativists, they are not anti-immigrants; \nthese are American citizens who are concerned about their country and \nabout being a country that respects the rule of law--they want to know: \nIs this going to work? Will it be enforced? Are we serious about \nrestoring the rule of law to our country?\n  I have to say that the sort of fine and requirement that is being \nrequired with the Z visa is looked at with great skepticism. Last week, \nI had a constituent who said: Well, Senator, are you telling me that we \nare going to allow people who have not respected our immigration laws \nto pay $5,000, in effect, to buy legal status and then potentially \napply for legal permanent residency and then become an American \ncitizen? Who wouldn't go for that kind of deal? That caused me a lot of \nconcern because I, frankly, had not thought about it in those terms.\n  But what causes me even greater concern is the concept that is \nmissing from this legislation that is so important; that is, when it \ncomes to our laws, we believe in the role of deterrence. In other \nwords, when we provide a penalty to somebody for violating the law, one \nof the considerations is, will it deter people from acting in a similar \ncapacity in the future?\n  I am afraid, when I look at this legislation, it completely omits any \nconsideration of what will deter people from violating our immigration \nlaws in the future. In fact, I am afraid what happens, as pointed out \nby my constituent, is that it is really viewed as an incentive. If all \nyou have to do is to get into the country any way you can and then wait \nfor the next bill to pass Congress which will allow you to pay a fine \nand then become legally here and on a path to legal permanent residency \nand citizenship, that is no deterrent. That is a powerful magnet which \nwill continue to attract people to our country.\n  I say this not in any spirit except to say we have to find a way to \nfix this. I have been one who wants to try to fix this legislation. The \namendments I have offered are in that spirit. But I have to say that we \nare going to continue to be viewed as nonserious about workability, \nabout enforcement, about restoring respect for the rule of law unless \nwe vote to exclude those who have shown nothing but defiance for our \nlaws by absconding, by going underground even after having their day in \ncourt and refusing an order of deportation, or those who have been \ndeported following a day in court, following all the rights our country \nprovides for judicial review and administrative review and who simply \nleft to only reenter again illegally.\n\n[[Page S7113]]\n\n  As I mentioned at the outset, the Immigration and Naturalization Act \nmakes both those categories of individuals felons--felons. This is not \na misdemeanor. This is not an inadvertency. These are not people, \nfrankly, who are entitled to the generosity of the American people when \nit comes to dealing with their legal status. These are people who \nshowed they have nothing but contempt for our laws, for restoring the \nrule of law, and I just cannot imagine why any Member of the Senate \nwould vote to give these individuals a path to legal residence and a \npath to potentially American citizenship.\n\n  If we are going to regain that lost credibility--and I think this is \nreally where the rubber meets the road because, frankly, people across \nthis country don't really believe we are serious about making this \nwork. They are used to a history of being overpromised and undersold \nwhen it comes to fixing our broken immigration system. But I believe \nthere is going to be a high price to pay for those of us who are still \naround in the coming years if, in fact, we pass this law knowing that \nit has these huge, gaping loopholes that excuse unlawful conduct, which \nis basically thumbing their noses at the rule of law. If we are not \nserious about making sure people who go through background checks are \nactually not criminals or terrorists, if we are not serious about \nmaking this work, there is going to be a high price to pay for those \nwho support this legislation only in the coming years to find that it \nwas another scam pulled on the American people.\n  That is why it is so absolutely critical that we continue this \ndebate, and I implore the majority leader to allow us to continue the \ndebate, to allow us to have amendments offered. I understand and we all \nunderstand in this country that you win some and you lose some, \nmajorities rule, but that is what we ought to be doing on this bill to \nmake it as good as we possibly can to try to regain the respect and the \ntrust of the American people because, frankly, we don't have it now. \nThat is the reason for the outcry we have heard in my State and around \nthe country when it comes to this legislation.\n  We can fix it. I am an optimist, but we cannot fix it if there is not \nan opportunity for a full and fair debate and if the majority leader is \ndetermined to cut off the opportunity to provide votes on amendments \nand is going to insist on ``my way or the highway''; in other words, \nyou are either going to have to agree to not let your amendments be \nheard and to let this bill go to a final vote or the majority leader is \ngoing to pull it down and deny us the opportunity to fix this problem.\n  I don't know anyone in the Senate who doesn't want to fix this \nproblem. It is enormously complicated because this problem has festered \nfor 20 years or more without a solution. That is no excuse for not \ntrying, and that is why I have tried, along with my colleagues, to come \nup with an acceptable solution. I would say 90 percent of it we agree \nwith. There is no light separating us. It is in the 10 percent we \ntalked about that is the subject of important amendments which need to \nbe heard and voted on where we can regain that trust.\n  Let me say in conclusion--and I may reserve a little bit of time--let \nme say before I sit down, Mr. President, that a ``no'' vote on the \nCornyn amendment and a ``yes'' vote on the Kennedy amendment will, in \nessence, could retitle this section of this bill ``No Felon Left \nBehind'' because while we have excluded many categories of felons, we \nhave, for some reason, left this big, gaping hole when it comes to \nthose who show nothing but contempt for our laws. We need to fix this \nbill, we need to make it better, not make it worse, and we have an \nuphill climb to regain credibility of the American people to show we \nare serious and we want to restore our reputation as a nation that \nbelieves in the rule of law. A ``no'' vote on the Cornyn amendment will \ndo nothing to help it; indeed, I think it will confirm the worst \nsuspicions of the American people--that we really are not serious about \nfixing this problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor but reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator's \npresentation. I have come to a different conclusion. The Senator said a \n``no'' vote means we are really not for dealing with this issue. We \nhave a bipartisan group that has worked long and hard. The Senator from \nTexas was involved in a lot of the discussions. As we pointed out \npreviously, we wanted to have tough law enforcement internally. We \nwanted recognition that those 12.5 million people here were going to be \nable to be secure, they weren't going to be deported, they were going \nto go to the end of the line, they would have to go through the earned \nlegalization program, bring families together again, set up a program \nin terms of a temporary worker program. I don't know what 90 percent \nthe Senator agrees with because I haven't heard much.\n  What is important is what his amendment does and what its impact \nwould be.\n  We ought to come back at the conclusion of this debate to the point \nthat was raised at the beginning because after all the rhetoric, after \nall is said and done, listen to the example that was given by my friend \nfrom Illinois.\n  Senator Durbin describes a mother of four U.S. citizens, married to a \nU.S. citizen, who is herself undocumented. She left the country to \nvisit her sick mother. She was apprehended after she snuck back in. \nThat means she has reentered the United States at least twice, and \nunder the Cornyn amendment on page 2, she could be convicted of illegal \nreentry. That would make her an aggregated felon. Even if she is not \nconvicted, the Cornyn amendment makes her ineligible for the Z program.\n  On page 10 of the amendment, he eliminates the waiver for final \norders available in the bill. This is a waiver for hardship to family, \nand he eliminates it. No harm, the Senator says, because she can get a \ndifferent waiver as the wife of a U.S. citizen. That didn't stop DHS \nfrom deporting her.\n  So why should people come out of the shadows? Why should they come \nout of the shadows if they are here with false papers, undocumented? \nWhy should they come out of the shadows when they have seen what has \nhappened to a mother of four citizens married to an American \ncitizen? That is what we are basically talking about. That is \nundermining the basic core because we are talking about 12\\1/2\\ million \npeople who are here, who came here to work in order to provide for \ntheir families, and they have been trying to do that for their \nfamilies. More often than not, they probably went back to their \ncountries of origin and came back in again. Probably more often than \nnot they had false papers in order to be able to get their jobs. That \nin and of itself, under the Cornyn amendment, would effectively exclude \nthem from participating in this program and would subject them to \ndeportation. End of story. End of story because that undermines, \nobviously, the essential aspect of this legislation.\n\n  The rest of the Cornyn amendment--which I mentioned earlier with the \nlist of the amendments that we have put through--covers the bars, the \ncriminal gang members, including the new provisions of gang members \nengaged in gun crimes. Sex offenders are covered by the comprehensive \nAdam Walsh Act. The sex offenders are not going to get Z visas.\n  The Senator from Texas can say, under our language, under his \ninterpretation, they will, but they would not. End of story. They would \nnot.\n  On the provisions regarding drunk-driving convictions and individuals \nconvicted of domestic violence, stalking, child abuse, and other \nserious crimes, we increase the penalties for perjury, fraud, and \nfirearm offenses.\n  It is important that after all is said and done--and we gave the \nillustration earlier about the questions of material support--the \nterrorists are out.\n  One thing about managing a bill, for those of us who have been here, \nwe understand it; that there is always the possibility and the \nlikelihood people will misrepresent what is in the bill and then differ \nwith it. It is an old technique. I have even used it myself. But we \nought to understand when we see it that it is just a technique that is \nbeing used.\n\n[[Page S7114]]\n\n  So with all respect to my friend and colleague, and I have a good \ndeal of respect for him, the effect of the underlying Cornyn amendment \nwould effectively exclude from the Z visa program any immigrant who had \nbeen or will be convicted of using false documents. That is the problem \ntoday. Because of our broken immigration system, almost every hard-\nworking immigrant in the country has been forced at one time or another \nto use false documents to get a job. These people have come here to \nwork. They have been lured by the employers offering work. They are the \nvery people this program is designed to bring out of the shadows. The \nCornyn amendment will ensure they cannot come forward. Indeed, if they \ndid come forward, they could be subject to prosecution and mandatory \ndeportation for using a fake Social Security card.\n  I believe we have addressed many of the concerns the Members have had \non dealing with some of these other issues and questions with the \nKennedy amendment, and I would hope the Members would vote in favor of \nthat and against the Cornyn amendment.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. May I inquire how much time remains on my side, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, let me assure my colleague, Senator \nKennedy, that only those who have actually been convicted of document \nfraud would be excluded under my amendment.\n  According to recent statistics, roughly 10 million Americans fell \nvictim to identity theft last year, at an estimated cost of $50 billion \nto U.S. taxpayers, and victims spent an average of $1,500 and 175 hours \nto actually recover their good name and their good credit after \nidentity theft. This is not a trivial matter, and it is only people who \nhave actually been convicted, not those who have presented false \ndocuments to work in the country who have not been convicted.\n  As far as the woman with four American children and married to an \nAmerican spouse, my amendment does not touch her rights under current \nlaw. For example, we don't touch current law waivers for consent to \nreapply for admission. We don't touch the Secretary's ability to grant \nhumanitarian parole. And we don't touch the waivers under current law \nthat cover an immigrant who is the spouse of a U.S. citizen.\n  I thought Mr. Durbin, the Senator from Illinois, was satisfied with \nthat answer earlier, but I point that out to my colleagues just so they \ncan be satisfied that there are exceptions for extraordinary \ncircumstances.\n  What this amendment does is it broadly says felons will not be given \nthe benefits of legalization and a path to American citizenship. They \nhave had their chance, they blew their chance, and they have shown \nthemselves unworthy of the trust and confidence of the American people \nwhen it comes to living among us in compliance with our laws and \nrespecting the fact that, yes, we are a nation of immigrants, and \nproudly so, but we are also a nation of laws. Those laws keep us safe, \nthey keep us secure, and they assure our prosperity, and the prosperity \nof generations yet to come. We cannot, once again, turn a blind eye to \nthe laws that protect all of us, including those immigrants who have \ncome here to become part of our great country and to seek opportunity \nfor their future.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the Cornyn amendment, that they \nwill vote against the Kennedy amendment as a dilution and watered-down \nfigleaf of the Cornyn amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with regard to Senator Durbin, he could \ncome back and speak to this issue, this was a mother of four U.S. \ncitizens, herself undocumented, who left the country to visit her sick \nmother and was apprehended after she snuck back in. She had entered and \nreentered the U.S. twice. She had false documents, and she has been \neffectively deported.\n  The Senator says, well, she had rights to appeal, rights to do this \nand to do that. This is the real impact. This is the real impact of the \nCornyn amendment. This is what the Cornyn amendment is all about. We \nknow the people who have come in here. Why do they come in here? They \ncome to work. Why do they come to work? Because the job is there. They \nare devoted to their families, devoted to their work and faith, in many \ninstances devoted to this country--with 70,000 of them working in the \nArmed Forces of the United States. But in order to be able to do that, \nsomewhere along the way they get the false papers. That is what the \nfacts are. The great majority have them.\n  Under the Cornyn amendment, it says those individuals are subject to \ndeportation. He thinks all 12\\1/2\\ million people are all going to \nvolunteer and come out and say, well, by the way, Senator Cornyn gave \nus assurance that somebody down there in DHS can give me a waiver and \nlet me stay. Come on. Come on. We believe that? That is going to be \nsufficient assurance to get these people to come out of the shadows so \nthat they are not going to continue to be exploited? I don't believe \nthat.\n  I have a lot of respect for my friend. I know what he is attempting \nto do in order to deal with some of these other issues, and we have \nattempted to address that. But the fact remains his amendment \nundermines the basic core of this--recognizing that people here are \nundocumented, and the ones who are undocumented, by and large, have \nthese false papers. That is a part of the reality.\n  The question is: Are we going to say to those individuals: Look, you \ncame here and are undocumented. You are going to pay a fine, and you \nare going to have to demonstrate that you are going to work, and you \nare going to show that you are going to be a good citizen. And in 8 \nyears, after all the other people who have been waiting in line, after \nall of that period, when you are able to pay the fine, demonstrate that \nyou have worked all that time, and have been a good citizen trying to \nmake a difference in terms of going into the country, that then you \nwill be able to at least start--start--on the potential road to \ncitizenship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, does the Senator desire the yeas and \nnays?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to consider the yeas and nays on both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request for the yeas \nand nays on both amendments?\n  The chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Is there sufficient second on both amendments?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are \nordered on both amendments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: There are going to \nbe two back-to-back votes. The first one will be on the Kennedy \namendment and the second one is on the Cornyn amendment; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Kennedy amendment is the first vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And the second vote is the Cornyn amendment. I thank the \nChair.\n  To continue, Mr. President, it is our hope that we will move toward \nthe DeMint amendment. We had good debate on that yesterday, and the \nBingaman amendment, and then have votes on those fairly soon after. I \nthank all our Members for their cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1333, as modified, offered by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 1184 offered by the \nSenator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would ask my colleagues for a ``yea'' \nvote on this amendment. If you voted for the Kennedy amendment, you \nmade an incremental improvement over the current law when it comes to \nbanning criminals from getting the benefit of our immigration system. \nBut in order to exclude felons, people who have shown their contempt \nand defiance of American law, and unless it is your intent to reward \nfelons who have shown their contempt for the American legal system, to \nreward them with the most precious gift this country can offer, which \nis legal status, potentially legal permanent residency and a path to \ncitizenship, you should vote yes on this amendment. I would urge my \ncolleagues to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, make no mistake about it, with many good \nintentions which were covered in the Kennedy amendment, this guts the \nbill because it not only eliminates--it not only says that felons \nshould not become citizens, and we agree with that, it says that anyone \nwho has filed an illegal paper should not become a citizen. That is \nevery immigrant who would be on the path to citizenship. This body \nvoted against eliminating that provision overtly a few weeks ago. Now \nthey are trying to do the same thing covertly because if you vote for \nthis amendment, you will say no one will have a path to citizenship, no \none who works, because everyone who has worked had to file a Social \nSecurity paper or something like that.\n  Anyone who wants to keep this bill going at the moment should vote \nagainst the Cornyn amendment. The Kennedy amendment dealt with felons. \nThis is a stealth, Trojan horse amendment to kill the bill by saying no \none--no one--who has ever worked shall have the path to citizenship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, with all due respect, the Senator should \nread the amendment. It does not affect people who have committed \nidentity theft unless they have actually been convicted of that. It \nwould have no effect on people who have entered without a visa or who \nhave come in on a legal visa and overstayed. This is no gutting of the \nbill; it is only to protect the American people from felons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n2 p.m. today be for debate prior to a vote in relation to the following \namendments; that the time until then be equally divided and controlled \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, with the time to run \nconcurrently; that no amendments be in order to any of the amendments \ncovered in this agreement; that at 2 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote \nin relation to the amendments in the order listed; that there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote, with the vote \nafter the first being 10 minutes in duration, with no amendments in \norder to the amendments prior to the vote: DeMint No. 1197, Bingaman \nNo. 1267, as modified.\n  I designate Senator Kennedy to have my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are making some good progress. The \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint, had a good discussion last \nevening, as well as Senator Bingaman. We are grateful to them. We will \nhave a good discussion prior to 2 o'clock on these issues.\n  We are hopeful, then, we will be moving along. Senator Cornyn had an \namendment on confidentiality. We have Senator Dodd. There are a number \nof those where we are trying to go back one side to the other. We hope \nthose Senators who have amendments who are ready, particularly those \nwho would like to enter into a time agreement, will let us know as \nquickly as possible. We will be in touch with others during this \nluncheon period and continue to move along. But we are thankful for all \nthe help and cooperation we have received.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, staff has been working hard to set up votes \non the amendments that have been called up. We ran into a little \nproblem; that is, we had too many Democratic amendments. But we think \nat this stage they are now working on setting up side by side, in some \ninstances, Republican amendments. We need to clear\n\n[[Page S7116]]\n\noff the amendments that have been called up.\n  Now, as I have just indicated, if we have offsets for the Democratic \namendments, we will go ahead and allow those to be called up or have \nside-by-sides. Once we get this done, I have been assured by both \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Kyl and others that we can have a list of \namendments people need a vote on--not they want a vote on but need a \nvote on. We hope both cloakrooms have hotlined this and Senators are \nworking on a personal basis with individual Senators.\n  Hopefully, we can get, by the 2 o'clock time, permission to do away \nwith--I should not say ``do away with''--to dispose of the amendments \nthat have been called up. Then, hopefully, we can shortly thereafter \nfind out what amendments people wish to have votes on. If we can do \nthat, it would really move this ball down the court a long ways.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  As I understand, 1 o'clock today is the deadline for the filing of \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. A number of Senators have spoken to me about having \ntheir amendments filed. Many of them I have given the insurances that \nwe would. The Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, had asked that 2 days \nago, and we are working with the Finance Committee. I see her in the \nChamber. I think Senator Thune was here last evening. I objected to \nthose individuals proceeding. It would appear to me, out of fairness we \nought to make sure they are not excluded. Is our policy to make sure \nthey are at least within--if they have indicated to the floor managers, \nthey want to be in, we have them meet the deadline?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, all first-degree amendments would have to be \nfiled by 1 o'clock. As we have indicated, we are going to try to be \nfair to everybody. If there are amendments that have been up at the \ndesk, we will certainly do our best to get to those. I think what we \nneed to do is find out, as I have indicated, what needs to be voted on. \nSome Senators on our side, for example, have been contacted this \nmorning, and they have decided not to offer amendments. The same will \nhappen over there. If people have been waiting around and feel \naggrieved they have not been allowed to offer their amendments, of \ncourse, we will consider that. But I do not think we need to do \nanything right now as far as a unanimous consent request in that \nregard.\n  We will do everything we can--everybody is working in good faith--to \nhave people feel they have the opportunity to offer their amendments. I \nknow the Senator from Texas--she is gone--she just walked in. I do not \nknow what her amendment is about. I think it is Social Security. I am \nnot too certain. She has been around here a lot. She is entitled, if \nfor no other reason than having the endurance to hang around as long as \nshe has, to have her amendment offered. We will work with everybody, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, to see if we can work something out to \nhave all these amendments offered and a time set to vote on them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, all they have to do is \nbe filed by this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So for those who are back in their offices, they do not \nhave to be called up. They just have to be filed. So they have until 1 \no'clock for the filing of amendments. We urge those who want to have \namendments filed to make sure they understand that. They do not have to \ncall them up. They are protected in that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed \nto speak up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nme, the Senator from Maine be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, let me add another part to that \nunanimous consent request: that the Senator from Florida be allowed to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes, following the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Chambliss are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, under the rules, the \nfiling time was set for 1 o'clock, and the leader has indicated for \nfiling any amendments that we extend that. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe filing time be extended until 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could just say this--I would say this \nmostly to the staffs: We do not need a big rush over here as to filing \namendments. It does not give anybody any benefit anyway. Just show some \ndiscretion on who has to file amendments, and then we will work our way \nthrough those and find out how we are going to dispose of them. So I \nthink this is the right thing to do. There is no magic to the next 5 \nminutes. So we will wait for the next 65 minutes. If people have \ntrouble making that deadline, let us know.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might just add a word, we thank the \nmajority leader and the Senator from Massachusetts for extending the \ntime. That should ease substantial pressure on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 1554 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 5 minutes \nof the remaining time be reserved for Senator DeMint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1267\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to first speak on behalf of an \namendment I offered with Senator Obama. It is one of the two amendments \nthat will be voted on in the sequence at 2 o'clock. The amendment is \naimed at addressing what I believe is a very shortsighted provision in \nthis draft immigration bill.\n  My amendment applies only to this new guest worker program we are \ncreating under the bill, the so-called Y-1 program. It doesn't impact \nthe Y-2 program, which is the seasonal and nonagricultural program that \nis based on the existing H-2B program, or the H-2A program, which is \nthe agricultural temporary worker program.\n  Under this immigration bill as it now stands, Y-1 workers--guest \nworkers, which is how we refer to them--would be able to work in the \nUnited States for three 2-year work periods. But before they could \nrenew their visas for the second and the third of those 2-year work \nperiods, they would have to leave the country for at least a year. This \nis the so-called 2-1-2-1-2 provision. Work for 2 years, leave for 1 \nyear, work for 2 years, leave for 1 year, work for 2 years, and then \nleave for good. The total number of work years in the United States \nwould be limited to 6 years, but the work pattern would be interrupted \ntwice each time by a 1-year absence requirement.\n  The amendment I have offered, and that we will be voting on in a few \nminutes, simply removes the requirement these guest workers leave the \ncountry before they renew their visas. It would leave in place the term \nof the visa, which is 2 years, and it would not alter the 6-year total \nwork limit that is provided for in the bill. In addition, it would \nmodify the requirement that Y-1 workers meet all of the relevant \nrequirements under the program each time they apply to renew their \nvisas.\n  Over the last 2 days, I have come to the floor to discuss this \nprovision a couple of times. I strongly believe it does not make any \nsense from a policy standpoint and, ultimately, we are going to be \njudged by how much sense this legislation makes. As I have pointed out, \nthis provision is bad for employers; it harms American workers; it will \nbe difficult and costly to implement; and it will likely encourage \nthese workers, whom we are bringing here as so-called guest workers, to \noverstay their visas.\n  For these reasons, my amendment has the broad support of labor \ngroups, such as the Service Employees International Union; business \norganizations, such as the National Association of Home Builders and \nthe Associated Builders and Contractors; and immigration and religious \ngroups, such as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the American \nAssociation of Immigration Lawyers, and the National Immigration Forum. \nThe coalition of organizations supporting this amendment is indicative \nof how harmful the 1-year absence requirement would be from a variety \nof different perspectives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the following \nmaterial be printed in the Record: the statement that was issued by the \nU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, a letter by the Associated \nBuilders and Contractors Organization, a letter by the National \nAssociation of Home Builders, and a statement by the SEIU, the Service \nEmployees International Union.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, with regard to the employer, it would be \nextremely costly to require businesses to retrain and rehire new \nworkers every 2 years. No employer I am aware of would think it \nsatisfactory for an employee to take a 1-year so-called break every \ncouple of years. Each of us in the Senate employs people in our \noffices, here in the Capitol and our home States. This would be an \nunacceptable condition for us, and I am sure it would be for any \nemployer. Businesses would have to hire other workers to take over for \nthe leaving guest worker, would have to invest time and money in \nretraining additional staff. This would be extremely burdensome, \nparticularly on small businesses.\n  From an economic standpoint, I believe it generally does not make \nsense\n\n[[Page S7118]]\n\nto enact laws that cause instability in the workforce and create \nrequirements that unnecessarily impose significant costs on our small \nbusinesses. I am not an economist, but this does not seem to be a \nsensible way for us to do business.\n  Let me take a moment to read a portion of a letter I received from \nthe National Association of Homebuilders on this issue. The letter \nsays:\n\n       This system essentially makes the entire program in title \n     IV unworkable for the construction industry. In the \n     residential construction industry, employers spend much time \n     and resources training employees. To arbitrarily lose valued \n     employees at the end of 2 years, as they are forced to return \n     home for a full year, creates unnecessary amounts of \n     instability in our workplaces, and wastes scarce employer \n     resources.\n\n  The construction industry is not the only sector of the economy that \nwould be adversely impacted by this provision. The new guest worker \nprogram is not limited in the respect that existing temporary worker \nprograms are in terms of the work being seasonal or within certain \nindustries, such as in agriculture. These are, in fact, permanent jobs \nwe are talking about, and they are scattered throughout our economy and \nwill be affected if we leave this provision unchanged.\n  The 1-year absence requirement is also harmful to American workers. \nKicking workers out of the country every 2 years ensures that there \nwill always be guest workers who will be coming in to be paid at the \nlow end of the pay scale, and this will result in a depression of wages \nfor all workers, not just those guest workers but for the American \nworkers who are competing for those jobs as well.\n  According to a letter of support I have asked to be printed in the \nRecord that I received from the Service Employees International Union, \nthey say the following:\n\n       Employers will be less likely to invest in worker training \n     or other benefits and wages to retain workers. . . . The 2-1-\n     2-1-2 is a recipe for wage depression, job turnover and \n     increased illegal workers.\n\n  The structure of the new guest worker program will also result in a \nsubstantial number of these workers overstaying their visas so they \ndon't have to leave the country for an extended period of time. The \nGovernment has not done a great job in the past of ensuring that \nindividuals leave the country at the expiration of their visas, and I \nhave no reason to believe--I don't think any of us have any reason to \nbelieve--that the Department of Homeland Security will be able to do a \nsubstantially better job in the near future.\n  In December of last year, after the Government Accountability Office \nissued a report regarding the US-VISIT Program, which is a mechanism by \nwhich Government is supposed to be able to track the entry and the exit \nof foreign visitors, the Department of Homeland Security scrapped its \nplans to implement the exit portion of that program for U.S. land ports \nof entry.\n  In essence, the GAO report found it could take up to 10 years to \ndevelop the technology required to fully implement the program and that \nthe cost of doing so could be in the tens of billions of dollars. There \nis nothing in the immigration bill that indicates that this capability \nis within our reach.\n  In section 130 of the bill, the Federal Government is required to \ncome up with a schedule for deploying the exit component of the US-\nVISIT system. However, we have already been told by the GAO that this \nwill not be a reality for a very long period of time.\n  In crafting this immigration bill, there has been a lot of attention \ngiven to trying to bring together individuals with a wide variety of \npolitical views. In my opinion, we have not focused enough on the \npractical aspects of how this bill is going to be implemented. \nCompromises need to be made as part of any legislative package, but we \ncannot lose sight of the need to craft legislation that makes sense \nfrom a policy standpoint and that actually can be implemented and can \nwork.\n  It is my belief the new guest worker program is currently structured \nin a manner that has more to do with the politics of getting a \ncompromise among those who drafted the legislation than it does with \nsound policy. As I have discussed, the requirement that these guest \nworkers leave every 2 years before renewing their visas is bad for \nemployers, it is harmful to American workers, it is difficult to \nenforce, and it will likely result in a larger population of \nundocumented workers in this country in the future.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and \nto help make this bill more workable and better public policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                       United States Conference of\n\n\n                                             Catholic Bishops,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2007.\n\n  U.S. Catholic Bishops Urge Senate To Support Amendments Protecting \n Asylum Seekers and Guest Workers in the Comprehensive Immigration Bill\n\n       The U.S Conference of Catholic Bishops urges Senators to \n     vote for the following amendments to S. 1348, the \n     Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007:\n       The Lieberman Safe and Secure Detention Amendment. \n     Lieberman amendment #1191 would maintain U.S. obligations to \n     international human rights by providing safe and secure \n     detention for victims of torture and persecution seeking \n     asylum protection in this country. While awaiting judgment on \n     their cases, persons claiming persecution or fear of \n     persecution in their home countries often are subjected to \n     prison-like conditions in U.S. detention facilities without \n     proper health, nutritional, physical or spiritual care. This \n     amendment makes major improvements to the U.S. detention \n     system by reinforcing the country's rich heritage and \n     tradition of assisting especially vulnerable persons.\n       The Bingaman Guest-Worker Workability Amendment. Bingaman \n     amendment #1267 would eliminate the requirement for the \n     ``years out'' for guest workers who are renewing their \n     temporary Y-visas. By requiring workers to leave the country \n     after two years, only to return one year later, the \n     underlying legislation would create a highly-bureaucratic and \n     unstable system for guest workers to come in to the country. \n     It is likely that many guest workers would overstay their \n     visas, knowing that they are to return in just a year, and \n     many government resources would likely be devoted to seeking \n     out and punishing individuals who are providing valuable and \n     much-needed work. The Bingaman amendment provides a \n     significant step toward creating a worker program that is \n     more humane, workable, and desirous for both guest workers \n     and employers alike.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                    Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc.,\n\n                                                     June 6, 2007.\n     The U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Members of the United States Senate: On behalf of \n     Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) and its more than \n     24,000 general contractors, subcontractors, material \n     suppliers and construction related firms across the United \n     States, I urge you to vote YES on an amendment (#1267) being \n     offered by Senator Bingaman and Senator Obama to S. 1348, the \n     ``Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration \n     Reform Act of 2007,'' which would remove the requirement that \n     Y-1 temporary workers leave the country before renewing their \n     visas.\n       Currently, the immigration bill allows Y-1 guest workers to \n     work in the U.S. for 2-year periods (up to 6 years). However, \n     it requires the workers to leave the U.S. for at least 1 year \n     before renewing their visas. Requiring these workers to leave \n     the country for a lengthy period of time between each work \n     period is harmful for employers; extremely difficult and \n     costly to enforce; harms American workers; and increases the \n     likelihood that individuals will overstay their visas. \n     Moreover, the construction industry, more so than many other \n     industries, relies on highly trained workers to fill their \n     labor force. Having a temporary worker on the job for only a \n     two year time frame makes the current Y-1 visa program \n     outlined in S. 1348 virtually useless for our industry. This \n     is due to the fact that in most cases it takes two to four \n     years to properly train workers in the construction industry.\n       The Bingaman/Obama amendment (#1267) would allow Y-1 \n     temporary workers to stay in the United States for the entire \n     duration of their work visa. This would give ample time for \n     the employee to become fully trained in the construction \n     industry and it would make the new Y-1 temporary visa \n     beneficial to our ever expanding industry. It is imperative \n     that America's construction industry be allowed the time \n     needed to properly train their employees so that accidents on \n     jobsites can be avoided at all costs.\n       ABC supports the Bingaman/Obama amendment (#1267) that \n     would remove the mandatory requirement that Y-1 temporary \n     workers leave the country before renewing their visa and ask \n     you to vote ``YES'' on this important amendment.\n           Respectfully Submitted,\n                                               William B.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: On \n     behalf of the 235,000 member firms of the National \n     Association of Home Builders (NAHB), we urge\n\n[[Page S7119]]\n\n     you (NAHB), we urge you to vote in support of the amendment \n     being offered by Senators Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and Barack \n     Obama (D-IL), AMDT 1267, that would eliminate the mandatory \n     one year cooling off periods in the proposed 2-1-2-1-2 future \n     flow (``temporary worker'') program contained in Title IV of \n     S. 1348, the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity, and \n     Immigration Reform Act of 2007. Because of the importance of \n     this issue to our members, and the overall workability of \n     comprehensive immigration reform, NAHB will be key voting in \n     support of this amendment.\n       The future flow program in Title IV of S. 1348 will create \n     a legal process by which immigrants can enter the United \n     States in future years to work in industries that have \n     established labor shortages. Under the current proposed \n     legislation, the bill would require a worker to return to \n     their home country for a full year every two years. This \n     system essentially makes the entire program in Title IV \n     unworkable for the construction industry. In the residential \n     construction industry, employers spend much time and \n     resources training employees. To arbitrarily lose valued \n     employees at the end of two years, as they are forced to \n     return home for a full year, creates unnecessary amounts of \n     instability in our workplaces, and wastes scarce employer \n     resources.\n       The Bingaman/Obama amendment will eliminate the mandatory \n     one-year ``cooling off'' periods in the current bill, and \n     replace it with a two-year visa, that can be renewed two \n     additional times for a total of six years--equal to the six \n     years that are ultimately allowed under the program in S. \n     1348 now. Removing the cooling off periods will create a much \n     more usable program for employers, and we urge you to support \n     this effort to improve the bill.\n       NAHB believes that a workable future flow immigrant program \n     is essential to comprehensive immigration reform because \n     without it, it is likely to lead to a situation that will \n     encourage more illegal immigration in the future.\n       Again, NAHB will be key voting in support of the vote on \n     the Bingaman/Obama amendment, AMDT 1267.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Joseph M. Stanton,\n     Chief Lobbyist.\n                                  ____\n\n       SEIU strongly support the removal of the requirement that \n     Y-1 temporary workers leave the U.S. for at least 1 year \n     before renewing their visas. While we are willing to accept a \n     temporary worker program in exchange for legalization of the \n     12 million undocumented living among us, we are very \n     disappointed with the guest worker program contained in the \n     ``Grand Bargain''. This is why the Bingaman/Obama amendment \n     is critical and would improve workers ability to stay \n     employed during the entire period of their Y visa. When \n     temporary workers are working in year round jobs it is more \n     difficult for all workers to raise their wages and improve \n     their working conditions. The Y-1 visa program as it is \n     currently drafted will ensure wage depression for all \n     workers, because it will ensure workers leave their jobs \n     every two years. Employers will be less likely to invest in \n     worker training or offer benefits and wages to retain \n     workers. Removing the 1 year return requirement will help all \n     workers raise the wages, gain job experience and receive \n     valuable training to improve the job skills. The 2-1-2-1-1 is \n     a recipe for wage depression, job turnover and increased \n     illegal workers, as history has demonstrated--guest workers \n     will overstay their visas, when they have no legal channel to \n     remain in the country.\n       We thank Senator Bingaman and Senator Obama for their \n     continued leadership on comprehensive immigration reform. \n     SEIU urges all Senators to vote for this improving amendment.\n     Alison Reardon,\n       Director of Legislation, Service Employees International \n     Union (SEIU).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico and I have \nworked on a great many matters since he was elected in 1982. If I may \nhave the attention of the Senator from New Mexico, I am about to \ncompliment him. I don't like to compliment him behind his back. The \nSenator from New Mexico and I have worked on a great many matters since \nhe was elected to the Senate in 1982. I came at about the same time \nafter the 1980 election. I am especially interested in his amendment \nand the criticism of the bill because it is the politics of compromise \nand not based on sound public policy.\n  The Senator from New Mexico and I are now working on a bill called \nthe Bingaman-Specter bill on global warming. I am pleased to hear there \nhas been no compromise in that bill that is based upon sound public \npolicy. But in a very serious way, I suggest that is what we do. This \nplace would be run a lot better if I ran it unilaterally. The Senator \nfrom New Jersey, who is presiding, smiles at that. I think more in \nhumor than in disagreement. But we have 100 Members of this body with \n200 different ideas. Each of us has two ideas on the same subject at a \nminimum. I know the Senator from New Mexico has a full plate on many \nitems. He chairs the Energy Committee. He has been working on the \nglobal warming issue. He is not on Judiciary, and he doesn't have a \nspecial concern--well, for whatever reason, he did not elect to become \npart of the group of Senators who worked on the bill, for good and \nsufficient reason. I am not suggesting he should have. He attended the \nsessions, as did the Senator from New Jersey who is presiding, and saw \nwhat we were doing. We were so compromised that people on opposite ends \nof the political spectrum left us. They wouldn't stay with us because \nwe couldn't satisfy everybody, and understandably so. We simply could \nnot satisfy everybody.\n  The question is whether we would have satisfied anybody. We will know \nwhen we move along and try to get this bill to final passage. But when \nyou take what happened to us last year--we passed a bill in the Senate, \nthey passed one in the House, and we couldn't even conference it, \nwouldn't even conference it. There are people who just want a tight \nborder and to deport 12 million undocumented immigrants. That is what \nthey want to do.\n  As we work through the compromises, I would consider it a compliment \nto be a party to the politics of compromise, and I would accept the \nterm ``politician'' with grace and appreciation. I remember hearing \nAdlai Stevenson speak in the early fifties. Perhaps it was when he \nfirst ran for President in 1952. He said: Do you know the definition of \na statesman? The definition of a statesman, Mr. President, is a dead \npolitician. That is why I much prefer being a politician, at least for \nthe moment. I much prefer being a politician.\n  On this specific amendment, we hassled about this a long time. We had \n6 years in mind. Should it be 3 and 3 or should it be 2 and back and 2 \nand back for a year and back? We finally accepted this compromise to \ntry to make the workers temporary, that they would not get roots here \nand not return to their home country; that when we are working within \nthe structure of the immigration laws, we have to accommodate the 12 \nmillion because we cannot deport them. We would like to identify those \nwho are criminals, who are not contributing, who do not have roots and \ndeport them, if we can identify them in numbers that we can handle.\n  Then there was the issue of trying hard to avoid the characterization \nof amnesty. Amnesty is a lot like Shakespeare's famous definition of a \nrose:\n\n       That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as \n     sweet.\n\n  If we could find more ways to make these 12 million people earn \ncitizenship, we would. We have the fine. Maybe it is too high, maybe it \nis too low. We have back taxes. Maybe we can find that out and maybe we \ncannot. The requirement of English I think everybody agrees with. \nHaving roots in this country, yes. Being a contributor to this country, \nyes. If we could shake the title of amnesty, we would like to do it, if \nsomebody could tell us how to do it.\n  There are many people who are so opposed to what we are trying to do, \nthey will call anything amnesty. I am not going to say it is not \namnesty--although I believe it is not amnesty because they are earning \ntheir way--because if you get involved in name calling, it all \ndisintegrates. People are angry at President Bush for saying it is not \namnesty when they are sure it is amnesty.\n  I compliment the President for the leadership he has shown on this \nissue. He sent us Secretary of Commerce Gutierrez and Secretary of \nHomeland Security Chertoff. For hours, days, weeks, months they worked \non it. There was a commitment by the administration.\n  The President has spoken out on this issue loudly, plainly, and \nclearly. He has taken a lot of brickbats for it, but he is working hard \non it. On the Senate floor a few weeks ago, I made a comment that it \nwas either amnesty or anarchy. Anarchy is what we have here; that is, \nif it is amnesty--and, again, I say I think it is not, but I am not \ngoing to get into a name-calling contest with people who want to call \nnames.\n  Lou Dobbs of CNN has been one of the most vocal critics of the plan. \nHe\n\n[[Page S7120]]\n\nhas a right to do that, and I have been on his program and discussed it \nwith him, debated it with him. But I was interested to see him comment \nabout my characterization of anarchy. That struck a chord. Lou Dobbs \ndoesn't like anarchy--nobody likes anarchy--but in a sense that is the \nchoice we have.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, although I have great respect, and I know this is very \nthoughtful, very well presented, all except for his criticism of the \npolitics of compromise.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I first thank my colleague and \ncongratulate him for his leadership on this bill. I know he has worked \nlong and hard to bring this bill to the floor and is making the best \nout of a very awkward, difficult situation in trying to get all the \ninterested parties under the same tent.\n  I am reminded of when I was attorney general of my State of New \nMexico. One of the duties of the attorney general in New Mexico is to \nissue what are called attorneys general opinions about different legal \npoints that come up. Sometimes those opinions are followed by various \nState agencies and then they are challenged in court. I remember in one \nof the cases where it was challenged in our State supreme court, a \nfriend of mine on the State supreme court, who was a very wise man, \nwrote an opinion essentially saying that the opinion I had issued, the \nattorney general opinion, was wrong. He said attorneys general opinions \nare entitled to great weight, except when they are wrong.\n  That is sort of the way I feel about the bill that has been brought \nto the floor. I have great respect for those who have put it together, \nand it is entitled to great weight and deference, except where it \nclearly is wrong. That is what we are trying to do with this amendment, \nis to correct an area of the bill that clearly is wrong. I hope my \ncolleagues will see it the same way and support my amendment. But I \ncompliment the Senator from Pennsylvania for his leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1177\n\n  I wish to speak very briefly about another amendment, unless the \nSenator from Pennsylvania wishes to say something, and then I would \ndefer to him. I gather he does not need to at this point.\n  Let me speak briefly about another amendment I have filed. It is \namendment No. 1177. It provides forestry workers with Y visas some of \nthe same rights to ensure that the terms of their guest worker \ncontracts are honored the same way other guest workers in the \nagricultural sector can have their contracts honored.\n  This is an amendment that is eminently reasonable. It was adopted by \nunanimous consent during the debate as part of the immigration bill we \npassed out of the Senate in the last Congress. I hope we can get \nagreement from the managers of the legislation to include it this year \nas well. So I wished to briefly allude to that amendment and urge every \nconsideration of it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1197\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I expect that Senator DeMint will come to \nthe floor to address his amendment, but in the next 5 minutes that we \nhave before he does so, I would say his amendment is basically saying \nthere will be no adjustment in status unless all these individuals are \ngoing to be able to buy into the high-deductible HSAs, health savings \naccounts, and that because of the fact that immigrants are a burden on \nthe health care system, that they should be required to do this \nadditional kind of work to meet their responsibilities under this \nlegislation.\n  There are a couple factors I wish to mention. First of all, if you \ntake the fact that you have 12 million of these individuals, the 12 \nmillion who are the undocumentable, they are going to, as part of their \nfine, pay $500 per individual. That comes to some $6 billion--$6 \nbillion--that can go for support for various health care offsets into \nlocal communities. That is not an insignificant amount of resources. We \nanticipated this possibility, No. 1.\n  No. 2, we ought to make an examination of what happens to these \nundocumented individuals. What is the utilization by the undocumented? \nWe know they are basically healthier, they are younger, and the various \ninformation and statistics we see says there is not an overutilization \nof the health services.\n  I have statistics for undocumented immigrants in one of the border \nStates, this is in Texas, and I will read this and include the \nappropriate part in the Record. The Comptroller's office estimates the \nabsence of the estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants in Texas \nwould have been a loss to their gross State product of $17 billion. \nAlso, the Comptroller's office estimates State revenues collected from \nundocumented immigrants exceed what the State spends on services, with \nthe difference being $424 million. That is today, one State--Texas--in \nthe utilization of services.\n  So we find this population where there has not been an \noverutilization of services, and we have provisions in the current \nlegislation to deal with this problem and deal with it generously. But \nthe Senator from South Carolina wants to insist on a high-deductible \nprogram.\n  Let us look at the average high-deductible program. The average \nannual deductible for a high-deductible plan required under the DeMint \namendment is $1,900 for an individual and $4,000 for a family. The \naverage annual premium for the plan: $2,700 for an individual and \n$7,900 for a family. The total average cost for an individual would be \n$4,600 and $11,000 for a family. That is for the average individual and \nfamily. This includes the fees and also the deductibility.\n  We have the various studies that have been done, the reports, and \nthis information is from the Los Angeles Times. It points out that \nplans with high deductibles of $1,000 or higher monthly premiums that \ncan be less than $100, as Senator DeMint provides, are a good fit for \nhealthy people with some financial resources. The median annual income \nof those using the high-deductible plans is $75,000. This is a fit for \n$75,000. Although the lower premiums make plans attractive, cash-\nstrapped families run the risk of being unable to afford the \ndeductibles.\n\n  Those are the facts. So the effect of the DeMint amendment is another \nway of denying the 12 million undocumented from being able to \nparticipate in the other provisions of the legislation, which we have \nvery carefully crafted. They have to pay a high fine, they have to pay \nthe State a set-aside, they are going to have to pay the fees as they \nmove along. These are not insignificant. We are talking about thousands \nand thousands of dollars which have been worked out carefully and \nconsidered.\n  This kind of additional burden will say to men and women whose \naverage income may be $10,000 or $11,000 that they are not going to be \nable to do it. Take those individual Americans who are making $10,000 \nand $11,000 and look at how many of them are able to afford health \ninsurance. Virtually none. We know about that in Massachusetts because \nMassachusetts has passed a very effective program to bring those \nindividuals in and to help and assist those individuals.\n  So the idea that we are going to put this in as a requirement is \nanother way of saying to those individuals, look, we might like other \nprovisions of the legislation, but this is a way of effectively barring \nyou from being able to participate in this program. That undermines the \nobject of a very important aspect of this whole endeavor. Therefore, I \nhope the amendment will be defeated.\n  As I understand from the Chair, the last several minutes are supposed \nto be for the Senator from South Carolina; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't see him in the Chamber. I think we ought to \nreserve that time for the Senator. As I understand, under the previous \nagreement,\n\n[[Page S7121]]\n\nwe have agreed to vote at 2 p.m.; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to speak on my amendment that \nis up for a vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. At the present time, all time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that I have 2 minutes to speak on \nmy amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on \nthis amendment. I think all of us would agree that we would like to \ndesign an immigration program that benefited America, that actually \nbrightened the future for Americans, for our children, and that we do \nnot want an immigration system that is going to invite people from all \nover the world who will come here and be a burden to the American \ntaxpayers.\n  Unfortunately, the way this bill is written, the Z visas we offer all \nthe illegal immigrants in this country do not require that these \nillegals have health insurance before they are given these legal \npasses. That means they will continue to be a heavy burden on the \nAmerican health care system.\n  Senator Kennedy has said the $500 one-time fee they have to pay is \nenough to cover these costs. I know every American wishes they could \npay $500 and have free health insurance for life but, unfortunately, it \nis more expensive than that. Also, Senator Kennedy has said these types \nof minimum policies cost well over $2,000 a year, which is, frankly, \nnot true. Many of us have policies that cost less than $1,000 a year \nfor a high-deductible policy, which is the minimum level we ask for.\n  The least we can ask of these immigrants we are granting permanent \nlegal status in this country is not to be a burden on Americans for \ntheir health care. To have a minimum level of health insurance is the \nleast we can ask. This amendment would require Z visa holders to have \nthat minimum level, and I ask all of my colleagues to support it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \nDeMint amendment No. 1197.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico has an \nimportant amendment. He was over here yesterday afternoon and evening \nand spoke well about it. He came over here during the lunch hour. It is \na very important amendment. He deserves to be heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1267\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided on the Bingaman \namendment No. 1267, as modified.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLandrieu be added as a cosponsor to amendment 1267.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment tries to eliminate the 2-\n1-2-1-2 provisions in this bill. The underlying bill says if a guest \nworker comes here, they can work for 2 years, they are kicked out for a \nyear, they can come back, work for two more, they are kicked out for a \nyear, they can come back work for two more, then they are kicked out \nfor good.\n  What my amendment does is to say: Let's bring them here for 2 years, \nallow them to renew their visa twice, so that they would be here a \nmaximum of 6 years. This makes a lot more sense for employers, for \nAmerican workers who are competing for these jobs, for the guest \nworkers themselves.\n  This has the support of the business community, the unions, the \nCatholic bishops. Everybody interested in this bill supports this. This \nis commonsense legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon the Senator from \nNew Mexico criticized the bill as being the ``politics of compromise,'' \nas opposed to sound public policy. I told him, had he participated in \nthe negotiations, he would have seen quintessential politics of \ncompromise. You could not begin to make any progress at all on this \nlegislation unless it was the politics of compromise. I suggest that is \nan art form frequently practiced in this body. I reminded the Senator \nfrom New Mexico of our cosponsorship of global warming. I am glad to \nhear there is nothing in the bill which he is the principal sponsor of \nthat is a factor of the politics of compromise. I am glad our bill is \npure.\n  I have not seen the bill, in the short time I have been in the \nSenate, that doesn't have compromise in it. If it did not have any \ncompromise, it would not have gotten here. If it did get here, it would \nnot be passed.\n  The principle of this bill is to make it temporary so people do not \nestablish roots. If you dealt with Senator Kyl on this matter, you \nwould understand how important he is to this bill and how important \nthis provision is to his continued support.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in favor \nof the Bingaman-Obama Y-1 guest worker amendment.\n  The Bingaman-Obama amendment removes the requirement that Y-1 visa \nholders under the new guest worker program leave the United States for \nat least 1 year before renewing their visas. Designing a worker program \nwhere people are supposed to come to the U.S. for 2 years, leave for a \nyear, return for 2 years, leave for a year, and then return for 2 years \nis a recipe for creating a new undocumented population.\n  Our amendment does not modify the overall number of permissible work \nyears, which would still be limited to a total of 6 years, and it \ndoesn't change the term of the visa, which would still be 2 years. In \norder to renew their visa, applicants would still have to demonstrate \nthat they are eligible to meet the requirements of the program. The \namendment maintains the general structure of the program, but revises \nit in a manner that makes the program more workable.\n  We need to pass this amendment because the process in the underlying \nbill\n\n[[Page S7122]]\n\nis costly and burdensome on employers, especially small businesses. \nRequiring employers to rehire and retrain workers every 2 years imposes \nunnecessary costs and creates instability in the workforce.\n  The underlying language is also harmful to American workers. The 1-\nyear absence requirement would ensure that guest workers are always at \nthe lowest end of the pay scale, which would depress overall wages. And \nthe system as now designed provides an additional incentive for guest \nworkers to overstay the term of their visas. Rather than returning to \ntheir home countries after their 2-year visas expire, many workers will \njust remain in the United States and become undocumented immigrants.\n  In short, the temporary worker design in the bill is unworkable and \ndifficult to enforce. It is unlikely that the government will be able \nto sufficiently track the entry and exit of these workers to ensure \nthat they comply with the 1-year absence requirement. By removing the \n1-year requirement to leave the country between renewals we would at \nleast be making the program workable.\n  Our amendment has the support of a variety of labor, business, \nimmigration, and religious groups. Specifically, the Service Employees \nUnion International, SEIU, the National Association of Homebuilders, \nNAHB, the Associated Builders and Contractors, ABC, the U.S. Conference \nof Catholic Bishops, USCCB, the American Immigration Lawyers \nAssociation, AILA, U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and the National \nImmigration Forum, NIF, have voiced their strong support of this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 1267.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could the \nleader tell us when amendments can be called up which were not on the \nlist he just read, that have not been allowed to be called up today?\n  Mr. REID. We are working on that now. We are making progress. There \nare going to be three called up as soon as we get this vote started. \nThat will be the next agreement we will enter into, and there will be \nthree Republican amendments. So if you have something you care about, \nwork with your colleagues over there to see if that can be one of the \nnext three.\n  Mr. THUNE.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and the time to be charged to the majority side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1313\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to discuss amendment No. 1313, an \namendment I will offer to the immigration reform bill, which will \naddress what I believe are two important, crucial flaws in this \nlegislation. The first flaw relates to what many are calling amnesty, \nwherein the bill legalizes almost everyone who entered this country by \nthe beginning of this year. The second flaw relates to an unworkable \nset of procedures that is applicable to those who are properly being \noffered legal status. It is important to the health and practicality of \nour system, in my view, that these two flaws be addressed.\n  My amendment would achieve three critically important goals. It \ncreates a fair and workable path to legalization for those who have \ntruly put roots down in America; it protects the legitimate interests \nof all working Americans; and it accords honor and dignity to the \nconcept of true American justice. If one accepts the premises of these \nthree goals, then I strongly believe this amendment is the best way \nforward for our country.\n  As a general matter, I agree with my colleagues that the time has \ncome for fair and balanced reform of our broken immigration system. \nWhen I say ``fairness,'' I mean a system of laws that is fair to \neveryone in the United States, and especially our wage earners.\n  I strongly support the provisions in this immigration bill that \nstrengthen our Nation's borders. Our porous borders are a threat to our \nnational security, and we have wasted far too long to fix this problem.\n  I also support the sections of the bill that create tough civil and \ncriminal penalties for employers who unfairly hire illegal immigrants, \ncreating both a second-class population and undercutting American \nworkers. This bill's employment verification system will help ensure \nthat illegal workers cannot get employment in the United States and \nwould, therefore, face no choice but to return to their homelands.\n  As a point of reference, I did not support this bill's creation of a \nmassive new temporary worker program. Two weeks ago, I supported \nSenator Dorgan's two amendments to strike and sunset that program, and \nI find it regrettable the Senate did not adopt those amendments. We \nhave seen a good bit of analysis on the Senate floor in recent days to \nthe effect that the temporary worker program will be largely \nunworkable. To the extent it would work, it would create a wage-based \nunderclass and a bureaucratic nightmare. Furthermore, as I stated on \nthe floor 2 weeks ago, I believe guest worker programs--aside from \npurely temporary, seasonal work--drive down the wages of hard-working \nAmericans, and of those who came here by following the law.\n  With those points in mind, I wish to now turn to my amendment, which \nregards the other major component of this bill: the legalization \nprogram.\n  My amendment reflects a proposal I have been discussing with \nVirginians ever since I began my campaign for the Senate last year. I \nhave always supported tough border security and cracking down on large \nemployers who hire illegal workers. I also have always supported a path \nto legalization for those who came here during a time of extremely lax \nimmigration laws but who have laid down strong roots in our \ncommunities. I do not, however, favor this path to citizenship for all \nundocumented persons. Under the provisions of the immigration bill we \nare now debating, virtually all undocumented persons living in the \nUnited States would be eligible to legalize their status and ultimately \nbecome citizens. Estimates are that this number totals 12 million to 20 \nmillion people. This is legislative overkill. It is one of the reasons \nthis bill has aroused the passions of ordinary Americans who have no \nopposition to reasonable immigration policies but who see this as an \nissue that goes against the grain of true fairness, which is the very \nfoundation of our society.\n  My amendment would allow a smaller percentage of undocumented persons \nto remain in the United States and legalize their status based on the \ndepth of a person's roots in their community. Under my proposal, \nundocumented persons who have lived in the United States at least 4 \nyears prior to the enactment of the bill could apply to legalize their \nstatus. I note that this 4-year period is even more generous than the \n5-year threshold that was contained in several bills the past few \nCongresses addressed--bills that were supported by Senators from both \nparties and by immigrants' rights groups.\n  After receiving the application, the Department of Homeland Security \nwould evaluate a list of objective, measurable criteria to determine \nwhether the applicant should receive a Z visa and thus be allowed to \nget on the path to citizenship.\n  Among the statutory criteria would be an individual's work history; \npayment of Federal or State income taxes; property ownership and \nbusiness ownership in the United States; knowledge of English; \nattendance, successfully, at American schools; immediate family members \nliving in the United States; whether the applicant has a criminal \nrecord; and, very importantly, whether the applicant wants to become an \nAmerican citizen.\n  Like the underlying bill, applicants would be given probationary \nstatus while the DHS considers their Z visa application and could \nlawfully work during this probationary period.\n  I believe these provisions are fair to our immigrant population, and \nalso that they will help us avoid the mistakes this Congress made in \n1986 with the Simpson-Mazzoli amnesty bill, which resulted in a tidal \nwave of illegal immigration.\n  My amendment would also make the underlying bill more practical. It \nstrikes the bill's unrealistic ``touchback'' requirement. Few \nimmigrants would have the money or the ability to return to their home \ncountries on other continents. Most of these persons would lose their \nAmerican jobs. They would leave their families in turmoil and place \nfurther strain on our community services. Basic fairness and common \nsense dictates that these persons be allowed to apply for a green card \nfrom within the United States.\n  I believe my amendment sets forth an equitable system that not only \nrecognizes the contributions of immigrants to our society but also \nintroduces practical measures that will help us avoid the same mistakes \nour country made in 1986 with the Simpson-Mazzoli amnesty bill.\n\n  I have heard loudly and clearly from Virginians, and I have talked \nwith people on all sides of these issues. What I hear over and over \nagain is that Congress should find a fair system that both protects \nAmerican workers and respects the rule of law. This amendment \nrepresents the fairest method I know to do so, and to do so \nrealistically.\n  I ask my colleagues to support amendment No. 1313 when it comes to a \nvote in the Senate.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I gladly yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was listening to the description of the \namendment by Senator Webb. I think\n\n[[Page S7124]]\n\nit is a good amendment, and I intend to be prepared to support it. This \namendment is about the treatment of those who have come here without \nlegal authorization. The underlying bill, by the way, was cobbled \ntogether by a group of people, including the White House, I guess, and \nthey said anybody who shows up in this country without legal \nauthorization by December 31 is deemed to then have been legal and will \nbe given a work permit.\n  I think Senator Webb's approach is much more sensitive and much more \nrealistic to our people who have been here 10, 15, 20 years without \nlegal authorization but they have been model citizens, they raised \nfamilies, have had jobs, have done things that would commend them to us \nfor the future. He is suggesting a much more sensible way of dealing \nwith that. I think that amendment makes a lot of sense.\n\n  I did want to say we had a vote on the guest worker or temporary \nworker provisions, and I offered an amendment, or 2 amendments, and the \nsecond amendment was to sunset that after 5 years. I lost that vote by \none vote in the Senate, and I have filed an amendment at the desk and \nwill attempt to have another vote on that. I have modified section 2 \njust a bit. But my hope is that the Senate would reconsider and pass \nthe amendment that would sunset this temporary worker provision after 5 \nyears. Again, the vote was 49 to 48 against my amendment, and we will \nhave another opportunity to vote on it.\n  The reason I mention it is the Senator from Virginia mentioned that \namendment and the other amendment I offered as well. I ask the Senator \nfrom Virginia if he doesn't think this piece of legislation, in \naddition to legalizing those who have come here as of December 31st of \nlast year, saying you now have legal status--in addition to that--\nsaying we believe there are millions of people who don't live here at \nthis point whom we want to be able to invite in to take American jobs--\nI ask the Senator from Virginia whether that makes much sense in the \nscheme of trying to create economic opportunity for Americans at the \nlower economic scale in this country. There are a lot of people working \nat the bottom of the ladder here who want jobs, who can't find jobs, \nand find downward pressure on their income. I ask whether the Senator \ndoesn't believe this temporary worker program displaces people in this \ncountry who need these jobs.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from North Dakota I was \nvery pleased to support both his amendments for those reasons and \nreasons similar to them. I hope the Senator can get a vote on his \nrevised amendment. I think it is important we deal with this \nimmigration issue in a very realistic and practical manner, with the \nfocus being the well-being of individuals who are here legally and who \nare citizens whose wages and salaries are in many ways being held down \nby these types of programs. The guest worker programs are classic \nexamples of that.\n  I also would like to say that with respect to the timeline in the \npresent bill and the cutoff for full legalization being anyone who came \nhere before December 31 of last year, or before January 1 of this year, \none of the questions that has been raised on my amendment is: Well, \nwhat do we do with these people who haven't been here 4 years? Some \nquestions have been raised saying this would create an unfairness in \nthis amendment. But the answer to that--the obvious answer to that is: \nWhat do we do with people who came here after December 31? They are \nhere. What are we going to do with the people who are here next year? \nThey are going to be here.\n  There is always going to be some leakage in our system. What we are \nlooking for is a measure of fairness for people who have truly put down \nroots in their community and to allow them to assimilate and become \nAmerican citizens. That is a separate thing from the guest worker \nprogram that the Senator from North Dakota is talking about, and I hope \nI get another chance to vote for his amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield further for a \nquestion, there are some in this Chamber who say to us: The choice on \nimmigration is between doing the wrong thing and doing nothing. That is \nnot the choice at all. That is a false choice. They bring the wrong \nthing to the floor of the Senate and say: If you oppose this, then you \nare for nothing.\n  One of the things we are for is enforcing the law. We have a law in \nthis country about employer sanctions, about illegal immigration, \ntrying to stop it. All one would have to do would be to enforce the \nlaw. In 2004, there were four cases in the entire United States of \nAmerica that were brought by the U.S. Justice Department against \nemployers who were employing illegal workers, illegal aliens--four. \nWhat does that tell us? That tells us that the administration says: We \nsurrender on the issue. We surrender.\n  The other point I wished to make is there is no discussion on the \nfloor of the Senate in the construct of this bill, within the debate on \nthis bill, about the American worker. I understand we have an \nimmigration issue. I fully understand that, and we need to deal with \nthat. But part and parcel of that, in my judgment, ought to be some \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate about how this affects the \nAmerican worker. We have a lot of workers in this country who aren't \ndoing very well. It has been a long time since they have seen any \nincrease in their income, despite their productivity rising. Where is \nthe debate about the impact on the American worker? It is not selfish \nfor us to believe that ought to be a part of this discussion.\n  So I ask the Senator from Virginia whether he believes as well that \nwhen you bring an immigration bill to the floor, you ought to have some \ndiscussion about what is the impact of this issue on the American \nworker, on the people who have a high school education or perhaps don't \neven have a high school education and who are at the bottom of the \nladder, got up this morning and went to work and are working at minimum \nwage, struggling to get by to raise a family to do the best they can \nand discover at the end of the day: Oh, by the way, there is more \ndownward pressure on your income because the employer can bring \nsomebody through the back door that is able to be paid lower wages, \nthey will work for less money, even as the bigger employers are \nexporting jobs out the front door to China and Sri Lanka and \nBangladesh.\n  So I ask whether the American worker shouldn't play a bigger role in \nthe debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would say that an enormous amount of work \nhas gone into this piece of legislation, as we all know. I appreciate \nall the energy that the Senator from North Dakota has placed for years \non the interests of the American worker. I share those interests. This \namendment that I offer is based on two things. One is fairness to \neveryone, including the American worker, and the other is the \npracticality that is this particular part of the legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1250\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have an amendment that is scheduled for \na vote later on this evening, and I would like to spend a few minutes \nexplaining it. This is--well, let me put it this way: If the definition \nof insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again and \nexpecting a different outcome, the provisions in the underlying bill \nthat my amendment will correct represents insanity in action because it \nrepeats a mistake made in the 1986 immigration laws that is within our \npower to correct. I believe the amendment I am offering will allow that \ncorrection to take place, and I offer it in that spirit.\n  At the very least, the American people expect we will not \nintentionally repeat mistakes. They don't expect us to be perfect. They \ndo expect us to do our best, and we owe them that much. But in this \ncase, doing our best means not repeating a mistake.\n  Quite simply, the Department of Homeland Security is, under the \ncurrent bill, prohibited from using internally all information from Z \nvisa applications, as well as sharing information with the relevant law \nenforcement agencies. That is right. You can actually apply for a Z \nvisa if you are 1 of the 12 million or so people here in the\n\n[[Page S7125]]\n\ncountry already in violation of our immigration laws, whether it is \nentering without a visa or once having entered with a visa, overstaying \nthat visa, and if you are seeking the benefits of this underlying bill \nwhich are mainly represented in the form of a Z visa, the information \ncontained in that application by those 12 million individuals is \neffectively shielded from law enforcement authorities. For example, if \nan applicant comes forward and is denied a Z visa, this legislation \ncurrently pending prohibits the Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nService from using that information in order to apprehend that person \nwho is not legally present in the country.\n  What we learned about the 1986 amnesty was that the New York Times \nsaid it created the largest immigration fraud in the history of the \nUnited States. That same view is shared by the general counsel of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service under President Clinton with \nregard to statutory restrictions on sharing and using information. That \ngeneral counsel, Paul Virtue, noted that this prohibition greatly \ncontributed to this fraud.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times \narticle be printed in the Recored and I refer my colleagues to the \ntestimony of Paul Virtue before the House Immigration and Claims \nSubcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee at judiciary house.gov/\njudiciary/106-52.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. In addition to questions of why we would want to put out \nof bounds to law enforcement agencies information which they could use \nto investigate and identify fraud and criminal conduct, you might ask: \nWhy the double standard? For example, we don't afford these kinds of \nrobust confidentiality provisions for other classes of immigrants such \nas asylees or battered women or those who fall under the temporary \nprotected status provisions. So why would we have a double standard? \nWhen an asylum seeker applies for legal status, that asylum seeker must \nsubmit an application and return at a later date for the decision. If \nthat asylum seeker's application is denied, then he or she is taken \ninto custody on the spot, based on information contained in the \napplication.\n  Now, the proponents of this bill will tell us that without these \nguarantees of confidentiality, those who are already here in the \ncountry in violation of our immigration laws will not come forward and \nseek the benefits of the Z visa provided for under the bill, which \nleads me to ask: Aren't we granting the biggest benefit that can ever \nbe given to anybody in the world--legal status and a path to American \ncitizenship--even though these individuals have violated our laws?\n  And to be clear, we are talking about those who cannot even establish \nthat they meet the minimum requirements to get this valuable benefit. \nEven worse, they have continually flouted our immigration and criminal \nlaws. Why would we consciously give these individuals broad privacy \nprotections by the mere filing of their application for Z status, and \nwhy would they be treated differently from other immigrants?\n  The proponents say they do exempt from confidentiality those who \ncommit fraud or are a part of some other scheme in connection with \ntheir application. Of course, that is the very least we should do. But \nthis bill does not go nearly far enough to effectively enforce our \nimmigration laws and protect the American people from those who could \nand would and might do us harm.\n  For example, on page 311 of the bill, in section 604(b) labeled \n``Exceptions to Confidentiality,'' the drafters of this bill have \nchosen to protect aliens who are criminal absconders who have not been \nremoved from the United States; that is, people who are under orders of \ndeportation but who have not yet been removed. This is, in fact, a \nfelony offense under 8 U.S.C. 1253, which is punishable for up to 4 \nyears in prison. Yet the underlying bill would provide confidentiality \nfor that individual.\n  We all know that hundreds of thousands of individuals come across our \nborders each year in violation of our immigration laws. But what most \nAmericans would be shocked to realize is that, according to recent \nestimates, almost 700,000 aliens who have immigrated illegally or \noverstayed who have been ordered deported have simply failed to comply \nwith that court order. How many Americans think that it is OK to ignore \na court order? How many Americans, after receiving a subpoena from a \ncourt, ignore it and simply skip that court date?\n  Let me give two examples of what I am talking about. In section \n604(b), the drafters claim they allow law enforcement to go after \ninformation for those denied Z status because of felonies and serious \ncriminal offenses, but what is missing are those aliens who have \nactually committed those felony offenses but who have not yet been \nactually convicted. In section 604, the drafters further claim they \nresolve the problem by allowing law enforcement access to those who \ncommit fraud or misrepresentations in their Z applications. But again, \nwhat is missing is law enforcement's ability to reach third-party \nfraud: Where the alien, him or herself may not be complicit but to \nprosecute the third party, the Government needs the information from \nthe Z application filed by such individuals in order to make the case. \nSimply stated and summarized, fraud by third parties involved in a Z \napplication; crimes that have not yet resulted in a conviction; \nabsconders--people who have ignored a valid court order and who have \nyet to be physically removed--as well as those Z visa applicants who \nare denied on noncriminal grounds, all of those categories of \ninformation are rendered confidential and kept from law enforcement \nauthorities when it comes to investigating crime and other wrongful \nconduct.\n  As I said earlier today, in fact, if we were more interested in \nregaining the public's confidence that we were actually serious about \npassing an immigration law that could be and would be vigorously \nenforced, I don't think I would be up here offering this amendment \nbecause it would be agreed to without the necessity of a vote. But \nstrangely, to me, this commonsense sort of amendment is being resisted. \nIn a way, it helps merely confirm what most people across the country--\nparticularly in my State--seem to suspect, which is that Congress \ncannot be trusted and is not serious about creating an immigration law \nsystem that can be adequately enforced.\n  As my colleagues know, I offered a separate amendment that would \ncategorically bar fugitive aliens from receiving the benefits under \nthis bill. I believe this is an issue of fundamental fairness and \nintegrity of the system. In exchange for what has been offered to this \npopulation, which is the largest legalization program in our Nation's \nhistory, we should be able to say that for any person who applies for \nand receives benefits under this program, we will authorize the \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement Service to look at that application \nand to, if necessary, if warranted under law, arrest that individual \nwho made that application and deport them, in accordance with our laws \nthat Congress has already passed.\n  But the bill the Senate is considering today turns a blind eye to \nthose who apply for the benefits under this bill and are denied. This \nbill would allow them simply to slide back into the shadows--the \nprecise problem we are being told we are trying to fix.\n  I daresay if you ask a random taxpayer on the street this simple \nquestion: Assume an alien comes forward to apply for legal status under \nthis bill. Because the applicant doesn't satisfy one of the criteria \nfor being awarded legal status, the applicant is denied benefits under \nthe bill. What happens to that individual under the Senate immigration \nbill? If you were to ask that question to a man or woman on the street, \nI bet you that 100 out of 100 times people would say: Well, they ought \nto go home, they ought not to be granted benefits under the bill. \nCertainly, they would say you ought not to hide evidence of fraud or \ncriminality or wrongdoing that could be investigated and prosecuted.\n  Yet the so-called confidentiality provisions my amendment addresses, \nunder the current bill, would prevent law enforcement officials from \nusing information on the application to locate and remove a significant \npopulation of those who don't qualify for legalization but have applied \nfor it.\n  To be clear, this is for individuals who have actually applied for a \nZ visa, or benefits under the program, and\n\n[[Page S7126]]\n\nhave been denied, not those whose Z visa status has been granted.\n  This is, in essence, providing an opportunity--to significant \ncategories of individuals whose applications are considered and \nrejected--to slide back into the shadows, which is the very problem we \nare told this solution is designed to solve.\n  The whole point of this exercise, we continue to be told, is to \nenhance U.S. security by bringing people out of the shadows. But this \nbill would draw people out, only to allow them to slide back in if they \ndemonstrate they are disqualified for the benefits under the bill--the \nvery people we ought to be focusing on and having deported in \naccordance with our laws.\n  I remind my colleagues of our Nation's recent history with mass \nlegalization and the consequences of prohibitions on Federal agencies \nsharing information.\n  As I have stated, reasonable observers have concluded that the 1986 \namnesty was rife with fraud. That is the conclusion of the New York \nTimes in the article that will be part of this record, dated November \n12, 1989. The title is ``Migrants' False Claims: Fraud on a Huge \nScale.''\n  We also note, for example, from the 9/11 Commission staff statements, \nthat Mohamed and Mahmud Abouhalima, conspirators in the 1993 World \nTrade Center bombing, were granted green cards, or legal permanent \nresident status, under the Special Agricultural Workers Program, which \nwas an amnesty program created by the 1986 bill.\n  Under this Special Agricultural Workers Program, a key component of \nthe 1986 amnesty, these applicants had to provide evidence they had \nworked on perishable crops for at least 90 days between May 1, 1985, \nand May 1, 1986; their residence did not have to be ``continuous'' or \n``unlawful.'' Nearly 1 million illegal aliens received legal permanent \nresident status under this amnesty--``twice the number of foreigners \nnormally employed in agriculture'' at that time, according to the 9/11 \nCommission staff statements.\n  In other words, the inference is inescapable that there was fraud on \na huge scale, based on the very kind of confidentiality provisions this \nbill includes and which my amendment would remove.\n  I wish to make one other point about this ill-conceived \nconfidentiality provision. Under this bill we are considering, Congress \nwould even prohibit the use of information from sworn third-party \naffidavits that are one of the documents that can prove eligibility. \nWho could not, with a little bit of creativity and initiative, get some \nthird party to provide an affidavit that says: Yes, you were present on \nJune 1, 2007; thus, you are eligible for the benefits under this \nprogram.\n  If you designed a program to welcome and invite and embrace fraud \nmore, I cannot imagine what it would be. Yet that very same sort of \naffidavit could be rendered confidential and could not be shared with \nlaw enforcement personnel, unless my amendment is passed.\n  We already know from well-documented prosecutions of document vendors \nand other legalization cases that the type of documents submitted--\nespecially sworn affidavits from third parties, not even relatives--no \nqualification, just third parties--have been used routinely to further \nfraud.\n  At the very least, we should not repeat the mistakes of 1986 by \nallowing the continued use of sworn affidavits by applicants to \nestablish eligibility for the Z visa. My amendment takes care of these \nconcerns.\n  We know one thing: Criminals and terrorists have abused--and will \ncontinue to seek ways to abuse--our immigration system in order to \nenter and remain in this country.\n  I regret this bill we are debating fails to give law enforcement the \ncommonsense tools they need in order to prevent terrorists and others \nfrom exploiting the vulnerabilities inherent in any massive \nlegalization.\n  My colleagues may tell you there is a confidentiality exception for \nnational security and for fraud. But to rely solely on these exceptions \nis simply wishful thinking; it is not going to happen. It doesn't go \nnearly far enough to reach the kinds of fraud and criminal conduct and \nother wrongful conduct I have mentioned.\n  This kind of information law enforcement needs may provide valuable \nleads of which they were previously unaware. Failure to allow law \nenforcement to connect the dots is a deadly mistake I have heard my \ncolleagues promise they would ``never allow to happen again.'' So I \nurge those who are truly serious about the commitment to make sure this \nkind of fraud and the danger associated with it doesn't ever happen \nagain to support my amendment and make a crucial improvement to this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 12, 1989]\n\n             Migrants' False Claims: Fraud on a Huge Scale\n\n                           (By Roberto Suro)\n\n       In one of the most extensive immigration frauds ever \n     perpetrated against the United States Government, thousands \n     of people who falsified amnesty applications will begin to \n     acquire permanent resident status next month under the 1986 \n     immigration law.\n       More than 1.3 million illegal aliens applied to become \n     legal immigrants under a one-time amnesty for farm workers. \n     The program was expected to accommodate only 250,000 aliens \n     when Congress enacted it as a politically critical part of a \n     sweeping package of changes in immigration law.\n       Now a variety of estimates by Federal officials and \n     immigration experts place the number of fraudulent \n     applications at somewhere between 250,000 and 650,000.\n\n\n                       lack of manpower and money\n\n       The Immigration and Naturalization Service has identified \n     398,000 cases of possible fraud in the program, but the \n     agency admits that it lacks both the manpower and the money \n     to prosecute individual applicants. The agency is to begin \n     issuing permanent resident status to amnesty applicants on \n     Dec. 1, and officials said they were approving 94 percent of \n     the applicants over all.\n       Evidence of vast abuse of the farm worker amnesty program \n     has already led to important changes in the way immigration \n     policies are conceived in Congress. For example, recent \n     legislation to aid immigration by refugees from the Soviet \n     Union was modified specifically to avoid the uncontrolled \n     influx that has occurred under the agricultural amnesty \n     program.\n       Supporters of the farm worker amnesty argue that it \n     accomplished its principal aim of insuring the nation a \n     cheap, reliable and legal supply of farm workers and that it \n     made an inadvertent but important contribution in \n     legitimizing a large part of the nation's illegal alien \n     population. #1,000 Workers, 30 Acres Critics point to cases \n     like that of Larry and Sharon Marval of Newark. Last year \n     they pleaded guilty to immigration fraud charges after \n     immigration service investigators alleged that the Marvals \n     were part of an operation that helped about 1,000 aliens \n     acquire amnesty with falsified documents showing they had all \n     worked on a mere 30 acres of farmland.\n       The amnesty for farm workers was a last-minute addition to \n     the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which sought \n     to halt illegal immigration with a two-part strategy. Under a \n     general amnesty, illegal aliens who could prove they had \n     lived in the United States since before Jan. 1, 1982, were \n     given the chance to leave their underground existence and \n     begin a process leading to permanent resident status. And \n     to stem further illegal immigration, the employment of \n     illegal aliens was made a crime.\n       The agricultural amnesty program was adopted at the \n     insistence of politically powerful fruit and vegetable \n     growers in California and Texas who wanted to protect their \n     labor force. In several respects, the provisions for the \n     program were much less strict than the general amnesty \n     program, which drew 1.7 million applicants. Instead of having \n     to document nearly five years of continuous residence, most \n     agricultural worker applicants had to show only that they had \n     done 90 days of farm work between May 1, 1985, and May 1, \n     1986.\n       Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who \n     was an author of this Special Agricultural Worker provision, \n     said that in retrospect the program seemed ``too open'' and \n     susceptible to fraud. But he argued that budget decisions had \n     made the battle to combat fraud more difficult.\n       ``There has not been enough diligence in tracking down the \n     fraud,'' he said, ``because funding for the I.N.S. has been \n     cut by the White House in each of the last three budgets, \n     even though everyone agreed when the bill passed that greater \n     I.N.S. manpower was essential to make it work.''\n       Congress rarely raises the immigration service budget above \n     Administration requests.\n       Aside from its budget problems, the immigration service has \n     repeatedly come under fire this year in Congress and in an \n     audit by the Justice Department for what was termed \n     mismanagement and administrative inefficiency.\n       John F. Shaw, Assistant Immigration Commissioner, agreed \n     that ``manpower restrictions'' at the agency were a major \n     factor in the fraud in the agricultural amnesty program. He \n     said much of the fraud ``shot through a window of \n     opportunity'' when the agency was frantically trying to deal \n     with many new burdens of the 1986 immigration law.\n\n[[Page S7127]]\n\n                    people who sold false documents\n\n       Mr. Shaw said law-enforcement efforts had been limited to \n     the people who sold false documents to applicants for the \n     farm worker amnesty. The immigration service has made 844 \n     arrests and won 413 convictions in cases alleging fraud in \n     the amnesty program. The people involved ranged from notaries \n     public to field crew leaders. ``It was a cottage industry,'' \n     Mr. Shaw said.\n       The immigration service can revoke legal status if it finds \n     the applicant committed fraud, but even this effort is \n     limited. Only applications that appear linked to a fraud \n     conspiracy are held for review, as when an unusually large \n     number of applicants assert that they have worked in the same \n     place. Some 398,000 aliens have fallen into this category \n     since the application period ended last Nov. 30, but it is \n     likely that many of them will get resident status.\n       Mr. Shaw said the fraud conspiracies often involved farms \n     that actually did employ some migrant labor. So it is \n     frequently impossible to separate legitimate from illicit \n     claims.\n       Given the limited law-enforcement effort, no precise count \n     of fraud in the agricultural amnesty program is possible. But \n     some rough estimates are possible based on information from \n     the aliens themselves. An extensive survey conducted in three \n     rural Mexican communities by the Center for U.S.-Mexican \n     Studies at the University of California in San Diego found \n     that only 72 percent of those who identified themselves as \n     applicants for farm worker amnesty had work histories that \n     qualified them for the program. A similar survey conducted by \n     Mexican researchers in Jalisco in central Mexico found that \n     only 59 percent qualified.\n       But fraud alone does not explain why the program produced \n     more than five times the applicants Congress expected. Frank \n     D. Bean, co-director of the Program for Research on \n     Immigration Policy at the Urban Institute in Washington, said \n     the miscalculation in the Special Agricultural Worker program \n     reflected longstanding difficulties in tracking the number of \n     temporary illegal migrants from Mexico.\n       ``It is at least plausible that a very large percentage of \n     the S.A.W. applicants had done agricultural work in the U.S. \n     even if they did not meet the specific time requirements of \n     the amnesty,'' Mr. Bean said. `It Was a Weak Program'.\n       Mr. Shaw of the immigration service, and other critics of \n     the law, believe there were more fundamental flaws. ``It was \n     a weak program and it was poorly articulated in the law,'' he \n     said.\n       Unlike almost all other immigration programs, which put the \n     burden of proof on the applicant, the farm amnesty put the \n     burden on the Government. Consequently, aliens with even the \n     most rudimentary documentation cannot be rejected unless the \n     Government can prove their claims are false.\n       Stephen Rosenbaum, staff attorney for California Rural \n     Legal Assistance, a nonprofit service organization for farm \n     workers, argued that there was no other way to structure an \n     immigration program for an occupation ``that does not produce \n     a paper trail.'' He noted that farm workers are paid in cash \n     and neither the employers nor the workers keep detailed \n     records. `Immense Logistical Problems.'\n       ``You can argue the wisdom of a farm worker amnesty, but if \n     you have one, you have to recognize the immense logistical \n     problems involved in producing evidence,'' he said.\n       The immigration service at first tried to apply the \n     stringent practices common to other immigration programs, \n     like rejecting applicants with little explanation when their \n     documents were suspect. But three lawsuits brought in \n     Florida, Texas and California over the last two years forced \n     the agency to follow the broader standards mandated by \n     Congress.\n       The burden-of-proof issue arose again earlier this year \n     when the House of Representatives approved legislation that \n     would have made any person who could prove Soviet citizenship \n     eligible for political refugee status.\n       A legislator with a powerful role on immigration policy, \n     Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, eliminated \n     the provision because of concerns raised by the farm worker \n     amnesty program, an aide said. Mr. Simpson, who is on the \n     Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee \n     Affairs, substituted a series of specific circumstances that \n     had to be met for a Soviet citizen to be considered a \n     refugee, like denial of a particular job because of religious \n     beliefs.\n       Immigration experts believe that the agricultural amnesty \n     program will probably color policy debates over other \n     categories of aliens whose qualifications will be difficult \n     to document, like the anti-Sandinista rebels of Nicaragua.\n       ``One certain product'' of the agricultural amnesty \n     program, Representative Schumer said, ``is that in developing \n     immigration policies in the future, Congress will be much \n     more wary of the potential for fraud and will do more to stop \n     it.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeMINT pertaining to the submission of S. Con. \nRes. 35 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent \nand Senate Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, so I understand, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 hour 42 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield such time as I might use.\n  On the Cornyn amendment, the issue is basically confidentiality. Why \nis confidentiality important? What we are trying to do with this \nproposal is to say to the 12.5 million who are living here, the \nundocumented as well as those in agricultural jobs: Come out of the \nshadows, and if you are going to meet the other requirements of the \nbill--paying fines, go to the end of the line, demonstrate solid work \nachievement and accomplishment--you will eventually be able to get in \nline after the backlog is completed for a green card and citizenship. \nWe are saying to the individuals: If you are undocumented today, we \nwant you to register.\n  There is a question with regard to people who are undocumented today. \nIf I go down and say my name is--maybe an undocumented Irish person, \nsay his name is Halloran, and he goes in and says: I am Halloran and \nlive on Linden Street. I am undocumented, my wife is undocumented, and \nmy children are undocumented. We want these people to come out of the \nshadows and register to begin this process, right? Right. We have to \nmake sure those people are going to have a certain amount of \nconfidentiality, that they are not thinking they are just going to sign \nin and register and report to be deported. That is what the Cornyn \namendment effectively does, is report to deport because he eliminates \nall kinds of protections of confidentiality.\n  We provide levels of protection of confidentiality for individuals, \nbut not if they have been involved in any criminal activity and any \nfraudulent activity.\n  The Senator from Texas mentions the 1986 act. He has been mentioning \nthe 1986 act time and time again. I responded that President Reagan \nsigned that act. Republicans were in charge at that time, and they \nadministered that act from 1986 to 1992. I voted against that \nlegislation for many of the reasons that have been outlined. That is a \ndifferent time.\n  If they want to talk about what President Reagan and what the \nRepublicans did at that time, they can be my guest. But the fact is, as \nwe do know, there were incidents where fraud was committed during that \nprogram in the submission of various agricultural documents, and fraud \nwas committed. That is all outlined in a 1988 report which has been \nquoted here. But that has been the document. We have not seen other \ndocuments about similar kinds of fraudulent activities.\n  As a result, what did we do with this legislation? We did a number of \nthings because of what happened in 1986.\n  We provide additional protections and requirements in these areas of \nidentification. We provide a number of protections in this legislation, \nand I will include those at the conclusion of my statement.\n  Secondly, we have included in this legislation that if the DHS \nbelieves fraud has been committed, they can move ahead and deport. Do \nmy colleagues understand? If the Department of Homeland Security thinks \nfraud has been committed by these individuals, they can move ahead and \ndeport. That has been included. We have also included random audits of \nthese various programs.\n  The point that has been made that in 1986 there were irregularities \nwe accept and agree. The fact that the 1986 act was not well managed, \nwe agree. Was there fraud in a number of these affidavits? We say, yes, \nand that is why we took action in this legislation to address it. And I \nwill include those particular citations.\n  I will run through these points very quickly. If the applicant is \ninadmissible for criminal reasons or an alien smuggler, that \ninformation is turned over to the local law enforcement and police. If \nthere has been a conviction of a crime, criminal activity, smuggling, \nmarriage fraud, all of that information is turned over to the police. \nIf there is any indication of any kind of intelligence activity, it is \nturned over to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n[[Page S7128]]\n\n  We have written into this legislation protections so we are not going \nto have abuses of confidentiality. But--but, Mr. President--when we are \ntalking about other kinds of activities--for example, if they fail the \nEnglish test, or because there is a certain amount of work requirement \ntime, there is an issue as to whether they completed the work \nrequirement, we protect their confidentiality. If they fail the English \ntest, we protect their confidentiality. If there is a technical \nregistration issue, we protect their confidentiality.\n  This is enormously important because if we do not protect their \nconfidentiality, they are not going to register. It is as clear and \nsimple as that.\n  This represents a very careful balance that was worked out. I respect \nthe Senator from Texas on this issue, but it is important that we have \nguarantees for individuals if we expect them to register as this system \nis being set up because it is going to transition. We know parts of \nthis system are not going to go into effect until we have border \nsecurity, and if we expect individuals to participate in that system, \nwe have to guarantee their confidentiality. We do so. It is enormously \nimportant. This system isn't going to function unless we do.\n  If the Cornyn amendment is adopted, the bottom line is this system \nwill not function, and it will not work because as individuals in this \ncommunity are wondering whether they ought to sign up for this system, \nby and large they are going to check with perhaps their local parish, \nmaybe their local priest, maybe a nonprofit organization, social \nservice organizations, community organizations in which they have \nconfidence and trust, and those individuals are going to know whether \nthere is confidentiality or not. Those individuals upon whom they rely \nin the local community, extended members of their family, nonprofit \norganizations, church organizations, unless they are able to give the \nassurance to these individuals that their confidentiality is going to \nbe protected, we are not going to have people involved, and we are not \ngoing to have success with this legislation.\n  As I mentioned, in the incidence of fraud, we have addressed those \nextensively with provisions in the legislation. If there are incidents \nof fraud, criminal activity, terrorist activity, any of the other kinds \nof issues that involve criminality, of course, that protection is \neffectively out the window. We provide confidentiality, but limited in \na very important way. It is enormously important to the success of the \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I anticipate that we are going to have presentations \nby my friend and colleague from Alabama sometime with regard to the \nearned-income tax credit. I have comments in response to that \namendment. I know there will be an alternative amendment that will be \noffered in that area. I will address the Senate when we have that \nparticular proposal.\n  Eventually, we are going to have the Lieberman amendment, which is a \nvery thoughtful amendment. We will have opportunity to address it at \nthat time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask that the time during the quorum \ncall be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I appreciate the tremendous effort that \nhas been made on both sides of the aisle to try to address the \nimmigration dilemma facing our country. In my view, other than the war \nin Iraq, the war on terror, there is nothing more important before us, \nand we should leave the bill on this floor for as long as it takes to \nget it right because as difficult as it is to get it right, it seems to \nme that failure is not an option. If we fail, then what we have done is \nadmitted that we have just simply allowed a situation to continue where \nperhaps a million new illegal persons will come into our country each \nyear. That contravenes the rule of law upon which this country is \nfounded, it works against our ability to be a country that lives by the \nmotto that is engraved up there on the wall, ``one from many,'' to \nassimilate into our country the number of people who are coming, and it \nis a poor example for the rest of the world when we suggest to them \nthat they create governments that rely upon the rule of law. It also \nabsolutely enrages the American citizens, who look at Washington and \nsay that the Government has done a horrible job for the last 10, 15, 20 \nyears in enforcing our immigration laws. Americans have, in many cases, \nlost faith that we even have the ability to fix the mess. I used to \nfeel that way myself before I came here. I haven't been here that \nlong--just 4 years.\n  Twelve years ago, I was a candidate for President of the United \nStates. I was in those debates which we watched on television last \nnight, or those kinds of debates. One of my proposals was that we \nshould create a new branch of the military in order to secure the \nborder. In 1994, 1995, and 1996, Americans were upset about our \ninability to distinguish between legal immigration, which is the \nlifeblood of our country, and illegal immigration, which is an affront \nto the rule of law and the principles of what it means to be an \nAmerican. So this has been going on year after year after year.\n  When I was home last week in Tennessee, I spent a lot of time \nlistening and talking to Tennesseans. In fact, I just left a group of \nhomebuilders from Tennessee in my office who were talking to me about \nthe immigration bill and about some concerns they have. But of all the \nconcerns that came through to me last week in my conversations with \nTennesseans, it boils down to this: We don't really trust you guys in \nWashington, DC, to fix this problem. You don't seem to be willing to do \nit.\n  So I have a suggestion today that I will make, an amendment that I \nintend to offer. I won't call it up at this moment, but I want my \ncolleagues to know about it and the country to know about it because I \nthink if this bill were to become law, it would increase the level of \ntrust the American people would have in the ability of this Government \nto enforce whatever law we pass. I am not suggesting it would solve \neverything or that we would regain trust overnight, but I am suggesting \nit would be a step forward. I will describe the legislation in just a \nmoment, but it boils down to this: We would involve the Governors of \nthe border States between the United States and Mexico in determining \nwhether the new border control system we put in place is actually \noperational.\n  Right now, particularly amendment offered by my distinguished \ncolleague from New Hampshire (Senator Gregg) the other day, the \nproposed bill has been strengthened in the following way: He said that \nhis amendment would require the Department of Homeland Security to \ncertify that it has established and demonstrated operational control \nover the entire U.S.-Mexico land border before other parts of the bill \ninvolving legal status could go into effect. We call this the trigger.\n  Senator Isakson from Georgia suggested this last year. It is a wise \nidea. It says, first we secure the border, and then, when it is secure, \nwe do the other things about legalization of people already here, to \nthe extent we decide to do that. But the question still remains: Who is \ngoing to say when the border is secure? The people out across the \ncountry--at least those in Tennessee--don't trust us, don't trust the \nGovernment in Washington, because of this poor record of 20 years. It \ndoesn't matter that I just got here 4 years ago. They look up here and \nsee the Government and they say: You didn't do it last year, you didn't \ndo it 3 years ago, you didn't do it 10 years ago or 15 years ago, so \nhow do we know you are ever going to do it, even if you pass the law?\n  Well, the three things I can think of that would make a difference \nare, No. 1, to pass a bill with teeth in it. For example, the Gregg \namendment says\n\n[[Page S7129]]\n\nthere will be 20,000 Border Patrol agents. That is more than we \ncurrently have. Today, there are 13,000. There will be four unmanned \naerial vehicles. There will be 300 miles of vehicle barriers. \nCurrently, there are about 78. There will have to be at least 370 miles \nof fencing already built. Now, there are 700 already authorized by the \nSecure Fence Act of 2006, and that hasn't changed, but 370 miles would \nhave to be built. There would have to be 70 ground-based radar and \ncamera towers on the southwest border. There would have to be a \npermanent end to catch and release. There would have to be an \nemployment verification system that requires employers to \nelectronically verify new hires within 18 months and all existing \nemployees within 3 years. All of those things would have to be in \nplace. The words are they would have to be ``established and \ndemonstrated, that the Federal Government had operational control over \nthe entire U.S.-Mexico land border.''\n\n  The amendment that is already part of the bill, the Gregg amendment, \nsaid the Director of Homeland Security would certify that. What I add \nwith my amendment is it has to be concurred in, agreed with, signed off \non by three of the four Governors on the United States-Mexico border. \nIn other words, we pass the law with teeth--the teeth of the Gregg \namendment and maybe more. I have suggested, and others seem to have \nagreed, what we ought to do is then fund the law. Either the President \nchallenges us to pass an appropriations bill within 30 days after we \npass the law, we do it ourselves, or we set up a trust fund--the way we \ndo for highways and the way we do for Social Security, the way we do \nfor anything else--and we say that money goes to secure the border, to \nfund these things. We pass a law with teeth. Then we provide the money. \nThen the Director of Homeland Security says the border is secure. That \nis the trigger. My amendment would say: The Governors of the border \nStates, three out of four, have to agree.\n  The Governors of the border States are not in Washington, DC. They \nhave not been infected with whatever is up here. They have not even \nbeen vaccinated. I have been up here long enough to be vaccinated with \nwhatever disease is up here, and for that reason more Tennesseans trust \nthe Governors than they do the Washington officials to solve this \nproblem. If the Governors of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas \nsay yes, the border is secure, we agree with the certification of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, I think that would be good enough for \nmost Americans. That is the point of my amendment.\n  We need to put together a good bill that secures the border first. \nAfter border security, the other biggest problem is what to do about \nthose already here illegally. I think that issue is less of an issue if \nmost Americans believe we would pass a law that permitted the Border \nPatrol agents and the verification system to be done, that we would \nfund it and we would actually do it as certified by the Director of \nHomeland Security and the Governors on the border. Then I think they \nwould be willing to accept different solutions for those already here.\n  But the week before last I voted for the amendment offered by Senator \nVitter that would have sent the bill's drafters back to the drawing \nboard on the question of what to do about the 12 million illegal \npersons, more or less, who are already here.\n  Senator Hutchison and Senator Corker have done some very important \nwork on this issue, which I intend to support and to cosponsor. That \namendment would require illegal immigrants, who want to work here, to \nreturn to their home countries and reenter through legal channels in \naddition to paying a fine and passing the criminal background check.\n  In addition to that, this bill should be about another subject about \nwhich we hear almost nothing, and that is the number of people who come \nhere legally every year. A little more than a million people come into \nthe United States each year legally. Today, if I remember the figures \nright, most are family members. Some come here as students. Some come \nhere as researchers, to create jobs for us. Some come here as refugees. \nFor those Americans who come here legally and who are prospective \ncitizens, especially given the large number of people coming from \noverseas, we need to do everything we can to help those persons become \nAmericans.\n  I have filed several amendments. They seek to promote learning \nEnglish, our common language, and what it means to become an American \nthrough an understanding of history and civics. For example, one of \nthese amendments will help these legal immigrants learn English and \nwhat it means to be an American, to codify the oath of allegiance, and \nto make English our national language.\n  Another amendment would ask the Government Accountability Office to \nprovide a comprehensive report on the costs imposed on the public and \nprivate sector by having millions of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent \nresidents who are not proficient in English. So far in this debate the \nSenate has already passed my amendment to establish a Presidential \naward to recognize companies who have taken extraordinary efforts to \nhelp their employees learn English and American history and civics.\n  Some may say that is not so important, we all agree with that. It is \nawfully important. If you take a look at Europe today and you see the \ndifficulty France has helping immigrants become French, and that \nGermany has helping immigrant workers become German, and that Japan \nhas--because no one has an idea of what it might mean to become \nJapanese if you are not born Japanese--you can see how fortunate we are \nin this country to have literally invented the concept of becoming \nAmerican. We say it does not matter what your race is, it doesn't \nmatter who your grandfather is, you come here, you take the oath George \nWashington gave his officers at Valley Forge and you say: I am not \nwhatever I was. I pledge allegiance to America. I learned the language, \nI learned the history, and we have a few principles we agree on, and I \nam an American. I am proud of where I came from, but I am prouder to be \nan American. Race doesn't matter. Religion doesn't matter. We pride \nourselves on that. It is a tremendous advantage we have, so we ought \nnot lose sight of the importance of helping legal citizens learn \nEnglish and what it means to be an American.\n  I have heard some talk that encouraging people to learn English is \nsomehow divisive. I can't imagine that. In fact, it is the reverse. It \nis our unifier. It unifies us, to have a common language. It unifies us \nto know that the rule of law and equal opportunity are common \nprinciples.\n  We debate what that means, and often they collide and conflict and we \nhave to work that out as legislators, but we all agree on the same \ncommon principles and we enjoy the fact we have a common language, so I \ncan speak to the President, and I can argue with the Senator from \nColorado or I can agree with him as we are doing on an Iraq piece of \nlegislation right now. We have a common language.\n  So, common language, what it means to be an American, finding many \ndifferent ways to honor these new citizens who come here legally--that \nought to be as important a part of this bill as securing the border and \ncreating a verification system in dealing with the people who already \ngot here illegally.\n  Primarily I came to the floor this afternoon to let my colleagues \nknow I have a suggestion for how to begin to regain the trust of the \nAmerican people on this issue, and that is this bill should pass with \nstrong new provisions for border security, with funding to pay for it, \nand with a trigger that says the legalization parts of the bill don't \ntake effect for 2, 3, 4, maybe even 5 years, until the border is \nsecure.\n  Then the question is how are we going to know if the border is \nsecure? The bill says trust the Director of Homeland Security. I say \nask him, pay attention to him or her, but also trust the Governors of \nthe border States. Let three out of the four Governors, of California, \nArizona, New Mexico, and Texas concur with the Director of Homeland \nSecurity that the border is secure before we begin the legalization \nprocess, and I think the American people might buy it, they might \nbelieve that, and we might begin to regain their trust, after 20 years \nof mismanagement, that we are willing to take seriously securing the \nborder and establishing respect again so we can have a rule of law.\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank my friend from Tennessee for his comments on the \nimportance of immigration reform. I would say there is agreement in \nthis Chamber among both Democrats and Republicans that what we need to \ndo is secure our borders. The legislation before us today and the \nlegislation we have been working on is, in fact, intended to secure our \nborders. We all recognize we need to move from a system of lawlessness \nand broken borders that create a wake of victims, to a system of law \nand order and a system of immigration reform that works for our \ncountry. We have been making significant progress as we move forward \nwith this legislation. At this point we have already had 15 rollcall \nvotes on this legislation. We expect to have another seven rollcall \nvotes on this legislation as we move forward today. That gets us up to \n22 rollcall votes. Last year before cloture was invoked on the \nimmigration bill that was before the Senate, there were, at that time, \n23 rollcall votes. So by the end of tonight we should be at a point \nwhere we would have equaled at least the number of votes we had last \nyear.\n  We have some difficult amendments still coming up that we will be \nvoting on, both today and tomorrow, but it seems to me we are making \nsignificant progress, and I appreciate the hard work that is going on \ntoday on the Democratic side as well as the Republican side.\n  Again, I appreciate the leadership of Senator Reid. What he did is \nsay: I am going to take the time of the Senate, 100 Senators. All of us \nhere in the Chamber know how important our time is. We get a 6-year \nlicense to serve as Senators, so how we spend our time and how our time \nis allocated is at a very high premium. What Senator Reid did was to \nsay a long time ago we would spend the latter part of May, and now we \nare into June, dealing with this huge issue of immigration reform. At \nthe end of the day it is a national security issue that goes to the \nheart of what Senator Alexander was saying, which is we have to secure \nthe borders of this country, we have to deal with the economic \nrealities that have created the immigration issues we are facing here \ntoday, we have to deal with the reality of 12 million undocumented \nworkers who live here in the shadows of America's society, and we have \nto create a system for immigration that is going to work into the \nfuture.\n  The people who have worked on this, including President Bush in the \nWhite House, have helped us move this debate forward--hopefully closer \nto conclusion.\n  I see my friend from New Jersey, who is I think ready to speak, so I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Reid be added as a cosponsor of the Menendez-Hagel amendment, \nNo. 1194.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1194\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, let me first commend my distinguished \ncolleague from Colorado, who has been a voice of reason throughout this \nwhole process. He has been a leader in trying to fashion a \ncomprehensive immigration reform that is tough and smart. We need \nimmigration reform that is tough as it relates to making sure our \nborders are protected. We have not only the right but the obligation to \nsecure those borders and ensure that we have the wherewithal and the \nresources to make sure only those who cross, cross in a fashion that is \nsafe, legal and orderly. At the same time, we need immigration reform \nthat deals with our economy, fueling that economy, and finally finds \njustice for individuals who are often subject to human trafficking as \nwell as exploitation.\n  To my distinguished colleague from Colorado, I tip my hat for the \ntremendous effort he has made--and that brings us to where we are \ntoday. But I do want to go toward one of the pending amendments that \nwill be voted on in the next block. It is the amendment I have offered \nwith Senator Hagel and many others that goes to the core of one of the \ngreat issues the Senate will decide as it relates to this immigration \nbill, and that is whether families and the reunification of families is \nstill a value to the Senate, is still a value in our family, whether \nfamilies who come together and are strengthened by being together and \nhelping each other and working with each other and nurturing each other \nand by so doing strengthening communities in the process are to be \npreserved, or are they, in terms of that battle, likely to be \neliminated and struck, at least in our immigration context?\n\n  I certainly hope when the Senate comes to vote, it will be voting in \na way that is in line with the many speeches I have heard here, that I \nhave heard in committee hearings, that I have heard in the other body, \nin the House of Representatives, where I served before coming here, \nabout family values, family reunification is going to be preserved. It \nis time to put our votes where our values are. The Menendez-Hagel \namendment offers that opportunity.\n  Now, I do wish to wave my saber to the managers of the bill. I have \nheard some suggestion that there may be an attempt to offer a budget \npoint of order which would require a higher vote total. I would simply \nsay that there are also budget points of order on the underlying \nsubstitute. If in fact we are going to go down that slippery slope, \nthen I would have the expectation myself to be offering budget points \nof order against the substitute. I think what is fair is to have a vote \nup or down on the amendment as it relates to the majority of the \nSenate's will. We will see what the majority will of the Senate is.\n  But if we are going to move down that road, I would acknowledge that \nthere is a budget point of order as it relates to the underlying \nsubstitute. So I hope we will not move to that type of tactic as we \npursue the vote on this amendment.\n  Now, it seems to me that under the existing bill, people who apply \nunder the existing rule, under the law as it is today, who observe the \nlaw, who follow the rules, who said to their family member: No, no, do \nnot come to the United States, wait your turn, follow the law, obey the \nrules, who filed an application as is a right of a U.S. citizen to file \nfor a petition for their immediate relative, who paid their application \nfee, whose Government took their application fee, whose Government went \nahead and made an analysis of that petition to see if it was a petition \nthat was lawfully entitled to be approved, and who approved the very \nessence of that petition saying: Yes, this person, as a U.S. citizen, \nhas the right--the right--to go ahead and apply for their family \nmember, their brother or sister, their mother or father, their son or \ndaughter--that is the universe that we are talking about--and says: \nHaving approved my documentation and having approved of that petition, \nthen you must wait your turn to the time that ultimately the priority \ndate will invoke the possibility for you to come to the United States.\n  That is the law. That is obeying the law. That is the rule of law. So \nyou would think that in the legislation we are debating, those who have \nobeyed the law, followed the rules, and those who are U.S. citizens and \nhave done the right thing, that we would not extinguish, eliminate \ntheir right for having done the right thing--for having done the right \nthing.\n  But that is the very essence of what this bill does, unless we adopt \nour amendment. Under the bill, not only does, of course, the Senate \nbill propose a radical change to who and how you can come to this \ncountry, but it also cancels the applications that are pending--\npending--of many people who have been waiting patiently in line for \nfamily-based visas. If you are a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent \nresident, you filed after May of 2005, the date that arbitrarily was \ntaken and put into the bill to bring in a relative to the family \nimmigration system, your application is gone. It is voided. You are \ntold: Get to the back of the line--the back of the line, by the way, \nwhich is the back of the line with people who violated the law, who \nviolated the law. Imagine that.\n  Whose right is being extinguished here? Not the family member who is \nwaiting abroad. No. The right of the individual that is being \nextinguished is the U.S. citizen. That is where the right accrues. It \nis that person who has\n\n[[Page S7131]]\n\nthe right to make this claim under existing law.\n  So we take away their right after they filed the petition, paid their \nfees, and told their family members to wait. They are told to get in \nthe back of the line. The back of the line is after those individuals \nwho did not follow the law and obey the rules.\n  It boggles the mind. Under the Senate bill, employment-based \nimmigrants are allowed to continue their applications as long as they \nare pending after the date of enactment. Employment-based verification. \nWhat about those families who have done everything right? It is only \nfair, in my mind, that family-based immigrants be given the same \ntreatment.\n  The Menendez-Hagel amendment goes a long way to restoring fairness to \nthis situation by doing what? We simply take the cutoff date that is in \nthe bill, May 2005, and we say: Do not treat American citizens any \nworse than you are going to treat those who came into the country in an \nundocumented fashion. You are going to give them a benefit, January 1, \n2007. They had to be here by January 1, 2007. Well, then, let those who \nfollowed the law, obeyed the rules, paid their fees, told their \nfamilies to wait, they have the same benefit: January 1, 2007.\n  It is not outside the ``grand bargain.'' It is within the same \ncontext. You want to clear out a backlog? Fine, clear out a backlog but \nbe fair in the process. Do not extinguish the rights of U.S. citizens.\n  It is important to understand, as we talk about this, the stringent \nrequirements that exist under the law today governing family \nsponsorship for immigration. They would continue to apply in these \ncases. Any U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident wishing to sponsor \na family member, as part of the approval of that petition, must \ndemonstrate that he or she earns at least 125 percent of the Federal \npoverty level and must sign a legally enforceable ``affidavit of \nsupport,'' pledging to ensure his or her relative will not become a \npublic charge.\n  On top of that, based upon the welfare reform legislation that was \npassed several years ago, legal immigrants are barred, barred from \naccessing most Federal means-tested public benefits for the first 5 \nyears in the United States and are thereafter subject to further \nlimitations until they have worked 40 quarters in this country, which \nis the equivalent of 10 years--10 years. Five years first, in terms of \nbeing barred from any public benefit because you came in on the \naffidavit of a family member who said: I am going to be responsible for \nthis individual, and then 10 years after, in terms of being subject to \nfurther limitations of their necessity to have worked 40 quarters, 10 \nyears.\n\n  Now, I have heard a lot about the rule of law. I am for the rule of \nlaw. But how does the rule of law get promoted, how does the rule of \nlaw get promoted when we say to a U.S. citizen who has applied for \ntheir family member waiting abroad, waiting their time, following the \nrules, obeying the rule of law, that, in fact, they have an inferior \nright to someone who did not follow the rules, who did not obey the \nlaw, and who ultimately will receive a benefit superior, superior to \nthat U.S. citizen who is claiming their family member and waiting under \nthe law and pursuing the law?\n  In my mind, it sends out totally the wrong message. The message \nshould have been: No, no. Come across. Come however you can. Then, by \nthe way, you know we are going to give you a benefit. Do not stay out \nthere waiting. Yes, it breaks our heart that we are not together. Yes, \nyou are going to have to wait a period of time. But you know that is \nthe law. We are going to do this right.\n  Oh, no. Instead of honoring and rewarding that and sending a message \nthat when you observe the law there is a benefit, you know, we do the \nopposite. We do the opposite under this bill. Our amendment very simply \nsays: A U.S. citizen claiming their family member, waiting under the \nlegal process, waiting to proceed, that their right should not be \nsnuffed out like that, under this bill, in May of 2005, when those who \nhave crossed the borders of our country through a process that is \nunchecked, undocumented, get a benefit--January of 2007.\n  Because here is the message we send under this bill: Break the law, \nyou get a benefit--January of 2007. Follow the law, follow the rule of \nlaw, obey it, your right is snuffed out in May of 2005. So I think if \nwe want to send a message about the rule of law, what we want to do is \nto ensure we put on an equal footing the rights of a U.S. citizen \nclaiming their family member, obeying the law, to give them the same \nopportunity that those who have not. That is what our amendment is all \nabout.\n  Now, as we approach moving toward a vote on this amendment, I wish to \nremind our colleagues about whose rights they are snuffing out. Rights \nof individuals good enough to wear the uniform of the United States, \ngood enough to serve their country, good enough to fight for their \ncountry but not good enough to observe their right to claim their \nfamily member.\n  Under this bill, both U.S. citizens and U.S. legal permanent \nresidents' rights are snuffed out. These men in different branches of \nthe armed services of the United States, they were good enough to fight \nfor their country, but they were not good enough, under this bill, to \nhave their rights preserved to claim their family member.\n  That does not make sense to me. Now, I have heard about this killer \namendment--killer amendment. One of our colleagues has tried to \ndescribe our amendment on family reunification as a killer amendment. \nWhat is a killer amendment? A killer amendment is an amendment that is \nproposed by a sponsor who does not want to see comprehensive \nimmigration reform pass the Senate.\n  Now, the ironic part of that is many who used that language last year \nwhen I was in the Senate voting for comprehensive immigration reform, \nthat was used against me in my election last year. They were voting \nagainst comprehensive immigration reform. Killer amendment? When did \nfamily reunification--family reunification--strengthening of families, \npreserving the rights of U.S. citizens, including those who wear the \nuniform of the United States, when did that become a killer amendment?\n  Now, I have heard a lot about family values in my 15 years in \nCongress. You know, when you want to move away from the human aspect, \nwhen you want to forget, for example, the face of Marine LCpl Jose \nAntonio Gutierrez, a legal permanent resident of the United States who \ngave his life, the first soldier to die in Iraq, under this bill, had \nhe survived, you would have extinguished his right to claim his family. \nHe was good enough to die for his country, not good enough to have his \nrights preserved. When you don't want to see the human faces, you \ndehumanize it so you can deal with it abstractly. So what have we heard \nabout? We have heard about chain migration. We can treat it like an \ninanimate object; we have to stop that chain migration.\n\n  This is much more than chain migration. This chain my colleagues so \nabstractly refer to, the top of this chain is someone who is a mother \nor a father. When did that become such a horrible thing? I thought we \nwanted to strengthen families, honor our parents, honor their ability \nto perform and to be strengthened. But that is chain migration. We \ncan't let a U.S. citizen be able to claim their family. No, that is \nchain migration. We can't do that.\n  When did we decide our brothers and sisters are nonnuclear? But they \nare part of the chain, brothers and sisters. Then our children--this is \na good one--if they are under the age of 21, they are part of our \nnuclear family. If they are over the age of 21, they are no longer part \nof our nuclear family, just a little part of this chain.\n  I have two children. One is 21; the other is 23. I have never for a \nmoment, because they changed from 20 to 21, believed they were not part \nof my nuclear family. I don't view them as part of a chain. I don't \nlove them any less. I couldn't live without them any less. The mere \npassage of a year, some numerical figure makes them part of a chain, \nnonnuclear. I guess we can do away with our children. I guess we can do \nwithout the right of U.S. citizens to claim their children. We can just \ndiscard them. I guess when you become 21, you really don't matter \nanymore. As a matter of fact, all of that family values stuff doesn't \nmatter anymore. Unless we adopt this amendment, that is what we are \ntalking about.\n  Imagine if we couldn't have such a set of circumstances be preserved \nby\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\nvirtue of this amendment. I have shown some of these pictures before, \nbut as we move to the vote, I hope people understand what I am talking \nabout. Under the bill, family reunification that I believe is so \ncritical, we wouldn't have a lot of people in our country who have made \nenormous contributions. Ultimately, we ended up thriving because of \ntheir contributions. We ended up thriving on the contributions of a \nColin Powell whose parents, under this bill, would not have been \neligible to come to this country and, therefore, unlikely that he would \nhave been born here and had the opportunity to become chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff or Secretary of State. He has made a good \ncontribution to this country.\n  Right now in Iraq our leadership comes from GEN David Petraeus. The \nreality is, under this bill his parents would have been unlikely to \ncome to this country, and he would not be a United States general and \nleading the best efforts we can have in Iraq.\n  Under this bill, the inventor of the polio vaccine, Jonas Salk, would \nnot have made it to this country. Yet he saved the lives of millions \nand millions of people here and across the world. Under this bill, at \nleast, America wouldn't have been the place in which electricity and \nthe light bulb would have been found. Thomas Edison, from my home State \nof New Jersey, likely would not have made it because his parents \nweren't rocket scientists.\n  The list goes on and on. We have a gentleman who did a great service \nto our service men and women across the globe, Bob Hope. Under this \nbill his parents wouldn't have made it, and we wouldn't have had an \nincredible ambassador for our country and an incredible sponsor of \ngoodwill for the men and women who served us over decades around the \nglobe.\n  What do we say? This came out recently in one of the newspapers. What \nare our priorities? Stopping terrorists, stopping drugs at the border? \nNo. Drugs or explosives? No. We are just checking to make sure you \ndon't take any loved ones with you.\n  Under this bill, it doesn't matter because even when you obey the law \nand follow the rules, you ultimately have your right extinguished.\n  It seems to me we have our values wrong. It is not about chain \nmigration, not about just looking at the ability to say that family \nreunification should not happen, especially when the burden is on the \nfamily member who happens to be a U.S. citizen. I simply believe the \nquestion before the Senate will be, are you willing to vote to \neliminate the right that exists today of a U.S. citizen who filed his \npapers, the Government took his money, he obeyed the law, followed the \nrules, you are going to take away his or her right? But you are going \nto give a right to individuals who didn't follow the law and obey the \nrules. I certainly don't believe that ultimately is in pursuit of the \nrule of law.\n  There are many organizations that have joined us. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have this list printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Asian American\n\n\n                                               Justice Center,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2007.\n       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned organizations, write to \n     urge you to vote yes on the Menendez-Hagel Amendment to \n     ensure fairness for U.S. citizens and their families. Without \n     this amendment, U.S. citizens will be punished for playing by \n     the rules and waiting in line to be reunited with their \n     family members.\n       The current immigration bill being considered by the Senate \n     contains a provision that would address the current family \n     backlog of people that have applied for lawful permanent \n     residence, but only for those who applied before May 1, 2005. \n     Applications that were filed by U.S. citizens to sponsor \n     their adult children or siblings after this cut-off date--an \n     estimated 833,000--would be thrown out. Not only does this \n     send the wrong message to people who are citizens and obey \n     the law, the government will be severely taxed with the \n     administrative cost of returning application fees for the \n     past two years.\n       Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Chuck Hagel (R-NE) have \n     introduced an amendment, co-sponsored by Senators Daniel \n     Akaka (D-HI), Hillary Clinton (D-NY), Christopher Dodd (D-\n     CT), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Daniel Inouye (D-HI), Frank \n     Lautenberg (D-NJ), and Barack Obama (D-IL), to the current \n     Senate bill that would correct this grave injustice by \n     changing the cut-off date for legal immigrant applicants from \n     May 1, 2005 to January 1, 2007--the same cut-off date that is \n     currently set for the legalization of undocumented \n     immigrants--and adding 110,000 green cards a year for a \n     meaningful backlog reduction so as to not lengthen the 8-year \n     deadline for clearing the adult children and sibling backlog.\n       By voting for the Menendez-Hagel Amendment, you will help \n     immigrants who have gone through the long and sometimes \n     arduous process of learning English and becoming citizens. \n     These Americans have filed applications and paid fees to the \n     U.S. government so that they can bring in their adult \n     children or siblings. They have made life choices based on \n     the very reasonable expectation that they would be eventually \n     reuniting with their family members. Our country can't tell \n     people who have been waiting patiently in line for visas that \n     we are now retroactively rewriting the rules and effectively \n     forcing them to start from scratch.\n       We urge you to vote yes on the Menendez-Hagel Amendment and \n     ensure our immigration system is fair for United States \n     citizens.\n           Very truly yours,\n         National Organizations: Asian American Justice Center; \n           Advocates for Children and Elders International; \n           American Friends Service Committee; American \n           Immigration Lawyers Association; Amerian-Arab Anti-\n           Discrimination Committee; Asian & Pacific Islander \n           American Health Forum; Association of Community \n           Organizations for Reform Now; Cambodian American \n           National Conference; Church World Service, Immigration \n           and Refugee Program; Coalition for Comprehensive \n           Immigration Reform; Democracia Ahora; Dominican \n           American National Roundtable; Ethiopian Community \n           Development Council; Federation of Indo-American \n           Seniors' Association of North America; Friends \n           Committee on National Legislation; Hate Free Zone; \n           Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society; Hmong National \n           Development; Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project; \n           Immigrant Legal Resource Center; International \n           Immigration; Foundation Japanese American Citizens \n           League; Kurdish Human Rights Watch; Laotian American \n           National Alliance; Latin American Legal Defense and \n           Education Fund; Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; \n           Legal Momentum; Lutheran Immigration and Refugee \n           Service; Mennonite Central Committee, Washington \n           Office; Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational \n           Fund; National Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the \n           Good Shepherd; National Alliance to Nurture the Aged \n           and the Youth; National Asian Pacific Center on Aging; \n           National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed \n           Officials Educational Fund; National Council of La \n           Raza; National Korean American Service & Education \n           Consortium; National Immigration Forum; National \n           Immigration Law Center; NETWORK, A National Catholic \n           Social Justice Lobby; Organization for Justice & \n           Equality; Organization of Chinese Americans; People For \n           the American Way; Sikh Council on Religion and \n           Education; Sojourners/Call to Renewal; Somali Family \n           Care Network; South Asian American Leaders of Tomorrow; \n           Southeast Asia Resource Action Center; Unitarian \n           Universalist Association of Congregations; United \n           Methodist Church, General Board of Church and Society; \n           U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops; World Relief.\n         Local Organizations: Asian American Federation of New \n           York; Asian American Institute, Chicago, IL; Asian Law \n           Caucus, San Francisco, CA; Asian Pacific American Legal \n           Center of Southern California; CASA of Maryland; Causa, \n           Oregon; Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition; EI CENTRO \n           de Igualdad y Derechos, Albuquerque, NM; Filipino-\n           American Coalition of Florida; Filipino American \n           Political Alliance of Florida; Fresno \n           Interdenominational Refugee Ministry; Guru Gobind Singh \n           Foundation Sikh Center, Rockville, Maryland; Illinois \n           Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights; Iowa \n           Citizens for Community Improvement; Korean Resource \n           Center, Los Angeles, CA; Korean American Resource & \n           Cultural Center, Chicago, IL; La Casita: Servicios \n           Legales para inmigrantes, Trenton, NJ; Latin American \n           Community Center, Wilmington, DE; Massachusetts \n           Immigrant And Refugee Advocacy Coalition; National \n           Capital Immigrant Coalition; New Jersey Immigration \n           Policy Network; New York Immigration Coalition; \n           Northwest Federation of Community Organizations; OCA--\n           South Florida Chapter; Stone Soup Fresno; Tennessee \n           Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition; The Pyonghoa \n           Gospel Church, Flushing, NY; United Chinese Association \n           of Florida; YKASEC--Empowering the Korean American \n           Community, Flushing, NY.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. There are 80 of them. I will not read them all, but I \nwant to give a sense of some who have moral authority behind them, as \nit relates to saying the Senate should adopt this amendment: The Church \nWorld Service; the Hebrew Immigrant Aids Society; the Lutheran \nImmigration\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\nand Refugee Service; the Mennonite Central Committee; NETWORK, a \nNational Catholic Social Justice Lobby; the Unitarian Universalist \nAssociation of Congregations; the United Methodist Church; the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops; and a whole host of organizations that \nare not religious in nature but clearly are advocates from all of the \ndifferent sectors of society: For example, the Asian American Justice \nCenter, the Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum, the \nFederation of Indo-American Seniors' Association of North America, the \nFriends Committee on National Legislation, the National Association of \nLatino Elected and Appointed Officials, the National Council of La \nRaza, the National Korean American Service & Education Consortium, to \nmention a few. They all believe this Senate should be putting its votes \nwhere its values are, into the reunification of families.\n  Finally, I know there will be an attempt to offer what we call a \nside-by-side, something to try to produce a figleaf for those who don't \nwant to be seen as casting a vote against family reunification, a vote \nagainst snuffing out the rights of U.S. citizens. And that figleaf \nactually would do absolutely nothing. What it would do is guarantee the \nunderlying bill. It would guarantee that a U.S. citizen who obeyed the \nlaw, followed the rules, did everything right, had their family member \nwaiting, it would guarantee that their right would be snuffed out. It \nwould guarantee that they would go to the back of the line, a line in \nwhich there are people who didn't follow the law, obey the rules, \nviolated the law, and they will be in the back of the line with them.\n  That amendment that is going to be offered clearly is a figleaf. It \nclearly is poorly constructed. It doesn't deal with the present \nrealities of undermining that right of a U.S. citizen. It does nothing \nto preserve the right of those people who filed and who are now being \nsnuffed out, being cut out in terms of the rights of those U.S. \ncitizens because of the underlying bill.\n  There is only one way to make this right. There is only one way to \npreserve family reunification. There is only one way to preserve the \nrights of these individuals who wore the uniform of the United States, \nwho were good enough to wear the uniform, serve their country, and \nshould have the right, which this bill snuffs out, to claim family \nmembers. There is only one way of making sure we don't turn this into \nan abstract object of chain migration, but that we understand the core \nvalues of family; that we understand a child who turns 21 is no less a \nchild you love dearly and want to be with and who doesn't stop being \npart of your nuclear family because they magically turned 21 and are \nnow nonnuclear. That is what is at stake in this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Menendez-Hagel, and others, \namendment so that, in fact, we can still stay within the ``grand \nbargain'' but we can do what is right on family reunification.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Klobuchar are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and \nask unanimous consent that the quorum call be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As we noted earlier, we are going to have a series of \nvotes at 6:45. I wanted to address the amendment which has been offered \nby my friend, Senator Sessions from Alabama, which relates to the \nearned-income tax credit.\n  I see the Senator from Alabama has just arrived, so I will be glad to \nlet him make his presentation and then respond. If that is what the \nSenator would like to do, I will withhold.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think I am ready, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1235\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for his \ncourtesy, and I would just like to make some general comments about the \nearned-income tax credit and why I think this is important. I ask that \nI be notified in 20 minutes if I have gone that far.\n  The earned-income tax credit is one of the major--the major, in \nfact--transfer programs in the Federal Government. It is a payment of \nmonies, in reality. It doesn't work the way it was intended, but in \nreality, it provides a substantial check every year to persons who are \nlow-wage workers. It is for people who are trying to do well but are \nnot making much money, so they give them a check to encourage work. I \nhave felt for some time--and maybe I will talk with Senator Kennedy one \nday about it, and we might reach an agreement on this--I think it would \nbe much better if tax credit were paid along with your paycheck. It is \ndesigned to increase--it is allowed, under the EITC, but we don't do it \nthat way. You file a return, and the next year, after you have \ncompleted your year's work, they send you a large check. On average, \nthe recipient receives a benefit of almost $1,800 a year; that is, the \npeople who qualify receive that amount. Again, the people who qualify \nare individuals who are working in lower wage jobs, which, in fact, are \nthe types of jobs most of the 12 million illegal aliens are doing. They \nare working at low-wage jobs. Therefore, we can expect there will be a \ndisproportionate number of persons who will qualify for this tax \ncredit.\n  Now, the tax credit was designed to encourage Americans to work--\nAmerican citizens. When it started in the 1970s under President Nixon, \nthey thought there had to be some incentive so that you would get more \nmoney by working than by drawing welfare, or else you would just stay \nhome and draw welfare. There still is a problem with that, in reality. \nBut this bill was supposed to incentivize work, and that is why it was \ndrafted the way it was and has continued to grow and become quite \nsubstantial. But, again, it was designed to take care of American \ncitizens, our own people.\n  Now, we are into an immigration reform bill where we have 12 million \npeople here who came into our country illegally. They are being \nconsidered for amnesty. They are going to be allowed to stay in this \ncountry and be given that right. Maybe some didn't want it or didn't \nexpect it, but they will be given the right to stay here. But under \npresent law, because they are not legally here, they are certainly not \nentitled to the earned-income tax credit. Unless they file fraudulent \ndocuments and receive it fraudulently, they don't get an earned-income \ntax credit.\n  So we say we are going to have a $1,000 fine that people must pay as \npart of a punishment for being in the country illegally, and it is not \nreally amnesty because they pay a fine, but in reality, the fine can be \npaid on the installment plan, and only $200 has to be paid the first \nyear when you apply for the Z visa. So under the bill, as I understand \nit--I think there is little dispute about it--as soon as this bill \npasses, everybody can come in and get a probationary legal status in \nAmerica, and then before long, they are entitled to apply for and \nreceive a Z visa that is good for 4 years. It can be renewed \nindefinitely. At some point, they can apply, if they so choose, for \nlegal permanent residency.\n  What I want to tell my colleagues is that not only will we be \nproviding amnesty to the persons who came into our country illegally \nfor a $200 payment, we will be giving them--even for the temporary \nprobationary status and the\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\nZ visa, prior to legal permanent residency, the earned-income tax \ncredit. I think that is quite a step. Indeed, you pay $200 for your \nfine, and you file your tax return next year and get a $1,800 check \nfrom Uncle Sam.\n  Don't be mistaken, the earned-income tax credit is for people who \ndon't pay income tax. It is a gift from Uncle Sam. It is meant to \nencourage Americans to get out and work, not to encourage people to \ncome into our country illegally to gain this benefit. So I just would \nsay to my colleagues, this is an important principle.\n\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office--and they run the \nnumbers on this--it is the largest single benefit program and cost of \nthis bill in the first 10 years--not in the outyears; there are some \nbig costs that aren't being calculated. But in the first 10 years, this \nis the largest direct single benefit.\n\n       Over the 2008 to 2017 period--\n\n  Ten years--\n\n       the Joint Tax Committee estimates that S.A. 1150 would \n     increase outlays for refundable tax credits by about $13 \n     billion, the largest direct spending effect of the \n     legislation. Enacting 1150 would increase the amount of \n     refundable tax credits mainly by increasing the number of \n     resident aliens for income tax purposes.\n\n  In other words, it would increase the number of people eligible.\n\n       Resident aliens are taxed in the same manner as U.S. \n     citizens and thus could qualify for the refundable tax \n     credit.\n\n  They are taxed, but they are not going to be paying high taxes \nbecause many of them are lower income people, but they will get the tax \ncredit.\n  So my amendment would reduce the bill's direct spending cost, the \ncost to the American taxpayer. Who pays the big check they get every \nyear? Who pays the check they get every year? They are not paying it. \nIt is the taxpayers, the American taxpayers. It is an additional reward \non top of the amnesty that is provided. So my amendment would reduce \nthe estimated cost of this legislation by nearly half, No. 1, and it is \nright, and it is fair.\n  Now, last year, my amendment--which I believed was justified, but \nthis Congress didn't agree--said you would not receive the earned-\nincome tax credit until you became a citizen. Why not? How is an \nillegal alien able to come here, not expecting the earned-income tax \ncredit, and then be rewarded with it by our government? That never made \nsense to me.\n  But in this legislation--because I think it is important, and we can \nmake a big difference here--in this legislation I have offered, it \nwould simply say that during the time you have a probationary visa or a \nZ visa up until the time you become a legal permanent resident, you \nwouldn't get the earned-income tax credit. How much simpler is it than \nthat?\n  I hope my colleagues will see that this is a perfectly logical \namendment, and I would suggest it reflects on our mindset, our approach \nto this entire process, if we are not able to draw this kind of line as \nwe go through passing--or attempting to pass--this historic piece of \nlegislation. I really think we should give thought to that and ask \nourselves what right does somebody who came into our country illegally, \nwho has been here maybe for a number of years, expect to receive this \nbenefit, where we say: OK, we are just going to give up; we are not \ngoing to make you go home; we will let you stay; you can have amnesty. \nBy the way, you start receiving the earned-income tax credit of $2,000. \nHow much sense does that make? I don't think that is good public \npolicy. It raises questions about how serious we are about defining our \nimmigration system in a way that works, that has bright lines, and \ncarries out a logical policy. But I understand that people are \ndetermined to see that this goes forward.\n  Now, Senator Reid has offered an amendment that is going to be a \nside-by-side. This amendment is very short, and basically all the \namendment says is--I don't have it before me. Our majority leader, our \nDemocratic majority leader, is offering an amendment that says: Well, \nwe will comply with all the current laws of the IRS, and you don't get \nthe earned-income tax credit if you are illegal. Well, of course. That \nmeans zero--nothing. I have to tell my colleagues, I am amazed at that \namendment, unless I have missed something entirely, because that is \nwhat it is all about. They won't be illegal when they are given the \nprobationary status or the Z visa status. They become legal and would \nget it. I was going to meet with some of the White House people to \ndiscuss this issue. I don't think they understood it that way, and I am \nnot sure the President understood that this was actually going to \nhappen under the legislation. But if this bill becomes law, they would \nget it.\n  So you say: Well, maybe they wouldn't get it. Well, if they don't get \nit, why wouldn't you vote for my amendment, which quite plainly assures \nthat they don't get it? Follow me?\n  So I don't understand this cover amendment. It is not even a fig \nleaf, I say to my colleagues. I don't think you are going to be able to \nhide behind the Reid amendment because it is not going to do anything \nbut guarantee that persons who are here and are given this amnesty will \npay $200 and then they will get to draw nearly $2,000 a year under the \nearned-income tax credit.\n  The amendment being offered by Senator Reid makes no sense to me. \nMaybe I missed something, but I don't think so. I would be delighted to \nhear what is in play. It is what you call a cover amendment. So what I \nsay to my colleagues is, let's get realistic about what we are doing. \nLet's understand the cost this legislation is going to have. The \nCongressional Budget Office has found in their report--although it was \nwritten so that it is a little hard to find, but it is perfectly \nplain--the bill, over 10 years, will cost the American taxpayers $32 \nbillion. A substantial chunk of that amount is the earned-income tax \ncredit. They say the earned-income tax credit is for children. It is \nnot for children, it is for American workers. You may get more if you \nhave children, but it is not for children, it is for American workers.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of my time on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Arizona on the \nSenate floor. I was going to respond at some time to the Senator from \nAlabama. I am glad to wait until the Senator from Arizona is finished.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, since \nit is important that, prior to a meeting we have at 5:30, to speak to \nan amendment offered by Senator Menendez.\n  I want to be clear that we have a side-by-side amendment that we will \nalso be voting on, which I think goes to the heart of what Senator \nMenendez is trying to get at here, but it does so in a way that will \nnot upset the bipartisan consensus that has been worked out on the \nlegislation.\n  I think the Menendez amendment has been discussed in the past. It is \nan amendment that would, in significant ways, change the basic \nagreement that has been made by some of the Senators. Therefore, it \nwould be very problematic were it to pass. There is a budget point of \norder against the Menendez amendment, and that point of order will be \nraised. Because of the extra cost that would be imposed by additional \nimmigrants being permitted to come into the country over time, in fact, \nI think there is more than one budget point of order because of those \nincreased costs. The general proposition is that some have said the \nbill is not family friendly and that we need to do more for families. I \nwant to try to dispel that, Mr. President.\n  We start out with the proposition that somewhere between 12 million \nand who knows how many million illegal immigrants who are in the United \nStates, for the most part, are going to be able to stay. If everything \nthat can be expected of them is accomplished, they have the ability to \napply for a green card and eventually potentially become citizens of \nthe United States of America. That is a tremendous benefit for people \nwho came illegally.\n  One of the reasons some of us have been willing to accommodate that \nis people have come here with families or have created families here, \nand we do not want to disrupt those families.\n  Secondly, there are family visas that historically have been issued \nby the United States. This bill doesn't in any way affect the ability \nof any legal permanent resident or citizen to bring\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\ninto the United States their spouse or minor children. That is the so-\ncalled nuclear family.\n  In addition, 40,000 parents per year can be brought into the United \nStates, and there are extraordinarily liberal visitations for parents \nbeyond that 40,000 number. We have said the so-called nonnuclear \nfamily--the extended family--in the future is going to compete the same \nas workers are going to compete, so that we can get in balance with \nsome of our competitors in the global economy, where more of the visas \nare reserved for work purposes and fewer for family purposes. But in \nthe meantime, some 4 million people, roughly, who have applied for a \nfamily visa--extended or nonnuclear family--are going to be allowed to \nimmigrate to the United States, and instead of taking 30 or 40 years, \nin some cases, it is going to all happen within an 8-year period of \ntime. That is extraordinarily helpful to families and family \nreunification.\n  Now, it is true, if somebody has come here illegally and their family \nis still outside the country, we don't permit that family to come. But \nthe object, obviously, is to try to encourage that individual to go \nback with his family. That would be family reunification.\n  But the problem the Menendez amendment poses is, instead of allowing \nthose people who have applied for visas for extended families who have \na reasonable expectation to come to the United States, he would change \nthe date that measures their eligibility in such a way as to allow a \nlot of people--thousands, hundreds of thousands, actually--to immigrate \nto the United States who, today, under current law, have no reasonable \nexpectation they would ever make it to the United States. What we have \ntried to do is to be fair and say, if you have a reasonable expectation \nyou will be permitted to immigrate to the United States, we will allow \nyou to come in, and we will do it within a very short period of time--8 \nyears, or perhaps less than that period of time, as opposed to the \nperhaps 20 or 30 years it may have otherwise taken. If you didn't have \na reasonable expectation to get in, then you are not going to come.\n  The reason the date was drawn where it was in May 2005 is that \nrepresented a compromise. I believe the original date was March or July \nof 2004--the time when people who were in line but had no reasonable \nexpectation--that their application was going to be processed and were \nnotified by the U.S. Government. Basically, the Government said: For \nthe time, we are not going to be processing these numbers anymore \nbecause the backlog is too long. The backlog numbers are truly \nastounding. There are people in Mexico, for example, who have no \nreasonable expectation of getting here. For example, if you are the \nbrother or sister of a U.S. citizen, and if you are a Mexican national \nand you recently filed to become a legal permanent resident of the \nUnited States, you have an expected wait of about 80 years. So even if \nyou are 21 years of age, at the time when you can expect to get here \nyou would be 101 years of age. That is not a reasonable expectation you \nwill be allowed into the United States.\n\n  I went to Senator Menendez and said: I think you have a point because \nwe have drawn an arbitrary deadline. Remember, the date at which they \nwere told we were no longer going to be processing, temporarily, these \napplications was in 2004. But in order to be more liberal, we moved the \ndate to May 2005. His argument was, there may be some people who still \nhad an expectation because they filed last year, and maybe they had an \nexpectation they could make it.\n  I said: You know, there may be some such people, so let's take a look \nat it and see if we can redo this so everybody who had a reasonable \nexpectation they could get here will be allowed to be here, no matter \nwhen they applied--whether it was 2 years ago, last year, 2 months ago, \nor 10 or 12 years ago--if they had a reasonable expectation of getting \nin.\n  We have crafted an amendment that I offered to Senator Menendez, but \nhe preferred to go forward with his amendment. But the side-by-side \nthat I will be proposing is an amendment that stretches the date out to \n2027. It says: If you had a reasonable expectation, based upon your \ncategory of immigration, the country you are from, the lines that \ncurrently exist with that country, if you had a reasonable expectation \nwithin the next 20 years you could have made it into the United States, \nthen you get to come in under a family visa. That is extraordinarily \nliberal--everybody who really had an expectation that they could make \nit. Like I said, if you are this Mexican national, and you are the \nbrother of an American citizen, and you were 21 years of age when you \napplied, you would be over 100 years old today. That is not a \nreasonable expectation. So you would not be permitted to come into the \nUnited States. You never had a reasonable expectation that you could \nmake it.\n  The effect of my amendment and the Menendez amendment is almost \nidentical in terms of the number of people who would be allowed to come \nto the United States. There is only a 3,000 difference out of about \n600,000 people. So we are not reducing the number of people. We are \nmaking it accurate as to who can actually come.\n  There is also a general notion that somehow we are being unfair to \nfamilies. As Senator Kennedy has frequently pointed out, after this \nlegislation is passed, for a period of 8 years, the total family \npercentage coming into the United States will be 74 percent. And you \nadd another 15 percent for humanitarian visas, and there is only 11 \nleft for the employment visas. Today, 65 percent are family visas. In \nsubsequent years, families will still be the majority of immigrants to \nthe United States--51 percent. Then you add to that another 17 percent \nfor asylum seekers and other humanitarian visas; 17 percent of the \ntotal is a very humane number for the United States. We can still be \nvery proud of our tradition of allowing the poor, hungry, and \ndowntrodden to come to this country, and we will still have a majority \nof family-based visas in this country.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. For those who are worried about this, on the issue of \nfamilies, you should be worried about this. Is it not true that in this \nbill, in terms of family reunification, the way we have accomplished or \ndealt with the bill, families will be reunified decades earlier, and \nthose who are waiting to join their families under this bill--those who \nhave done it right--will be together no later than 8 years; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KYL. That is exactly correct. Instead of waiting 20, 30 years, \nthey will have to wait no longer than 8 years.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So if you want to be the person who keeps families apart, \nbring this bill down. I assure families will not be reunified under the \ncurrent system like they are here, that we will have a dramatic \nincrease in green cards to get these families reunited. We go up to 74 \npercent. If you want to keep families apart, bring this bill down and \nlet the current system survive.\n  Secondly, when it comes to families, there are 12 million people here \nillegally. Is it not true that their families, under this bill--if they \nwill do the right thing--will never live in fear again?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, to me, that is one of the main features of \nthe bill. Today, we have people who are being exploited, people against \nwhom crimes are being committed, but they are afraid to report it to \nthe law enforcement authorities. They are not being paid adequate wages \nand their working conditions are poor. Frankly, they are being taken \nadvantage of. As long as they are in this gray status, that will \ncontinue.\n  This bill offers them immediately an opportunity to begin a process \nby which they are playing by the rules and, as a result of that, they \ncan have the freedom and the assurance of being protected by the laws \nof the United States.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To my good friend from Arizona, I say this: If you are \nconcerned about the 12 million people who are living in fear, subject \nto exploitation, then this is the best chance you will ever have in my \npolitical lifetime to fix it. If you want to bring this bill down, the \none thing I can assure you is that the 12 million, or however many \nthere may be, will not only live in fear, they are going to live in \nmore fear because we have stirred up a hornets nest in this country.\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\n  I argue, if you care about people who have families not being afraid \nanymore, if they get themselves right with the law, help us pass this \nbill. In the future, after everybody has been accommodated who has a \nreasonable expectation, we are going to allow families to be part of \nthe new immigration system.\n  Could the Senator tell me again, in the future, what percentage of \nvisas will be given to families?\n  Mr. KYL. The answer I give the Senator is that family visas alone are \n51 percent--a majority--and another 17 percent is humanitarian.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator acknowledge that is twice the family \ncomponent of other nations with whom we are competing?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that is almost exactly right. I know in the \ncase of--in fact, I will give you the exact number. In Canada, it is 24 \npercent. If we have 51 percent, obviously, that is close to twice that \nnumber. In Australia, it is 27 percent. And, again, if we are at 51 \npercent in the future, that is almost exactly twice. But remember, that \nis only after 8 years. For the next 8 years, it is 74 percent because \nof what the Senator from South Carolina was pointing out.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the bottom line, I say to my good friend \nfrom Arizona, is we would have no bill without him. He stepped to the \nplate and said I am willing to look at the 12 million anew; I don't \nbelieve we are going to deport them, and I don't believe we are going \nto put them in jail; So I am going to give them a chance to identify \nthemselves, come out of the shadows and do things that will make them \nvaluable to our country and will be fair and humane.\n  We have accomplished that. We couldn't do it last year. We are going \nto reunite families who have been waiting for decades to get into this \ncountry. We are going to expedite family reunions in an 8-year period \nfor some people because they would not live long enough to get back \nwith their families.\n  In the future, we are going to have a new system. There is going to \nbe a strong family component, but I make no apologies about this, in \nthe future we are going to have immigration based on the global economy \nand merit. We need to start looking at where we are in the world and \nmaking sure people come into our country under a merit-based system. \nNeither one of my parents graduated high school. There is a way forward \nfor the semiskilled and low-skilled workers to come into our country in \nthe future. But the family component in the future will be spouses and \nminor children, freeing up thousands of green cards for merit-based \nemployment. They are not going to bring in their adult children unless \nthey have a way to get in on their own. They are not going to bring in \ntheir third cousin. Nobody else does that. They are going to come in as \na nuclear family, and we are going to do it based on merit, and merit \nis not a degree.\n  Under this bill, if you come in with a strong back and a strong heart \nand a desire to get ahead, you get points for getting a GED, you get \npoints for an apprenticeship, you get points for doing the things that \nmake you a better person. So I reject completely the idea that the \nmerit-based system excludes hard-working people.\n  I end with this one thought. If we don't get it right now and correct \nthe flaws in our system which led to the 12 million which will make us \nglobally noncompetitive, then who will? When will they do it? There are \na million reasons to say no to something this hard, there are 12 \nmillion reasons to say yes, and there are many reasons in the future to \nsay yes because our country cannot survive with a broken immigration \nsystem that makes us noncompetitive.\n  This is a national security issue. This is a global economic issue. \nNow is the time to understand we will never have a perfect bill but to \ndo something that will be good for America.\n  I thank my good friend, Jon Kyl, and Senator Kennedy for getting us \nthis far.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate that from the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Let me make one final point. I know Senator Kennedy wishes to speak.\n  It was not easy for some people to agree to allow at least 12 million \nimmigrants who came to this country illegally to stay here and \neventually become citizens. That was not easy. One of the bases upon \nwhich we were able to do that was to respond to an argument that had \nfrequently been made: Why should we let all those people, is the way it \nis described, become U.S. citizens and then chain migrate all their \nfamily--their uncles, cousins, grandparents, and so on? The answer to \nthat question is we probably shouldn't. So that was ended in this \nlegislation. That is what was stopped. That is part of the agreement \nthat was reached, the consensus that was reached.\n  The adoption of the Menendez amendment would undo that. You can \nimagine how someone like me feels. I have taken a lot of heat for \nagreeing that the people who are here illegally should stay here, but I \nknew one of the reasons that was more palatable was because we had at \nleast stopped the chain migration that would occur for anybody \nsubsequently in the future, after we cleared the backlog of people who \nalready applied.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, I will be happy to yield. I was going to conclude and \nturn to Senator Kennedy. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. One point. Remember how the Senator from Arizona said \nhow all ``those people'' would be able to claim their families. The \nMenendez amendment has nothing to do with ``those people.'' The \nMenendez amendment has everything to do with U.S. citizens today who \nhave a right under the law. So I hope we do not confuse both of those.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New Jersey that \nwhat he said, as far as he said it, is, of course, exactly correct. \nWhat I was talking about was the tradeoff that existed between the \naccommodation to the 12 million people and--by the way, I don't use \nthat phrase ``those people.'' I hope the Senator understands that I was \nreferring to the criticism of those who say we shouldn't allow the \nillegal immigrants in the country, especially if we chain migrate their \nfamilies. We ended the chain migration.\n  We had to draw a time when applicants would be able to apply and \ntheir applications would be considered. We had it at one point. We \nagreed to move that date to accommodate the people on the Democratic \nside of the aisle. The Menendez amendment would move it to January 1 of \nthis year, bringing in, I think, a total of well over 800,000 people. \nThat, obviously, would undo the rather delicate balance of agreements \nthat was reached that deals with this subject.\n  Recognizing, however, we wanted to make sure anybody who had a \nreasonable expectation of being able to immigrate should be able to do \nso, we have prepared an amendment that would, in fact, allow anybody \nwith a reasonable expectation to be able to immigrate here. We put the \ndate way back to 2027, and we say that if you could have reasonably \nexpected to get here by 2027, you are in and you are in within an 8-\nyear period from now.\n  I think that is very fair. The person who is excluded under our \nproposal is the person who, as I said, is the sibling of a Mexican \nnational who is a sibling of a U.S. citizen who might be 101 years old \nwhen he gets to the United States of America. That is not a reasonable \nexpectation.\n\n  I think our approach is reasonable. It is consistent with the \nunderlying agreement we reached. I regret to say--and I appreciate the \nSenator from New Jersey has every right to raise a budget point of \norder on the underlying bill--we fully expected there would be points \nof order at the conclusion presumably of the consideration of the bill \nand we would have to vote on those. Obviously, it is a 60-vote point of \norder. We expected to have 60 people who would support the legislation, \nand we believe that to be the case. But if the Senator wants to bring \nthe bill down, as the Senator from South Carolina said, by raising an \namendment such as that which has been proposed or at this time trying \nto conclude the budget point of order, I don't think that is the best \nway forward.\n  As the Senator from South Carolina said, we have one good chance to \nget legislation passed. I don't think we want to blow that chance. Now \nis our time. We were sent here to do difficult\n\n[[Page S7137]]\n\njobs. I hope, in the bipartisan spirit that has so far characterized \nour debate, we can move forward and continue to keep this bill as \nliterally a beacon of hope for a lot of people who are counting on us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Vermont is \nlooking for some time to speak. I believe there is 30 minutes I have \nremaining; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, wants time. \nI yield 10 minutes to Senator Lieberman. I will use probably 6 or 7 \nminutes. I will be more than glad to give 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Vermont if not, we will try and extend that if we can.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I might interrupt the Senator for a \nquestion. Would it be possible also to make sure Senator Domenici will \nbe able to speak after the Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take 5 minutes of the 30 minutes; Senator \nDomenici can have 5 minutes; 10 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman; and 10 minutes to the Senator from Vermont, \nMr. Sanders. I think that takes up 30 minutes. I ask unanimous consent \nthat another minute be given to each of us, 33 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1234\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will be brief in response to the \nSessions amendment. We are talking about the earned-income tax credit. \nThat was developed in the 1970s. Why was the earned-income tax credit \ndeveloped? Because of the increased number of children living in \npoverty.\n  We have, as this chart shows, in the United States more children who \nlive in poverty than any other country in the world. This amendment \nwould say to legal immigrants that you are not eligible for the earned-\nincome tax credit that benefits children.\n  If we look at the report from the CRS, it shows that over 98 percent \nof the earned-income tax credit goes to families with children. That \nwas its purpose, that is where it is focused, that was the reason for \nit, and this is the need.\n  Why in the world would we want to take benefits away from needy \nchildren? Who are the workers of the earned-income tax credit? Their \naverage income is less than $20,000 a year. This is phased out at about \n$30,000 to $33,000 a year. This is the low-income individuals who are, \nwhat? Are they on welfare or are they out working? They are working. \nThey have children. They are legal. Why take the benefits away from the \nchildren, the neediest children, most of whom are living in poverty?\n  We don't take the earned-income tax credit away from people who go to \njail and commit murder. We don't take away the earned-income tax credit \nfrom people who have defrauded the Government. We don't take the earned \ntax credit away from burglars, child molesters, and the rest of the \nindividuals who commit crimes. But this amendment wants to take it from \none particular group and that is legal workers.\n  Who are those legal workers? They are trying to provide for their \nfamilies, pay the penalties, show that they are working, and go to the \nend of the line. Many of these children are American children. They are \nnot undocumented. They are American children because they were born \nhere.\n  I find it difficult to understand, when we are talking about \nindividuals who are working, who want to work, will work, are trying to \nmake a better future for themselves and their families and particularly \nfor their children, why they should be the only class of working people \nin the United States who ought to be penalized. That is what the \nSessions amendment would do. That is wrong and it is not fair and it \nshould not be accepted.\n  Mr. President, I yield the time as I have indicated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for yielding me \ntime.\n  As I think we all know, this is a long and complicated bill. An \nimportant part of this bill deals with illegal immigration--how do we \nmake sure we stop the flow of illegal immigrants into this country; how \ndo we finally begin to deal with employers who are knowingly hiring \nillegal immigrants; what do we do with 12 million people who are in \nthis country who, in my view, we are not going to simply, in the middle \nof the night, throw out of this country. These are difficult and \nimportant issues.\n  On those issues I am in general agreement with the thrust of this \nlegislation. But, Mr. President, I wish to tell you there are areas in \nthis bill where I have strong disagreement, and one is the issue of \nlegal immigration, what we are doing in terms of bringing people into \nthis country who, in my view, will end up lowering wages for American \nworkers right now.\n  Senator Kennedy a moment ago made a very important point. He talked \nabout the truth that in our country today we have the highest rate of \nchild poverty of any major country on Earth. That is a national \ndisgrace. But on top of that, we have the highest rate of poverty of \nany major country on Earth. In fact, since President Bush has been in \noffice, 5 million more Americans have slipped into poverty.\n  Today, in our country, as many people know, the middle class is \nshrinking. Millions of American workers are working longer hours for \nlower wages. In my State of Vermont, it is not uncommon for people to \nwork two jobs, even three jobs, to make enough income to pay their \nbills. According to a recent Pew-Brookings Institute study, men in \ntheir 30s earned, on average, 12 percent less in 2004 than their \nfathers did in 1974, after adjusting for inflation. In other words, in \nAmerica, we are moving in the wrong direction. Our standard of living, \nin many ways, is going down. If we don't reverse trends, our kids will \nhave a lower standard of living than we have.\n  Now, in the midst of all of that, we are finding many large \ncorporations, both those who employ skilled workers--professional \nworkers--and those who employ low-wage workers, that are coming to this \nbody and are saying, my goodness, yes, we are outsourcing millions of \ndecent-paying jobs; yes, we have opposed vigorously raising the minimum \nwage; yes, we have done everything we can to make sure workers can't \nform unions, but what we want to do now, because we love the American \npeople so much and we are so concerned about the American worker, what \nwe want to do now is bring millions of new workers into this country, \nboth low-wage workers and professional workers.\n  The argument there is Americans don't want to do the work. They say: \nWe can't find American workers to do the work. That is a crock, in many \ninstances. It is not true. One of the groups that has come to Congress \nto tell us how much they are concerned about the need to find workers \nbecause they can't find Americans to do the jobs is our old friends at \nWal-Mart.\n  As many Americans know, Wal-Mart pays low wages. They often hire \npeople for 30 hours a week rather than 40 hours a week, and they \nprovide minimal health care benefits. Yet Wal-Mart has come in and \nsaid: Well, we can't find the workers. Bring us in more low-wage \nworkers.\n  Well, guess what. Two years ago, when Wal-Mart announced the opening \nof a new store in Oakland, CA, guess how many people showed up for that \njob in Oakland, CA, at a Wal-Mart. Eleven thousand people showed up--\n11,000 people showed up in Oakland--filled out applications for a job \nwhen only 400 jobs were available. Eleven thousand people for 400 jobs.\n  Wal-Mart says they need more low-wage workers coming in from around \nthe world because they can't find workers. Well, that was a couple of \nyears ago. So you might say: Well, that doesn't happen today. In \nJanuary of 2006, when Wal-Mart announced the opening of a store in \nEvergreen Park, just outside of Chicago, in your home State, Mr. \nPresident, 24,500 people applied for 2,325 jobs. Yet Wal-Mart and their \nfriends are coming in here saying we can't find Americans who want to \nwork.\n  Let us be clear. Wal-Mart does not provide good wages, does not \nprovide good benefits, does not provide good health care, yet we are \nfinding many people who want to do that because\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\npeople in this country are desperate, because people in this country \nwant to work at almost any job.\n  Some of the people at the other end of the economic spectrum, the \npeople who are hiring professionals, make the same argument. There are \norganizations out there, including companies such as Motorola, Dell, \nIBM, Microsoft, Intel, and Boeing, that say the same thing: We can't \nfind professionals to do the jobs. I find it interesting that while \nthese companies claim they can't find workers in the United States, \nsome of these very same companies have recently announced major layoffs \nof thousands of American workers.\n  Let me repeat that. These companies are saying we desperately need to \nbring workers from other countries into America because we can't find \npeople in the United States to do these skilled jobs. Yet, at the same \ntime, they are laying off tens of thousands of American workers.\n  Let me give a few examples. A few days ago, the Los Angeles Times \nreported Dell would be eliminating 10 percent of its workforce, \nslashing 8,800 jobs. Dell is part of the group saying we need to bring \nmore professionals into America. Meanwhile, as Dell has eliminated \ndecent-paying jobs in the U.S., it applied for nearly 400 H-1B visas \nlast year.\n  But Dell is not alone. On May 31, the Financial Times reported \nMotorola would be cutting 4,000 jobs on top of an earlier 3,500-job \nreduction designed to generate savings of some $400 million. This is \nnothing new. Motorola has cut jobs in this country year after year \nafter year. But guess what. Motorola, part of a group saying they can't \nfind American workers, recently received 760 H-1B visas. That was last \nyear.\n  On May 30, Reuters reported IBM would be laying off more than 1,500 \nAmerican workers, bringing total layoffs to that company of 3,700 last \nyear. In April, CBS MarketWatch reported Citigroup announced it would \nbe laying off 17,000 workers, yet Citigroup received over 330 H-1B \nvisas.\n  Here is the point, and this is not a complicated point. Many of the \nlargest corporations in this country are supporting this legislation. \nAnd you know why? It is not because they are staying up late at night \nworrying about some Mexican kid in Detroit or Chicago and what will be \nthe future of that kid. They are not worrying about that. What they \nwant to see is a continued influx into this country of cheap labor. \nThey are not content with outsourcing millions of good-paying jobs. \nThey are not content with fighting against working people who want to \nform unions. They are not content with their opposition, successful \nuntil recently, of keeping the minimum wage at $5.15 an hour for 10 \nyears. That is not good enough. Now they are saying: Gee, we can't move \nWal-Mart from America to China, we can't move hotels to China, we can't \nmove restaurants to China, so what is the best way to continue keeping \nwages low for those workers?\n\n  When I was a kid, I worked in a hotel. I was a busboy. There is \nnothing wrong with that job. Millions of people do that job. I resent \nvery much the fact that many of these large corporations are continuing \ntheir war against the middle class and against the American worker. I \nthink it is high time the Senate begins to stand up for the American \nworker rather than the large multinational corporations who have so \nmuch sway over what we do in this body. I would hope before an \nimmigration bill is passed, it will respect the rights of American \nworkers, both low-wage workers and professional workers, and say that \nis our major responsibility, to make sure our kids----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute to yield to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My question, I guess, Mr. President, would be something \nlike this: Perhaps it could be true that the large number of job \napplications received by Wal-Mart facilities is because even though \nWal-Mart does not pay great wages, they do have health care benefits \nand job security, as opposed to construction work. Would the Senator \nagree that if businesses raised wages at the construction sites, if \nthey had jobs that had a more permanent status to them, and actually \noffered a retirement plan and health care benefits, they might get more \npeople willing to work at the construction sites?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Reclaiming my time, Mr. President, the Senator makes an \nimportant point, and that is we have all been educated that economics \nis about supply and demand. If you don't get the workers you want, you \nraise wages and you raise benefits. You don't simply open the door and \nbring in other workers at low wages.\n  The Senator makes an important point.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I came to the floor tonight for a few \nmoments to talk about the significance of the bill that is before us \nand the work that has been done by Senators and a couple of Cabinet \nmembers and great staff.\n  The American people have been telling us for many years that we are \nconfronted with a problem that is apt to destroy our land, destroy our \ncountry, destroy our values, and that problem is that we have an \ninability to control our borders. We have illegal immigrants who come \nacross our borders by the thousands who are, for the most part, \ninterested in jobs. But after some of them get here and their jobs are \nprocured, there are other things they bring with them or do here that \nmake the American people very worried about our future.\n  I, for one, as a Senator of long standing, grow more worried every \nyear as to whether we will ever be able to control our borders and thus \ncontrol who comes in and who goes out so that we know who they are. We \nhave heard the American people tell us this is our biggest \nresponsibility; that if we don't secure our borders, something bad is \ngoing to happen to our country. We have heard them tell us of the \nhorror stories that happen when some of these immigrants come here \nwithout authority, without the law on their side; they sneak in, in the \ndark of the night, or however they have been able to come, and then \nthey form gangs. We have heard about how they have scared our people, \nhurt them, killed them, and how they fight amongst each other. Of \ncourse, I am not talking about all of them. I am saying the American \npeople see this and say to us, can't you ever control our borders?\n  I want to say I think a terrific job has been done with this bill. It \nis not finished--there are a few more amendments that need to be \nconsidered and some time taken to review the final bill--but I believe \nthe bipartisan group that wrote this bill under the leadership of \nSenator Jon Kyl on the Republican side and Senator Ted Kennedy on the \nother side, working with their best staff for months, and then both day \nand night for the last 2 months, have put together a piece of \nlegislation that shows how you can work out practical differences if in \nfact your goal is significant and you forget about politics, you forget \nabout party, and you begin to write a law you can be proud of.\n  I think we are close to that. I don't think you get there very often. \nRarely do you get the opportunity to be part of such a law as a \nSenator. So for those who are going to vote against this bill, tonight \nthey are saying to themselves, I think I am going to vote against it, I \nask you and urge you to think of when you are going to be given an \nopportunity to vote on a bill, a piece of legislation that is more \nimportant than this. If we don't do it now, with your vote, when will \nwe do it?\n  If for some reason this bill fails, those who cause it to fail have \nto ask themselves, when will we get a bill we can rely on, that we can \ntrust, which is put together by good, practical people who resolved \nissues in a practical manner by working on the issues that are now \nconfronting us, which are that our borders are wide open and we have no \ncontrol over what is happening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7139]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am certain if, after we pass legislation such as \nthis, we provide the resources that are needed--and that is very \nimportant, and I think we are providing a means and a manner for \nresources to go to the border in this bill--and, secondly, if we \nannually make sure the resources and manpower are there to implement \nthis law--because it will require much by way of manpower, much by way \nof technology--if we give this law that, we will return to say this was \na historic event. Indeed, we will have done something good for America \nand good for our children. Something good for the families of existing \nimmigrants, good for immigrants who are coming in the future and their \nfamilies, who will also be permitted. We will also look for merit in \nthose who are coming to help America, which is competing in a very \ndifficult world.\n  I am very proud to be on the side of those who are trying to maintain \nthe measure intact, or practically intact, because you can't do much \nbetter than was done by this hard-working bipartisan group. The more \nyou try to change it, the more you risk losing it. When you end up \nthinking what did you lose it for, you end up really wondering whether \nyou did right for your country.\n\n  I urge that we move as fast as we can, giving Senators an \nopportunity, those who need it, and, yes, saying we are going to pass \nit soon--I don't know about tomorrow or the next day but certainly send \nto our leader a message that if you will give us an opportunity to call \nup a few more amendments, it will get accomplished.\n  I look forward to more debate, more amendments.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Who yields to the Senator? If \nno Senator yields time, then the time will be divided equally between \nboth sides.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be equally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1345\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, I ask that at the conclusion of the \nconsented time and the stacked votes, I be recognized to call up my \namendment No. 1345 and that after 2 minutes of consideration, the \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Who yields time to the Senator? At this time, the Senator from \nAlabama controls 17 minutes and the Senator from Texas 12.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is there any other time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not at this time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to yield to the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, I am very concerned that amendments to \nthis bill are being limited because there are many issues that deserve \nattention in this debate. For instance, in my home State of North \nCarolina, we have had a number of fatal automobile accidents caused by \nan intoxicated person who was in the United States illegally. Sadly, \njust yesterday morning on Interstate 40 near Raleigh, a man was killed \non his way to work when his vehicle was struck by an SUV barreling \nacross the median. The SUV driver, according to initial news reports, \nis an illegal alien, who now faces a number of criminal charges, \nincluding DWI.\n  In several of these incidents, the illegal alien driver has a record \nof DWI, sometimes repeated offenses, but has been caught and released. \nJust this past March, in Johnston County, NC, a 9-year-old boy and his \nfather lost their lives in an accident caused by an intoxicated driver \nwho had been convicted twice of drunken driving and had an outstanding \nwarrant stemming from a probation violation--and he was in the United \nStates illegally. Another tragic case was the death of Scott Gardner, a \nGaston County school teacher, who was killed in 2005 by a drunk \ndriver--a driver who was an illegal alien with five previous DWI \ncharges. I want to thank my colleague Richard Burr who introduced the \nScott Gardner Act to deal with this serious issue, and on the House \nside, my good friend Sue Myrick has been a true leader on this front.\n  I hear from many North Carolinians who ask me what is Washington \ndoing to stop this from happening. When are we going to take action to \nmake our communities safer.\n  Such senseless tragedies are not unique to North Carolina. Automobile \naccidents caused by intoxicated illegal aliens are occurring around the \nNation--too often killing innocent people who are just going about \ntheir daily lives, or leaving the victims with crippling, disabling \ninjuries.\n  It is a privilege, not a right, for an immigrant to receive legal \nstatus to live in the United States of America. My amendment would \nensure that this privilege is not granted to an illegal alien with a \nDWI conviction.\n  No question, our DWI laws should be vigorously enforced, regardless \nof the offender's immigration or citizenship status.\n  My amendment addresses an all too prevalent problem and should be \nconsidered. There are a number of other amendments that deserve a place \nin this debate. The bill we are considering would have enormous \nramifications for nearly every American, as well as those who want to \nwork in this country or become American citizens. We must do our due \ndiligence and not rush this bill through. The majority in this body \nmust not stifle the voice of the minority Members. More amendments must \nbe considered.\n  I yield back my remaining time to Senator Sessions, the Republican \nmanager.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Dole for her insight, sharing that \nimportant information, and for offering an amendment and demonstrating \nonce again that good amendments dealing with very important issues are \nnot being allowed to be considered. This is not a free and open debate. \nThis is not a free opportunity to amend. The majority leader is \ncontrolling his machinery, the train is moving down the track, and very \nfew amendments are being approved.\n  I have offered and filed quite a number. I have only gotten two \namendments, and I said at the beginning that only one would be voted \non. We are having the first vote on one I have offered.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent--I see my colleague, Senator \nKennedy, here--I ask unanimous consent that the pending business be set \naside and I be allowed to call up amendment No. 1253.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. On behalf of Senator Kennedy, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we have quite a number of other \namendments. That is what we are going to hear when we offer any of them \nbecause we now have a cloture motion filed. If cloture is obtained and \nyou don't have an amendment pending, you can't get a vote on it. We \nknow what the game is, and it is not a free, open debate on one of the \nmost important bills in the time that I have been in the Senate that we \nare considering today.\n  I would like to share a few more thoughts. Maybe I will have a few \nminutes left for Senator Lieberman. I know he wants more time than he \nhas gotten so far. Senator Kennedy is maneuvering for me to give him \nsome of my time and maybe I will be able to do that.\n  The earned-income tax credit will not be taken away from people who \nare illegally in the country today if my amendment is passed. The \nearned-income tax credit is a credit given to working individuals who \nhave lower incomes to encourage people to work. That is what it is all \nabout. It is for Americans and people legally here.\n  So what I propose is that we do not provide this, on average, almost \n$2,000-per-year paycheck from the U.S. Government, to people who came \ninto the\n\n[[Page S7140]]\n\ncountry illegally and were given this probationary card status through \ntheir Z card status.\n  I am not offering an amendment to take the earned-income tax credit \naway after they become legal permanent residents. So if they become a \nlegal permanent resident, they would be entitled to have the earned-\nincome tax credit.\n  Last year I offered an amendment that said that you would not get the \nearned-income tax credit until you became an actual citizen. That was \nvoted down. Why? I still am not sure. I still don't think that was a \ngood vote. But at least we ought not to give this credit to someone who \nwas here illegally a few days ago, and now we give them some sort of \nprobationary status and they immediately start getting paychecks from \nthe Federal Government.\n  I don't think that is what this system is about. People would be \ngiven a great thing. They would be given amnesty, they would be able to \nstay in the country legally, continue to work, and any family gets to \nstay with them. All of this is in this piece of legislation.\n  A lot of people think that is too generous, but that is what this \nlegislation does. The next question is: What else do they obtain by \nvirtue of having this legal status bestowed on them when they were \nillegal? They are not receiving the earned-income tax credit now. It is \nnot something that is being taken away from them. It is a question of \nwhen are we going to bestow that additional benefit on people who were \nin our country illegally and how much of an incentive does this payment \nto them create for other people who want to come into our country \nillegally?\n  That is some of the confusion we have. In my view, the first thing \nyou do to reduce the flow of illegal immigration into the country is to \nquit rewarding it by Federal largesse. That is the first thing. If you \ncannot go out and arrest everybody--and that is not practical--and we \nare not going to do these other things, at least don't give people \nextra financial benefits as a reward to coming into our country \nillegally.\n  I am very concerned about that. I think that it is not a little bitty \nmatter because the--Madam President, I would ask that I be notified \nwhen there is 5 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So what I would say to my colleagues is, this is going \nto cost a lot of money. You do not have to be trained in economics to \nunderstand that money comes from somebody. Who does the money come \nfrom? It comes from American workers and taxpayers, many of whom are \nhaving their wages depressed as a result of this huge flow of illegal \nlabor. They are being asked to pay an earned-income tax credit check of \n$1,800, on average, to individuals who were illegal a few months before \nand possibly still have not completed the full background check. They \nstill may not have completed the process to go to even a Z visa. Then \nthey may be in a Z visa status for some time.\n  I know it is said it is not amnesty because they have to pay a fine. \nHow much is the fine? $1,000. They pay a $1,000 fine. Well, they do not \nactually pay a $1,000 fine. When they get this probationary status \nvisa, they only pay $200. They pay the rest of it on an installment. \nNobody has stated and set out how they are going to pay it. Presumably, \nthey can pay it for 8 years or more.\n  So a person here illegally under the legislation that is now before \nus, that person would obtain legal status in the country, be able to \nwork, and would then be entitled to receive an earned-income tax \ncredit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So they would receive that earned-income tax credit, \nwhich would be, on average, almost $2,000, and they would pay only \n$200. Now, that is a pretty good deal, if you can get it, it seems to \nme. It is not necessary. It is not necessary as a matter of law, and it \nis not necessary as a matter of morality. It is certainly contrary to \nsound principles of Government. We should not do that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is an amendment \nthat would impact our Treasury by perhaps, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, $10 billion in the next 10 years--$10 \nbillion. So it is quite a sizable chunk.\n  Madam President, I see my friend, Senator Lieberman is here. I yield \nthe remainder of the time I have left to him. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1191\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend, Senator Sessions. \nI appreciate his kind gesture. That brings me back within 30 seconds of \nwhat I originally had. I appreciate that.\n  I am going to speak on amendment No. 1191, which is set down for a \nvote this evening. This is an amendment that would improve our Nation's \ntreatment of asylum seekers, that is, people who come to our shores \nseeking refuge from persecution they have suffered in their home \ncountries based on race, religion, nationality or political conviction.\n  As far as I know, this is the only amendment on the treatment of \nthose seeking asylum that will be considered as part of this \ncomprehensive immigration legislation. I offer this amendment because \nthe Congressionally chartered Commission on International Religious \nFreedom has told us that our country, our Government, is failing in its \nhistoric duty to those ``longing to breathe free'' from the Statue of \nLiberty.\n  I believe, as the Commission outlined, we can address this serious \nchallenge at very little expense, with no adverse affect on our \nNation's security, and without impairing immigration enforcement \noperations. It is the right thing to do. It is consistent with our best \nvalues in our history. In fact, as you know, our Founding Fathers \nunderstood the Nation's role to be not just a haven for those seeking \nfreedom but a haven for those seeking freedom from persecution.\n  Thomas Jefferson once likened the United States to a ``New Canaan,'' \nthe Biblical Canaan in mind, where victims of persecution, and I am \nquoting here, ``will be received as brothers and secured against like \noppressions by a participation in the right of self-government.''\n  That is exactly what America has become. To the great benefit of this \ncountry, some of the greatest Americans in our history came here as \nrefugees seeking asylum from persecution. Nobel Laureates Albert \nEinstein and Thomas Mann became neighbors in Princeton, NJ. Henry \nKissinger and Madeline Albright came with their families to the United \nStates, fleeing from the Nazis and Communists, respectively, and went \non, of course, to become Secretaries of State.\n  If I might, on a point of personal privilege say, most special to me, \non a day in 1949, then a child, my wife, Hadassah Freilich Lieberman, \ncame here with her parents seeking asylum from Communist \nCzechoslovakia. This national duty to those fleeing persecution is \nemblazoned in a particular stanza on the Statue of Liberty that says:\n\n     Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand\n     A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame is the\n     imprisoned lightning,\n     And her name . . . Mother of Exiles.\n\n  Yet despite that lofty sentiment, too often today we are apparently \nturning asylum seekers away without the proper hearings guaranteed them \nby law, or confining them in prison conditions alongside convicted \ncriminals while their cases are pending. That is what the U.S. \nCommission on International Religious Freedom has reported to Congress. \nThis group was established, I am proud to say, in 1998, pursuant to \nlegislation I introduced along with then-Senator Nickles and still, \nfortunately, Senator Specter.\n  It was aimed at strengthening our Government advocacy on behalf of \nindividuals around the world who were being persecuted for their faith. \nCongress in the year that we established the Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom also expressed its concern that \nrecently enacted expedited removal procedures might be causing our own \nGovernment to mistreat victims of oppression, religious oppression, who \ncame to the United States seeking asylum.\n\n[[Page S7141]]\n\n  To find out if this was happening, Congress directed the newly \nestablished Commission to study the treatment of asylum seekers. The \nCommission conducted a comprehensive investigation and released a \nreport in February of 2005 that was quite critical of the procedures of \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  The report's recommendations were reasonable and straightforward. \nUnfortunately, 2 years passed. I persistently asked officials at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security when it would respond to the report and \nwas always told the same: The recommendations are under review.\n  It appeared that little or nothing was being done. In fact, this \nFebruary, 2007, the Religious Freedom Commission itself issued a \nblistering report 2 years after its initial report in which it gave out \ngrades. The Customs and Border Patrol Agency received an F with respect \nto its treatment of asylum seekers. The Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement Agency received mostly Fs, and an overall grade of D. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security itself generally received an overall \ngrade of D as well in its treatment of those claiming to be coming to \nAmerica to seek asylum from persecution--religious, racial, nationality \nor based on political conviction.\n  That is unacceptable. Remember it was Congress that originally \nexpressed concern about the treatment of asylum seekers. It was \nCongress that directed the Commission it had created to study whether \nthere is a problem, was a problem, and now, in this Congress, as part \nof this comprehensive immigration reform bill, it must be Congress that \nwill fix the problems the Commission has found.\n  That is why I introduced separate legislation earlier this year and \nthen filed this amendment. I am pleased to say it appears I have come \nto some agreement with the Department of Homeland Security on a \nmodified version of the amendment which I hope will be broadly \nsupported by my colleagues.\n  It implements the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom and will improve our treatment of those \nwho come to our shores claiming they seek asylum from persecution.\n  We have made a number of changes to address the concerns the \nDepartment of Homeland Security brought to us. I am pleased to describe \nthem briefly.\n  The Commission on Religious Freedom found that too often the \nDepartment of Homeland Security was returning asylum seekers to \ncountries where they were persecuted without giving them a chance to \nadequately make their case that they had a credible basis for their \nclaims of persecution. Often employees of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity were failing to even ask these asylum seekers if they feared \npersecution, as required by Department procedures, before they were \nremoved. This amendment would require what might be called simple \nquality assurance procedures so that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity can ensure its practices comply with its policies.\n  Secondly, virtually all the defense facilities the Department of \nHomeland Security uses are run as maximum security prisons, and in many \ncases those seeking asylum in this country, because they claim to be \nfleeing countries that were persecuting them, those detainees are \nforced to share cells with convicted criminals in maximum security \nprisons, sometimes in county jails. This is not appropriate for asylum \nseekers and other detainees who are not criminals and are not being \ncriminally prosecuted. This amendment would require better Department \nof Homeland Security standards for those detention facilities to make \nthem more consistent with our best values and the words that are \nemblazoned on the Statute of Liberty. This amendment would also \nencourage the development of more appropriate facilities for asylum \nseekers and families with children. These would be modeled after two \nsecure but less restrictive facilities that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity already operates, one in Florida and the other in \nPennsylvania.\n  The amendment will also encourage the expansion of secure \nalternatives to detention such as supervised release programs. Congress \nhas already funded programs of this kind, and they have been \nsuccessful. The amendment ensures the Department of Homeland Security \nwill conduct vigorous oversight of the detention facilities it uses so \nthe facilities, in fact, are complying with Department standards.\n  It is time we put in place and enforce safeguards to ensure people \nfleeing persecution are treated humanely and in accordance not just \nwith our Nation's laws but with our best values.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1191, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I have a modification to the amendment, which I send \nto the desk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n               Subtitle __Asylum and Detention Safeguards\n\n     SEC. __01.

RECORDING EXPEDITED REMOVAL INTERVIEWS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish quality \n     assurance procedures and take steps to effectively ensure \n     that questions by employees of the Department exercising \n     expedited removal authority under section 235(b) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)) are asked \n     in a standard manner, and that both these questions and the \n     answers provided in response to them are recorded in a \n     uniform fashion.\n       (b) Factors Relating to Sworn Statements.--Where \n     practicable, as determined by the Secretary in his \n     discretion, any sworn or signed written statement taken of an \n     alien as part of the record of a proceeding under section \n     235(b)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1225(b)(1)(A)) shall be accompanied by a recording of the \n     interview which served as the basis for that sworn statement.\n       (c) Exemption Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--Subsection (b) shall not apply to \n     interviews that occur at facilities, locations, or areas \n     exempted by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection.\n       (2) Exemption.--The Secretary or the Secretary's designee \n     may exempt any facility, location, or area from the \n     requirements of this section based on a determination by the \n     Secretary or the Secretary's designee that compliance with \n     subsection (b) at that facility would impair operations or \n     impose undue burdens or costs.\n       (3) Report.--The Secretary or the Secretary's designee \n     shall report annually to Congress on the facilities that have \n     been exempted pursuant to this subsection.\n       (d) Interpreters.--The Secretary shall ensure that a \n     competent interpreter, not affiliated with the government of \n     the country from which the alien may claim asylum, is used \n     when the interviewing officer does not speak a language \n     understood by the alien and there is no other Federal, State, \n     or local government employee available who is able to \n     interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially.\n       (e) Recordings in Immigration Proceedings.--Recordings of \n     interviews of aliens subject to expedited removal shall be \n     included in the record of proceeding and may be considered as \n     evidence in any further proceedings involving the alien.\n       (f) No Private Right of Action.--Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed to create any right, benefit, trust, or \n     responsibility, whether substantive or procedural, \n     enforceable in law or equity by a party against the United \n     States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities, \n     entities, officers, employees, or agents, or any person, nor \n     does this section create any right of review in any \n     administrative, judicial, or other proceeding.\n\n[[Page S7142]]\n\n     SEC. __04.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS; EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this subtitle.\n       (b) Effective Date.--This subtitle and the amendments made \n     by this subtitle shall take effect on the date that is 180 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, it is my understanding that based on \nthe agreement we have reached after negotiation with the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Senate is prepared to agree to the amendment. I \nask unanimous consent that occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \namendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1191), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. This will mean the amendment now listed as No. 6 of \nthose\n\n[[Page S7144]]\n\nto be voted upon would no longer have to be voted upon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the remainder of \nthe time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1250\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of my earlier \namendment which would take the blinders off law enforcement personnel \nwhen it comes to investigating fraud and other wrongful and even \ncriminal conduct on the part of those who are claiming an advantage \nunder this legislation, as well as third parties who might be \nimplicated in fraud or other criminality.\n  I would first like to respond to Senator Kennedy's comments, and then \nI want to speak to the Menendez amendment briefly. Senator Kennedy \nearlier claimed my amendment eliminated all kinds of protections of \nconfidentiality. He said he provided a level of protection of \nconfidentiality for individuals so it will encourage them to come \nforward and file their applications for Z visas, and he is worried if \nwe allow law enforcement access to that information to investigate \nthird party fraud or other criminality, the applicants for the Z visas \nwill not be willing to come forward.\n  It should be noted that my amendment does not eliminate all \nprotections. It simply ensures law enforcement has access to \ninformation for those who cannot qualify for Z status under the terms \nof the underlying bill, including those who are criminals and \nabsconders who have reflected their prior disregard for our laws. Also, \ndespite Senator Kennedy's claim, their proposal still protects \ninformation for aliens who have committed crimes but have not been \nconvicted and are denied Z status. My amendment would make that \ninformation available to law enforcement personnel in the discharge of \ntheir official duties.\n  Furthermore, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nacknowledges there was fraud in sworn affidavits and claims.\n  He said he is now alluding to the 1986 fraud under the agricultural \namnesty bill that I mentioned in my earlier remarks and which were the \nsubject of a New York Times article dated November 12, 1989. He said we \ntook action in this legislation to fix it.\n  First, let me express my appreciation to the Senator for \nacknowledging that the third party affidavits that were used to qualify \nfor benefits in 1986 were a large source of fraud.\n  I see nothing in the bill that would ensure that fraudulent sworn \naffidavits, especially those provided by third parties, are accessible \nto law enforcement to prosecute the fraud.\n  This type of fraud remains protected and thus we haven't come very \nfar from the problems we encountered in the 1986 amnesty.\n  Senator Kennedy says we must guarantee confidentiality.\n  He said:\n\n       If we expect individuals to participate in that system, we \n     have to guarantee their confidentiality. It's enormously \n     important. This system isn't going to function and work \n     unless we do.\n\n  What my esteemed colleague is essentially saying is, we need to \nprotect those who have violated our laws, even committed felonies and \nother crimes for which they have not yet been convicted, because they \nwould not come out of the shadows and register.\n  The point is, it is more than just coming out of the shadows. It is \ngiving legal status to a person who has arguably violated our laws and \nput them on a path to citizenship, denying law enforcement the \nopportunity to investigate and to prosecute where appropriate.\n  Further, we are essentially binding the hands of law enforcement \nbecause even if they wanted to prosecute these individuals and remove \nthem from the country, they couldn't get the evidence needed to make \nthe case, nor could they remove the person because by merely applying \nfor Z status, they get the protection from removal.\n  Is that really what we want to say to our country about who should be \npermitted to remain in the United States? I think not. Nothing in my \namendment would affect the ability of those who have entered the \ncountry in violation of our immigration laws or who have simply \noverstayed their visa or even those who have produced false documents \nin order to gain access to work. My amendment would not even address \nany of those individuals. This present amendment would not do that.\n  But, surely, we want to remove the cloak of confidentiality, the \nblinders, from our law enforcement personnel that would allow them to \ninvestigate cases of fraud, wrongful conduct, and other criminality.\n  I remain flabbergasted that the proponents of this bill would embrace \nthis sort of provision. I would think what they would want to do is \nrestore public confidence that we are actually reestablishing the rule \nof law when it comes to this broken immigration system. If anything, \nthis serves to confirm the worst fears of skeptics about this bill \nbecause, frankly, it does nothing but confirm their worst fears that \nthis is a vehicle for perpetuating the same sort of mistakes we \nencountered in the 1986 legislation, but apparently those lessons were \nnot learned.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1194\n\n  I want to speak briefly about the amendment offered by Senator \nMenendez while he is on the Senate floor regarding those who want to \nimmigrate to our country, but particularly those who have respected our \nlaws and who have waited patiently in line.\n\n  I am particularly troubled by the situation that his amendment is \ndesigned to remedy because the proponents of the underlying bill have \nsaid: We are not going to allow any line jumping. We are going to \nprovide an opportunity for those who have violated the law to get right \nwith the law, but we are not going to do so to the detriment of people \nwho have followed the rules and waited patiently in line, expecting \nthat their application for a visa or legal permanent residency would be \nacted on. As I said before the recess, this is a very important \nprinciple to me. It is a matter of fundamental fairness and crucial to \nthe integrity of not only our immigration system but our entire legal \nsystem. It would be extremely unfair to allow someone who has not \nrespected our laws to be able to obtain a green card before someone who \nhas respected our laws and waited in line for a chance to enter the \ncountry legally.\n  I am not talking about the claim that those who wait in line legally \nhave to do it in their home country while someone who is here illegally \nand obtains a Z card can wait in country. That certainly is an issue. \nThose who are here illegally are getting the advantage over and above \nthose who have made the decision to obey our laws waiting patiently \noutside the country. Even Secretary Chertoff, a key negotiator of the \ncompromise, admits in a USA Today article that there is a ``fundamental \nunfairness'' anytime illegal immigrants are permitted to stay in \ncountry, while those who have respected our laws wait patiently outside \nof the country. I am afraid we make what even Secretary Chertoff admits \nis a ``fundamental unfairness'' that much more unfair in the underlying \nbill. To their credit, proponents of this compromise have stated that \nthe proposal would not allow anyone who came here illegally to obtain \ntheir green card until everyone who chose to follow the law gets their \ngreen card. That is a laudable goal, and that should be our goal. But \nto achieve this goal, the compromise arbitrarily sets the cutoff date \nfor legally ``being in line'' at May 1, 2005, while setting the date \nfor the end of the line for those illegally here at January 1, 2007.\n  As an illustration, this means someone who chose to respect our \nimmigration laws, chose not to enter illegally, and filed the proper \nimmigration paperwork on June 1, 2005, is not considered to be ``in \nline'' under the terms of this bill, while someone who decided not to \nrespect the laws and enter illegally on the same date can obtain a Z \nstatus and ultimately secure American citizenship.\n  My staff has met with a number of groups who have focused on this \nparticular problem. I know Senator Menendez has been listening to their \nsame concerns. The Asian American Justice Center in particular has made \ncompelling arguments that declaring the end of the line for legal \nimmigration as May 1, 2005, is unfair. Other groups, including the \nInterfaith Immigration Coalition, the Jewish Council for Public \nAffairs, the U.S. Conference of Bishops, the Mexican American Legal \nDefense and Education Fund have written to my office to explain that \nthose people who played by the\n\n[[Page S7145]]\n\nrules and applied after May 1, 2005, will not be cleared as part of the \nfamily backlog pursuant to the terms of the bill and will lose their \nchance to immigrate under current rules and be placed in line behind Z \nvisa applicants. Some of these groups report that more than 800,000 \npeople who have patiently waited in line will in essence be kicked out \nof the line.\n  I understand the Menendez amendment will be voted on soon. It \naddresses an important issue, ensuring that those who decided to abide \nby the laws will not be disadvantaged simply because they chose not to \ncome here illegally.\n  As I said, I have been struggling with this over the past couple \nweeks because this is a matter of fundamental fairness. So I continue \nto consider this amendment. I know others are likewise considering it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1250\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes equally divided on \namendment No. 1250.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I understand we have 2 minutes equally \ndivided before the vote.\n  Simply stated for my colleagues, my amendment would remove the \nblinders that would prevent law enforcement from investigating and \nprosecuting wrongful conduct, including fraud and criminality.\n  I would think if there is one thing we learned from the 1986 amnesty, \nthis type of confidentiality provision, if it protects any information \nto be gleaned from the applications of those who have actually been \ndenied Z visas, it would be that we should pursue and support this kind \nof amendment which would help law enforcement and, even more \nimportantly, help restore public confidence that we are not playing \ngames with them but that we are actually serious about restoring the \nrule of law when it comes to our broken immigration system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Cornyn amendment attacks the whole \nissue of confidentiality for these undocumented aliens. If the Cornyn \namendment is adopted, there are no individuals who are going to \nregister for any of these programs--none--because all their information \nwill be available.\n  This is a report-to-deport amendment. How are you going to convince \nindividuals to come in and register for the Z visa program or any of \nthe programs if they know all of their information is going to go to \nthe Immigration Service and every other agency?\n  With regard to criminality, with regard to terrorism, with regard to \nall the fraud and all the abuse, we have put in here careful \nprotections. Those kinds of protections are supported by Jon Kyl, by \nother Republican Members, and by all of us here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If you accept the Cornyn amendment, it effectively \nundermines all confidentiality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate everyone allowing me to say a \nfew words before the vote starts. We have six votes that will take \nplace. Any minute, the votes will start. We worked out an agreement--\ntentative in nature, but I think it is fairly firm--we will have six \nmore votes tonight. I want to alert Members we will have more votes \ntonight. It could be a late night, for sure.\n  When that is all completed, we will have had--I do not know the exact \nnumber--35 votes, or something like that, and it is evenly divided \nbetween Democrats and Republicans. There is one vote difference as to \nwho offered the amendment. But I think we have made a lot of progress.\n  I hope people feel they are having an opportunity to have their \nvoices heard in this regard. Within a short few votes, we will \ncertainly have had more votes than we had last year. I am not sure that \nis a good guide for anything, but that is at least what we will be able \nto show everyone. I hope people would be able to see that the end is in \nsight.\n  Remember, if cloture is invoked on this matter, we will have 30 hours \nmore of amendments. As I have indicated to my friend, the distinguished \njunior Senator from Arizona and others, upon being asked the question \nwhether all these postcloture votes would take place, the answer is, we \nare not going to be blocking any people from voting on germane \namendments.\n  I hope everyone understands it will be a late night tonight, and we \nwill start early in the morning.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes evenly divided on \nthe Reid amendment, No. 1331.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the earned-income tax credit is an important \nprogram that benefits low-income workers with children who are legally \nworking in this country. Those working illegally in this country are \nineligible for the earned-income tax credit.\n  This amendment makes it perfectly clear that nothing in the bill \nchanges the prohibition of an illegal alien's access to the earned-\nincome tax credit. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is not a cover vote. It is not a \ncover vote at all. It leaves the bill exactly as it was. The problem \nwith the legislation is that those people who are today illegal and \nwould be made legal through the probationary status visa or the Z visa \nwould be entitled to receive the earned-income tax credit, which is, on \naverage, nearly $1,800 per recipient. That earned-income tax credit is \na direct payment from the taxpayers of America.\n  This amendment--unlike the vote you cast last year when I raised it--\nwould allow the earned-income tax credit when you get a green card but \nnot when you are on a Z visa or probationary visa. So this is less far-\nreaching than the amendment I offered last year.\n  I urge that this amendment not be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 1331.\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

There is now 2 minutes equally divided before \nthe vote on the Sessions amendment No. 1234.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, who is eligible for the earned-income tax \ncredit? Legal workers. They work. Who are the beneficiaries of the \nearned-income tax credit? Ninety-eight percent of it goes to poor \nchildren. What country in the world has the greatest percent of poor \nchildren? The United States of America. Ninety-eight percent of the \nbenefits of the earned tax credit go to poor children, and many of them \nare American children.\n  In the history of the Internal Revenue Code, we have never excluded a \nclass. We have treated everyone equally. The Sessions amendment for the \nfirst time in the history of the United States of America is going to \nsay: Workers who are here legally are going to be denied the earned-\nincome tax credit that can benefit their children who are looking for a \nbetter future.\n  I hope the Sessions amendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the earned-income tax credit was \ndesigned and has been in effect as a support for American workers. That \nis what it is. Four million people who do not have children receive it.\n  This amendment says those people who are here illegally today who are \nmade legal under this bill through the Z visa or the probationary \nstatus who have not yet obtained legal permanent residence would not \nget this benefit. The people are supposed to pay a fine, $1,000. They \nonly have to pay $200. They pay that $200 fine, sign up, and they get a \n$2,000 earned-income tax credit, which is basically a check from the \nUnited States Government.\n  The people who are here illegally would be, under this bill, made \nlegal, be allowed to work. They are not receiving earned-income tax \ncredit today. There is no moral, legal, or principled reason to give \nthem that in the future until they become a legal permanent resident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes evenly divided before \nthe vote on the Menendez amendment, No. 1194.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, under the bill before us, U.S. citizens \nhave less rights than an undocumented alien. The base bill says, you \nbreak the law, you get benefits up to January 1, 2007. You follow the \nrule of law, and your right as an American citizen to claim your \nfamily, for which you have already submitted a petition, is \nextinguished as of May 1, 2005. That is fundamentally wrong.\n  How do we promote the rule of law when we say to a U.S. citizen, who \nhas already applied for their family member waiting abroad, paid their \nfees, the government has collected them, their application has been \napproved, they followed the rules and obeyed the law, that they have an \ninferior right--an inferior right--to someone who did not follow the \nrules and crossed the border and who will ultimately receive a benefit \nsuperior to that of a U.S. citizen who is claiming their family?\n  Why do we tell the family of the U.S. citizen to go to the back of \nthe line behind people who violated the law? This is a vote about \nfamily values and family reunification. This is a vote about the rule \nof law. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, this is an amendment that would \nenable people to enter the United States and become immigrants, green \ncard holders, and eventually citizens, who, under the current law, have \nno expectation of ever getting those rights because they are in \ncategories or are from countries in which the waiting line is so long \nthat they would never, ever be able, under existing law, to become a \nU.S. citizen.\n  In addition, because it would allow several hundred thousand \nimmigrants to come into this country who would not otherwise be legal \nunder existing law, there are three budget points of order, and, \ntherefore, at the conclusion\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\nof these remarks, I will be making a budget point of order. I hope my \ncolleagues agree that we should not waive the budget under these \ncircumstances.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \namendment, No. 1194, to S. 1348, violates section 201, the pay-as-you-\ngo point of order of S. Con.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1460\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes evenly divided before \nthe vote on the Kyl amendment No. 1460. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate not waiving the budget in this \nlast point of order. I will confess to you, I think that Senator \nMenendez had a point in saying we should only allow people who had a \nreasonable expectation to be immigrants, and those who didn't should \nnot. The bill itself drew an arbitrary deadline. Senator Menendez drew \na different arbitrary deadline. This side-by-side actually is \nconstructed so that, under existing law, everyone who has a reasonable \nexpectation of being allowed to immigrate under a family visa will be \nable to immigrate under a family visa. Only those people who never had \nany reasonable expectation would be denied.\n  What it does is to take it out to the year 2027, 20 years from now, \nand anyone who could have had a reasonable expectation of immigrating \nwithin that 20-year period would be allowed to immigrate under this \namendment. It is a more precise and fair and just way to allow family \nmembers to come into the United States. The numbers are approximately \nidentical to those who would be allowed to immigrate under the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthis. It is not more than a figleaf. It sounds great, 2027. The \ndefinition of ``reasonable expectation'' means absolutely nothing. The \nmajority of the Senate voted to have some form, although it did not \npass a budget point of order, to have some form of family reunification \nof U.S. citizens waiting to go be reunited with their family abroad.\n  This does nothing. As a matter of fact, I have heard some of the \nchildren, family members of U.S. citizens, would have to wait 60 years. \nI have the State Department's report. None of them are more than 15 \nyears. So the reality is, this is a figleaf for those who voted against \nthe last one. It does absolutely nothing for family reunification.\n  Let's keep at least a strong message we do want to reunify families \nas we move this bill ahead and vote against the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The question is on agreeing to \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) \nand the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1183, As Further Modified\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1183, as further \nmodified, and ask unanimous consent for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, and Senator Dodd be added as cosponsors \nto the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I know there are very strongly held and \nhonestly felt disagreements in this Chamber on the legislation before \nus. Many of these differences are mirrored across our country. The \nissue of immigration strikes deeply at our values and our concept of \nAmerica and stirs our emotions. While we may reach different \nconclusions, we all have to begin at the same place. Our immigration \nsystem is in crisis. I have concerns about this underlying bill, but we \nall do. This is not the bill any of us individually would have written \nand produced for the Senate's consideration. But I commend the primary \nsponsors for bringing this to the floor of the Senate so we can debate \nthe issues it raises and try to craft a solution that simultaneously \nhonors our Nation's strong immigrant heritage and respects the rule of \nlaw.\n  As a nation, we place a premium on compassion, respect, and policies \nthat help families. But our immigration laws don't reflect that. In \nfact, our current laws tear families apart. For lawful permanent \nresidents and their spouses and minor children, this bill not only \nfails to help them, it actually makes matters worse. It is time to take \nall the rhetoric about family values and put it into action and show \nthat we mean what we say when we talk about putting families first. \nThat is what my amendment does.\n  This amendment is a bipartisan amendment offered with Senator Hagel \nand Senator Menendez. It is our view we must make reuniting families a \npriority in our immigration system, that we should show compassion for \nthose living apart from their spouses and minor children, that we \nshould reform immigration in a way that honors families and brings them \ntogether. Unfortunately, the compromise bill before us fails to help \nfamilies and children stuck in a bureaucratic quagmire created by our \ntangled, broken immigration system. Spouses and minor children of \nlawful permanent residents applying for a green card are required to \nremain overseas while awaiting their new legal status. The problem is \nthere is a huge backlog.\n  Despite what some have suggested this week, the visa backlog for \nspouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents is significant \nand substantial. According to the June 2007 State Department visa \nbulletin, the backlog is currently more than 5 years long. For some, \nthat backlog could stretch even longer. What does that mean? In very \nhuman terms it means parents are forced apart from their children. \nHusbands are separated from their wives. Tax-paying, law-abiding, legal \nimmigrants who are doing the right thing are treated as though their \nfamilies don't matter at all.\n  If you are a lawful permanent resident and your spouse and minor \nchildren are caught in this long line, your family is not allowed to \nenter the United States even for a brief visit. You are limited in your \nability to leave the United States to visit your spouse and children \noverseas. Under our current policies, lawful permanent residents are \nforced to choose between their newly adopted country and living with \ntheir spouse or children. Five years may not seem long to some of us. \nWe serve 6 years in the Senate. It seems to go by very fast. But 5 \nyears in the life of a young child or in a marriage is precious time \nindeed. For a 10-year-old child, it is half their life. It is time that \ncan never be recaptured. Unfortunately, that 5-year timeframe is often \nmuch less than what actually happens to these families.\n  We are proposing that spouses and minor children of lawful permanent \nresidents be exempt from the visa caps and that we finally allow these \nnuclear families who have been separated for far too long to be \nreunited. This amendment is necessary because the compromise bill does \nabsolutely nothing to bring these families together. In fact, the \ncompromise actually reduces the number of visas for spouses and minor \nchildren of lawful permanent residents. It does not allocate a single \nvisa to address the existing backlog for these family members.\n  As I have said many times, we have a national interest in fostering \nstrong families. This amendment is supported by more than 100 faith-\nbased, family, and immigrant advocacy organizations and denominations. \nI thank all of these organizations that have endorsed and rallied \nsupport for the Clinton-Hagel-Menendez amendment. They do an invaluable \nservice in speaking out for people whose voices would otherwise not be \nheard.\n  The amendment is not considered a bill killer. It is not considered \nan amendment everybody has to vote against who has agreed to the \ncompromise, because many of us know these legal permanent residents. \nMany of us actually work with them. Some of them even contribute to the \ncampaigns of people in this Chamber. These are people who are doing \neverything they can to play by the rules, except they are divided for \nyears from their spouses and minor children. I hope the Chamber will \nendorse this act of compassion and common sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I certainly agree with the Senator from \nNew York about the value of having family unity. A strong family is \ncertainly a very important value that we ought to maintain to the \nmaximum extent possible. I intend at the appropriate time, before the \nvote comes up, to raise a point of order under concurrent resolution \n21, but for a few moments I will deal with the merits as to the issue \nadvanced by the Senator from New York.\n  The effect of adoption of this amendment would mean those who are now \nlegal permanent residents or green card holders would have an immediate \nright to bring in their spouse and children, and it is estimated there \nare some 800,000 of these green cards in existence at the present time. \nFrom many perspectives, it would be worthwhile to have that \naccomplished. That would certainly be a personal preference of mine, if \nit were not for many collateral constraining factors about the \ndifficulty of allowing that many additional green cards all of a \nsudden. The 800,000 figure is the best estimate that is available at \nthis late hour.\n  The effect of the amendment offered by the Senator from New York as \nto the approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants would be that \nas soon as the backlog is cleared after 8 years, then at that time they \nwould be eligible to have green cards issued as green card holders or \nas legal permanent residents, after the backlog is\n\n[[Page S7151]]\n\ncleared in 8 years. Under the amendment by the Senator from New York, \nthey would have the right to bring in their spouse and minor children.\n  Again, if I were to devise an ideal system and there were not other \nlimitations, I certainly would not disagree with that as a desirable \nway to proceed. But this compromise was constructed very carefully and \nvery painfully by the dozen or so Senators from both the Democratic \nside of the aisle and the Republican side of the aisle who structured \nit. The Presiding Officer was a member of that group, the junior \nSenator from Colorado. In structuring the arrangement to not allow \nlegal permanent residents or so-called green card holders from bringing \nin their spouse and minor children, there were many tradeoffs. As I \nhave said on the floor earlier, many of the provisions which were \nexcluded, rejected, were ones I personally would have favored. I have \ncast a fair number of votes here during the course of this debate that, \ngiven my preferences, I would have cast differently. But the overall \nobjective of getting a bill passed is worth the compromises which have \nbeen made.\n  Earlier today, this amendment was characterized by the Senator from \nNew Mexico as the politics of compromise. Well, that might sound bad, \nbut that happens to be the reality of what goes on in the Senate all \nthe time. It goes on in all political bodies. We don't have anyone who \ncan structure a bill to his or her precise specifications. If I could \nstructure a bill, it would be a very different bill. But my role, along \nwith a number of other Senators, was to try to find accommodations to \nfind a bill which we could agree to and bring to the floor and then, if \nthe full Senate wanted to work its will to the contrary, that is the \nway the system works. But there is nothing inappropriate about the \npolitics of compromise. That means we sacrifice the better for the \ngood.\n  The overall good is to get a bill passed which will deal with 12 \nmillion undocumented immigrants in a constructive way. It gives them an \nopportunity to escape the fear they now have that they will be detected \nat any time. It gives us an opportunity to identify those who are not \ncontributing, who have criminal records, who ought to be deported. We \ncan't deport all 12 million, but for the balance to be on the path \ntoward citizenship, that is a very worthwhile, commendable objective as \nto the greater picture. We have comprehensive reforms. We have securing \nthe border and employer verification. I will not go through all of the \ndetails, but this bill is very important. This accommodation to reject \nthe contentions of the Senator from New York is necessary if we are to \nattain the greater good.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I just interrupt with a question to the \nSenator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, is it not true that under this amendment, \nthis amendment would wipe out the difference between a citizen of the \nUnited States and a green card holder with respect to their right to \nimmigrate the nuclear family? So there would be no distinction between \na green card holder and a citizen's rights?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is correct. It \nis the citizen who has the right to bring a spouse and minor children, \nnot legal permanent residents, so-called green card holders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it was the intention of the majority \nleader to ask that there be 10 minutes on each amendment to be evenly \ndivided. I think that was the desire in order to be fair to all of \nthose who were going to offer amendments. I think those who are \noffering amendments were given that kind of assurance. So I ask \nunanimous consent that the remaining time be allocated equally between \nthe amendments and equally in terms--well, I ask unanimous consent that \nthere be 10 minutes on each amendment equally divided between those who \nfavor the amendment and those who are opposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, may I inquire, was a budget point of \norder or other point of order made against the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was not raised. It is not in order at this \ntime.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, let me, just if I could, respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take 2 minutes of my time on the \nfollowing amendment and yield it to the Senator. She was not aware of \nthe time limitation when she made her remarks. I think she ought to be \nentitled to make her comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I think it is important to recognize that there are many distinctions \nbetween a U.S. citizen and a foreigner living legally in the United \nStates which uphold the value of citizenship, but the right to marry \nand to live with your family should not be one of them.\n  Denying legal permanent residents, who are on the pathway to pledging \ntheir allegiance to the United States, the right to marry and live \ntogether in our country is an obstacle to their becoming the kind of \nfull-fledged citizens we want them to be.\n  Also, under current law, guest workers, students, and others can be \nwith their spouses and minor children and then adjust to legal \npermanent resident status with them. Due to the backlogs, only lawful \npermanent residents are treated differently.\n  So, Mr. President, I understand that those who worked so hard on \ncoming up with this compromise may not be able to find their way clear \nto support this at this time, but I do not believe we have a national \ninterest in separating legal permanent residents from their spouses and \nminor children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1151\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me make an inquiry. It is my \nunderstanding that under the UC, all of the eight amendments that will \nbe considered on the floor have been called up and are in order to be \nconsidered; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not all been reported at this time.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me tell you something procedurally \nthat is going to happen here in about an hour at 10 o'clock. There is a \nlist of amendments. First, there are two of them, and then the Salazar \namendment will be considered. After that, the Inhofe amendment will be \nconsidered.\n  Now, I want to get something understood procedurally because I think \nit is very important for everyone, particularly the occupant of the \nchair at this time, who has the Salazar amendment, to know what is \ngoing on.\n  A year ago, we debated the Inhofe amendment that would make English \nthe national language for the United States of America. We debated it \nat length, hour after hour. We talked about that every President back \nto and including Theodore Roosevelt in 1916 made comments that English \nshould be the official and should be the national language of the \nUnited States of America. We talked about the 50 countries that have \nEnglish as a national language, one being in west Africa--Ghana--and \none being in east Africa--Kenya--but not the United States of America.\n  Now, one of the things that happened a year ago is I had my amendment \nup, which is essentially the same amendment that will be up tonight. I \nwould like to have you listen carefully. It is really a one-sentence \namendment. All it says is:\n\n       Unless specifically provided by statute, no person has a \n     right, entitlement, or claim to have the Government of the \n     United States or any of its officials or representatives act, \n     communicate, perform or provide services, or provide \n     materials in any language other than English.\n\n  In other words, this is an entitlement.\n  Now, it has exceptions in there for laws that are on the books, such \nas laws protecting the sixth amendment, which would be the Court \nInterpreters Act and other such things. However, it\n\n[[Page S7152]]\n\nwas aimed--I don't want to act as if I am hiding this because we talked \nabout this a year ago. One of the things has been very controversial: \nAt the very end of the Clinton administration was when he passed \nExecutive Order No. 13166, and 13166 essentially said that if you are a \nrecipient of Federal funds, then your documentation can all be done in \nwhatever language you desire, so it could be Swahili, it could be \nSpanish, or any other language.\n  Now, what happened a year ago was they passed my amendment--and my \namendment was exactly the same as it is today--and it passed by a vote \nof 62 to 35. Does that sound right? So, 62 to 35. Then right after \nthat, the Salazar amendment--and I see the Senator from Colorado is \npreparing to respond--was passed, which gutted my amendment, did away \nwith it.\n  So those individuals who voted for my amendment and then voted for \nthe Salazar amendment--and there are quite a few Democrats and \nRepublicans who did that--voted to make English the official language \nand then, in the next vote, 3 minutes later, voted to take it away.\n  Now, I see that this is happening again tonight because, \nunfortunately, I have to offer my amendment first. I anticipate it will \nbe adopted because it is very popular. Right now, the polling shows \nthat 91 percent of the people in America want English as an official \nlanguage, and 76 percent of Hispanics believe English should be an \nofficial language.\n  Now, I am prepared to go on and debate this issue. I should not have \nto do it since 62 Members of this body already voted in favor of it. \nWhat I am going to say now, though, is very significant because if you \nvote for the Inhofe amendment when it comes up tonight, then vote for \nthe Salazar amendment, you are essentially saying you are gutting the \nInhofe amendment and you do not want English to be the official or the \nnational language of the United States of America.\n  The Salazar amendment is exactly the language in the underlying bill. \nI have it before me. I would be glad to read it. In fact, I am not sure \nhow this time is going to work out. If we have time equally divided, I \nam going to run out of time. So I will just state that the language is \nprecisely the same in the underlying bill. The underlying bill actually \nputs into law executive orders, and this specific executive order of \n13166, which gives anyone an entitlement to any language he or she \nwants, will become law. That is the language which is in there right \nnow.\n  I am attempting to change that language. If my amendment is adopted, \nit will change. However, the next vote is going to be on the Salazar \namendment. I am just saying to you, as my friends out here, do not vote \nfor both of us because if you vote for both of us, you are voting to \nmake English the official language, and then, in the very next vote, \nyou are taking it away and reinstating the original language in the \nbill.\n  So I hope no one is going to think it is going to go unnoticed if \nanyone votes for my amendment and then votes to kill the amendment they \njust supported. That is what is going to happen tonight. I look forward \nto the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nproposed amendment by my good friend from Oklahoma. First and foremost, \nI want to say I believe all Members of this Chamber and the people in \nthe United States understand that English is important and that people, \nin order to succeed in our society, need to learn English; that the \nability to acquire the English language and to speak it well is \nsomething we all support, and we support a number of different programs \nthat would assist people who have limited English proficiency to \nacquire the English language as a keystone to success. I think that \ngoes without saying.\n  The amendment that is proposed by my friend from Oklahoma would, in \nfact, do a number of things that I think are problematical and should \ncause all of us to vote against the amendment.\n  The first and a very important reason to vote against his amendment \nis that it is contrary to the provisions of law that exist in many \nStates. For example, in the State of New Mexico, you have in the \nConstitution--in the Constitution of the State of New Mexico--as my \ngood friend, Senator Domenici, would articulate here, a provision that \nsays that many of the documents within that State have to be provided \nin both English and Spanish. The same thing is true for the State of \nHawaii. I believe this is a States rights issue, and those \nconstitutions of those States ought to be respected. There are other \nStates in our Union which have decided they are going to adopt English \nas their official language. I believe that is a matter the States ought \nto decide. I do not believe it is a matter we ought to be imposing here \nfrom Washington, DC, on the backs of the States of our Union.\n  Also, at the end of the day, what my good friend from Oklahoma is \nattempting to do with his amendment is to undo an executive order that \nhas been long recognized by President George Bush, implemented by \nPresident George Bush, conceived by President Bill Clinton, and put \ninto law with his signature.\n  President Clinton's executive order was signed on April 11, 2000, on \nOctober 26, 2001. That executive order was recognized by Ralph Boyd \nwith the U.S. Department of Justice under the Bush administration. It \nwas again recognized on January 11, 2002, and again on November 12, \n2002, and then again on December 1 of 2003.\n  If I may take a moment to just read a portion of what was included in \nthat communication that went out from the U.S. Department of Justice to \nall of the court administrators across the United States and all of the \nU.S. district courts. It said the following in the memorandum:\n\n       It is beyond question that America's courts discharge a \n     wide range of important duties and offer critical services \n     both inside and outside the courtroom. Examples range from \n     contact with the clerk's office in pro se matters to \n     testifying at trial. They include but are not limited to \n     matters involving domestic violence, restraining orders, \n     parental rights, and other family law matters, eviction \n     actions, alternative dispute resolution or mediation \n     programs. . . .\n\n  And on and on.\n  What both the Bush administration and the Clinton administration \nrecognized in this executive order is that it is important to make sure \npeople who have limited English proficiency receive the kinds of \nservices so they can understand what is going on in terms of the \ninterface between the Government and themselves.\n  Mr. President, I believe my friend from Oklahoma has an amendment in \nsearch of a problem, and I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes.

The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I conclude by urging my colleagues to \nvote no on the Inhofe amendment. At the end of the day, what the Inhofe \namendment is proposing to do is to undo executive orders that have been \nsigned by both the Clinton administration and the Bush administration. \nThose executive orders were created in order to be able to have people \nunderstand what is happening with respect to the courts, with respect \nto domestic violence, and with respect to other issues that our \ngovernment provides services for where they need to be able to \nunderstand what is happening with respect to the communication they are \nreceiving.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Inhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1374\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 1374.\n  Mr. President, this bill does a laudable job in setting up a new \nmerit-based system for the future. That is the right thing to do for \nour country, but the bill misses the mark.\n  Our country needs an immigration system that recognizes we want to \nattract the best and the brightest from around the world. We have been \ndoing that for many years because we recognize that people who are \nsmart, who are talented, when they come to this country they actually \ncreate jobs in this country. They create opportunities for other people \nin this country.\n  The current bill unfortunately misses the mark on this merit system. \nThe current bill is actually worse than current law. This bill today is \nworse than current law, and that is why the high-tech community across \nthe country has come out in opposition to the provisions of the merit-\nbased system in this bill. I want to tell a small anecdote that will \nillustrate the problems with our current system on attracting talent.\n  In my office today, a gentleman by the name of Bill Watkins from \nSeagate Corporation out of California just opened a new branch in \nSingapore and hired U.S. graduates, foreign students who graduated from \nMIT and other universities. The reason he hired them to go to \nSingapore, where he will pay them less money than he would have paid \nthem in the United States, the reason he sent those jobs overseas is \nbecause of our immigration policy that basically will educate you in \nthe United States, but then after we educate you, we will send you \nhome.\n  The amendment I offer today says we are going to actually value \npeople who are educated here, especially in the science and mathematics \nand engineering fields--we call those the stem fields--in the health \nsciences fields, we are going to give you even more points than the \ncurrent bill does so that into the future we will attract the best and \nthe brightest from around the world. It is the idea of being a brain \ndrain to the rest of the world. People from all over the world want to \ncome to America. We want the best and the brightest to come to America \nbecause of this fact--whether it is low-skilled or high-skilled \nworkers, 4 percent of the jobs, 4 percent of the people who have jobs \nin the future will create the jobs for the other 96 percent of \nAmericans. Those are the talented people we want to attract.\n  Over half of the start-ups in Silicon Valley in the last 10 years \nhave come from immigrants. Those people, when they start up companies, \ncreate jobs in America. They create opportunities, some high skilled, \nsome low skilled, but they are creating opportunities for people to \npursue the American dream. So while the current bill is going in the \nright direction, it misses the mark.\n  So my amendment says we are going to reward those in the sciences, \nthose in the technical fields, those who have a Ph.D. in electrical \nengineering. We are going to give you enough points to virtually \nguarantee entrance into this country. It is a good thing. It is why the \nhigh-tech community is supporting my amendment.\n  We also put in this amendment, if you are an immigrant, if you are \none of these Z visa holders, we actually want you to be rewarded for \ndoing military service. So we are going to offer another amendment to \nmake sure they can do military service, and then when they do that, we \nwant to reward them to come into this country. To serve in our military \nshould be the greatest honor, and we should reward people with legal \npermanent status, the ability to get legal permanent status.\n\n  We have a shortage of nurses in this country. We give more rewards \nfor people in the health sciences as well in our amendment.\n  I think this is a critical amendment to improve this bill. If we are \ngoing to do a comprehensive immigration reform bill, we certainly \nshouldn't make it worse than current law, and this bill is worse than \ncurrent law when it comes to high-tech workers coming into this \ncountry. So I would urge all of our colleagues to support this \namendment. I know it is a delicate balance that we have between the \nvarious people who have brought this bill together, but I truly believe \nthis is an improvement on not only current law, but it is also a great \nimprovement on the current bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, is there anyone who is going to speak \non the other side on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator could be recognized, and the \nperson is free under the agreement to\n\n[[Page S7154]]\n\nspeak later during the course of the evening.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, in that case, I would like to use 4 \nminutes of my time and then reserve the remainder of my time for if \nthere is opposition to my amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1415\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside, and I call up amendment No. 1415.\n  Mr. President, will the Presiding Officer notify me at 4 minutes so \nthat I may reserve the remainder of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, our Social Security system, we all \nknow, is in a very precarious position. In fact, we are trying to pass \nSocial Security reform that would extend the life of our Social \nSecurity system. We know we are facing impending insolvency. The trust \nfund has $2.4 trillion and is supporting 46 million beneficiaries. In \n2017, the trust fund will begin paying out more in benefits than it \nreceives in revenue. It is expected to be fully exhausted in 2041. If \nwe pass the bill before us, we will be adding millions of new \nbeneficiaries into the Social Security system, but we will also be \nallowing individuals who were not authorized to work in this country \nthe opportunity to qualify from illegal work.\n  Under the current bill, Social Security credits for the time prior to \ngetting a valid card would not be allowed. That is the good part of the \nbill. However, on a visa overstay or someone who has a card in their \nname, but they are working illegally, they would still be able to get \nquarters credited for that illegal work. My amendment would close that \nloophole.\n  According to the GAO, about 22 percent of the whole Social Security \nthat an employee would pay over 40 quarters would be approximately \n$193.42 per month. What I meant to say is, if you take the example of \nan hourly worker making $9 an hour, they would, in a 40-hour workweek, \ncontribute $193 to the system per month. However, after working 40 \nquarters, which is the minimum, the payout would be $405 per month for \neach overstay after the age of 65 and up to the expected life \nexpectancy of 78. So 22 percent would be paid in, while 78 percent \nwould come out. This means over the lifetime of the Social Security for \nthat worker, the payout would be $81,922 but the input would be \n$23,210. So over the lifetime of that person, the deficit would be \n$58,712.\n  Now, it is estimated that 40 percent of the illegals in this country \nare visa overstays. So if you multiply the 40 percent, which is about \n4.8 million people according to estimates, you would get $28 billion \nthat would be a deficit in the Social Security system. That is if it \nwere 1 year of overstay. We don't know how many years people overstay. \nThat is impossible to know right now. But if it were 2 years, it would \nbe $56 billion, and it goes on.\n  We asked for a scoring of this amendment, and we have a letter from \nthe Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1384\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1384.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Chair let me know when I have 2 minutes \nremaining on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Pete Domenici be \nadded as a cosponsor to this amendment No. 1384.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of my amendment \nNo. 1384 and to urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \ncommonsense legislation that supports English as the common language \nfor the United States of America.\n  Our amendment is a very simple amendment. It says that the Government \nof the United States--and here I am quoting:\n\n       The Government of the United States shall preserve and \n     enhance the role of English as the language of the United \n     States.\n\n  Again, it is:\n\n       The Government of the United States shall preserve and \n     enhance the role of English as the language of the United \n     States.\n\n  This is a simple and straightforward amendment that recognizes the \nreality of the United States of America, that we are a people who yearn \nto speak English, want to speak English, and have the vast majority of \nour people knowing how to speak English.\n  This language I have read is also part of a carefully crafted \ncompromise. It is included in the underlying legislation that was \nworked upon by both Republican and Democratic Senators over a long \nperiod of time. It was agreed that this was the language that made the \nmost sense in terms of including a provision relating to the English \nlanguage in the underlying legislation.\n  As I said earlier in opposition to Senator Inhofe's amendment, this \nis in fact a States' rights issue. The States of America ought to \ndecide whether they are going to call English the official language of \ntheir State, as they did in Colorado; or they should decide, as they \ndid in New Mexico in their constitution in 1912, to recognize English \nand Spanish as part of the language within their State. That was their \nright as New Mexicans. It is their right in Hawaii to be able to \nrecognize a language other than English. It is a matter that ought to \nbe left to the States. It would be a Washingtonian kind of thing to \nrequire these mandates upon the States, and it is something that we as \nthe Senate should reject. Our language in amendment No. 1384 preserves \nthat ability of the States to be able to enact their own legislation \nwith respect to the English language.\n  Finally, I only say that in my own personal history the native \nlanguage in my home was Spanish. My family had lived along the banks of \nthe Rio Grande River in southern Colorado for a period of 407 years. \nDuring all that time, they preserved their Spanish language, but they \nalso honored and preserved the English language. My father and mother, \nwho were veterans of World War II, had eight children who became \ncollege graduates. They understood the importance of English as \nsomething that would help them live the American dream, as all eight of \ntheir children have.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if I am in order, I will speak in strong \nsupport of my amendment No. 1339 which will be voted on later tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is so entitled.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1339\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion in this \ndebate on the immigration bill about enforcement provisions. There has \nbeen a lot of discussion about triggers in this bill to ensure that \nenforcement actions are taken, are paid for, and are enacted before \nother aspects of the bill, such as the Z visa program and the temporary \nworker program, go into effect.\n  My grave concern is that these triggers are wholly inadequate and \nrepresent thinking that is backward from where it needs to be. If you \nlook at the triggers designed in the bill, they were arrived at, again, \nas I would put it, in a backward fashion.\n  The question was asked: Well, it is going to take about 18 months to \nbe ready to enact the other provisions of the bill, so what enforcement \nare we teed up to do during the next 18 months anyway? We will define \nthat as the enforcement trigger for the bill.\n  I simply think that is the wrong way to arrive at a trigger. The key \nquestion has to be: What needs to be done? What is the totality of \nsignificant measures that needs to be done in order to have real \nenforcement at the border and real enforcement at the workplace? Let's \nmake that totality the trigger in the bill. Of course, the triggers are \nfar less than that.\n  One perfect example is the subject of this amendment. The US-VISIT \nProgram has been authorized since 1996, but it is not near operational. \nThis is the program that would establish an entry and exit system so we \nknow absolutely who comes into the country on visas and when those \npeople leave, if they leave on time under their visa, or if they do not \nand are, therefore, overstaying their visa.\n  Without such a system, we cannot possibly know who is in the country \nand who is overstaying their visa. This\n\n[[Page S7155]]\n\nis a very serious part of our illegal immigration problem. As of 2006, \nthe illegal population, by most estimates, included 4 million to 5.5 \nmillion overstays. So visa overstays are a big part of the problem. We \nknow from 9/11, that visa overstays accounted for many of the \nterrorists at the center of the 9/11 plot.\n  So how can we have meaningful enforcement without this US-VISIT \nsystem, including the exit portion of the system? We cannot. The simple \nanswer is that we can't. My amendment No. 1339 would include full \nimplementation of this exit system of the US-VISIT Program into the \ntrigger of the bill. Therefore, the other significant portions of the \nbill, such as temporary workers, such as Z visas, et cetera, cannot \ntake effect until the full trigger is pulled, including full \nimplementation of the US-VISIT system.\n  If we are serious about enforcement, we have to pass this amendment. \nIf we are serious about enforcement, we have to recognize that 4 \nmillion to 5.5 million illegals in this country are visa overstays, and \nwe cannot get our hands around that visa overstay problem without full \nimplementation of this system, which has been authorized but nowhere \nnear implemented since 1996.\n  So I urge all my colleagues to come together and build up the trigger \nand enforcement provisions of this bill with the Vitter amendment No. \n1339.\n  With that, I yield back my time.\n  (Mr. SALAZAR assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1202\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight to speak about \nthe new point system created in this bill--a proposal that will \nradically change the way we judge who is worthy of lawful entry into \nAmerican society.\n  For decades, American citizens and legal permanent residents have \nbeen able to sponsor their family members for entry into our country. \nFor decades, American businesses have been able to sponsor valued \nemployees. The bill before us changes that policy--a policy that, while \nimperfect, has worked well, and this bill will now replace it with a \nnew, untested, unexamined system to provide visas to immigrants who \nlook good on paper but who may not have any familial or economic ties \nto our country.\n  I have serious concerns about this new experiment in social \nengineering, not only because of the lack of evidence that it will work \nbut because the bill says the new point system cannot be changed for 14 \nyears. For that reason, I come to the floor today, joined by Senators \nMenendez and Feingold, to offer amendment No. 1202 to sunset the point \nsystem after 5 years.\n  I am pleased that immigration experts, religious organizations, and \nimmigrant advocacy organizations have all endorsed our amendment.\n  These groups have endorsed our amendment because the point system in \nthis bill constitutes a radical shift in immigration policy, premised \non the view that there is something wrong with family and employer-\nsponsored immigration. If this program were merely supplementing the \ncurrent system rather than significantly replacing it, it would not \nhave caused as much concern.\n  Religious organizations and immigrant advocacy groups have also \nendorsed my amendment because the decisions about what characteristics \nare deserving of points--and how points are allocated for those \ncharacteristics--were made without a single hearing or public \nexamination.\n  They support the amendment because the new points system shifts us \ntoo far away from the value we place on family ties and moves us toward \na class-based immigration system, where some people are welcome only as \nguest workers but never as full participants in our democracy. Indeed, \nthe practical effect of the points system is to make it more difficult \nfor Americans and legal permanent residents with family living in Latin \nAmerica to bring them here.\n  Our current immigration system delivers the lion's share of green \ncards--about 63 percent--to family members of Americans and legal \npermanent residents, while roughly 16 percent of visas are allocated to \nemployment-based categories. The bill before us would reduce visas \nallocated to the family system in order to dramatically increase the \nproportion of visas distributed based on economic points. Once \nimplemented, these new economic points visas would then account for \nabout 40 percent of all visas, while family visas would account for \nless than half of all visas, with the remainder going for humanitarian \npurposes.\n  Under the new system, just a few of the current family preferences \nwould be retained in any recognizable form. Spouses and children of \nU.S. citizens would still be able to come, but parents of U.S. citizens \nwould no longer be counted as immediate family. Thus, most parents \nseeking to join their children and grandchildren in the United States \nwould be denied green cards.\n  The rest of the current family preferences--siblings, adult children, \nand many parents--would be eviscerated.\n  The new points system would also eliminate employment-based green \ncards altogether, forcing employers recruiting workers abroad to rely \nexclusively on short-term H-1B and Y visas. This proposal takes an \nadmittedly problematic employment-based visa system and replaces it \nwith a far more problematic temporary worker visa system.\n  The design of the points system leaves numerous questions unanswered. \nBeyond pushing workers from Latin America to the back of an endless \nline with no hope of ever reaching the front, the new points system \nleaves unspecified the crucial question of how migrants with sufficient \npoints will be prioritized. Government bureaucrats would thus be left \nwith unprecedented discretion to determine which immigrants have \nacceptable education, employment history, and work experience to merit \nadmission into the country.\n  Taken together, the questionable design of this points program and \nthe fundamental shift away from family preferences in the allocation of \nvisas raises enough flags that we should not simply rubberstamp this \nproposal and allow it to go forward.\n  Let me be clear. Senators Menendez, Feingold, and myself are not \nproposing to strike the program from the bill, but this system should \nbe revisited after a reasonable amount of time to determine whether it \nis working, how it can be improved, and whether we should return to the \ncurrent family and employer-based system that has worked so well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, we live in a global economy, and I do \nbelieve America will be strengthened if we welcome more immigrants who \nhave mastered science and engineering. But we cannot weaken the very \nessence of what America is by turning our back on immigrants who want \nto reunite with their family members, or immigrants who have the \nwillingness to work hard but might not have the right graduate degrees. \nThat is not who we are as a country. Should those without graduate \ndegrees who spoke Italian, Polish, or German instead of English have \nbeen turned back at Ellis Island, how many of our ancestors would have \nbeen able to enter the United States under this system?\n  Character and work ethic have long defined generations of immigrants \nto America. But these qualities are beyond the scope of this bill's \npoints system. It tells us nothing about what people who have been \nwithout opportunity can achieve once they are here. It tells us nothing \nabout the potential of their children to serve and to lead.\n  In short, the points system raises some serious concerns for me. I am \nwilling to defer to those Senators who negotiated this provision and \nsay we should give it a try, but I am not willing to say this untested \nsystem should be made virtually permanent. For that reason, I urge my \ncolleagues to support to sunset this points system after 5 years so we \ncan examine its effectiveness and necessity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think it is very appropriate you be \noccupying the Chair during this moment in this debate. My good friend \nfrom Illinois says to those who have worked so hard to get this bill to \nthe point it is at: Nothing personal, but I can't live with this \nprovision.\n  Bipartisanship is music to the American people's ears. When you are \nout there on the campaign trail, you are trying to bring us all \ntogether. You are trying to make America better. Why can't we work \ntogether? This is why we can't work together because some people, when \nit comes to the tough decisions, back away because when you talk about \nbipartisanship, some Americans on the left and the right consider it \nheresy, and we are giving in if we adopt this amendment.\n  The 12 million who have lived in fear for decades, my Republican \ncolleagues and a majority have told our base we are not going to put \nthem in jail and we are not going to deport them. No matter how much \nyou scream, no matter how much you yell, we are going to make them \nright with the law, we are going to punish them, but we are not going \nto play like they don't exist, and we are going to do things \ndifferently in the future.\n  If you care about families under this bill, people are united in 8 \nyears who would be 30 years getting here. If you care about families \nwanting to wake up one morning and not be afraid, this bill does it.\n  This amendment in the name of making the bill better says that \nbipartisanship doesn't have the ``bi'' in it. It means everybody over \nhere who has walked the plank and told our base you are wrong, you are \ngoing to destroy this deal. And that is exactly what it is, a deal--a \ndeal to make America more secure, to give people a chance to start \ntheir lives over again and to have a new system that has a strong \nfamily component but will make us competitive with the world because \nsome people don't want to say to the loud folks: No, you can't have \nyour way all the time.\n\n  Let me tell you, this is about as bipartisan as you will get, Mr. \nPresident. Some of us on the Republican side have been beat up and some \non the Democratic side have been beat up because we have tried to find \na way forward on a problem nobody else wants to deal with.\n  To my friend, Senator Kennedy, thank you for trying to find a way, as \nmuch as we are different, to make this country better, more secure, to \ntreat 12 million people in a way they have never been treated and, in \nmy opinion, deserve to be treated, to have a chance to start over.\n  What a sweet idea it is to have a second chance in life. Well, they \nare not going to get it if this is adopted, and America will be all the \nworse for it. What a great opportunity we have as a country not to \nrepeat the mistakes of 1986, by having a merit-based immigration system \nthat has a strong family component but frees up some green cards so we \ncan be competitive.\n  So when you are out on the campaign trail, my friend, telling about \nwhy can't we come together, this is why.\n  Mr. OBAMA addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I understand, but I wish to respond to my colleague from \nSouth Carolina since it appears to be directed at me.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object unless the Senator from South Carolina has \nsufficient time as well.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I would like to give additional time. When the Senator \nfrom South Carolina addresses me directly, I feel it is appropriate for \nme to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the \nopportunity to yield time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think I am entitled to yield time. I am in charge of \nthe time on this side. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts yields 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I have a very simple response to what we \njust heard. I think it is important to consider the actual amendment \nbefore us as opposed to what appeared to be a broad-based discussion of \nthe bill overall.\n  What this amendment specifically does is it says we will go forward \nwith the proposal that has been advanced by this bipartisan group. It \nsimply says we should examine after 5 years whether the program is \nworking. The notion that somehow that guts the bill or destroys the \nbill is simply disingenuous and it is engaging in the sort of \nhistrionics that is entirely inappropriate for this debate. This is a \nbill that says after 5 years, we will examine a point system in which \nwe have had no hearings in the public. Nobody has had an opportunity to \nconsider exactly how this was structured. It was structured behind \nclosed doors. And the notion that after 5 years we can reexamine it to \nsee if it is working properly, as opposed to locking it in for 14 \nyears, that somehow destroys the bipartisan nature of this bill is \nsimply untrue.\n  I ask all my colleagues to consider the nature of the actual \namendment that is on the floor as opposed to the discussion that \npreceded mine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1415\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to use the final minute of my \ntime on my amendment No. 1415 and say I want to make sure we are doing \neverything to be fair to the people who pay into our Social Security \nsystem. We know we will be adding more people in this bill, but we want \nto make sure they are people who have worked legally in the system. \nTherefore, I hope we will adopt my amendment No. 1415, cosponsored by \nSenator Grassley.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration \nin which he says the average annual savings in the bill from my \namendment would be approximately $300 million this year, and over the \n75-year period there will be more savings up front, fewer savings \ntoward the end of the 75 years, but the average would be about $300 \nmillion per year. That is into our Social Security trust fund.\n  It is a matter of fairness to the people who have paid legally, and I \nhope everyone will support amendment No. 1415.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Social Security Administration, Office of the Chief \n           Actuary,\n                                      Baltimore, MD, June 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n      Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: Matthew Acock of your staff and \n     Derek Kan of the Republican Policy Committee have requested \n     that we produce preliminary estimates of the effect of two \n     amendments to S. 1348, as amended with A. 1150, on the \n     financial status of the Social Security program. They \n     emphasized the need for at least preliminary estimates as \n     quickly as possible. We have developed preliminary estimates \n     for these amendments consistent with the analysis provided to \n     Chairman Max Baucus on the current bill S. 1348/1150.\n\n\nAmendment 1301: Option to Refund Payroll Taxes for Y-visa Guest Workers\n\n       Your amendment number 1301 to S.1348 would provide Y-visa \n     workers who have completed their time in this status and have \n     returned to their home country the option to get a refund of \n     employee payroll taxes from Social Security and Medicare. \n     Exercising the option would preclude obtaining credit for \n     these earnings toward Social Security or Medicare benefits. \n     It would also preclude returning to the United States as a Y-\n     visa guest worker in the future.\n       We assume that only those Y-visa workers who have no \n     intention of returning to the U.S. would exercise the option. \n     Such workers, without exercising the option, would often have \n     made the payroll tax contributions with no expectation of \n     receiving any benefits in the future because the limit of 6 \n     years in Y-visa status is not sufficient to obtain insured \n     status for most Social Security benefits (unless the U.S. and \n     the worker's home country have an in-force totalization \n     agreement). Thus, refunded payroll taxes under the amendment \n     would represent a reduction in revenue for the OASDI program.\n       Of the 200,000 Y-visas granted each year we estimate that \n     roughly two thirds would ultimately exercise the option to \n     receive their employee payroll taxes back as a refund. Those \n     not exercising the option would be individuals who either \n     attain legal permanent resident status in the U.S. or \n     overstay the Y-visa and continue residing in the U.S. on an \n     unauthorized basis. We estimate that the reduction in revenue \n     from this amendment, assuming it is enacted along with S. \n     1348/1150, would be a negligible worsening in the long-range \n     OASDI actuarial balance. The average annual cost over the 75-\n     year long-range projection period would be about equivalent \n     to $200 million this year.\n\n\n Amendment 1302: Withholding of Social Security Earnings Credits for Z-\n            Visa Workers When Not Legally Authorized to Work\n\n       S. 1348/1150 provides for legalization of current \n     undocumented immigrants who were\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\n     working in the United States on January 1, 2007. This \n     amendment would prohibit assigning credit toward OASDI \n     benefits for years in which earnings were received but the \n     worker was not legally authorized to work. The effect of the \n     amendment would restrict the use of such earnings credits for \n     Z-visa holders who obtained a legitimate Social Security \n     number (SSN) before January 1, 2007. S. 1348/1150 already \n     includes this restriction for workers who would first obtain \n     a legitimate SSN after 2006.\n       We estimate that almost one half of the 6.5 million \n     individuals expected to gain legal status under S. 1348/1150 \n     (through Z-visas and agricultural visas) would be affected by \n     this amendment. We estimate that the long-range actuarial \n     balance would be improved by 0.01 percent of taxable payroll.\n       We are hopeful that these quick preliminary estimates will \n     be helpful. We will be working on more detailed estimates and \n     must caution that due to the preliminary nature of estimates \n     mentioned here, the more detailed estimates could differ \n     somewhat. We look forward to continuing to work with you on \n     this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Stephen C. Goss.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1151\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Colorado \nand I have each had 5 minutes on my amendment. I have not had 5 minutes \nin rebuttal of the amendment of the Senator from Colorado. Let me tell \nyou what is going on. I know a lot people in this Chamber are going to \nthink no one is going to figure this out. I am going to say it over and \nover again after this is over if the outcome is as I anticipate it will \nbe.\n  First, this is probably the first time in 20 years we have had an \nhonest effort where we can make English our national language in the \nUnited States of America. This is something all the polling data shows \nis in the nineties--91 percent, 93 percent of the people in America who \nwant to have this amendment adopted.\n  In fact, a Zogby poll last month in May showed 76 percent of the \nHispanics in America want to have English as the national language.\n  The Salazar amendment is precisely what the underlying bill is. The \nunderlying bill--and I can read it to my colleagues, but I have done it \nthree times on the floor already--yes, it does put into law the \ncontroversial Executive Order 13166. My colleagues have heard a lot \nabout this from their constituents.\n  It says you are entitled to have your information, if you receive \nGovernment money, in any language of your choosing--Swahili or any \nother language. That is what is in the underlying bill. That also is in \nthe Salazar amendment.\n  This is what is going to be happening. My colleagues have a chance to \nchange all of this when they vote on the Inhofe amendment, which is I \nbelieve the third amendment in line tonight. What I don't want my \ncolleagues to do is vote for my amendment and then vote for the Salazar \namendment. All that does is put it right back where the bill is now. In \nother words, it would do away with my amendment and put it back as the \nlanguage is in the underlying bill.\n  So there is no reason in the world to do it, unless someone is trying \nto cover up their true position. If my colleagues believe we should \njoin the other 50 countries, such as Kenya, Ghana, and other countries \naround the world, that have English as their official language, then \nthis is a chance to do it. If my colleagues do not believe it, then \nthis is their chance to vote against the Inhofe amendment.\n  It is an act of hypocrisy if colleagues vote for the Inhofe amendment \nand then vote for the Salazar amendment to undo the Inhofe amendment. \nThat happened a year ago. Democrats and Republicans did that. However, \nthis time it will not go unnoticed.\n  It is interesting that every President back to and including Teddy \nRoosevelt in 1916 said very emphatically that we should have English as \nour official language, as our national language. It was said by \nPresident Clinton, it was said by the other President Roosevelt, by \nboth President Bushes, and everyone has been for it.\n  I have a listing I wish to make part of the Record that shows all of \nthe polling data in the last 5 years. It shows that between 85 and 95 \npercent of the American people want this amendment adopted. My \ncolleagues can turn their backs on them or they can try the old trick \nthey do around here all the time: Vote for the Inhofe amendment, and \nthen turn around to vote to undo it if they want.\n  One thing that was stated by the Senator from Colorado was there are \na lot of statutes this would negate. I remind my colleagues, if they \nread this bill, it says: Unless specifically provided by statute, no \nperson has a right, entitlement, or claim to have the Government of the \nUnited States or any of its officials or representatives act, \ncommunicate, perform, or provide services or provide materials in any \nlanguage other than English.\n  I have a list I also want to be made part of the Record that shows \nthere are many statutes where they mandate languages other than \nEnglish. A good example is the Court Interpreters Act. That is put in \nthere to protect the sixth amendment to the Constitution, so people can \nbe advised of their rights.\n  Again, my colleagues are going to have the opportunity to vote to \nmake English our national language. I hope they will adopt this. They \nwill certainly be serving their constituents well if they do. But if \nthey do, they shouldn't turn around and undo what they just did because \nthat is not going to go unnoticed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the polling information \nand the list of selected Federal laws requiring the use of languages \nother than English be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    National English Amendment Polls\n\n       Polls: All types of pollsters of all groups, liberal and \n     conservative, immigrant and nonimmigrant, with all wordings \n     show consistently high levels of support for making English \n     the official language of the United States:\n       1. A Zogby Poll conducted on May 17-20, 2007 showed that 83 \n     percent of Americans favor official English legislation, \n     including 76 percent of Hispanics. 94 percent of Republicans, \n     72 percent of Democrats, and 83 percent of Independents are \n     favorable to official English legislation.\n       2. An April 2007 McLaughlin & Associates poll showed 80 \n     percent of all Americans indicated that they would support a \n     proposal to make English the official language.\n       3. A December 2006 Zogby International poll showed that 92 \n     percent of Americans believe that preserving English as our \n     common language is vital to maintaining our unity.\n       4. A June 2006 Rasmussen Reports poll showed that making \n     English the nation's official language is favored by 85 \n     percent of Americans; this figure includes 92 percent of \n     Republicans, 79 percent of Democrats, and 86 percent of those \n     not affiliated with either major political party.\n       5. A March 2006 Zogby International Poll showed 84 percent \n     of likely voters support making English the official language \n     of government operations with commonsense exceptions.\n       6. A 2004 Zogby poll showed 92 percent of Republicans, 76 \n     of Democrats and 76 percent of Independents favor making \n     Englisgh the official language.\n       7. In 2000, Public Opinion Strategies showed 84 percent \n     favored English as the official language with only 12 percent \n     oppposed and 4 percent not sure.\n       8. A 1996 national survey by Luntz Research asked, ``Do you \n     think English should be made the Official Language of the \n     United States?'' 86 percent of Americans supported making \n     English the official language with only 12 opposed and 2 \n     percent not sure.\n       Latino immigrants support the concept of Official English:\n       1. An April 2007 McLaughlin & Associates poll showed that \n     80 percent of all Americans, including 62 percent of Latinos, \n     would support a proposal to make English the official \n     language.\n       2. A March 2006 Zogby poll found that 84 percent, of \n     Americans, including 71 percent of Hispanics, believe English \n     should be the official language of government operations.\n       3. My favorite poll is this one: In 2004 the National \n     Council of LaRaza found that 97 percent strongly (86.4 \n     percent or somewhat (10.9 percent) agreed that ``The ability \n     to speak English is important to succeed in this country.''\n\n                                STATUTES\n\nSelected Federal Laws Requiring the Use of Languages Other than English\n\n       The following are provisions of the United States Code \n     which expressly require the use of languages other than \n     English:\n       1.

I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think there are 2 minutes left on the \ndiscussion of this issue.\n  I hope our colleagues listened to the extraordinary history of the \nSalazar family. It is the living of the American dream. It is respect \nfor the Spanish language and Spanish tradition, and the reverence that \nit has for English today.\n  I am disappointed in the Inhofe amendment because the Inhofe \namendment doesn't add one nickel, it doesn't add 1 hour for those who \nwant to learn English. To learn English in my home city of Boston, MA, \nimmigrants have to wait 3 years in order to gain admission to a class \nto learn English. There are long waits in all parts of the country. If \nwe had some effort to try and provide the opportunity for those who do \nnot know English to learn English, I think we would be much better off.\n  Finally, as the Senator from Colorado has pointed out, the great \ncivil rights protections of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and \nExecutive order 13,166 as well as protections dealing with public \nhealth and safety that we have found to be so important in terms of \nensuring the health and the safety and the security of our people. \nProviding information needed to protect health and safety depend on \ncommunication--communication--and we have developed a process, a way of \nrespecting different traditions in order to be able to do that.\n  The Salazar amendment retains and respects that tradition, and it is \nthe way we should be proceeding and embracing this evening for the \nreasons he stated so well.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1374\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to yield time on the Ensign amendment. I think \nI have 5 minutes on the Ensign amendment in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator has 5 \nminutes on the Ensign amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Ensign amendment basically rearranges \nwhat we call the merit-based system that has been included in this \nlegislation. This was the subject of a good deal of debate: Do we want \nto develop a merit-based system that has been developed in some other \ncountries. It has had some success in some areas, some challenges in \nothers.\n  During the debate there was a question about how we would develop a \nmerit-based system to take in the needs of the United States. There are \nimportant needs in high skills, but we also understand from the \nDepartment of Labor that 8 out of the 10 areas of occupations are \nbasically low skill, what they call low skill. Those may be teachers, \nthey may be managers, or professional people in some areas, but they \nare basically individuals who have very important skills that are \nessential to the American economy.\n  We had debate about how we were going to work out that merit system, \nand in that whole process we worked diligently to find a system that is \ngoing to respect the higher skilled but also provides some opportunity \nfor the low skilled as well to be able to gain entry and then to gain \nwhat we call the sufficient points to move far forward and able to gain \ngreen cards and eventually citizenship.\n  The Ensign amendment absolutely emasculates that amendment and \nvirtually closes out all of the low-skilled possibilities for people \nwho might come on in as temporary workers or may come on in under other \nprovisions of this legislation. Under the Ensign amendment, all of \nthose individuals, the lower skilled, are effectively eliminated and \nclosed out, make no mistake about it. Make no mistake about it.\n  Finally, we have provisions in the legislation dealing with the \nhigher skills, called the H-1B provisions. That is directly related to \nhigher skills. We have addressed that issue in other provisions of the \nlegislation.\n  For those reasons, I would hope the Ensign amendment would not be \naccepted.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1339\n\n  Mr. President, on the Vitter amendment, let me add some additional \npoints to this debate. A great deal of time was spent listening to \nSecretary Chertoff, to making recommendations about what is going to be \nin the national security interest to preserve our borders. That was one \nof the most important parts of the development of this legislation.\n  Senator Isakson came forward with a very important suggestion and a \nproposal with regard to ensuring that we were going to have true \nnational security, protection of our national security before other \nprovisions were going to be set forth. We have had good chances during \nthe period of these past months to work with Homeland Security and to \nwork with all of the Members of this body to ensure we were going to \nhave effective provisions to protect national security. We even \naccepted a Gregg amendment which we believed added to the provisions \nthat were accepted.\n  It is our belief those provisions are sufficient, the allocations of \nresources for the border, the utilization of enhanced border patrols, \nthe enhanced border security, which has been outlined time and again \nduring the course of this debate. They are sufficient. So I would hope \nat the time that amendment is addressed it would not be accepted.\n\n[[Page S7159]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1316\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Dorgan \namendment. I was a little surprised to see it in order, but that \nhappens quite often around here. This is the same amendment we voted on \na couple of weeks ago. It was a close vote, I realize, but I didn't \nknow we were going to have a practice of second chances on amendments \nafter they were defeated.\n  It seems to me this is something that is very unnecessary. But if we \nget into the custom here with so many amendments that we vote again and \nagain, I don't think that is good for this process. I think the process \nthat has taken place so far has been very commendable. Both managers \nhave done a great job, but this is another attempt to do away with the \ntemporary worker program. It is another attempt to kill this \nlegislation. That is what it will do. That is exactly what this \namendment does.\n  We had vigorous debate on it once, with a long period of debate, and \nit was defeated. Now, basically, we are having another vote again. I \ndon't think that is appropriate. But more important, one thing that \nhasn't changed, I say to my colleagues, if you pass this, it kills the \nbill. We have made too much progress with too much debate and with too \nmuch consensus to revisit the same issue over again and have it carry \nthis time.\n  I am sure the sponsor of the amendment has some reason for bringing \nit up again, but I don't think there is a good reason, and I hope we \nwill reject this amendment because it has already been rejected.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I take the time on the Dorgan amendment \nmyself. How much time remains on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have opposed the Dorgan amendment each \ntime for very important and basic reasons. We are attempting to secure \nour borders. We are going to secure our borders. We know, even when we \nsecure our borders, we are going to have pressure on those borders to \ncome through. People are either going to come through the front door or \nthey are going to come through the back door.\n  What do I mean by that? If they are coming through the back door, \nthey are going to be the undocumented and the exploited undocumented \nworkers, such as we have seen in my own city of New Bedford, where they \nare arrested and exploited and are driving down wages. If they come \nthrough the front door, they are going to meet the needs of American \nindustry when we find there are no existing options for American \nworkers. There is going to be the requirement that you have to get \nAmerican workers first. We have accepted that and restated that with \nthe Durbin amendment. But if they are able to gain entry into the \nUnited States, they are going to have the kind of protections that are \nincluded in the legislation.\n  I have listened to those who have been opposed to the temporary \nworkers, saying there are no rights and protections for these temporary \nworkers. They ought to read the bill. They ought to read the bill, \nbecause any temporary worker who is going to be hired is going to be \nguaranteed the prevailing wage, they are going to be protected by the \nOSHA provisions, they are going to be protected by workmen's \ncompensation, and they are going to have the opportunity, we believe, \nover a period of time, if they have come in, to try to improve \nthemselves, to learn English, to involve themselves in an employment \nprogram to begin to go up the ladder in terms of getting a green card. \nSo that is the choice.\n  If we act to eliminate the temporary worker program, we are going to \nfind what we have at the present time, that hundreds of individuals die \nin the desert; that we are going to have those individuals who are able \nto gain entry in the United States and are undocumented and they are \ngoing to be exploited, as they are exploited today, and they will drive \ndown wages, as happens today. That happens to be the situation.\n  Some like some temporary worker programs better than others, but we \nhave the one we have in this bill and we have every intention to try \nand make it work. We have set up a careful system in the bill to \naccommodate the concerns about the size of the temporary worker \nprogram. There is, as well, a market-based adjustment that is crucial \nto the provision in the bill, and I think it would be a great mistake \nto effectively emasculate the temporary worker program. That is what \nthe Dorgan amendment would do.\n  Mr. President, I believe that I am the only one who has time that is \nremaining. If that be the case, I would be glad to yield back the \nremaining time.\n  I ask if the Chair would be good enough to state the amendments, the \nfirst amendment that would be before the Senate at this time. We have a \nseries of different votes, and I think we ought to have the opportunity \nto make sure all of us understand exactly what we are voting on.\n  I believe the hour of 10 o'clock has arrived, and I yield whatever \ntime remains, and I think we expect yeas and nays votes on all of them.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1183\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the Clinton amendment, \nNo. 1183.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \nClinton amendment, No. 1183, to S. 1348, violates section 201, the pay-\nas-you-go point of order of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent resolution \non the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable provisions \nin the Budget Act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) \nand the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

On this vote, the yeas are 44, the nays are \n53. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The point of order is sustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1374\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided on amendment No. 1374, offered by the junior Senator \nfrom Nevada, Mr. Ensign.\n\n[[Page S7160]]\n\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, my amendment goes to the merit-based \nsystem. We have a serious problem in this country where we are \ngraduating incredible engineers from our high-tech universities. When \nthey graduate, we say: You must go home.\n  I had a company in my office today from Silicon Valley. They are \nopening an office in Singapore, hiring American graduates, foreign-born \ngraduates from American universities, opening in Singapore because they \ncannot hire them in this country. There are not enough visas.\n  My amendment fixes the merit-based system and says we want to attract \nthe best and the brightest from around the world. The high-tech \ncommunity supports my amendment because they think the underlying bill \nis flawed.\n  Mr. President, India and China will graduate 600,000 to 700,000 \nengineers. We will be graduating 65,000 to 70,000. Half of ours are \nforeign-born. We do not have enough of that brain power coming into \nthis country like we have had in the past. Those who came here will \ncome here and create opportunities for other people in the United \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the merit-based system that is included \nin this legislation as it exists at the present time is heavily skewed \ntoward the high skills. I would say 75 to 80 percent of those who are \ngoing to qualify in the merit-based system are going to be for the \nhighly skilled.\n  There is the reservation under the skill system, 25 or 30 percent for \nlower skills because our economy designed high skills, and the \nDepartment of Labor says 8 out of 10 occupations that our Nation needs \nare low skills: teacher's aides, home health aides, and others.\n  That has been worked out. That is the way it is. Under the Ensign \namendment you would completely skew it to shortchange all of the low \nskills, all for the high skills. We are taking care of the high skills \nwith the H-1B program. If we need to do something about that, then \nlet's have amendments to do it.\n  But this way effectively is saying to millions of people who have \ncome here and have been absolutely indispensable to our economy that \nthey are never going to have a chance to be part of the American dream.\n  I hope the amendment will be defeated.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 1384 offered by the \nSenator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask for a ``yes'' vote on Salazar 1384 \nand a ``no'' vote on Inhofe 1151, and the 2 minutes under that time I \nwill yield to Senator Domenici from New Mexico.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry, before the Senator speaks: Is the \n2 minutes equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 2 minutes equally divided. The senior \nSenator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Parliamentary inquiry: The senior Senator from New \nMexico is recognized for 2 minutes to speak on both amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are now considering only the Salazar \namendment. There are 2 minutes to be divided equally.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent that the senior Senator from New \nMexico be given 2 minutes to speak on both Salazar 1384 and Inhofe \n1151.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I yield 1 minute on Salazar 1384 and request a ``yes'' \nvote and yield the time to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I, too, ask for a ``yes'' vote on the \nSalazar-Domenici amendment which everybody should understand says that \nthe English language is the common language of the United States. I \ncome from a State that is different from most of yours in that we have \nhad a long history of trouble regarding what language we speak; this \nhas been so from the very time New Mexico started to become a State. \nThe legislature of the United States played around with New Mexico in \nan effort to see if there could be enough Anglos so there wouldn't be a \nmajority of Spanish speakers at the State's infancy. We were told we \nhad to wait for Statehood until there was a majority of English \nspeakers in New Mexico, and the U.S. Supreme Court later said the \nCongress could not do that to New Mexico. New Mexico could do what they \ndesired. We voted in a State constitution that still stands that says \nEnglish and Spanish are common languages and you can speak both \nlanguages.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is very simple. I hope everyone \nunderstands and is listening. We are going to have an opportunity in a \nfew minutes to vote on another amendment which we will describe at that \ntime with 2 minutes equally divided.\n  If you are opposed to English as the national language of the United \nStates, then vote for the Salazar amendment. That is exactly what it \ndoes. His amendment says anyone who receives Federal money is \nentitled--this is an entitlement--to have the documentation in any \nlanguage he or she chooses. It could be in Swahili, French, any other \nlanguage.\n  So if you are opposed to English as the national language, go ahead \nand vote for this amendment. But keep in mind, when you do, that 91 \npercent of Americans are on our side of this issue and want English to \nbe the national language, and 76 percent of the Hispanics, as a result \nof a poll that was taken in May of this year--a Zogby poll--are for \nEnglish as the national language.\n  I ask you to defeat the Salazar amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to Salazar amendment No. 1384.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last year, a year and a month ago, we had \nthis same vote. Sixty-two people in this Chamber voted in favor of it, \nand I will ask them to do the same again. This, very simply--we talked \nabout this many times--makes English the official, the national \nlanguage of the United States as opposed to giving an entitlement to \nanyone, to any other language, which is in, of course, the amendment we \npassed.\n  If this amendment passes, it will go to conference, and we will have \nan opportunity to do something in conference to decide whether it is a \ncombination of these or one or the other should prevail. So I ask that \nyou do what 90 percent of your constituents want you to do and that is \nvote yes on the Inhofe amendment to make English the national language \nof the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Colorado is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to vote no on 1151 \nfor three reasons. First, it is in violation of the very delicate \ncompromise, the bipartisan compromise that has been put together by \nboth Republicans and Democrats. Second of all, it is an absolute \ntransparent attempt to undo the Executive Orders of President Bush and \nPresident Clinton and the implementation memorandums from both of those \nPresidents. Third, this is a States' rights issue.\n  Fourth, for me, I remember having my mouth washed out with soap as a \nyoung man for speaking the Spanish language, which is my native \nlanguage. I love English and we should encourage people to speak \nEnglish.\n  This amendment is nothing but a divisive amendment among the people \nof the United States. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nAllard be added as a cosponsor on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the underlying bill does not allow \nSocial Security credits for work done with a fraudulent card. However, \nit does allow credit for work done on visa overstays. We all know that \nis estimated to be about 40 percent of the 12 million estimated illegal \nimmigrants.\n  Mr. President, if we don't pass this amendment, it could jeopardize \nthe integrity of the Social Security system for all the hard-working \npeople who are going to depend on that for their retirement. It would \nbe a loss of about $28 billion per year. I urge adoption of my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. She has \nworked with the managers of this legislation. We are prepared to accept \nthis amendment. We thank her for the courtesy, and we hope the \nmembership will support her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Texas.\n  The amendment (No. 1415) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1339\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on amendment No. 1339 offered by \nthe Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple and \nstraightforward. It would add to the enforcement trigger mechanism of \nthe bill that the US-VISIT Program be fully operational. This is the \nentry/exit system program that has been authorized since 1996 but has \nnever been put into operation.\n  As Senator Hutchison just mentioned, we all know a huge part of the\n\n[[Page S7162]]\n\nillegal immigration problem is visa overstays. The latest estimate, in \n2006, is that 4 million to 5.5 million visa overstays are illegal \nimmigrants in this country. We cannot get a handle on that problem \nwithout the US-VISIT system knowing when people are leaving the country \nand, thus, whether they are overstaying their visa. Yet that is not \npart of the enforcement mechanism in the bill at all.\n  Let's vote for this amendment and make it part of the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there was no difference among all of us \nin trying to ensure that we were going to have a secure America. We \nworked very closely with Secretary Chertoff. In this legislation, we \nhave increased it to 27,000 detention beds, 20,000 border guards, 375 \nmiles of fencing, 275 vehicle barriers, 70 ground-based radars and \ncameras, sensors, and 4 unmanned aerial vehicles. We accepted the \nIsakson trigger, saying that the other aspects of this legislation will \nnot go into effect until these are committed. Then we accepted the \nGregg additions. We are in the process now of trying to negotiate with \nthe administration to get mandatory spending to make sure all these are \ndone, and done expeditiously.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security thinks we have met our \nresponsibilities. I hope the amendment will not be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER.

Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nof debate equally divided on amendment No. 1202 offered by the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Obama.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It sunsets \nafter 5 years the points system that has been structured in this bill. \nI wish to emphasize that I think the authors of this legislation \ndeserve credit for working diligently and coming up with a carefully \nbalanced bill, but the points system we are transitioning to is a \nradical departure from the one we have had in the past. The question \nis, do we, after 5 years, take a look and see whether it is working \nproperly? Is it one that is inhibiting families from unifying in this \ncountry? Is it something that is making it easier or harder for \nemployers to operate effectively in a lawful fashion?\n  What this amendment simply says is that after 5 years, we will \nreexamine the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I leave it there. I ask my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues who worked to put \nthis bill together, they know what this does. The deal is that in 8 \nyears people will be reunited as families who never would have seen \neach other for maybe 30 years. We have united families in 8 years. The \nZ visa people have a chance to start over, but only after the backlog \nis cleared.\n  The merit-based system is the vehicle to be used after 8 years so \nthey can come into our system and maybe one day be a citizen and get a \ngreen card. If we sunset the merit-based system at 5 years, there is no \nvehicle left, and to us over here, what would my colleagues say if we \nsunsetted the Z program in 5 years? My colleagues would walk, and they \nshould.\n  This is not right. This does not help us as a country.\n  This destroys the vehicle to solve a problem that has been neglected \nfor 20-something years.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote no for the sake of the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, will this be the last vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This will be the last vote; that is correct.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a sunset of the temporary worker \nprogram in 5 years. It is a new bill, a new program, with more \nquestions than answers. It seems to me that we ought to ask some \nquestions at the end of 5 years.\n\n[[Page S7163]]\n\n  In the fifth year, we will have 600,000 jobs assumed by temporary \nworkers coming in; in the fourth year, 400,000 jobs, and on and on. So \nthe question is, How many of them are going to leave? What if they do \nnot leave? Are we going to come back to the floor with a new \nimmigration bill, talking about illegal immigration? Why don't we \nsunset after 5 years to see if this has worked?\n  Let me make a final point as we vote. We have had a lot of discussion \nabout immigration, but no one on the floor of the Senate is talking \nabout the impact on American workers. All of these jobs the temporary \nworkers will assume are going to compete with people at the bottom of \nthe economic ladder in this country. They are called American workers \nas well.\n  Let us sunset this and evaluate what we are doing, what kind of \ncontribution to illegal immigration this will amount to, and what \nimpact it has on American workers. Let us sunset this at the end of 5 \nyears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is the third time we have dealt with \nthis issue. As much as I respect the Senator from North Dakota, he \ndoesn't care more about American workers than I do.\n  The fact is, if you have a secure border, workers are either going to \ncome in through the front door or the back door. If they come in \nthrough the back door, as they are now doing, they are going to be \nexploited and humiliated. If they come through the front door, as a \nresult of the fact that there is no American worker prepared to take \nthat job, they are going to get labor protections, the prevailing wage, \nOSHA protections, workmen's compensation, and they are going to have \nthose kinds of protections which they do not have now.\n  You may not like the temporary worker program, but we have to have \npredictability for a period of time. In the legislation are correcting \nmechanisms for this program. Let us at least give it a chance to work.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know the hour is late and we have had a \nlong day. I think it has been a very productive day. Due to the delay \nin getting amendments actually voted on, of course, the amendment I had \nvoted on this morning had been pending for a full 2 weeks before we \nwere able to secure an agreement to vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up some of my pending amendments so \nwe can get them pending. I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \n1400, which is at the desk, be called up for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would have to object. We are in the \nprocess of attempting to clear up these. We have had a very full day. I \nwant to thank the Senator from Texas for his cooperation. We will try \nto address these in an orderly way. We have been trying to process some \nof these back and forth. I think we have made extraordinary progress \ntoday. We are trying to make sure everyone's voice and interests \npositioned on those issues are going to have an opportunity to be \nheard. Now I have to object. I will work with the Senator and see if we \ncannot arrange time for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know it has been a long day. But the \nmajority leader has filed a cloture motion which will be voted on \ntomorrow. There is concern that there are many amendments that have \nbeen filed which have not been allowed to be called up and be made \npending.\n  While I think there have been some recent indications that there is \nmore of a willingness to allow amendments to be considered, I am very \nconcerned, because of the procedural posture we will find ourselves in \nvery soon, that some of these amendments will not be allowed to be \nconsidered.\n  I am concerned as well that may very well affect how many of us are \nrequired to vote on cloture. I think there has been a recent spirit of \ncooperation which I hope continues. But if there is going to be an \ninsistence on a vote on cloture, and at the same time a denial of the \nopportunity of many of us to call up amendments and actually have them \nconsidered and voted on, I do not think we will have any alternative \nbut to vote against cloture.\n  I regret the reluctance to allow us to call up amendments continues \nat this time. If permitted, I want to call up at least four of my \namendments: 1400, 1208, 1337, and 1399. But I understand there has been \nobjection lodged. There likely will be objection lodged to additional \nunanimous consent requests.\n  I would note for the record here that there are a lot of other \namendments that have not been allowed to be considered, and we have got \na lot of work to do before we can consider that everybody has had the \nopportunity to call up amendments and have them voted on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would state for the record that last \nyear before cloture was successfully invoked on immigration, the Senate \ndisposed of 30 amendments with 23 rollcall votes. This year, after \nvotes just completed, the Senate has disposed of 41 amendments, with 27 \nrollcall votes, 11 amendments more than when we last considered this \nbill under the other party's control. Not counting side-by-side \nalternative amendments, there have been 18 Democratic amendments \noffered, compared to 21 Republican amendments. Counting side by sides, \nit is 21 Democrats, 22 Republicans. So I would say to my friend from \nTexas, by standards of the last debate on the immigration bill, we have \nconsidered 11 more amendments, we have had more rollcall votes, there \nhave been more side by sides and other votes offered from the \nRepublican side than the Democratic side.\n  So I say at this point this has been a fair and complete process. It \nis now 12:20 in the morning. We have worked a long day; probably have 2 \nlong days ahead of us. But to argue that Members have not had their \nchance to express themselves through the amendment process is not \nreflected in the actual vote.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I do not dispute the numbers. They are \nwhat\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\nthey are. But I would point out that this bill did not go through the \nJudiciary Committee. Last year when the McCain-Kennedy amendment and \nthe bill considered in the Judiciary Committee, I believe there were 62 \namendments filed. I think there were a lot more filed than that, but \nactually 62 amendments. So there was a process at the Judiciary \nCommittee level last year which gave people an opportunity to have \ntheir positions heard. That has not been the case this year. I would \npoint that out as an obvious point of distinction. I hope there is not \ngoing to be any attempt to try to force this bill through before \nSenators are ready to consider all or at least a reasonable number of \namendments, because I do not think we will have any alternative but to \nvote against cloture, to allow debate to continue and allow additional \namendments to be heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the interests of allowing Senator \nCornyn and other Senators to offer amendments, I make a unanimous \nconsent request that cloture votes be postponed tomorrow until 4 p.m. \nso Senator Cornyn and others who wish to can offer amendments before \nthe cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I believe a \ndemonstration of willingness to allow us to call up amendments and have \nthem debated and actually voted on would have been reflected in the \nlast 2 weeks. As I have pointed out, I was denied for a full 2 weeks an \nopportunity to have the very first amendment I called up actually \nscheduled for a vote. I know the distinguished deputy majority leader \nis acting in good faith. But I think we need to have a vote on that \ncloture motion at the time it is currently scheduled. So I would \nrespectfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have offered amendments on a number of \noccasions and had asked those amendments be made pending, and set aside \nthe pending business to make certain amendments pending. I have had \nobjection.\n  At this time I once again ask that amendment No. 1323, which we \nreferred to as the Charlie Norwood amendment, that deals with \nempowering State and local law enforcement officers to participate \nthrough the normal process, if they choose, be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is pretty clear what has been \noccurring is very few amendments have had the opportunity to get a real \ndebate. This is an important amendment. It deals with whether local law \nenforcement can actually participate in any meaningful way in the \nenforcement of Federal immigration laws. I will tell you what the facts \nare, with the help from my fine staff chief counsel, Cindy Hayden.\n  We wrote a law review article for Stanford University Law School that \ndealt with this issue, and it is a very important issue. It is one \nwell-understood by the legal professionals who have been behind the \nscenes crafting this legislation.\n  The ninth circuit has held that visa overstays, which make up 40, \nmaybe 45 percent, and in the future, if this bill becomes law, maybe \nmore than 50 percent of the people illegally in the country, would be \nvisa overstays.\n  Those persons, if involved in some traffic accident, like many of the \nterrorists were before 9/11--they were stopped for traffic violations \nby local police officers, but because that is not a normal criminal \nviolation, as is the case for people who have come across the border, \nthey are not detainable under the ninth circuit ruling by local police \nofficers.\n  So it is a weird thing. Several other circuits seem to have held \ndifferently. But the ninth circuit case was most on point. Lawyers for \npolice departments all over America are telling their police \ndepartments: You may not have authority to hold anybody, so even if you \napprehend someone you are concerned about who could even be a \nterrorist, like those people involved in 9/11, or like John Malvo, who \nwas involved in those murders, was stopped for traffic violations, we \ndo not have a system in place to even allow local police to detain them \nfor even a short period of time until they are turned over to the \nFederal authorities.\n  That is the way the system ought to work. There are 600,000 to \n800,000 State and local law enforcement officers in America. We are not \ntrying to mandate that they do anything. But in the course of their \nbusiness, their normal duties, if they come upon people in violation of \nthe law, they ought to be able to hold them and turn them over to the \nFederal authorities.\n  I am disappointed we are not getting to move forward on that \namendment, very disappointed. We had this matter sort of fixed in \nJudiciary Committee last year. Then an amendment came up--somebody \nfigured out the significance of it, and that amendment took it out. \nEver since, any effort to get that to be made a part of this fix has \nbeen undermined and blocked.\n  I say to my colleagues, I do not believe anybody can say they have a \ncommitment to having an enforceable immigration system if they throw \nroadblocks up that undermine the ability of State and local law \nenforcement to participate in their normal course of their duties by \ndetaining people they come upon who are here illegally. You would think \nthat would be an easy thing to get done. I have said before, it seems \nwhen it comes to immigration, many things can be accepted, many things \npeople approve of. But if you come up with something that actually is \nvery effective, that is what gets objected to. This is something that \nis critical. It is a testament and a test of our will and our \nseriousness as a body.\n  If we are not prepared to pass legislation like the Norwood \namendment, named after former House Member Charlie Norwood from \nGeorgia, who died recently, if we are not prepared to do that, we are \nnot serious about this.\n  I will say one more thing. Time and time and time again, I have heard \nMembers of this body say: Oh, we cannot vote for this amendment, or you \nmust vote against that amendment. Why? Because we have an agreement. A \ncompromise. It violates our compromise. Well, who was in on that \ncompromise? I am frankly getting tired of that. That is not \nsatisfactory to me.\n  The question really should be, is this amendment good or not good for \nthe legitimate interests of the Nation? No one small group of people \nhave a right to meet in secret with special interest groups and write \nan immigration bill and ram it down the throat of this Senate. I oppose \nit. It is not right. You can agree or disagree on these amendments, but \ndo so on the merits, whether or not it actually makes sense, not on \nsome deal made by some advocacy group or some business interest. That \nis not what this Senate is all about.\n  I hope today the people will begin to see that a small group of \nSenators who meet in secret and plot out a bill, that if printed in \nactual bill language would be 1,000 pages, don't have the power to say \nwe can't have amendments and we can't change it, and if you do get an \namendment up, we are all going to stick together and vote it down \nbecause it doesn't comply with our little compromise.\n  The masters of the universe are playing a tough game here. I have \ncalled them that affectionately. I respect the Members who have \nattempted to do what maybe they thought was right. But when you look at \nthe bill, it is a product of a political compromise. A group of \npoliticians met in secret and wrote a bill that is exceedingly \ntechnical, exceedingly important.\n  Let me tell you who was not there in this meeting. The American \npeople were not there. Who was advocating for the American people?\n  I will tell you another group who was not there. That is the law \nenforcement agencies that are charged with enforcing our laws at the \nborder. They weren't there. As a matter of fact, they had a press \nconference a couple of days ago. They were at the national press club \nand made a presentation. These are senior retired officials who had \nmany decades of experience in enforcing our laws at the border. They \nuniformly condemn this legislation, as do the Border Patrol Agents \nAssociation. They condemn it roundly. Hugh Brien, himself an immigrant, \nbecame chief of the Border Patrol from 1986 to 1989. I started making \nnotes on C-SPAN the night before last. I just happened to\n\n[[Page S7165]]\n\nturn it on. He said this bill is a ``sell out, a complete betrayal of \nthe nation, a slap in the face to millions coming here legally.''\n  He referred to the people in 1986 who passed the 1986 act and \npromised it would do things as our masters and our mandarins, who said \nthe bill was going to work and it never worked. He said:\n\n       Based on my experience, it's a disaster.\n\n  Kurt Lundgren, national chairman of the Association of Former Border \nPatrol Agents said this:\n\n       There are no meaningful criminal or terrorist checks in the \n     bill.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Screening will not happen.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Congress is lying about it.\n\n  With regard to the proposal that record checks would be performed \nwithin 24 hours, he said:\n\n       There's no way records can be done in 24 hours. As to the \n     proposal that Senator Cornyn tried to fix that allows gang \n     members, MS-13 international gang organization groups to get \n     amnesty by simply saying they renounce their allegiance to \n     the gang, he said:\n       What planet are they from?\n\n  Jim Dorcy, an agent for 30 years and inspector general with the \nDepartment of Justice that handled investigations into all these areas \ninvolving the Border Patrol, internal investigations, he said:\n\n       The 24-hour check is a recipe for disaster.\n\n  Referring to the bill, Mr. Dorcy, 30 years with the Border Patrol \nsaid:\n\n       I call it the al-Qaida dream bill.\n\n  Roger Brandemuehl, chief of the Border Patrol from 1980 to 1986, \nsecond one I am calling on here that was chief of it, said:\n\n       We have fallen into a quagmire.\n\n  He said:\n\n       The so-called comprehensive reform is neither comprehensive \n     nor reform.\n\n  He said:\n\n       It's flawed.\n\n  He set forth some principles that he thought would actually work. \nWhen asked had he been consulted by the masters of the universe who \ncobbled this bill together, a bunch of politicians who have never \narrested anybody in their lives, they joked about it. They never have \nbeen consulted. Nobody wanted to know what they knew or cared about.\n  I will just wrap up and say I am not comfortable with the way this \nbill is going. I think we have been slow-walked in the way the majority \nleader and the group that is trying to move this bill forward is doing \nthis. They are objecting to having amendments pending. So when cloture \nis filed, if an amendment is not pending, it fails. It can't be voted \non postcloture. So this way they have been able to maintain control \nover the amendment process and will be able to maintain it, even if \ncloture is obtained tomorrow. I don't know what will happen tomorrow, \nbut I know this: There are a lot of good amendments. I have seen some \nof the amendments Senator Cornyn has that are important. I know some of \nthe amendments I have are important to having a good, lawful \nimmigration system. There remain major flaws in this legislation. We \nshould not pass it in its present form.\n  In rebuttal to the constant refrain that somehow this bill is going \nto end the lawlessness and create a lawful system, I point out that the \nCongressional Budget Office, just 2 years ago, issued their analysis of \nthe bill and concluded there would only be a 25-percent reduction in \nthe number of people coming into our country illegally. We have gone \nthrough all this, and we are only going to get a 25-percent reduction \nin the number of people who come here illegally, when we arrested last \nyear over a million people. What kind of system is this?\n  I wish the principles and goals contained in the talking points that \nwere bandied about early on in this process could have been achieved. I \nhad hoped they would and said some good things about it because I \nthought some of the principles involved in this year's process were a \nbit better than last year, but the truth is, when you read the fine \nprint, very little progress was made in those directions, and the major \nflaws continue. I just wish it weren't so. But that is my opinion of \nit. I don't think we are on the road to improving the bill. I don't \nthink we are proceeding effectively to allow full debate and amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 1311, as Modified, to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Good morning, Mr. President.\n  On behalf of Senator Coburn, I call up amendment No. 1311 and ask \nthat the amendment be modified with the changes at the desk and then be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Whitehouse], for Mr. \n     Coburn and Mr. DeMint, proposes an amendment numbered 1311, \n     as modified.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the enforcement of existing border security and \n   immigration laws and Congressional approval before amnesty can be \n                                granted)\n\n       Strike section 1 and all that follows through page 4, line \n     11 and insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to clarify the record of my vote on \nBingaman amendment No. 1267. I intended to vote against the amendment. \nI do not support the amendment and I wish to explain why.\n  The Bingaman amendment No. 1267 would have allowed certain future \nlegal temporary workers to renew their work visas from the United \nStates, rather than being required to leave the country for a period of \ntime to reapply. In order to have a true temporary worker program, \nworkers must only come to the U.S. for a season and then return to \ntheir home country. If workers are instead permitted to stay in the \nU.S., they will likely establish economic and familial roots, and will \nnot want to leave when their legal visa has expired. People who want to \ntake part in our society should seek legal citizenship, rather than \nextending upon an agreement that was intended to be temporary. I \nencourage those who have respected our laws and want to live in our \ncountry to apply for a green card and become a U.S. citizen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7167-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I stand before you to honor the memory \nof the heroes who sacrificed their lives on the beaches of Normandy 63 \nyears ago today. It was these brave men who stared into the face of the \nstark unknown and forged on to military victory. Supreme Allied \nCommander and future President Dwight D. Eisenhower led the decisive \ninvasion, now known as D-day, that brought liberation throughout \nEurope.\n  It was on June 6, 1944, at 6:30 a.m., that the first assault wave of \na great armada rolled onto the beaches of Normandy, France. Operation \nOverlord commenced and everyone involved knew there was no turning \nback. And while the size and scope of the operation were colossal, so \nwere the risks. The success of the battle hinged on the element of \nsurprise, and with literally thousands of men involved in the planning, \nits secrecy hinged on those same men. It is clear these men were the \nepitome of unfailing loyalty, courage, and solidarity. The invasion had \nbeen postponed a day due to weather, and it was only after assurances \nfrom a meteorologist that conditions would improve that General \nEisenhower agreed to proceed. But still, cloudy skies caused drop zones \nto be overshot, and\n\n[[Page S7168]]\n\nmore than half of the equipment to be parachuted in was lost. But \nsoldiers persisted, risks paid off, and bravery triumphed over peril. \nOn that dangerous early morning, following a treacherous English \nChannel crossing, 150,000 Allied troops took the shore, and 100,000 \ncontinued inland. Mr. President, 9,000 men were lost that day, but it \nwent down in history as the decisive battle that turned the tide of the \nwar.\n  I am proud to bring your attention to what these men did. And as I \nrecognize their valor on this remarkable anniversary, I think it is \nboth fitting and necessary to recognize the valor of our troops in \nbattle today who are no less brave, and who face uncertainty and risk, \nas did those who fought for freedom in the Second World War. I wish I \ncould stand up here and draw other comparisons between these two wars--\nWWII and the global war on terror--and between the threats of Nazism \nand terrorism, because it is without a doubt that World War II, despite \nour human losses, brought a unity of cause to our Nation, and that \nwould be a great place for us to be again. But the fact is that we are \nin a different world and a different century; we face a different \nenemy, and, most of all, our Nation has tremendous differences on how \nto deal with this enemy.\n  However, as with the heroism demonstrated by our fighting forces both \nthen and now, there are other unmistakable parallels. The invasion on \nD-day marked a pivotal time in history when the outcome was uncertain. \nThe great generals going into battle had faith and trust in their \ntroops, but knew their bold strategy carried with it great risk. Just \nbefore the invasion, MG Leroy Watson, commander of the 3rd Armored \nDivision, sent his troops this message:\n\n       This is the greatest military operation in the history of \n     the world. Its success or failure will determine the course \n     of events for the next hundred years.\n\n  General Eisenhower, also uncertain about the outcome, prepared a \nletter which he never had to deliver, accepting responsibility for the \nloss. He expected catastrophic failure and military victory. He wrote \nto his troops:\n\n       My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon \n     the best information available. The troops, the Air and the \n     Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do.\n\n  The leaders knew the danger, but also knew the consequences of \nfailure. In Iraq, and in the fight against terrorism, we must continue \nto stay the course, because the stakes of not winning are too high, \nand, as was the case on D-day, we are again in a pivotal time in \nhistory. And again, the outcome will surely determine the course of \nevents for the remainder of this century.\n  D-day was a tremendous battle, with thousands of casualties over the \ncourse of a day. It was a time of great loss for our Nation. And amidst \nthose losses stand stories of bravery, individual valor and resounding \nbrotherhood--stories that enveloped the historic battle and \npersonalized it for a nation. And I can tell you that the soldiers I \nmet in Iraq, and the troops whose stories I heard at Fort Benning and \nFort Stewart, will be remembered in the annals of our Nation as \nwarriors who are as brave, as strong, and as committed as the heroes of \nD-day we remember today.\n  And the Generals who led these brave men will also never be \nforgotten. World War II saw Eisenhower, Patton, Marshall and Bradley--\nall of these men have secured their places in history. And today and in \nthe future we will remember the legacies of Petraeus, Odierno, \nMcChrystal, and Fallon--generals and admirals whose leadership, \ningenuity, courage and forthrightness are shaping the Iraq strategy, \nand no doubt its military outcome.\n  So in drawing these parallels, my conclusion is that in the history \nof war, there are some constants: the bravery of soldiers, the \nuncertainty of battle, the value of leadership, and the necessity of \nvictory. These things never change. They were evident on June 6, 1944, \nand they are evident today. And so it is on the 63rd anniversary of D-\nday, the decisive battle of World War II, that I recognize the heroes \nwho fought, lived, and died valiantly. And I thank them and their \nfamilies for setting an example and standard our warriors remember on \nthe battlefield today, and for creating a generation that is willing \nand able to set the same standard and example for our heroes of \ntomorrow. I hope that our men and women in uniform serving around the \nworld today will draw courage from the example of those who have gone \nbefore them as they execute the responsibilities we as a nation have \ntrusted them to carry out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7168-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ``BILL'' FRANCE, JR.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to speak today to pay tribute to \na great Floridian, Bill France, Jr.--a man who lived the American \ndream, a man who literally turned an idea and hard work into a \nmultibillion dollar national exhibition we today know as NASCAR.\n  Bill France was a great Floridian in many other ways as well. He was \nsomeone who contributed greatly to his local community of Daytona \nBeach, FL, as well as to the State of Florida at large. Mr. France left \nus at his home in Daytona Beach, when he passed away earlier this week \nafter a long and difficult battle with cancer.\n  What we in Florida know, and what the news reports confirmed \nimmediately following his death, is that Bill made NASCAR everything it \nis today: The sold-out races, the national network television coverage, \nthe regalia and the memorabilia--it all can be credited to this man and \nhis love of the sport.\n  Born right here in the Nation's capital, Bill France moved as a young \nman with his family, Bill France, Sr., and his mother Anne to Daytona \nBeach, FL, in 1935 to escape the Great Depression. With $100 in his \npocket, Bill, Sr., started a new life for his family in Florida, \nsetting up an auto repair shop and quickly taking a great interest in \nracing. In 1938, he would set up the Daytona Beach Road Course, and \nfrom there, as they say, the rest is history.\n  This course he set up back in those days was so unique, and to see \nphotographs of it is one of those things that one can only harken back \nto the old Florida that is no more. But the races were essentially \nconducted on the strip of sand in Daytona Beach. They would circle \naround A1A, the strip of highway that was there at the time, and then \ncircle back around on to the beach. The spectators would sit there on \nthe beach side and watch these cars as they raced literally on the \nbeach.\n  Bill, Jr., spent his young life around the racetrack and worked \ntoward the legacy his father had begun to build. He worked on cars, \nhelped out during races, and beginning in 1956, he worked every day of \nthe week for more than a year on the construction of the Daytona \nInternational Speedway.\n  In 1972, Bill, Jr., took the reins of the racing organization that \nhis father had helped to found in 1948 and took the risks and made the \ndecisions that took NASCAR to a whole new level.\n  The International Motorsports Hall of Fame describes it this way:\n\n       Other than the founding of NASCAR itself, Bill, Jr.'s \n     appointment to leadership is probably the most significant \n     event in the history of the sanctioning body. As rule-maker, \n     promoter, ambassador and salesman, France has set the \n     standard by which all other forms of motor sports are \n     measured. He has taken it from a regional sport to a national \n     sport, and nurtured its growing popularity on television, \n     culminating in a record-setting $2.4 billion broadcast \n     contract.\n\n  He served for a quarter century leading NASCAR to unbelievable \nheights and set the stage for what it has become today.\n  I know I speak for hundreds of thousands of fans, the drivers, the \npit crews and anyone and everyone who enjoys NASCAR, as well as \nFloridians and Daytona Beach residents, when I say a well deserved \n``thank you'' to Bill France, Jr., for making our weekends a lot more \nexciting, more enjoyable, and a lot faster. Florida thanks you for your \nvision, Bill. We will miss you, but you leave behind a legacy we will \nnever forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7168-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7168-S7170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR CRAIG THOMAS\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

While I have not served as long in the Senate as have many of my \ncolleagues who knew and worked with Craig over the years, I did have an \nopportunity to get to know him since being elected to the Senate in \n2004.\n  I think one of the most important things we have all witnessed with \nCraig's passing is the outpouring of support and stories about the \npeople he impacted in the Senate, in Wyoming, and across the country.\n  Without question, the Senate is a lesser place today without Craig's \npresence. One of the clearest indications of any politician's \npopularity is his or her support back home. Craig's leadership as the \nsenior member of the Wyoming delegation was overwhelming--primarily due \nto the confidence he earned from his constituents back in Wyoming. That \nconfidence was something he fought to keep since first being elected to \nCongress back in 1989.\n  Craig's battle with leukemia was very indicative of the way he led \nhis life and how he worked on behalf of his State and our Nation. I \nalso believe if his diagnosis hadn't been made public following his \nreelection last November, I doubt anybody would have known of the \nbattle he waged as he underwent his chemotherapy treatments.\n  Craig did timeless work on behalf of the citizens of Wyoming and our \nNation. His absence from the Senate will be greatly felt. Kimberley and \nI are deeply saddened by Craig's passing and extend our prayers to \nSusan and her family. Craig's hard work over the years on behalf of \nWyoming and our Nation is a testament to his character and gives all of \nus something to strive for.\n  Craig Thomas was a man of the people. He was a Wyoming original. He \nrepresented the very heart and soul of the people of his State and of \nour Nation. He personified hard work and integrity. He was a ``what you \nsee is what you get'' kind of a guy. Wyoming and America are a better \nplace because of his service.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join the many Senators who have paid \ntribute to our colleague Craig Thomas. Many of my colleagues have come \nto the floor since Senator Thomas's passing, and it is clear how many \nfriends he had in this Chamber and how well everyone thought of him and \nthe work he did.\n  We all knew him as a hard-working Member of the Senate who quickly \nearned his colleagues' respect. That respect was grounded in the way \nCraig Thomas served his country throughout his life. He spent 4 years \nin the U.S. Marine Corps and served in the Wyoming State Legislature, \nthe U.S. House of Representatives, and since 1995, the U.S. Senate.\n  During his years in the Senate, Senator Thomas served Wyoming with \ngreat dedication. Raised on a ranch, Senator Thomas understood the \nconcerns of rural Americans, and I appreciated his efforts in the \nSenate to stand up for the people who keep our rural communities \nstrong. That is an important concern in my State, and I know it is in \nWyoming as well.\n  I was very pleased to work with him to improve competition and fair \ntreatment for farmers and ranchers. I know that he was committed to \ngiving farmers and ranchers a fair shake in the marketplace, and his \nconstituents appreciated that dedication.\n  Senator Thomas also worked on a range of health care issues important \nto rural Americans. He well understood the challenges that people in \nrural areas face as they seek access to health care services and helped \nto address those concerns. The Senate benefited from his leadership as \ncochair of the Senate's Rural Health Caucus, where he showed tremendous \ncommitment to these issues. He led the push to maintain full funding \nfor several rural health discretionary programs, and I am grateful for \nhis efforts. That was just one of the many ways he contributed to the \nwork of the Senate and served the people of Wyoming.\n  As we remember Senator Thomas, we can all be grateful for the life he \nled and his outstanding service to the Senate and to our country. To \nhis wife, his family, his staff, and his many friends, I offer my \ncondolences and my deepest sympathies.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to join others in paying tribute \nto a wonderful colleague, Senator Craig Thomas. Tragically, last night, \nhe lost his battle with leukemia. I want to send my heartfelt \ncondolences to his wife Susan, his children, Patrick, Greg, Peter, and \nLexie, and to his staff.\n  Since January, I had the pleasure to serve with Senator Thomas on the \nFinance Committee. I found him to be a hard-working Senator and very \nconcerned about his constituents' struggling to get health care in \nrural areas.\n  I also had a chance to work with him last year on the Michigan \nLighthouse and Maritime Heritage Act. This legislation sets up a \nprocess whereby the National Park Service would work with the State of \nMichigan to create a lighthouse tourist trail.\n  As my colleagues know, he was chairman of the National Parks \nSubcommittee, which had jurisdiction over this legislation. During \nconsideration of this bill, he was helpful to me and the people of \nMichigan even though these lighthouses are thousands of miles away from \nhis home. He held a hearing on this legislation, worked with me to get \nit to the floor and ultimately to the President's desk.\n  On behalf of the people of Michigan, we appreciate his support of \nthis legislation.\n  Senator Thomas was a wonderful man--kind and decent to everyone. We \nwill all miss him.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, with a combination of great sadness and \nadmiration, I join my colleagues in honoring the life of Craig Thomas, \na person of strength, passion, and integrity.\n  Those who have had the blessing of traveling to the State of Wyoming \nappreciate its amazing beauty and variety. Craig Thomas reflected the \ngeography of his State. He could be as peaceful and serene as Wyoming's \nrolling prairie grass lands, and he could be as striking and powerful \nas its majestic mountains.\n  Growing up, he learned the creative dynamic of frontier life: rugged \nindividualism joined with an ethic of neighbor-helping-neighbor when \nthe need was great.\n  In this sometimes stuffy and frustrating Washington world, he was a \nfresh breeze of unconventionality. He maintained his Wyoming vision of \nlife throughout many years in this city, and the people of Wyoming \ndeeply appreciated his strong immunity to the political disease called \nPotomac Fever.\n  Craig Thomas lived a very meaningful life and made the State and \ncountry he loved a better place to live in. From his young days as a \nmarine to his last days as a Senator, his heart was service and he put \neverything he had into making a difference for generations to come.\n  Because of his service here, our national parks are a legacy that \nwill be passed to future generations in better shape than he found \nthem. Because of his fiscal conservatism, fewer dollars of debt will be \npassed on to our children. Because of his vision and integrity, a model \nof public service will be available to those who come after.\n  Laurie and I send our prayers to the Thomas family. We thank them and \nthe people of Wyoming for sharing Senator Thomas with the Nation.\n  Every one of us on this floor can learn a lesson from his life and \nremember Craig Thomas by living the values and commitments he taught \nus.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, when Craig Thomas passed away on \nMonday evening, the U.S. Senate lost more than a Member; our \ninstitution has lost a good man and I a good friend--someone who was \nproud to be called an American cowboy. Sharon and I extend our deepest \nsympathy to his wife Susan, his family, his friends, his staff, and the \npeople of Wyoming whom he served with such complete dedication.\n  Over the last few years, I worked closely with Senator Thomas. I came \nto know him well and came to respect him enormously. We both \nrepresented small, rural States with critical constituencies--his most \nemblematic being the farmer, mine the miner. We both maintained a deep \ncommitment to our home States. Perhaps most importantly, we both had a \nhistory of public service.\n  Throughout our careers, I would say that we had a very good \npartnership. We served together on the Senate Finance Committee and \nfought to make this country more independent of foreign energy, to \npromote the development of clean coal technologies, and to preserve the \nrural American lifestyle.\n\n[[Page S7170]]\n\n  Through it all, I greatly liked and admired Senator Thomas and \nappreciated him for the fine human being he was. He was a man of strong \nprinciple, one who knew the bottom line and didn't hesitate to consult \nhis colleagues on the other side of the aisle. What I will remember \nmost about him, however, wasn't his ability to work with his so-called \nfoes or our tough fights in the Senate, but for his deep affinity for \nthe beauty of this country.\n  In fact, over the years, when I have traveled to Wyoming and looked \nup at that towering, earthly skyline of the Grand Tetons, I have often \nthought of Craig.\n  Craig, after all, was perhaps one of the people who shared my deep \nlove of the Grand Tetons. It was in those mountains and the Gros Ventre \nthat we found a common bond. Together, we exchanged our marvels about \nthe alpine lakes, the cutting glaciers, wind-swept glaciers and \nsparkling rivers.\n  I will never forget his advice on enjoying the beauty of Jackson Hole \nor his stories about long horseback rides or camping in the cool \nshadows of the mountains. I will never forget his interest in the \nwildlife and his appreciation for the foliage. Nor will I forget how \npassionately he protected the autonomy of the park, and how much he \ncherished the culture and beauty of his home.\n  Senator Craig Thomas held my deepest respect; and, to his family and \nthe people of Wyoming, I offer my deepest sympathies. He was a valuable \npublic servant, a true fighter and a friend--and, more than anything, a \ntrue American.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our \ncolleague, our friend, and a great statesman, Senator Craig Thomas.\n  It is a somber day in the Senate Chamber as we mourn this loss.\n  His passing leaves a significant mark on the many lives he touched \nthroughout his life. On behalf of myself and my wife Annette, I send my \ndeepest sympathies to his wife Susan, his four children, and the entire \nThomas family.\n  Craig was an influential force in the Senate for the people of \nWyoming, as well as a thoughtful leader on national issues.\n  Craig served the people of Wyoming with distinction and honor.\n  His roots in the State ran deep, and Wyoming had no greater advocate. \nHe has built his reputation as a fiscal conservative while focusing on \nthe unique issues affecting the American west.\n  He was honest, humble, good natured, and loyal. It was these \ncharacteristics that he brought to the Senate and to his work. He was \nan effective leader because he believed you could get a lot \naccomplished when you did not care who took the credit.\n  Craig was committed to the values and principles he believed in \ndeeply. He loved his State, and it showed. He was committed to \nprotecting our Nation's natural resources, improving the lives of those \nin rural America, and a leader in advocating a sound national energy \npolicy.\n  It was my true privilege to have served with Craig over the past 13 \nyears in the Senate. While we continue to mourn his passing, we should \ntry to carry on with the same determination and energy he brought every \nday to the challenges he faced.\n  He will be remembered as a dedicated American, a marine, a public \nservant, and the quintessential American cowboy who gave so much of his \nlife in service to the Nation.\n  I offer my thoughts and prayers to those close to Craig in this \ndifficult time, especially to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7170-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7170-S7172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENERGY INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to discuss \nsome of the changes that need to be made to our national energy policy. \nThe simple truth is, our country is headed down the wrong energy path. \nOur current path has led to record-high electricity and gas prices. \nThese prices are not only hurting ordinary families, they are also \nhurting businesses who are seeing their costs go up dramatically. The \ngrowth of energy-intensive industries such as manufacturing is actually \nbeing stunted due to skyrocketing electricity costs. We already know \nthe negative global impacts our current energy path is having on our \nenvironment. It is clear we can't continue down this energy path \nanymore. It is not good policy. It is not good economic policy, and it \nis not good environmental policy.\n  Mr. President, I will be introducing a bill that will lead the Nation \ndown a path to a better, cleaner, more independent energy economy, a \npath that takes us away from higher electric bills and leads to new \nopportunities for investment and innovation, more jobs, and more \neconomic development. As the chart beside me illustrates, 52 percent of \nour electricity is currently generated from coal; 15 percent is from \nnatural gas; 3 percent from petroleum; 20 percent from nuclear; 7 \npercent from hydro; and 3 percent from renewable energy. Clearly, this \nis not a diversified energy portfolio. Clearly, something needs to be \ndone about rising energy costs.\n  It is estimated that Americans will spend over $200 billion more on \nenergy this year than last year. That is an increase of nearly 25 \npercent. The bill will allow us to meet our future electricity needs. \nIt will allow us to diversify our electricity supply. It will allow us \nto reduce the vulnerability of our energy system, and it will allow us \nto stabilize electricity prices, protect the environment, and most of \nall, stimulate the economies of rural America.\n  It is time to act. It is time to pass an aggressive renewable \nelectricity standard, one requiring that all electricity providers \nwould have to generate or purchase 25 percent of their electricity from \nrenewable sources by the year 2025. Twenty-two States throughout the \ncountry have already demonstrated the value of establishing renewable \nelectricity standards.\n  This chart shows what is going on around the country. I am looking at \nRhode Island, to try one State, a 16-percent standard by 2019. You see \nCalifornia, 20 percent by 2010. You see Washington, 15 percent by 2020. \nAll over the country, we see a change afoot. The checkered States are \nones that have voluntary goals, such as Illinois. The striped States \nhave standard goals, and the green States actually have standards put \ninto law.\n  While the States are already heading down the path toward the new \n``green economy,'' the Federal Government has not even made it to the \ntrail head. The Federal Government is stuck in the fossil age.\n  I am proud to say my State of Minnesota is further down the path than \nany other State. In February, the Democratic Minnesota State \nlegislature passed and our Republican Governor signed into law what is \nconsidered the Nation's most aggressive standard for promoting \nrenewable energy in electricity production. It is a ``25-by-25'' \nstandard. By the year 2025, the State's energy companies are required \nto generate 25 percent of their electricity from renewable sources such \nas wind, water, solar, and biomass. The standard is even higher for the \nState's largest utility, Excel Energy, which must reach 30 percent by \n2020. The CEO has been in my office and said it is going to be tough \nbut they are going to make it, and they are going to be able to meet \nthis goal without raising rates.\n  I admire what the States and communities and businesses are doing \nacross the country. I admire them for their inspiration, and I admire \nthem for their initiative. There is a famous phrase: the ``laboratories \nof democracy.'' That is how Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis \ndescribed the special role of States in our Federal system.\n  In this model, States are where new ideas emerge, where policymakers \ncan experiment, where innovative proposals can be tested.\n  Brandeis wrote over 70 years ago:\n\n       It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that \n     a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve \n     as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic \n     experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\n\n  But he did not mean for this to serve as an excuse for inaction by \nthe Federal Government. Good ideas and successful innovations are \nsupposed to emerge from the laboratory and serve as a model for \nnational policy and action. That is now our responsibility in Congress.\n  The courage we are seeing in the States, as they deal with global \nwarming, climate change, should be matched by courage in Washington, \nDC. We\n\n[[Page S7171]]\n\nshould be prepared to act on a national level, especially when the \nStates and local communities are showing us the way.\n  Now there is an opportunity for the Federal Government to act. It is \ntime for the Federal Government to begin moving toward an aggressive \nnational standard--on par with Minnesota's 25-by-25 standard.\n  There are many economic benefits of this aggressive standard. Yet, \nperhaps most importantly, an aggressive national standard opens the \ndoor to a new electricity industry that will bring thousands of jobs \nand pump billions of dollars into our economy.\n  Over the last 20 years, America's renewable energy industries--and \nthe wind industry in particular--have achieved significant \ntechnological advancements. The industries for solar, wind, and biomass \nenergy systems are expanding at rates exceeding 30 percent annually.\n  The clean water revolution is still in its infancy. I think of it \nlike the beginnings of the computer revolution when the computer used \nto take up an entire room. Now they are much cheaper, and they are much \nmore efficient. That is what is happening with our green technology. \nBut it will not happen unless we get into the act and set the standards \nas they should be.\n  Businesses are coming on board. CEOs of major corporations such as \nDuPont, Duke Energy, and General Electric see the opportunities. High-\ntech entrepreneurs in our country want to develop the green \ntechnologies before they do it in India and Japan. It is already \nstarting.\n  Nationally, venture capital investments in ``green'' or ``clean'' \ntechnologies have increased dramatically. Last year, venture capital \ninvestment in green technologies reached an impressive $2.9 billion. \nFrom 2001 to 2006, there was a 243 percent increase in green technology \nventure capital investments.\n  Not only is clean technology the fastest growing venture capital \nsector, it is now the third largest category--behind only biotech and \ncomputer software.\n  The economic benefits are not just limited to high-risk investors. In \nSeptember of 2004, the Union of Concerned Scientists used the Energy \nInformation Administration's National Energy Modeling System to examine \nthe costs and benefits of an aggressive national standard. Their \nanalysis found an aggressive national standard would reduce electric \nand natural gas prices and provide significant economic benefits for \nall of America.\n  For example, as you can see from this chart, an aggressive national \nstandard would create 355,000 new jobs--nearly twice as many as \ngenerating electricity from fossil fuels.\n  We would see economic development, such as $72.6 billion in new \ncapital investment; $16.2 billion in income to farmers, ranchers, and \nrural landowners; $5 billion in new local tax revenue. We would see \nconsumer savings. We would see $49 billion in lower electricity and \nnatural gas bills. We would have a healthier environment. We would see \nreductions in global warming, pollution equal to taking nearly 71 \nmillion cars off the road. We would see less air pollution, less damage \nto land, and better water use.\n\n  So while traditional manufacturing jobs continue to move away from \nthe United States, the country now has an opportunity to become a \nglobal hub of new, high-quality jobs in manufacturing and other high-\nskill areas, while generating environmental benefits at the same time.\n  So the future looks bright. Never before have we seen such strong \ninterest and growth in renewable energy and energy-efficiency \ntechnologies. But the question we face is this: Does the United States \nwant to be a leader in creating the new green technologies and the new \ngreen industries of the future? Or are we going to sit back and watch \nthe opportunities pass us by?\n  In this country, we have the fields to grow the energy that will keep \nthis Nation moving. And we have the wind energy to propel our economy \nforward. Right here in the United States, we have the science, we have \nthe universities, we have the technological know-how, and we have the \nfinancial capital to harness our own homegrown energy.\n  It is time to act. The only thing holding us back is complacency. A \nnational renewable energy standard will be a major contributor in \ndriving innovation in green technologies.\n  Now, I know there are critics of a national standard. These critics--\nwho I believe are stuck in the fossil age--believe an aggressive \nstandard would negatively affect the reliability of an energy system. \nYet, these critics seem to forget that numerous countries in Europe, \nincluding Spain, Germany, and Denmark--where wind power supplies over \n30 percent of their electricity--have seen no adverse impacts on the \nreliability of their systems.\n  In fact, a renewable electricity standard can actually increase the \noverall reliability of an electric system. It can diversify our \nelectricity sources so we are not so reliant on energy sources such as \nnatural gas that are vulnerable to periodic shortages or other supply \ninterruptions.\n  Not only is a national standard more reliable and good for the \neconomy, it will also, of course, protect the environment and public \nhealth. Electricity production has a significant impact on our \nenvironment. Today, electricity accounts for more than 26 percent of \nsmog-producing emissions, one-third of toxic mercury emissions, and \nsome 40 percent of climate-changing greenhouse gases.\n  An aggressive standard will reduce CO2 emissions by 434 \nmillion metric tons per year by 2020--reductions of 15 percent below \ncurrent levels. This, as I said, is equivalent to taking nearly 71 \nmillion cars off the road.\n  A couple of weeks ago, Minnesota's own Tom Friedman had a cover story \nin the New York Times magazine about ``The Power of Green.'' It should \nbe required reading for anyone who cares not only about the future of \nour environment but also our economic future and our future national \nsecurity. He talked about the need in this area for setting the \nstandards. When you set the standards, and people can see off into the \nfuture, we will see the investment. People say: Well, why do you have a \nstandard set at 2025? Obviously, our bill is going to have a standard \ngrowing each year. But the reason you want to go out to 2025 is you \nwant American businesses and capitalists and people involved in this to \nunderstand if they invest, where they are going.\n  In his article, Tom Friedman asks: ``How do our kids compete in a \nflatter world? How do they thrive in a warmer world? How do they \nsurvive in a more dangerous world?''\n  The answer is in making the most of the economic and technological \nopportunities to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and the \ngreenhouse gas pollution that comes from it.\n  Friedman says clean energy technology is going to be ``the next great \nglobal industry.'' Well, if that is the case--and I believe he is \nright--then we need to make America the leader. We cannot afford to sit \nback and watch the opportunities pass us by.\n  As I mentioned before, we are seeing unprecedented interest and \ngrowth in renewable energy technologies. But at the same time, we are \nno longer the world leader in two important clean energy fields. We \nrank third in wind power production, behind Denmark and Spain. We are \nthird in solar power installed, behind Germany and Japan.\n  Ironically, these countries surpassed us largely by adopting \ntechnologies that had first been developed right here in the United \nStates. We came up with the right ideas, but we did not capitalize on \nthese innovations with adequate policies to spur deployment. Our \nforeign competition was able to leapfrog over American businesses \nbecause these other countries have government-driven investment \nincentives, aggressive renewable energy targets, and other bold \nnational policies.\n  Friedman proposes a ``Green New Deal''--``one in which government's \nrole is not funding projects, as in the original New Deal, but seeding \nbasic research, providing loan guarantees where needed, and setting \nstandards, taxes and incentives that will spawn'' all kinds of new \ntechnologies.\n  I agree. It is about leading the new economy. It is about making \nAmerica the global environmental leader, instead of a laggard. It is \nabout creating a better economy for the next generation by inventing a \nwhole new industry, which will not only give us the clean power \nindustrial assets to preserve our American dream but also give us the \ntechnologies that billions of\n\n[[Page S7172]]\n\nothers need to realize our own dreams without destroying the planet.\n  It is about not being complacent. It is about getting on a new energy \npath. I believe an aggressive renewable electricity standard leads us \ndown that path.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support an aggressive standard. I \nsuggest Minnesota's standard: 25 percent by 2025 for renewable \nelectricity. It is a start down the path.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7172-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO FORMER CONGRESSMAN PARREN J. MITCHELL\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to a fallen \npillar of the movement to extend equal opportunity to thousands of \nAfrican-American and minority businesses throughout our Nation: \nCongressman Parren J. Mitchell.\n  With the passing of former Congressman Mitchell on May 28, 2007, our \ncountry has lost one of its legendary advocates for minority business \nowners, a giant who knew that the struggle for civil rights and equal \nopportunity would be decided in America's board rooms as well as its \nvoting booths and lunch counters.\n  Congressman Mitchell fought with heart, grit, integrity, and \ndetermination to level the playing field so more minority firms could \ndo business with the Federal Government. He didn't just serve as \nchairman of the House Small Business Committee, he served as Congress's \nconscience. He also was founder and chairman of the Minority Business \nEnterprise Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n  Congressman Mitchell's life was an incredible story of courage and \nresolve. He became the first African-American graduate student at the \nUniversity of Maryland when he challenged the university's policy of \nsegregation. He was the first African American elected to Congress from \nthe State of Maryland. He was the first African American elected to \nCongress who lived below the Mason-Dixon line since 1898. And he was \nthe first African American to chair the House Small Business Committee.\n  Congressman Mitchell's work on that committee has left a legacy that \nis as long and impressive as his commitment to equal opportunity for \nall of our nation's citizens. Many of his policies made it possible for \nthe rise of the minority business community. In 1976, he attached an \namendment to a public works bill stipulating that cities and States \nreceiving Federal grants had to award 10 percent of the money to \nminority-owned businesses. That year he also managed to pass a law \nrequiring contractors to document their goals in contracting with \nminority-owned companies. In 1980, he was able to successfully amend \nthe Surface Transportation Assistance Act to require 10 percent of the \nmoney to be set aside for minority businesses.\n  On May 22, 2007, in the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship we held a hearing to look at the state of minority \nsmall businesses. And while the witnesses at the hearing revealed that \nthere have been many gains for minority businesses, they also revealed \nthat there is still more that needs to be done. I believe that the \naccomplishments of those who testified at the hearing would have made \nCongressman Mitchell proud. I also believe that the testimony about \ndiscriminatory practices that still confront minority businesses would \nhave confirmed for him as it did for me that there are still more hills \nto climb.\n  The challenge now is to climb those hills by creating opportunities \nfor minority businesses that will do justice to the memory of \nCongressman Mitchell. As we move forward in the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, the best way to do that is to pass \nlaws that expand opportunities for all Americans who have been shut out \nor left behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7172-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, every Memorial Day, words fight a losing \nbattle against action. Each year, as spring warms into summer, we pause \nour lives and bow our heads in safety, and grope for words to honor the \nmen and women who have made that safety possible. Inevitably, we fail; \nwe say ``fallen'' when we mean ``killed''; we say ``sacrifice'' for \nthose who died unwillingly, in great pain. I believe we do so because \nwe want to find a register for our voice to match the heroism of their \nwork, but, also, because high words shield us from the immediacy of \ndeath in war. Even as we remember, we can't help looking away.\n  But some lack that luxury. They are in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they \nare living the war we speak about. For 10 American soldiers in Iraq, \nMemorial Day was their last day.\n  Last week, the Senate was out of session in commemoration of Memorial \nDay, but now that we have returned, I want to honor the memory of one \nof those 10 soldiers: Army 1LT. Keith Neil Heidtman. He was a native of \nNorwich and a graduate of the University of Connecticut. He was 24 \nyears old. On Monday, May 28, the helicopter he was copiloting crashed, \nlikely brought down by enemy fire. Early the next morning, an Army \nchaplain brought the news to Lieutenant Heidtman's family.\n  For Maureen and Arthur Robidoux, his mother and stepfather, for Kerry \nHeidtman, his father, for Chris Heidtman, his uncle, and for Keely \nHeidtman, his older sister, memories will never fill the place of the \nlive they loved. ``If you had to pick your son, this is who you would \npick,'' said Chris Heidtman. ``He was handsome, he was bright''. A star \nbaseball player and a distinguished ROTC cadet, Lieutenant Heidtman \nvolunteered for pilot training upon his graduation in 2005.\n  He learned the value of service from his parents, both public \nservants themselves: his mother at the State Department of Children and \nFamilies, and his father in a State child-support program. His death \nreminds us that the highest service carries the highest cost. ``We're \nsending our finest, and we're losing them,'' said Lieutenant Heidtman's \nuncle.\n  So today we honor one of our finest, who wore our uniform and died \nlong before his time. Next Memorial Day, his name will join the rolls \nof our dead. I pray that by then time will have soaked up his family's \ntears. Next spring, we will bow our heads and look for words to do him \njustice. I don't believe those words exist. His best memorial will be \nin our silence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7172-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7172-S7173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WAR CRIMES TRIAL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, earlier this week in a special chamber \nof the Special Court for Sierra Leone, based in The Hague, proceedings \nbegan in the trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor, who is \naccused of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and serious violations \nof international\n\n[[Page S7173]]\n\nlaw committed during Sierra Leone's 11-year civil war. Tens of \nthousands died in this conflict that ended in 2002, and more than a \nthird of Sierra Leone's 6 million people were forced to flee. His trial \nis expect to have significant impact across Sierra Leone but also \nthroughout neighboring countries as his raging brutality was in no way \nconfined by national borders.\n  For over a decade, the people of Sierra Leone and Liberia not only \nsuffered from deprivation and displacement at the hands of Charles \nTaylor, but they also endured forced recruitment of child soldiers, \nwidespread and brutal sexual violence, and horrifying murders and \nmutilations. Those responsible for these crimes abandoned all human \ndecency in their quest for power and wealth.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of accountability mechanisms \naround the world--and in particular Sierra Leone's Special Court and \nTruth and Reconciliation Commission. I have worked to ensure that the \nUnited States provides appropriate financial and political support for \nsuch important institutions, which are crucial to building a framework \nfor the rule of law in postconflict countries. I commend the court for \ntaking its mandate seriously and for following the evidence where it \nled--directly to a sitting head of state.\n  Despite Charles Taylor's unwillingness to appear at the opening of \nyesterday's trial, the message this critical trial sends--to current \nand would-be corrupt, violent, and brutal leaders--is momentous: the \ninternational community will no longer stand silently by but will \nsupport efforts to break the worst cycles of violence and impunity. \nWhen the trial continues later this month in The Hague, it is essential \nthat international fair trial standards are adhered to, that robust and \ntransparent outreach programs continue uninterrupted so the trial \nremains as accessible as possible to those most affected by the \nconflict and that great care is taken to ensure the security of \nvictims, witnesses, and their families.\n  While I welcome the proceedings in The Hague, more needs to be done \non behalf of the people of Sierra Leone and Liberia. True \naccountability for the horrific atrocities they endured will only be \nachieved when the rule of law is respected at every level in the \ngovernments of both countries and all citizens have access to justice. \nGreat steps forward have been taken, but much more work remains. I will \ncontinue to press the United States and the international community not \nto desert the people of Sierra Leone--or the region--as they work to \nreconcile their grievances and seek to heal from one of Africa's worst \nconflicts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7173-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONQUER CHILDHOOD CANCER ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to talk \nabout 8-year-old Jenessa Byers, known as ``Boey'' by her friends and \nfamily.\n  Last year, Boey was diagnosed with a very rare childhood cancer \ncalled rhabdomyosarcoma. Showing tremendous courage and strength as she \nunderwent radiation and chemotherapy, Boey battled the cancer into \nremission. Unfortunately, that cancer returned and Boey is back in \ntreatment undergoing radiation and chemotherapy once again.\n  While I was in Oregon over the recess, I had a chance to visit with \nBoey and her family at the Children's Cancer Center at Doernbecher \nChildren's Hospital, as well as with other children at the hospital who \nare battling a variety of childhood cancers. Boey refers to herself as \na warrior in the fight against cancer, and there is no doubt about it, \nBoey is a warrior. As I witnessed firsthand when I visited her last \nweek, she is fighting the cancer as hard as she can. This in itself \nmakes Boey a very brave and very special little girl.\n  But what makes her especially amazing is that in spite of what she is \ngoing through, Boey has been working tirelessly to help other children \nwho are also battling cancer. Each month, she donates special bears and \nhandmade cards titled ``Be Strong'' to other children at the hospital. \nThe day before her eighth birthday last month, Boey participated as a \nsurvivor in the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life, for which she \nraised over $500. In addition, she has raised money to help fight \ncancer on a local radiothon, and she has raised awareness using her own \nvideos, which she has posted on YouTube.\n  Because of Boey's incredible compassion and determination to help the \nother children fighting cancer, she was recently asked to be a \nspokesperson for Doernbecher Children's Hospital. On May 31, she spoke \nabout her experiences at a reception for the Children's Miracle \nNetwork. Just this past weekend, she was featured in a segment of the \nDoernbecher Children's Miracle Network Telethon.\n  While I was visiting Boey, she asked me to cosponsor the Conquer \nChildhood Cancer Act. Introduced by Senators Reed and Coleman, this act \nwould provide critical resources for the treatment, prevention, and \ncure of childhood cancer. The act would authorize $150 million over a \n5-year period to expand support for biomedical research programs of the \nexisting National Cancer Institute-designated multicenter national \ninfrastructure for pediatric cancer research. It would also establish a \npopulation-based national childhood cancer registry; enable researchers \nto more accurately study the incidence of childhood cancers and long-\nterm effects of treatments; and provide funding for informational and \neducational services to families coping with a diagnosis of childhood \ncancer. The Conquer Childhood Cancer Act brings hope to the more than \n12,500 children who are diagnosed with cancer each year, as well as \nmore than 40,000 children and adolescents currently being treated for \nchildhood cancers.\n  On behalf of Boey and the other courageous and wonderful children I \nmet at Doernbecher Children's Hospital recently, and every child with \ncancer, I would like to announce that I am cosponsoring the Conquer \nChildhood Cancer Act. I will be working with my colleagues to get this \nbill signed into law so that we can find a cure for childhood cancer \nonce and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7173-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7173-S7174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           D-DAY ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize \nthe great sacrifices made by our Nation's veterans on the anniversary \nof D-day and to once again highlight the need for all of us to do more \nfor those serving today.\n  On this day 63 years ago, 3,393 American troops gave their lives on \nthe beaches of Normandy defending the freedom of America and its \nallies. These brave young men sacrificed themselves to stop an empire \nborn of hatred from consuming Europe and fought to prove that freedom \nand justice would never bow to terror and intolerance. Their valor and \nservice will forever endure in our Nation's memory.\n  Today, a new generation faces new challenges. The nearly 170,000 \nAmerican troops currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan exemplify the \nkind of courage and dedication that has defined the American military \nthroughout our history. And for the sacrifices they are willing to \nmake, we in the Senate, our colleagues in the House, the military \nleadership, the President, and the American people have an absolute \nmoral obligation to provide our servicemen and women with the best \npossible protection when we send them to war.\n  I know that when President Roosevelt sent his men into battle, he did \nnot simply pay lipservice to their courage, he made sure that they had \nthe strongest artillery, the best gear, and the most advanced equipment \navailable. He did not worry that the landing craft he needed for D-day \nwould not be needed when the war ended. He made equipping the force the \nentire Nation's top priority. Calling on the patriotism of American \nbusinessmen to ensure military needs were met before all else. And so I \nask why--a half century later--we cannot do the same for our troops \ntoday.\n  Today, improvised explosive devices, IEDs, are the single greatest \nthreat to the lives of our troops, causing 70 percent of U.S. \ncasualties in Iraq. The military has indicated that mine resistant \nambush protected, MRAP, vehicles, which provide four to five times more \nprotection than up-armored Humvees, will reduce casualties from IEDs by \ntwo-thirds. These vehicles have already been tested fully at Aberdeen \nProving Center and our allies have been using similar technologies in \nthe field for years.\n  So why, then, are these critical vehicles not already in the field?\n\n[[Page S7174]]\n\n  We learned recently that in February of 2005, Marine commanders in \nIraq realized that they needed vehicles designed specifically to defeat \nthe IED threat and asked the Pentagon to build them. Yet 2 years later \ntheir request remains unfulfilled. Secretary Gates has indicated that \nMRAPs compete with other defense spending, which may make it difficult \nto produce all we need. I just don't get that logic. I can see no \ngreater use of our dollars than getting American troops the best \npossible protection that exists today. This Nation can afford to do \nthat and whatever else is necessary to do right by our military men and \nwomen and their families.\n  At a later date we will get to the bottom of what happened in 2005, \nbut our first order of business today should be making sure that we get \nour troops the technology they need as soon as possible. That will \nrequire a genuine assessment of how many MRAPs are needed in the field \nand how much it will cost to build that critically needed inventory.\n  We also need to provide our troops with all the latest in tested \ntechnology to defend against the new weapons which insurgents are using \nin Iraq: shaped charges called EFPs, or explosively formed penetrators/\nprojectiles, those shaped-charges which hit our vehicles from the side \nwith devastating effect. We cannot wait another 2 years to field \ntechnology to protect against these devices when Americans are dying \ntoday.\n  Today I ask of my colleagues, of the President, of our military \ncommanders, and of the American people, that we pay respect to American \nservicemembers with more than words. We have the ability and the \nobligation to do more and we must.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, 63 years ago today, many brave Americans \nand other allied forces members were dropped out over the frigid North \nAtlantic coastline of Normandy; numerous others stormed the beaches \nfrom the sea. Ultimately, well over 100,000 determined Allied troops \nwere involved in one of the most remarkable and well orchestrated \nmilitary events in history. D-day was among the greatest victories of \nWorld War II. June 6, 1944 is a day all lovers of freedom should hold \non high. We cannot ever forget the sacrifice and meaning of that day.\n  Were it not for the supreme leadership--both here and abroad--of \nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, \nGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower, and many other government and military \nleaders--and a patriotic citizenry--we might be living in a starkly \ndifferent world today. D-day does not just signify singular success; it \nsymbolizes the power of our fearless democracy and way of life. This \ntriumph--not only on D-day, but in the war effort at large--helped to \nfurther a clear message made by an earlier American President, one who \nwas considering the weight of World War I. As Woodrow Wilson remarked a \ngeneration earlier, ``The world must be made safe for democracy.'' The \nevents of June 6, 1944, helped to make the world a safer place. Victory \nwould not have come about without the smart and strong dedication of \nour military.\n  We must take it upon ourselves as Americans, and as grateful \ncitizens, to continue to thank the brave patriots who served in what \nhas become a legacy of freedom; we thank them for their service and \ntheir sacrifice. Every generation faces new challenges and must accept \nthe consequences of inaction. We are better off for the actions of the \nGreatest Generation. Across the beaches of Omaha, Utah, Juno, Gold, and \nothers, our brave Allied troops sacrificed mightily on June 6, 1944. \nThat sacrifice lives on.\n  For all those veterans of D-day, and for that matter, any campaign of \nWorld War II, thank you. You helped to make the world safe for \ndemocracy. Your victorious struggle of more than 60 years ago makes \nthis Nation proud and grateful. Thank you for your dedication and \nsacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7174-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory for its part in completing the 100th genome \nsequence. Like the Human Genome Project, this achievement serves as a \nconstant reminder of the possibilities before us and a step forward in \nscientific knowledge. The scientists of Los Alamos National Lab \nconstantly achieve excellence through their various endeavors, and I am \nproud of their contribution to this vast project. This well-deserved \nrecognition highlights their continuing dedication to serving this \ncountry through research in health and environment-related fields.\n  Los Alamos National Laboratory has championed the advancement of \nnational security for over 60 years. In the tumultuous times of World \nWar II, it stood as our Nation's front line in acquiring a superior \ntool with which we could be certain that freedom would prevail. \nHowever, once its mission was complete it continued to pursue the \nadvancement of American security and research. What began as an \ninstallation solely focused on the creation of an atomic bomb has \ndeveloped into a diverse and advanced institution dedicated to securing \nour nuclear ordinance, combating the effectiveness of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and addressing many problems in areas such as energy and \nhealth.\n  Los Alamos National Laboratory serves as one of five national \nlaboratories working with the Department of Energy to sequence genomes. \nLabeled the Joint Genome Institute, this group of research institutions \nfirst helped to complete the Human Genome Project, which has since been \ncalled one of the greatest scientific advances of our time. The \nbenefits of this outstanding achievement are many. For example, we can \nnow match organ donors and recipients with less uncertainty and even \ndiagnose disease more efficiently.\n  Over the years, the mission of the Genome Project has oriented itself \ntowards other vital interests. The Joint Genome Institute is now \ntargeting specific animals and microbes with traits that, if harnessed, \ncould aid in areas such as biotechnology, alternative fuels, and the \nenvironment. For example, the organism just completed has shown \npotential in aiding the cleanup of uranium-contaminated areas. This \napplication would greatly benefit Los Alamos itself, which has several \nradioactive wastesites.\n  In the past, I have strongly supported the research of Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory and the advancement of the Genome Project and have \nhelped each of them secure defense and biotechnology funding. In \nreturn, their research has yielded important advances in areas such as \nhealth, energy, and the environment. Furthermore, the continuing \nexcellence of Los Alamos National Laboratory has led to the creation of \nmany jobs in the northern New Mexico region. Los Alamos continues to \nsucceed in its purpose of national service, and I am pleased to offer \nmy support and congratulations for their contribution to the 100th mark \nin the Genome Project.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7174-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7174-S7175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              100th ANNIVERSARY OF HETTINGER, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

Peabody began as a property casualty insurance agency for \nAroostook County, and grew to represent 20 insurance companies. As time \nprogressed, the company expanded to meet other needs in the community, \nincluding investment management, real estate brokerage, and travel \nservices. A truly diversified operation, F.A. Peabody has gone further \nin recent years by administering mortuary trusts and providing \nbroadband internet to businesses and individuals from the counties of \nMaine's northern potato fields to its eastern shoreline. In light of a \nlack of broadband internet in Aroostook County earlier this decade, \nF.A. Peabody decided to take action and become a broadband internet \nservice provider.\n  Collectively, F.A. Peabody employs over 70 people, and has a wellness \nprogram to award employees with bonuses and gifts. Chris and Bob \nAnderson, president and chief financial officer, respectively, of F.A. \nPeabody, carry on the company's commitment to Maine's positive, pro-\ngrowth small business community.\n  F.A. Peabody is truly a success story, and a bright example of what \nsmall businesses can accomplish with measured expansion and consistent \ndetermination. I congratulate F.A. Peabody on all of its \naccomplishments and, in particular, for garnering the attention of the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce. This award is well-deserved, and I am \nconfident that F.A. Peabody's strong, outstanding achievements will \ncontinue for years to come as a source of pride for all of Maine. I \nwish F.A. Peabody and its employees continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7175-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7175-S7176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 11:38 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1675.

A bill to provide additional assistance to combat HIV/AIDS \namong young people, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Snowe to \nintroduce legislation to strengthen our international HIV prevention \nefforts and empower the people on the ground who are fighting this \ndisease to design the most effective and appropriate HIV prevention \nprogram.\n  The bill is cosponsored by Senator Leahy, Senator Durbin, Senator \nClinton, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Brown, Senator Kerry, Senator \nBoxer, Senator Dodd, Senator Murray, and Senator Feingold.\n  This bill simply strikes the provision in the United States \nLeadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 that \nmandates that at least 33 percent of HIV prevention funding in the \nPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, be set aside \n``abstinence-until-marriage'' programs.\n  Let me be clear from the beginning: this bill does not prohibit the \nadministration from funding ``abstinence-until-marriage'' programs.\n  In fact, if the bill becomes law, the administration would still be \nable to spend all of our HIV prevention funding on abstinence-until-\nmarriage programs if it decided do so.\n  This bill is about giving the administration and HIV/AIDS workers the \nflexibility to design the most effective HIV prevention program without \nhaving to worry about artificial earmarks that are based on politics, \nnot science.\n  Indeed, in the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic, we cannot afford \nto tie ourselves down with undue restrictions.\n  Worldwide, 40 million people are infected with HIV. Each day, \napproximately 12,000 people are newly infected with HIV. In 2006, there \nwere 4.3 million new HIV infections around the world, 2.8 million in \nsub-Saharan Africa alone. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to almost two-\nthirds of the estimated 40 million people currently living with HIV.\n  Across sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence rate for the adult \npopulation is 6 percent. Mr. President, 2.1 million adults and children \ndied of AIDS in 2005.\n  Despite these devastating numbers, according to UNAIDS, less than one \nin five people at risk for infection of HIV have access to basic \nprevention services. Studies have shown that two-thirds of new HIV \ninfections could be averted with effective prevention programs.\n  Clearly, we still have a long ways to go to rein in this disease.\n  The 2003 HIV/AIDS legislation recognized that prevention, along with \ncare and treatment, is an essential component of that fight and demands \na multipronged approach. It endorsed the ``ABC'' model for prevention \nof the sexual transmission of HIV: abstain, be faithful, use condoms.\n  Yet instead of allowing HIV/AIDS workers and doctors the ability to \nuse all of the prevention tools at their disposal to respond to local \nneeds, we required them to spend at least 33 percent on ``abstinence-\nuntil marriage'' programs.\n  The question has to been asked: Why 33 percent? Why not 15 percent? \nWhy not 50 percent? What scientific study concluded that 33 percent of \nHIV prevention funds for abstinence only programs was appropriate?\n  There was no study and it begs the question: when you are fighting a \npandemic that has already cost so many lives, who should decide how to \nallocate funding among different types of HIV prevention programs, \nCongress or the people with the knowledge and expertise on how to fight \nthis disease?\n  I support abstinence programs as a critical part of our HIV \nprevention programs. But mandating an earmark has negative consequences \nfor other effective tools.\n  It means less money for funds to prevent mother-to-child \ntransmission, less money to promote a comprehensive prevention message \nto high risk groups such as sexually active youth, and fewer funds to \nprotect the blood supply.\n  Indeed, the evidence clearly shows that the one-third earmark has \ninhibited the ability of local communities to design a multipronged HIV \nprevention program that works best for them.\n  Last year, the Government Accountability Office issued a report that \nfound ``significant challenges'' associated with meeting the \nabstinence-until-marriage programs. The report concluded that the 33 \npercent abstinence spending requirement is squeezing out available \nfunding for other key HIV prevention programs such as mother-to-child \ntransmission and maintaining a health blood supply.\n  Country teams that are not exempted from the one-third earmark have \nto spend more than 33 percent of prevention funds on abstinence-until-\nmarriage activities, sometimes at the expense of other programs, in \norder for the administration to meet the overall 33 percent earmark.\n  The spending requirement limited or reduced funding for programs \ndirected to high-risk groups, such as sexually active youth and the \nmajority of country teams on the ground reported that meeting the \nspending requirement ``challenges their ability to develop \ninterventions that are responsive to local epidemiology and social \nnorms.''\n  Last month, a congressionally mandated review by the Institute of \nMedicine on the first 3 years of the President's Emergency Plan for \nAIDS Relief also found significant problems with the abstinence \nearmark. It concluded: there is no evidence to support a 33 percent \nabstinence only earmark; the 33 percent earmark does not allow country \nteams on the ground the flexibility they need to respond to local \nneeds.\n  Our bill seeks to address the problems highlighted in the GAO and the \nInstitute of Medicine reports and provide local communities the \nnecessary flexibility to achieve the goal we all share: stopping the \nspread of HIV, especially among young people.\n  Simply put, our bill balances congressional priorities with public \nhealth needs. Under our legislation, country teams can take into \naccount country needs including cultural differences, epidemiology, \npopulation age groups and the stage of the epidemic in designing the \nmost effective prevention program.\n  One size does not fit all. A prevention program in one country may \nlook a lot different than a prevention program in another country.\n  A May 2003 report from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and \nHenry J. Kaiser Foundation highlights that proven prevention programs \ninclude behavior change programs, including delay in the initiation of \nsexual activity, faithfulness and correct and consistent condom use; \ntesting and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases; promoting \nvoluntary counseling and testing; harm reduction programs for IV drug \nusers; preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to child; \nincreasing blood safety; empowering women and girls; controlling \ninfection in health care settings; and devising programs geared towards \npeople living with HIV.\n  For example, studies have shown that combining drugs with counseling \nand instruction on use of such drugs reduces mother-to-child \ntransmission by 50 percent.\n  Such cost effective programs are not related to abstinence and should \nnot be constrained by the 33 percent earmark on funds for prevention.\n  I understand the importance of teaching abstinence. It is and will \nremain a key part of our strategy in preventing the spread of HIV.\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\n  But let us listen to the words of someone with firsthand experience \nabout the challenges sub-Saharan African countries face in combating \nHIV/AIDS and the constraints the ``abstinence-until-marriage'' earmark \nplaces on those efforts.\n  In an August 19, 2005, op-ed in the New York Times, Babatunde \nOsotimehin, chairman of the National Action Committee on AIDS in \nNigeria, wrote:\n\n       Abstinence is one critical prevention strategy, but it \n     cannot be the only one. Focusing on abstinence assumes young \n     people can choose whether to have sex. For adolescent girls \n     in Nigeria and in many other countries, this is an inaccurate \n     assumption. Many girls fall prey to sexual violence and \n     coercion. . . . When dealing with AIDS, we must address the \n     realities and use a multipronged approach to improving \n     education and health systems, one that can reach all of our \n     people.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       National governments must have the freedom to employ the \n     very best strategies at our disposal to help our people.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  If we want to help the girls of Nigeria and the youth of sub-Saharan \nAfrica, we cannot limit the information they receive about keeping them \nsafe from acquiring HIV.\n  We do not have time to lose. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation and support a pro-abstinence, multipronged approach to \npreventing the spread of HIV.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1553\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``HIV Prevention Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (in this \n     Act referred to as ``PEPFAR'') is an unprecedented effort to \n     combat the global AIDS epidemic, with $9,000,000,000 targeted \n     for initiatives in 15 focus countries.\n       (2) The PEPFAR prevention goal is to avert 7,000,000 HIV \n     infections in the 15 focus countries--most in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, where heterosexual intercourse is by far the \n     predominant mode of HIV transmission.\n       (3) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/\n     AIDS, young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years old \n     are ``the most threatened by AIDS'' and ``are at the centre \n     of HIV vulnerability''. Globally, young people between the \n     ages of 10 and 24 years old account for \\1/2\\ of all new HIV \n     cases each year. About 7,000 young people in this cohort \n     contract the virus every day.\n       (4) A recent review funded by the United States Agency for \n     International Development found that sex and HIV education \n     programs that encourage abstinence but also discuss the use \n     of condoms do not increase sexual activity as critics of sex \n     education have long alleged. Sex education can help delay the \n     initiation of intercourse, reduce the frequency of sex and \n     the number of sexual partners, and also increase condom use.\n       (5) The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7601 et \n     seq.) requires that at least \\1/3\\ of all prevention funds be \n     reserved for abstinence-until-marriage programs.\n       (6) A congressionally mandated review by the Institute of \n     Medicine of the first 3 years of PEPFAR unequivocally \n     recommends greater flexibility in the global fight against \n     AIDS. The March 2007 Institute of Medicine report entitled \n     ``PEPFAR Implementation: Progress and Promise'' calls for \n     greater emphasis on prevention than the law currently allows \n     and says that ``removal of the abstinence-until-marriage'' \n     earmark, among other changes, ``could enhance the quality, \n     accountability, and flexibility'' of prevention efforts.\n       (7) The Institute of Medicine report further found that the \n     abstinence-until-marriage earmark ``has greatly limited the \n     ability of Country Teams to develop and implement \n     comprehensive prevention programs that are well integrated \n     with each other and with counseling and testing, care and \n     treatment programs and that target those populations at \n     greatest risk''.\n       (8) The Institute of Medicine report also found that the \n     earmark has ``limited PEPFAR's ability to tailor its \n     activities in each country to the local epidemic and to \n     coordinate with . . . the countries' national plans''.\n       (9) The Institute of Medicine report is in keeping with the \n     conclusions of a report issued in 2006 by the Government \n     Accountability Office. The GAO report, entitled ``Spending \n     Requirement Presents Challenges for Allocating Funding under \n     the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief '', found \n     ``significant challenges'' associated with meeting the \n     earmark for abstinence-until-marriage programs.\n       (10) The Government Accountability Office found that a \n     majority of country teams report that fulfilling the \n     requirement presents challenges to their ability to respond \n     to local epidemiology and cultural and social norms.\n       (11) The Government Accountability Office found that, \n     although some country teams may be exempted from the \n     abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement, country teams \n     that are not exempted have to spend more than the 33 percent \n     of prevention funds on abstinence-until-marriage activities--\n     sometimes at the expense of other programs.\n       (12) The Government Accountability Office found that, as a \n     result of the abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement, \n     some countries have had to reduce planned funding for \n     Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission programs, thereby \n     limiting services for pregnant women and their children.\n       (13) The Government Accountability Office found that the \n     abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement limited or \n     reduced funding for programs directed to high-risk groups, \n     such as services for married discordant couples, sexually \n     active youth, and commercial sex workers.\n       (14) The Government Accountability Office found that the \n     abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement made it \n     difficult for countries to fund medical and blood safety \n     activities.\n       (15) The Government Accountability Office found that, \n     because of the abstinence-until-marriage spending \n     requirement, some countries would likely have to reduce \n     funding for condom procurement and condom social marketing.\n       (16) In addition, the Government Accountability Office \n     found that \\2/3\\ of focus country teams reported that the \n     policy for implementing PEPFAR's ABC model (defined as \n     ``Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms'') is unclear and open to \n     varying interpretations, causing confusion about which groups \n     may be targeted and whether youth may receive the ABC \n     message.\n       (17) The Government Accountability Office found that the \n     ABC guidance does not clearly delineate permissible ``C'' \n     activities under the ABC model. Program staff reported that \n     they feel ``constrained'' by restrictions on promoting or \n     marketing condoms to youth. Other country teams reported \n     confusion about whether PEPFAR funds may be used for broad \n     condom social marketing, even to adults in a generalized \n     epidemic.\n       (18) Young people are our greatest hope for changing the \n     course of the AIDS epidemic. According to the World Health \n     Organization, ``[f]ocusing on young people is likely to be \n     the most effective approach to confronting the epidemic, \n     particularly in high prevalence countries''.\n\n     SEC. 3. ENSURING BALANCED FUNDING FOR HIV PREVENTION METHODS.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress on Abstinence-Until-Marriage Funding \n     Requirement.--Section 402(b)(3) of the United States \n     Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of \n     2003 (22 U.S.C. 7672(b)(3)) is amended by striking ``, of \n     which such amount at least 33 percent should be expended for \n     abstinence-until-marriage programs''.\n       (b) Elimination of Abstinence-Until-Marriage Funding \n     Requirement.--Section 403(a) of such Act (22 U.S.C. 7673(a)) \n     is amended by striking the second sentence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1554. A bill to comprehensively address challenges relating to \nenergy independence, air pollution, and climate change facing the \nUnited States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Energy \nIndependence, Clean Air, and Climate Security Act of 2007. This \nlegislation takes an integrated approach that is much needed and long \noverdue if we are to address effectively three intertwined issues of \ncrucial importance to our Nation's economy and security and to the \nhealth of our people and our planet. I am very pleased to be joined on \nthis legislation by Senator Lieberman, a true leader on energy, climate \nchange, and environmental issues.\n  The majority leader has announced the Senate may well take up a broad \npackage of energy legislation next week. The bill I am introducing \ntoday lays out my own vision of how our Nation can best address its \nenergy problems.\n  If Mark Twain were with us today, it is not hard to imagine he would \nrephrase his famous quip about the weather to something along the lines \nof: Everyone talks about climate change and energy independence, but \nnobody does anything about it.\n  Since the actions we take to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, to \nclean our air, and to reduce our contribution to climate change all \naffect each other, it is necessary we develop a comprehensive strategy \nfor all three of these challenges.\n  Indeed, since the oil embargo of 1973, through 17 Congresses and 7 \ndifferent Presidents, energy efficiency and energy independence have \ngenerated a lot\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\nof talk, some pretty good ideas, and a lot of promises but not enough \nconcerted, determined, coordinated action. During these 34 years, our \nNation's imports of foreign oil have soared from less than 35 percent \nto more than 60 percent, leaving us dangerously reliant on unstable \nregions of the world in order to fuel our Nation and our economy.\n  In addition to our increased reliance on foreign oil, we are also \nconsuming more and more electricity. As demand puts increasing pressure \non supply, electricity prices have soared. In the summer, when air-\nconditioners struggle to keep up with rising temperatures, we run the \nrisk of blackouts, brownouts, and price spikes.\n  At the same time, our greenhouse gas emissions have soared, leading \nto virtually indisputable evidence that human activity is contributing \nto climate change. In the United States, emissions of the primary \ngreenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, have risen more than 20 percent since \n1990. Globally, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere now far \nexceed the natural range over the last 650,000 years. We know this from \nscientific analyses of ice cores and other evidence.\n  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the \nincrease in greenhouse gas emissions has already increased global \ntemperatures and has likely contributed to more extreme weather events, \nsuch as droughts and floods. These emissions will continue to change \nthe climate, causing warming in most regions and likely causing more \nfloods, droughts, and an increase in the intensity of hurricanes.\n  Climate change is not the only environmental problem caused by fossil \nfuel use. The quality of our air also suffers. Although we have made \nsome important strides in improving air quality since the 1970s, we \nhave not done enough. Fossil fuel use is the primary cause of mercury \npollution, smog, and acid rain that continue to plague our Nation. \nIndeed, air pollution causes thousands of asthma attacks and costs many \nlives annually.\n  The time has come to address our air quality, climate change, high \nenergy prices, and dangerous reliance on foreign oil. The legislation I \nam introducing today is, I believe, the first Senate bill that would \naddress all these problems in a single, integrated approach. There have \nbeen many bills introduced that address one of these problems. This is \nan attempt to have a comprehensive approach and to recognize that each \nof these problems affects the other.\n  My legislation focuses primarily on two sectors of the economy: \nelectricity and transportation. Together, these two sectors account for \n73 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. Electricity generation accounts \nfor more than 40 percent of our carbon dioxide emissions. More than 80 \npercent of these emissions are attributable to coal-fired powerplants. \nCoal-fired powerplants are also the single largest source of mercury \npollution, smog, and acid rain. Between 1990 and 2004, emissions from \nthese sectors increased by 27 percent.\n  My legislation requires utilities to reduce carbon dioxide emissions \nto 1990 levels by the year 2020, while also addressing the emissions \nthat cause smog, acid rain, and mercury pollution. It includes a \nrenewable portfolio standard which would help to diversify our \nelectricity supplies and energy efficiency resource standards that the \nAlliance to Save Energy estimates would save consumers, over time, \nbillions of dollars on their electricity bills.\n\n  The transportation sector, which relies almost entirely on oil, is \nnot only partly responsible for our dangerous reliance on foreign oil \nbut also accounts for 33 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. My \nlegislation would help to reduce emissions from this sector through a \ncombination of provisions such as CAFE standards for automobiles and \nheavy-duty trucks, tax incentives for consumers to encourage them to \npurchase hybrid and alternative fueled vehicles, incentives for \nmanufacturers to produce the next generation of energy-efficient \nvehicles, and a low carbon fuel standard that will help to replace some \ngasoline with biofuels. Taken together, these provisions will \nsubstantially reduce our reliance on foreign oil, while reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions by hundreds of millions of tons.\n  I wish to make clear the choice is not between hobbling our Nation's \neconomy and protecting our environment. This legislation is based on \nthe principle that research, development, and implementation of new \napproaches to energy independence and environmental stewardship will \nprovide a powerful new stimulus for our economy. All too often, we are \nconfronted with proposals to address one issue that only aggravate \nanother problem. The integrated approach I am proposing will help us \nbreak through that impasse.\n  This legislation does not attempt to reinvent the wheel. In fact, it \nincorporates several good ideas from my colleagues that have been \nintroduced as separate bills, many of which I have cosponsored, such as \nthe Ten-in-Ten and other CAFE bills, the DRIVE Act, and the Clean Power \nAct. It includes provisions of legislation I have introduced to address \nabrupt climate change and to eliminate certain tax credits for the oil \nindustry. It contains many of the excellent energy efficiency \nprovisions in the Energy for Our Future Act introduced by \nRepresentative Chris Shays in the House.\n  My bill is also complementary with the McCain-Lieberman Climate \nStewardship and Innovation Act. We need to pass that bill in order to \nestablish a nationwide cap and trade program for addressing climate \nchange. However, the regulations to implement that could take many \nyears. The legislation I am proposing today will help us take some \nearly action to help achieve the targets in the McCain-Lieberman bill.\n  I believe the first step toward energy independence is to make \nbetter, more efficient use of our current energy supplies. The first \ntitle of this bill tackles that issue on several fronts.\n  It would implement the ``Ten-in-Ten'' legislation I have co-sponsored \nwith Senators Feinstein and Snowe to increase fuel economy standards to \n35 miles per gallon by 2016. It would then go a step further and \nincrease CAFE standards to 45 miles per gallon by 2025. This provision \nwould save approximately 2.5 million barrels of oil per day.\n  It would help consumers buy more fuel-efficient cars by repealing the \nphase-out of the tax credit for hybrid vehicles, which is scheduled to \nsunset at the end of 2009. It would also require light trucks that use \ndiesel fuel to meet more stringent EPA emission standards in order to \nqualify for the lean-burn credit.\n  Public transportation is one of the most effective ways we can get \nmore passenger miles per gallon. This legislation would promote the \ndevelopment and use of public transportation by subsidizing fares, \nencouraging employers to assist their employees with fares, and \nauthorizing funding to build energy-efficient and environmentally \nfriendly modes of transport, such as clean buses and light rail.\n  It would direct the Department of Transportation to designate 20 \nTransit-Oriented Development Corridors in urban areas by 2015, and 50 \nby 2025. These TOD Corridors would be developed with the aid of grants \nto state and local governments to construct or improve facilities for \nmotorized transit, bicycles, and pedestrians. These provisions would be \nfunded by an authorization of $500 million per year from 2007 through \n2016.\n  We must do more to encourage the development and manufacture of \nenergy-efficient vehicles. This legislation would create a 20-percent \ninvestment tax credit for automobile manufacturers, and a fuel economy \nachievement credit for manufacturers that have a combined fleet fuel \neconomy that exceeds that of their 2005 model year. This credit would \nbegin at 5 percent next year and rise to 50 percent in 2015.\n  And we must do more to help existing vehicles be as energy efficient \nas possible. This legislation would direct the DOT to create a National \nTire Fuel Efficiency Program that would include tire testing and \nlabeling, energy-efficient tire promotions through incentives and \ninformation, and the creation of minimum fuel economy standards for \ntires. These standards would establish the maximum technically feasible \nand cost-effective fuel savings without adversely affecting tire safety \nor average tire life.\n  Heavy-duty vehicles move our economy. This legislation would keep \nthem on the move while helping to reduce both fuel consumption and \nemissions.\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\nIt would require DOT to develop a testing and assessment program to \ndetermine what is feasible to improve the efficiency of heavy vehicles, \nand then to develop the appropriate fuel-economy standards. It also \nwould provide a tax credit of up to $3,500 for the purchase of idling \nreduction technology for heavy vehicles.\n  In order for the Federal Government to lead by example, this \nlegislation would require the Secretary of Energy to issue regulations \nfor federal fleets covered by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to reduce \npetroleum consumption by 30 percent from a 1999 baseline by 2016.\n  Title II of my legislation focuses on increasing our energy \nindependence and reducing our emissions from the transportation sector \nthrough the use of alternative fuels.\n  Renewable fuels offer great potential to help us achieve greater \nenergy independence. This legislation would help us realize that \npotential by establishing a clean, renewable fuels performance \nstandard. The performance standard would require fuel providers to \nincrease the volume of clean, low-carbon, renewable fuels by up to 35 \nbillion gallons by 2025, unless EPA finds that the increase is \ntechnically infeasible or is likely to result in adverse impacts.\n  This legislation would expand existing tax credits for ethanol to \ninclude cellulosic biomass. While there has been a great deal of focus \non using corn-based ethanol in order to decrease our reliance upon \nforeign oil, there are other renewable, plant-based energy sources that \nare more environmentally friendly and have greater potential to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Researchers at the University of Maine have been at the forefront of \napplying a research technique known as ``Life Cycle Analysis.'' Life \nCycle Analysis is a unique interdisciplinary research tool that \nanalyzes the energy requirements and environmental footprint involved \nwith the manufacture, use, and disposal of a material. This technique \nis ideal for identifying fuels which have the lowest environmental \nimpact and the greatest potential for reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions, while reducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  My legislation would authorize $275 million over five years for \nresearch that would use Life Cycle Analysis in order to identify and \ndevelop new biotechnologies. These technologies will help move our \npetroleum-based economy toward a renewable, sustainable forest bio-\neconomy.\n  Environmental stewardship must go beyond the tailpipes of our \nvehicles to the smokestacks of our power plants. Title III of my \nlegislation builds upon the Clean Power Act that I introduced in the \nlast Congress with Senators Jeffords and Lieberman. I have, however, \nmodified this provision to provide assistance to small businesses \nstruggling with high electricity costs. I have also included increased \nfunding for important conservation programs such as Forest Legacy, in \norder to help wildlife adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n  This legislation would cut all four major power plant pollutants over \nthe next six years. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which cause \nsmog, acid rain, and asthma attacks, would be cut by 75 percent. Toxic \nmercury emissions would be cut by 90 percent from 1999 levels, and \ncarbon dioxide, which forms the heat-trapping blanket that contributes \nto global warming, would be cut to 1990 levels.\n  These reductions would do more than provide long-term protection for \nour environment; they also would produce dramatic and immediate health \ngains for our people. According to the EPA, quick and decisive cuts in \nnitrogen and sulfur emissions from power plants would save 18,700 lives \nevery year, avoid 366,000 asthma attacks, and prevent $100 billion in \nhealth care costs. In addition, these cuts would combat the acid rain \nthat is spoiling some of our Nation's most treasured parks and \nwilderness areas.\n  The Centers for Disease Control has concluded that 4.9 million women \nof childbearing age have elevated levels of mercury, and that 322,000 \nnewborns are at risk of neurological damage from mercury exposure. This \nprovision preserves our national commitment to reduce toxic threats to \npregnant women and to children by requiring meaningful reductions and \nby prohibiting trading.\n  The Clean Power Act incorporated into this legislation closes the \ngrandfather loophole that exempts dirty, aging power plants from \ncleanup. Every power plant will be required to meet the most modern \npollution control standards by either the plant's 40th year of \noperation or by the fifth year of the enactment of this legislation.\n  The Clean Power Act uses market mechanisms, such as buying and \nselling pollution allowances known as ``emissions trading.'' As I have \nalready stated, under my bill, this trading will not be allowed for \ntoxic mercury. Nor will it be allowed if it enables a power plant to \npollute at a level that damages public health or the environment.\n  Power plants are the largest source of our Nation's contribution to \nglobal warming; as I stated earlier, they account for some 40 percent \nof our carbon dioxide emissions. This legislation would return carbon \ndioxide emissions to 1990 levels. By providing electricity producers \nwith regulatory certainty now about future pollution-reduction \nrequirements, this legislation would allow smarter investments and more \ncost-efficient planning.\n  As with existing motor vehicles, we must make more efficient use of \nthe energy we now produce to heat our homes and power our lights. This \nlegislation would double funding for the Department of Energy \nWeatherization Program, reaching $1.4 billion for 2008. It also would \nprovide predictable funding for the valuable Energy Star Program, which \nhelps consumers buy energy efficient appliances, and would extend the \nrenewable electricity tax credit through 2011 and the residential \ninvestment tax credit for solar and energy efficient buildings through \n2012.\n  This legislation also includes an Energy Efficiency Performance \nStandard for utilities. This provision requires utilities to achieve \nenergy efficiency improvements. This provision would help consumers \nsave on their electricity bills. By way of example, in California, \nwhere a similar provision was employed, utilities achieved energy \nsavings at a cost of around 2-4 cents per kilowatt hour. According to \nthe Alliance to Save Energy, an Energy Efficiency Performance Standard \ncould save consumers $64 billion in net savings, and avoid the need to \nbuild 400 power plants, preventing 320 million metric tons of carbon \ndioxide emissions.\n  In addition, my legislation includes a renewable portfolio standard \nwhich would require utilities to generate 20 percent of their \nelectricity from environmentally sound renewable energy sources by the \nyear 2020. For example, biomass electricity generated under this \nprovision must be done using sustainable forest practices.\n  This legislation will help Americans save on utility bills, and make \nour tax code fairer, too. Title V would eliminate two major tax credits \nthat benefit large oil and gas companies: tax credits for intangible \ndrilling costs and for excess percentage over cost depletions. This \nwould save the taxpayers billions of dollars over the next five years.\n  This legislation also would help us better understand and assess \nclimate change. During the last three years, I have had the opportunity \nto meet in the field with some of the world's foremost climate \nscientists. I have traveled to Ny-Alesund, Norway, the northernmost \ncommunity in the world, where I saw the dramatic loss of sea-ice cover \nand the retreating Arctic glaciers. I have seen the same alarming \nchanges in Alaska. Just a year ago, I went to the other end of the \nworld and met with researchers--including a team from the University of \nMaine's outstanding Climate Change Institute--in Antarctica. These \nregions are the canary in the coal mine, and the changes taking place \nprovide a warning we cannot ignore.\n  Nor can we forestall taking action by arguing over the precise extent \nof climate change and the human contribution to it. The answer to \nscientific uncertainty is additional research. Title VI of my \nlegislation would authorize $60 million for abrupt climate change \nresearch. Studies suggest that the climate can change dramatically \nwithin a very short period of time. An abrupt climate change triggered \nby the ongoing buildup of greenhouse gases could cause catastrophic \ndroughts and floods.\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\nUnderstanding and predicting climate change are enormous scientific \nchallenges. A great deal more scientific research is necessary in order \nto better understand the potential risk of abrupt climate change, and \nthis legislation would provide the resources that are so urgently \nrequired.\n  There are few issues of greater concern to my constituents in my home \nstate of Maine than our nation's ongoing and escalating reliance on \nforeign oil, and the damage our vehicle and power plant emissions are \ndoing to the environment. They bear the brunt of wildly fluctuating and \nsteadily increasing energy prices. They know the harm this dependence \ncauses to our national security, and they know the harm our current \nenergy usage causes to the air they breathe. And although a bone-\nchilling, winter nor'easter may bring a new round of jokes about the \npossible benefits of global warming, they know that human-caused \nclimate change is no laughing matter. They know we must be better \nstewards of our planet.\n  I believe that all Americans--whether they live in the sunny south or \na winter wonderland--share these concerns. They have heard enough talk; \nthey want us to act. Americans deserve to breathe clean air, pay \nreasonable gasoline and electricity prices, live in a world with a \nstable climate future, and have the peace of mind that comes with \nsecure energy supplies. The Energy Independence, Clean Air, and Climate \nSecurity Act offers a comprehensive, integrated approach to these \nissues.\n  In conclusion, let me describe the six titles very briefly.\n  The first title of my bill would increase energy independence and \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions by improving the efficiency of our \ntransportation sector. The second title would accomplish similar goals \nby replacing some gasoline with alternative fuels. The third title \nwould reduce emissions of mercury, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and \nnitrogen oxides from powerplants. The fourth title would help to reduce \nheat and electricity bills and diversify our electricity supply through \na combination of energy efficiency and renewable energy provisions. The \nfifth title would help save taxpayers money through the elimination of \ncertain tax breaks for the oil industry. Finally, the sixth title would \nauthorize $60 million for abrupt climate change research to help us \nbetter understand this phenomenon.\n  I am particularly excited about renewable fuels. I think there is a \nlot we could do to expand the tax break for ethanol to include \ncellulosic biomass. There is very exciting research being done at the \nUniversity of Maine which has been in the forefront of applying a \nresearch technique known as ``Life Cycle Analysis,'' which is a tool \nthat analyzes the energy requirements and environmental footprint \ninvolved in the manufacture, use, and disposal of a material. It is \nideal for identifying fuels which have the lowest environmental impact \nand the greatest potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions while \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil. This technology will help us \nmove our petroleum-based economy toward a renewable, sustainable, \nforest bioeconomy.\n  This is a complex bill. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Akaka, Ms. Colllns, Mr. \n        Menendez, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 1557. A bill to amend part B of title IV of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 to improve 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleague Senator \nEnsign, to introduce the Improving 21st Century Community Learning \nCenters Act of 2007, which will provide children with safe, healthy, \nand academically focused afterschool programs. This bill is endorsed by \nthe Afterschool Alliance, an organization representing more than 20,000 \npublic, private, and nonprofit afterschool providers who are dedicated \nto expanding access to high quality afterschool programs, as well as \nmany other national and local organizations.\n  More than 14 million children enrolled in kindergarten through 12th \ngrade spend time unsupervised in the hours after school. Between the \nhours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., while parents are at work, kids are most \nlikely to experiment with risky behaviors. To the contrary, students \nwho regularly attend afterschool programs have better grades and \nbehavior in school, better peer relations and emotional adjustment, and \nlower incidences of drug use, violence, and pregnancy. America's \nfamilies rely on afterschool programs to give their children the \nopportunity to be engaged in high quality learning activities that will \nenhance their children's success in school and in life.\n  The Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act of 2007 is \ndesigned to do three things: enhance program quality and \nsustainability, address the obesity epidemic by including physical \nfitness and wellness programs in the list of possible programming \nactivities, and encourage service learning. First, our bill provides \nStates with tools designed to sustain high quality afterschool programs \nby allowing program grantees to renew their grants based on their \nprogram performance. The legislation also gives States the option to \nexpand their technical assistance functions to further improve the \nquality of afterschool programs.\n  Second, this bill will increase opportunities for children and young \npeople to be more physically active. As obesity reaches epidemic \nproportions in our society, allowing for such opportunities is critical \nin ensuring our children's overall health. Obesity is among the easiest \nmedical conditions to recognize, but among the most difficult to treat. \nThe annual cost to society for obesity is estimated at nearly $100 \nbillion. Physical activity and wellness programs are critical to our \noverall health and well-being.\n  Third, this bill encourages children to be involved in service \nlearning and youth development activities. Service learning integrates \nstudent designed service projects with academic studies. This type of \nprogram has been shown to strengthen student engagement, enhance \nstudent achievement, lower drop out and suspension rates, develop \nworkforce and leadership skills and provide opportunities for team \nwork. The Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act will \nhelp build the character and work ethic of our children and youth.\n  Finally, it is of paramount importance that we adequately fund our \nafterschool programs. Currently, afterschool programs have served, at \nmost, only 1.4 million children. It is critical that we provide more \nopportunities for youth to be engaged in high quality afterschool \nprogramming.\n  The Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act provides a \ncritical first step toward ensuring the health, safety, and education \nof our Nation's children. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1557\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Community \n     Learning Centers Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 28,000,000 children in the United States have \n     parents who work outside the home and 14,300,000 children in \n     the United States are unsupervised after the school day ends.\n       (2) 6,500,000 children are in after school programs but an \n     additional 15,300,000 would participate if such a program \n     were available.\n       (3) After school programs inspire learning. In academic \n     year 2003-2004, 45 percent of all 21st Century Community \n     Learning Centers program participants had improved their \n     reading grades, and 41 percent improved their mathematics \n     grades.\n       (4) In academic year 2003-2004 teachers reported that a \n     majority of students who participated in 21st Century \n     Community Learning Centers programs demonstrated improved \n     student behavior, particularly in the areas of academic \n     performance, homework completion, and class participation.\n       (5) A growing body of research also suggests that children \n     who participate in after school programs attend school more \n     regularly, are more likely to stay in school, and are better \n     prepared for college and careers.\n       (6) Benefits of after school programs extend beyond the \n     classroom. Communities\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\n     with after school programs have reported reduced vandalism \n     and juvenile crime.\n       (7) After school programs help working families. One study \n     estimates that decreased worker productivity due to stress \n     and absenteeism caused by issues related to after school care \n     arrangements costs employers $496 to $1,984 per employee, per \n     year, depending on the annual salary of the employee. The \n     total cost to the business industry is estimated to be \n     between $50,000,000,000 and $300,000,000,000 annually in lost \n     job productivity.\n       (8) While students in the United States are falling behind \n     in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), \n     more than 90 percent of after school programs funded by 21st \n     Century Community Learning Centers offer STEM activities, \n     providing more time for children and youth to gain skills and \n     build interest in the STEM fields. Evaluations of after \n     school programs offering STEM activities to students have \n     found increases in the reading, writing, and science skills \n     proficiency of these students. Children who participate in \n     such programs show more interest in science careers, and are \n     more likely to have engaged in science activities just for \n     fun.\n       (9) Data from 73 after school studies indicate that after \n     school programs employing evidence-based approaches to \n     improving students' personal and social skills were \n     consistently successful in producing multiple benefits for \n     students, including improvements in students' personal, \n     social, and academic skills, as well as students' self-\n     esteem.\n       (10) Teens who do not participate in after school programs \n     are nearly 3 times more likely to skip classes than teens who \n     do participate. The teens who do not participate are also 3 \n     times more likely to use marijuana or other drugs, and are \n     more likely to drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, and engage in \n     sexual activity. In general, self care and boredom can \n     increase the likelihood that a young person will experiment \n     with drugs and alcohol by as much as 50 percent.\n       (11) A 2006 study predicts that by the year 2010 more than \n     46 percent of school-age children in the Americas will be \n     overweight and 1 in 7 such children will be obese. A study of \n     after school program participants in 3 elementary schools \n     found that after school participants were significantly less \n     likely to be obese at the 3-year follow-up physical exam and \n     were more likely to have increased acceptance among their \n     peers. After school programs provide children and youth with \n     opportunities to engage in sports and other fitness \n     activities.\n       (12) After school programs have been identified as \n     effective venues for improving nutrition, nutrition \n     education, and physical activity at a time when just 20 \n     percent of youth in grades 9 through 12 consume the \n     recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables.\n       (13) After school programs also provide children and youth \n     with opportunities for service learning, a teaching and \n     learning approach that integrates student-designed service \n     projects that address community needs with academic studies. \n     With structured time to reflect on their service experience, \n     these projects can strengthen student engagement, enhance \n     students' academic achievement, lower school drop out and \n     suspension rates, and help develop important workforce skills \n     that employers are looking for, including leadership skills, \n     critical thinking, teamwork, and oral and written \n     communication.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       ``There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     part such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2008 and \n     each of the 5 succeeding fiscal years.''.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Improving \n21st Century Community Learning Centers Act of 2007 with my colleague, \nSenator Chris Dodd.\n  The Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act of 2007 \nwill go a long way toward providing our Nation's children with safe, \nhealthy, and academically focused aftershool programs. Mr. President, \n21st century community learning centers provide students in rural and \ninner-city public schools with access to homework centers, tutors, \nmentors, and drug and alcohol prevention counseling, as well as \ncultural and recreational activities.\n  Today, 14.3 million children go home alone when the school day ends, \nincluding over 40,000 kindergartners and almost 4 million middle school \nstudents. With less than half of the children in afterschool programs, \nthe parents of another 15.3 million children say their children would \nparticipate in afterschool--if a program were available. The 21st \nCentury Community Learning Centers Program is a critical resource to \nchildren, families, and communities in their struggle to meet the need \nfor high-quality afterschool programs.\n  The 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program is a worthwhile \nand necessary investment--evaluations show that these investments are \nhaving a great impact on children's academic achievement and behavior. \nIn 2003-2004, 45 percent of all program participants had improved their \nreading grades and 41 percent improved their math grades. Teachers \nreported that a majority of the students participating in the programs \nimproved their academic performance, improved their school attendance, \ncompleted more homework on time and to the teacher's satisfaction, and \nimproved their class participation. Beyond the academic gains, these \nprograms are making kids and communities safer by reducing vandalism \nand juvenile crime. It is important that we provide our children with \naccess to high-quality, safe, and enriching environments in the hours \nafter the school day.\n  When my colleagues and I passed the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002 \nit included a bipartisan commitment to quality afterschool programs and \ninvestment in the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program. The \nlearning centers are currently funded at $981 million and serve about 1 \nmillion children, yet this is just a fraction--7 percent--of the \nchildren who are eligible for the program and need access to high-\nquality afterschool programs. Improving 21st Century Community Learning \nCenters Act of 2007 will address this need and provide our children \nwith the sustainable afterschool opportunities that they deserve.\n  Recent evaluations of 21st Century Community Learning Center Programs \nshow that participating students are improving both their academic \nperformance and social behavior in and out of the classroom. Yet \nmaintaining quality programs takes constant effort and resources. This \nlegislation increases the investments in quality that are critical to \nensuring that programs not only contribute to children's academic and \nsocial development but also give young people the opportunities that \nwill ensure their college and workplace readiness in the future.\n  As the father of three and as a former latch-key kid myself, I \nunderstand the benefits of providing children with a place to go and \nactivities to help them excel. I am committed to ensuring that our \nschools have the assistance they need to ensure that our children leave \nthe public education system as well-rounded individuals. Children \nattending public schools should not only be proficient in reading, \nwriting, and arithmetic but also be skillful in music, art, and \nathletics. It is my sincere hope that my colleagues in the Senate will \nrecognize this important need and cosponsor the Improving 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Centers Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1560. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the \nquality and availability of mental health services for children and \nadolescents; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\n  Mr. DODD, Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation with my colleagues, Senators Domenici and Kennedy, that \nseeks to meet the mental health needs of children and adolescents.\n  I believe that the task of ensuring the emotional well-being and \nresiliency of our young people is one of paramount importance. We all \nknow that mental health is a critical component contributing to a \nchild's general health and ability to grow both intellectually and \nphysically. Yet, the task of ensuring the mental health of children and \nadolescents is not an easy one. In fact, it is arguably one of the most \ndifficult and largely unspoken tasks facing our Nation today.\n  According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration SAMHSA, 1 in 10 children and adolescents suffer from \nmental health disorders serious enough to cause some level of \nimpairment. Out of these young people, only one in five receive the \nspecialty mental health services they require.\n  These startling statistics prompted former Surgeon General Dr. David \nSatcher to convene a conference in 1999 that examined the mental health \nneeds of children. The conference, composed of some of the Nation's \nleading experts in mental and public health published a seminal report \nthat concluded that ``. . . the burden of suffering experienced by \nchildren with mental illness and their families has created a health \ncrisis in this country.'' The report further concluded that ``. . . \nthere is broad evidence that the Nation lacks a unified infrastructure \nto help children suffering from mental illness.''\n  The ``burden of suffering'' described in Surgeon General Satcher's \nreport is a burden endured by millions of children, adolescents, and \ntheir families in Connecticut and across our Nation. Throughout my \nSenate career, I have heard from families who have shared with me their \npersonal stories in struggling to care for their children. Their \nstories have fueled my belief that child and adolescent mental health \nneeds to be a top priority.\n  Recognizing the fragmentation of the Nation's mental health delivery \nsystem, Surgeon General Satcher's report concluded that one fundamental \nway to meet the mental health needs of children and adolescents is to \n``. . . move towards a community-based mental health delivery system \nthat balances health promotion, disease prevention, early detection, \nand universal access to care.'' The report further stated eight goals \nto ensure the resiliency of children and adolescents. These goals were: \nfirst, to promote public awareness of children's mental health issues \nand reduce the stigma often associated with mental illness; second, to \ncontinue to develop, disseminate, and implement scientifically proven \nprevention and treatment services in the field of children's mental \nhealth; third, to improve the assessment and recognition of mental \nhealth needs in children; fourth, to eliminate racial, ethnic and \nsocioeconomic disparities in access to mental health care services; \nfifth, to improve infrastructure for children's mental health services, \nincluding support for scientifically proven interventions across \nprofessions; sixth, to increase access to and coordination of quality \nmental health care services; seventh, to train frontline providers to \nrecognize and manage mental health issues, and educate mental health \ncare providers about scientifically proven prevention and treatment \nservices, and; finally, to monitor the access to and coordination of \nquality mental health care services.\n  In 2002, President Bush established the President's New Freedom \nCommission on Mental Health to study three obstacles identified by the \nPresident that prevent Americans with mental illness from getting the \ncare they require. These obstacles were identified as the stigma that \ntoo often surrounds mental health care, a lack of mental health parity, \nand the fragmented mental health delivery system. In 2003, the \nPresident's New Freedom Commission issued a report that made a series \nof recommendations on how the Nation's mental health system could be \ntransformed for the better. Like Surgeon General Satcher's report, this \npublication also set forth a series of goals. They were: first, to \nensure that Americans understand that mental health is essential to \noverall health; second, to ensure that mental health care is consumer- \nand family-driven; third, to eliminate disparities in mental health \ncare services; fourth, to ensure that early mental health screening, \nassessment, and referral services are common practices; fifth, to \nensure that excellent mental health care is delivered and research is \naccelerated; and finally, to ensure that technology is used to access \nmental health care and information.\n  I describe these two reports because the legislation I am introducing \nwith my colleagues today seeks to address the recommendations they \nespouse. The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Resiliency Act of 2007 \nauthorizes $205 million in an effort to meet five principal objectives.\n  The first objective is to increase access to, and improve the quality \nof, mental health care services delivered to children and adolescents. \nOur legislation seeks to meet this objective in several ways.\n  First, it authorizes a new grant of $50 million for states to develop \nand implement a comprehensive mental health plan exclusively for \nchildren and adolescents that provides community-based mental health \nearly intervention and prevention services and relevant support \nservices, such as primary health care, education, transportation and \nhousing. The plan would have to meet a set of core operational and \nevaluative requirements and would have to be developed through \nextensive outside consultation with children and adolescents, their \nfamilies, advocates and health professionals.\n  Second, our legislation authorizes two matching grants of $22.5 \nmillion each for community health centers, many of which primarily \nserve low-income populations, and primary health care facilities, such \nas a pediatrician's office, to provide community-based mental health \nservices in coordination with community mental health centers and/or \ntrained mental health professionals.\n  Third, our legislation authorizes a new grant of $22.5 million for \nstates, localities and private nonprofit organizations, for example, \nschool districts, to provide community-based mental health services in \nschools and appropriate mental health training activities to relevant \nschool and health professionals.\n  Fourth, our legislation authorizes a new grant of $20 million for \nStates, localities and private nonprofit organizations to provide \ncommunity-based mental health services specifically for at-risk mothers \nand their children.\n  Fifth, our legislation authorizes a new grant of $10 million for \nStates, localities and private nonprofit organizations to provide \ncommunity-based mental health services for children and adolescents in \njuvenile justice systems.\n  Sixth, our legislation authorizes $10 million for the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish, run and evaluate a \ndemonstration project that improves the ability of local case managers \nto work across the mental health, public health, substance abuse, child \nwelfare, education, juvenile justice and social services systems in a \nState.\n  Finally, our legislation requires States to meet their statutory \nobligations to fund fully mental health screening services under the \nEarly and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Services \nProgram. It also requires current successful initiatives, such as the \nComprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children with \nSerious Emotional Disturbance Program, the Community Mental Health \nServices Performance Partnership block grant, the Community Mental \nHealth Services block grant, and the Jail Diversion Program, to expand \ntheir scope with respect to certain reporting, evaluative, and service \nactivities.\n  The second objective our legislation seeks to meet is ensuring \ngreater public awareness and greater family participation in mental \nhealth services decisionmaking. Toward this end, our legislation does \nthe following:\n  First, it authorizes a new grant of $10 million for States, \nlocalities and private nonprofit organizations to develop policies that \nenable families of children and adolescents with mental health \ndisorders to have increased control and choice over mental health \nservices provided and received through a publicly funded mental health \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S7187]]\n\n  Second, it authorizes a new grant of $10 million for private \nnonprofit organizations to provide information on child and adolescent \nmental health disorders, services, support services and respite care to \nfamilies of children and adolescents with or who are at risk for mental \nhealth disorders.\n  Third, it authorizes a new grant of $10 million for private nonprofit \norganizations to develop community coalitions and public education \nactivities that promote child and adolescent resiliency.\n  In addition, our legislation authorizes $10 million to establish two \nnew technical assistance centers. These centers are designed to collect \nand disseminate information on mental health disorders, mental health \ndisorder risk factors, mental health services, mental health service \naccess, relevant support services, reducing the inappropriate use of \nseclusion and restraints, and family participation in mental health \nservice decision-making, exclusively for children and adolescents with \nor at risk of mental health disorders.\n  The third objective that this legislation seeks to meet is for the \nFederal Government to develop a policy specifically designed to meet \nthe unique mental health needs of children and adolescents. The \nlegislation authorizes $10 million for the establishment of an \ninteragency coordinating committee consisting of all Federal officials \nwhose departments or agencies oversee mental health activities for \nchildren and adolescents. Modeled after language in the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act, our legislation requires the coordinating committee \nto consult with outside parties, develop a Federal policy exclusively \npertaining to child and adolescent mental health, and report annually \nto Congress on specific challenges and solutions associated with \ncomprehensively addressing the mental health needs of children and \nadolescents. It also gives the committee flexibility to develop and \nimplement joint demonstration projects that bolster appropriate mental \nhealth care services to children and adolescents.\n  The fourth and final objective that this legislation seeks to meet is \nincreasing the amount of research into child and adolescent mental \nhealth. Only through intensive research can we develop evidence-based \nbest practices that allow us to develop services that fully meet the \nmental health needs of our children. Toward that end, our legislation \nauthorizes a new grant of $12.5 million for States, localities, \ninstitutions of higher education and private nonprofit organizations to \nidentify and research current service, training and information \nawareness gaps in mental health delivery systems for children and \nadolescents. Our legislation also authorizes $12.5 million to enhance \ncomprehensive Federal research and evaluation of promising best \npractices, existing disparities, psycho-tropic medications, trauma, \nrecovery and rehabilitation, and co-occurring disorders as they relate \nto child and adolescent mental health.\n  I have begun working with my colleagues on the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions to reauthorize the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration. It is my hope that this \nlegislation can contribute to that reauthorization effort.\n  I would like to conclude by saying that this legislation, while \ncomprehensive, is a first step, not a complete solution, towards fully \nmeeting the challenge of ensuring the resiliency of our children and \nadolescents. We need to continue working together--young people, \nfamilies, doctors, counselors, nurses, teachers, advocates, and \npolicymakers, since we all have a stake, either professional or \npersonal, on this issue. Only by working together can we develop \neffective and compassionate ways through which every young person in \nthis Nation is given a solid foundation upon which to reach his or her \ndreams in life. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join us in \nthis important effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, mental \n     health is a critical component of children's learning and \n     general health.\n       (2) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, 1 in 10 \n     children and adolescents suffer from mental illness severe \n     enough to cause some level of impairment.\n       (3) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, only 1 in \n     5 children and adolescents who suffer from severe mental \n     illness receive the specialty mental health services they \n     require.\n       (4) According to the World Health Organization, childhood \n     neuropsychiatric disorders will rise by more than 50 percent \n     by 2020, internationally, to become 1 of the 5 most common \n     causes of morbidity, mortality, and disability among \n     children.\n       (5) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, the \n     burden of suffering experienced by children with mental \n     illness and their families has created a health crisis in \n     this country.\n       (6) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, there is \n     broad evidence that the nation lacks a unified infrastructure \n     to help children suffering from mental illness.\n       (7) According to the President's New Freedom Commission on \n     Mental Health, President George Bush identified 3 obstacles \n     preventing Americans with mental illness from getting the \n     care they require: stigma that surrounds mental illness, \n     unfair treatment limitations and financial requirements \n     placed on mental health benefits in private health insurance, \n     and the fragmented mental health service delivery system.\n       (8) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, 1 way to \n     ensure that the country's health system meets the mental \n     health needs of children is to move towards a community-based \n     mental health delivery system that balances health promotion, \n     disease prevention, early detection, and universal access to \n     care.\n       (9) According to the President's New Freedom Commission on \n     Mental Health, transforming the country's mental health \n     delivery system rests on 2 principles: services and\n\n[[Page S7188]]\n\n     treatments must be consumer and family-centered, and care \n     must focus on increasing a person's ability to successfully \n     cope with life's challenges, on facilitating recovery, and \n     building resiliency.\n       (10) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, the \n     mental health and resiliency of children can be ensured by \n     methods that promote public awareness of children's mental \n     health issues and reduce stigma associated with mental \n     illness, continue to develop, disseminate, and implement \n     evidence-based and promising prevention and treatment \n     services in the field of children's mental health, improve \n     the assessment of and recognition of mental health needs in \n     children, eliminate racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic \n     disparities in access to mental healthcare services, improve \n     the infrastructure for children's mental health services, \n     including support for evidence-based and promising \n     interventions across professions, increase access to and \n     coordination of quality mental healthcare services, train \n     frontline providers to recognize and manage mental health \n     issues and educate mental healthcare providers about \n     evidence-based and promising prevention and treatment \n     services, and monitor the access to and coordination of \n     quality mental healthcare services.\n       (11) According to the President's New Freedom Commission on \n     Mental Health, the country's mental health delivery system \n     can be successfully transformed by methods that ensure \n     Americans understand that mental health is essential to \n     overall health, ensure mental health care is consumer and \n     family-driven, eliminate disparities in mental healthcare \n     services, ensure early mental health screening, assessment, \n     and referral services are common practices, ensure that \n     excellent mental health care is delivered and research is \n     accelerated, and ensure that technology is used to access \n     mental health care and information.\n\nTITLE I--STATE AND COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES CONCERNING THE MENTAL HEALTH OF \n                        CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Res. 222\n\n       Whereas over 37,170 people will be diagnosed with \n     pancreatic cancer this year in the United States;\n       Whereas pancreatic cancer is the 4th most common cause of \n     cancer death in the United States;\n       Whereas 75 percent of pancreatic cancer patients die within \n     the first year of their diagnosis and only 5 percent survive \n     more than 5 years, making pancreatic cancer the deadliest of \n     any cancer;\n       Whereas there has been no significant improvement in \n     survival rates in the last 25 years and pancreatic cancer \n     research is still in the earliest scientific stages;\n       Whereas there are no early detection methods and minimal \n     treatment options for pancreatic cancer;\n       Whereas when symptoms of pancreatic cancer generally \n     present themselves, it is too late for an optimistic \n     prognosis, and the average survival rate of those diagnosed \n     with metastasis of the disease is only 3 to 6 months;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of pancreatic cancer is 40 to 50 \n     percent higher in African Americans than in other ethnic \n     groups; and\n       Whereas it would be appropriate to observe November as \n     Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month to educate communities \n     across the Nation about pancreatic cancer and the need for \n     research funding, early detection methods, effective \n     treatments, and treatment programs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of \n     Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nwhich supports the goals and ideals of Pancreatic Cancer Awareness \nMonth. This resolution is an important step toward bringing the public \nawareness, funding for research, and congressional attention that is \nessential for addressing one of the most lethal cancers we face as a \nNation.\n  I doubt that there is one person who hasn't lost a friend or family \nmember to cancer, or knows someone who has. The American Cancer Society \ntells us that pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer \ndeath in the United States. The reality is that pancreatic cancer will \ntake over 33,000 American lives this year, more than 2,330 in New York. \nAnd yet, there are no early detection methods and our best treatment is \na surgical procedure that is more than 70 years old.\n  I believe that we can do better. This resolution encourages \ncommunities across the country to use the month of November to bring \nattention to what we have left to tackle. We need research dollars to \ncreate early detection methods, to find effective treatments, and to \nraise awareness about this deadly disease.\n  I am proud to introduce the Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month \nresolution today, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthis critical health issue.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution \nthat recognizes November as National Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. \nI am pleased to be joining my colleague, Senator Clinton, in \nintroducing this resolution, which represents a way to educate \ncommunities across the Nation about pancreatic cancer and the need for \nincreased research funding, early detection methods, and effective \ntreatments and programs.\n  Like many Americans, I have seen the ramifications of cancer first \nhand. I support this resolution in honor and loving memory of the \nmillions of Americans who have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer \nand their families, and for my mother, Jessica Udall Smith, whom I lost \nto pancreatic cancer.\n  Pancreatic cancer is hard to detect in its early stages as it doesn't \ncause symptoms right away. Also, because the pancreas is hidden behind \nother organs, health care providers cannot see or feel the tumors \nduring routine\n\n[[Page S7195]]\n\nexams. Because there are no early detection methods, pancreatic cancer \noften is found late and spreads quickly.\n  This year, more than 37,000 Americans will receive a diagnosis of \npancreatic cancer and for over 33,000 of them, it will be their killer. \nWhile overall cancer death rates have declined, the number of people \ndiagnosed with pancreatic cancer is actually increasing. It is \nprojected that this year, 440 Oregonians will die from pancreatic \ncancer. That represents a 17-percent increase in pancreatic cancer \ndeaths in Oregon over the last 3 to 4 years.\n  Individuals fighting pancreatic cancer continue to face \ndiscouragingly low odds of survival. In 1975, the 5 year survival rate \nfor pancreatic cancer was 2 percent. Twenty-five years later, the \nsurvival rate remain at an unacceptably low level of 5 percent, making \nthis cancer the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. Indeed, \npancreatic cancer is considered the deadliest cancer, of which 75 \npercent of patients diagnosed with this disease die within the first \nyear and most within the first 3 to 6 months. Early detection tools, \nsuch as those that currently are available for ovarian, colon, breast \nand prostate cancer, would make a significant impact on pancreatic \ncancer, but those tools require a new investment in basic scientific \nresearch at the National Cancer Institute, NCI.\n  In recent years, funding for cancer research has fallen behind the \npromise made during the doubling of the budget for the National \nInstitutes for Health, NIH. When NIH funding was first doubled, success \nrates for first submissions of grant requests to the NCI were 30 \npercent overall and 15 percent for new investigators. Those rates now \nhave dropped to an average of 10 percent across the board. \nUnfortunately, we are anticipating cuts to other NCI programs that \nadvance research, such as the Specialized Programs of Research \nExcellence program, which provides vital opportunities to explore new \nareas of research.\n  I support biomedical research and the great promise it holds in the \ndevelopment of new treatments and possible cures for the many types of \ncancer, including pancreatic cancer. Past investments at the NCI have \nhelped drive new discoveries that led to the decline in overall cancer \ndeaths in the U.S. for the second consecutive year. Now is the time to \nexpand our efforts in the fight against pancreatic cancer.\n  I ask that my colleagues support this resolution, which will help \nincrease research, education and awareness for pancreatic cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7195-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7195-S7196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 223--RECOGNIZING THE EFFORTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE \n  MEMBERS OF THE MONUMENTS, FINE ARTS, AND ARCHIVES PROGRAM UNDER THE \n  CIVIL AFFAIRS AND MILITARY GOVERNMENT SECTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES \nARMED FORCES DURING AND FOLLOWING WORLD WAR II WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR \nTHE PRESERVATION, PROTECTION, AND RESTITUTION OF ARTISTIC AND CULTURAL \n          TREASURES IN COUNTRIES OCCUPIED BY THE ALLIED ARMIES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. \nSnowe, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nLieberman, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas:\n\n                              S.

Roberts;\n       Whereas, in connection with the establishment of the \n     Roberts Commission, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives \n     program (MFAA) was established under the Civil Affairs and \n     Military Government Sections of the United States Armed \n     Forces;\n       Whereas the establishment of the Roberts Commission and the \n     MFAA provided an example for other countries, working in \n     conjunction with the United States, to develop similar \n     programs, and more than 100 foreign MFAA personnel, \n     representing at least seventeen countries, contributed to \n     this international effort;\n       Whereas the MFAA was comprised of both men and women, \n     commissioned officers and civilians, who were appointed or \n     volunteered to serve as representatives of the Roberts \n     Commission and as the official guardians of some of the \n     world's greatest artistic and cultural treasures;\n       Whereas members of the MFAA, called the ``Monuments Men'', \n     often joined frontline military forces and some even lost \n     their lives in combat during World War II;\n       Whereas, during World War II and for years following the \n     Allied victory, members of the MFAA worked tirelessly to \n     locate, identify, catalogue, restore, and repatriate \n     priceless works of art and irreplaceable cultural artifacts, \n     including masterpieces by Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, \n     and Vermeer, that had been stolen or sequestered by the Axis \n     powers;\n       Whereas the heroic actions of the MFAA in saving priceless \n     works of art and irreplaceable cultural artifacts for future \n     generations cannot be overstated, and set a moral precedent \n     and established standards, practices, and procedures for the \n     preservation, protection, and restitution of artistic and \n     cultural treasures in future armed conflicts;\n       Whereas members of the MFAA went on to become renowned \n     directors and curators of preeminent international cultural \n     institutions, including the National Gallery of Art, the \n     Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the \n     Toledo Museum of Art, and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, as \n     well as professors at institutions of higher education, \n     including Harvard University, Yale University, Princeton \n     University, New York University, Williams College, and \n     Columbia University;\n       Whereas other members of the MFAA were founders, \n     presidents, and members of associations such as the New York \n     City Ballet, the American Association of Museums, the \n     American Association of Museum Directors, the Archaeological \n     Institute of America, the Society of Architectural \n     Historians, the American Society of Landscape Architects, the \n     National Endowment for the Humanities, and the National \n     Endowment for the Arts, as well as respected artists, \n     architects, musicians, and archivists; and\n       Whereas members of the MFAA have never been collectively \n     honored for their service and contributions to humanity, and \n     they are deserving of the utmost acknowledgment, gratitude, \n     and recognition, in particular the 12 known Monuments Men who \n     are still alive: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the men and women who served in the \n     Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program (MFAA) under the \n     Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the United \n     States Armed Forces for their heroic role in the \n     preservation, protection, and restitution of monuments, works \n     of art, and other artifacts of inestimable cultural \n     importance in Europe and Asia during and following World War \n     II;\n       (2) recognizes that without their dedication and service, \n     many more of the world's artistic and historic treasures \n     would have been destroyed or lost forever amidst the chaos \n     and destruction of World War II;\n       (3) acknowledges that the detailed catalogues, \n     documentation, inventories, and photographs developed and \n     compiled by MFAA personnel during and following World War II \n     have made and continue to make possible the restitution of \n     stolen works of art to their rightful owners; and\n       (4) commends and extols the members of the MFAA for \n     establishing a precedent for action to protect cultural \n     property in the event of armed conflict, and by their action \n     setting a standard not just for one country, but for people \n     of all nations to acknowledge and uphold.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nhonoring the efforts and contributions of the members of the Monuments, \nFine Arts, and Archives Program under the Civil Affairs and Military \nGovernment Sections of the U.S. Armed Forces during and following World \nWar II. This group, known as the ``Monuments Men,'' was responsible for \nthe preservation, protection, and restitution of priceless artistic, \nand cultural treasures in countries occupied by the Allied armies.\n  In 1938, the Nazi party in Germany began a wide-scale confiscation of \nmillions of pieces of artwork and other cultural artifacts throughout \ncontinental Europe, including masterpieces by Leonardo Da Vinci, \nMichelangelo, and Rembrandt. Much of the art was confiscated from Nazi-\nconquered Europe, as well as from Jewish private collectors who were \nforced to relinquish their property rights.\n  In 1944, with the Allied armies rolling across Europe, the Monuments \nMen began their work. They were given the\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\ncharge of protecting the cultural treasures of Europe, which proved to \nbe a daunting task, given that they, at times, had to protect these \ntreasures from friend as well as foe. Their first task was to prevent \nAllied forces in the field from damaging national monuments and from \ndamaging or looting public or private collections. In the spring of \n1945, the Monuments Men began discovering large caches of Nazi-\nconfiscated artwork and artifacts. They began the arduous process of \ncataloging and repatriating the artwork and artifacts to their rightful \nowners.\n  I would like to take this moment to recognize the efforts of a couple \nof my fellow Oklahomans who served as Monuments Men. CPT Walter Johan \nHuchthausen served as a Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives officer with \nthe U.S. 9th Army in Europe. Captain Huchthausen was born in Perry, OK \non December 19, 1904. He earned a master of architecture degree from \nHarvard University in 1930 and went on to become the director of the \nDepartment of Design at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts before \njoining the faculty at the University of Minnesota. Captain Huchthausen \nenlisted in 1942. He served as a Monuments Man in France and Germany \nbefore he was tragically killed by gunfire in April of 1945 while \nworking to salvage an altarpiece in a German town.\n  Technical SGT Horace V. Apgar of Oklahoma City was transferred to the \nMonuments Men in Frankfurt in 1945, where he was involved in the \nretrieval and restitution of Jewish property. He was then assigned to \nthe Rothschild home in Paris, which was being used as a depository for \nrecovered Jewish artifacts stolen from synagogues and temples. Mr. \nApgar returned home after the war and sought a career in music. He \ngraduated from the Eastman School of Music at the University of \nRochester in 1949 served as a bass teacher at the University of \nOklahoma from 1951 to 1955.

Res. 35\n\n       Whereas public prayer and national days of prayer are a \n     long-standing American tradition to bolster national resolve \n     and summon the national will for victory;\n       Whereas the Continental Congress asked the colonies to pray \n     for wisdom in forming a nation in 1775;\n       Whereas Benjamin Franklin proposed that the Constitutional \n     Convention begin each day with a prayer;\n       Whereas General George Washington, as he prepared his \n     troops for battle with the British in May 1776, ordered them \n     to pray for the campaign ahead, that it would please the \n     Almighty to ``prosper the arms of the united colonies'' and \n     ``establish the peace and freedom of America upon a solid and \n     lasting foundation'';\n       Whereas President Abraham Lincoln, in declaring in the \n     Gettysburg Address that ``this nation, under God, shall have \n     a new birth of freedom'', rededicated the Nation to ensuring \n     that ``government of the people, by the people, for the \n     people, shall not perish from the earth'';\n       Whereas, as 73,000 Americans stormed the beaches at \n     Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944 (D-Day), President Franklin \n     Delano Roosevelt went on the national radio to lead the \n     Nation in prayer for their success;\n       Whereas, in his D-Day radio prayer, President Roosevelt did \n     not declare a single day of special prayer, but instead \n     compelled all Americans to ``devote themselves in a \n     continuance of prayer'';\n       Whereas the words of President Roosevelt calling on all \n     Americans to ``devote themselves in a continuance of prayer'' \n     for American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines in harm's \n     way are just as appropriate today as they were in June 1944;\n       Whereas, with our troops once again facing danger abroad \n     and the Nation looking for support here at home, the time is \n     ripe to once again heed the words and prayerful wisdom \n     contained in the D-Day radio address of the 20th century's \n     greatest Democrat president as he implored the Nation: ``as \n     we rise to each new day, and again when each day is spent, \n     let words of prayer be on our lips, invoking Thy help to our \n     efforts'';\n       Whereas more than 350,000 men and women of the United \n     States Armed Forces are deployed worldwide today;\n       Whereas more than 200,000 of these troops are engaged in \n     armed combat in Iraq and Afghanistan against determined and \n     ruthless enemies;\n       Whereas more than 3,800 brave Americans have been killed, \n     and over 26,000 have been wounded, while fighting the War on \n     Terror;\n       Whereas, because the War on Terror will be long and hard, \n     because success is not likely to come with rushing speed, and \n     because the sacrifice will continue to be immeasurable in \n     human terms, it is appropriate to make every anniversary of \n     D-Day, June 6th, a national day of prayer and rededication \n     for the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and \n     their mission; and\n       Whereas the D-Day radio address of President Roosevelt is \n     the inspiration and model for this annual national day of \n     prayer and rededication: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) every June 6 will hereafter be a national day of prayer \n     and rededication for the men and women of the United States \n     Armed Forces and their mission; and\n       (2) in encouraging our fellow Americans to join us in this \n     national day of prayer and rededication for our troops and \n     their mission, that the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives will each designate one member to read aloud \n     in the Senate and House chambers each June 6th, in its \n     entirety, President Roosevelt's D-Day radio prayer, as \n     follows:\n\n     ``My Fellow Americans:\n\n     Last night, when I spoke with you about the fall of Rome, I \n     knew at that moment that troops of the United States and our \n     Allies were crossing the Channel in another and greater \n     operation.

Their road will be long and \n     hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. \n     Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return \n     again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the \n     righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph.\n\n     They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without rest--\n     until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by noise \n     and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the violences of \n     war.\n\n     For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They \n     fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end \n     conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice \n     arise, and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They \n     yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the \n     haven of home.\n\n     Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive \n     them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.\n\n     And for us at home--fathers, mothers, children, wives, \n     sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas, whose thoughts \n     and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty God, to \n     rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of \n     great sacrifice.\n\n     Many people have urged that I call the nation into a single \n     day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the \n     desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a \n     continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again \n     when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips, \n     invoking Thy help to our efforts.\n\n     Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to \n     redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the \n     material support of our armed forces.\n\n     And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail, to \n     bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our \n     sons wheresoever they may be.\n\n     And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee; faith in \n     our sons; faith in each other; faith in our united crusade. \n     Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not \n     the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but \n     fleeting moment--let not these deter us in our unconquerable \n     purpose.\n\n     With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces of \n     our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and \n     racial arrogances. Lead us to the saving of our country, and \n     with our sister nations into a world unity that will spell a \n     sure peace--a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy \n     men. And a peace that will let all of men live in freedom, \n     reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.\n\n     Thy will be done, Almighty God.\n\n     Amen.''.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a resolution I have \nsubmitted today that declares June 6 a national\n\n[[Page S7197]]\n\nday of prayer and rededication for the men and women of the U.S. Armed \nForces and their mission.\n  As my colleagues know, when 73,000 Americans stormed the beaches at \nNormandy, France, on June 6, 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt went on \nnational radio to lead the Nation in prayer for their success.\n  With more than 350,000 men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces \ndeployed worldwide today, and many of these troops directly engaged in \narmed combat in Iraq and Afghanistan against determined and ruthless \nenemies, President Roosevelt's words calling on all Americans to \n``devote themselves to a continuance of prayer'' for American soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines in harm's way are as appropriate today as \nthey were in June of 1944.\n  As we have witnessed, the war on terror will be long and hard. \nUnfortunately, the sacrifice will continue to be immeasurable in human \nterms. It is appropriate to make every anniversary of D-day, June 6, a \nnational day of prayer for the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Now I wish to read President Roosevelt's D-day radio prayer:\n\n                          My Fellow Americans\n\n       Last night, when I spoke with you about the fall of Rome, I \n     knew at that moment that troops of the United States and our \n     Allies were crossing the Channel in another and greater \n     operation.

Con Res. 36\n\n       Whereas motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of \n     death for adolescents and young adults in the United States, \n     and many of these deaths are preventable;\n       Whereas almost 7,500 drivers between the ages of 15 and 20 \n     years were involved in fatal crashes in 2005 throughout the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the fatality rate in the United States for drivers \n     between the ages of 16 and 19 years, based on miles driven, \n     is 4 times the fatality rate for drivers between the ages of \n     25 and 69 years;\n       Whereas the majority of teen driver crashes in the United \n     States are due to driver error and speeding, and 15 percent \n     of the crashes are due to drunk driving;\n       Whereas roughly two-thirds of the teenagers killed in motor \n     vehicle accidents in the United States each year do not use \n     seatbelts;\n       Whereas approximately 63 percent of teen passenger deaths \n     in the United States occur while other teenagers are driving;\n       Whereas it is necessary to explore effective ways to reduce \n     the crash risk for young drivers by focusing research and \n     outreach efforts on areas of teen driving that show the most \n     promise for improving safety;\n       Whereas the National Teen Driver Survey, developed with \n     input from teenagers and administered by The Children's \n     Hospital of Philadelphia, demonstrates a national need to \n     increase overall awareness about the safe use of electronic \n     handheld devices, the risk of nighttime and fatigued driving, \n     the importance of consistent seatbelt use, and the practice \n     of gradually increasing driver privileges over time as a \n     young driver gains more experience under supervised \n     conditions;\n       Whereas in 2005, 1,553 crash fatalities involving a teen \n     driver occurred in the fall, when teenagers are in the first \n     months of the school year and faced with many decisions \n     involving driving, including whether to drive with peer \n     passengers and other distractions; and\n       Whereas designating the third week of October as National \n     Teen Driver Safety Week is expected to increase awareness of \n     these important issues among teenagers and adults in \n     communities throughout the United States, as additional \n     research is conducted to develop and test effective \n     interventions that will help teenagers become safe drivers: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Teen Driver \n     Safety Week; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate activities that promote the \n     practice of safe driving among the Nation's licensed teenage \n     drivers.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ncolleagues, Senators Specter, Durbin and Obama, a Senate concurrent \nresolution that will recognize a National Teen Driver Safety Week \nduring the third week of October. This resolution will focus increased \npublic attention and positive action upon the No. 1 cause of death of \nadolescents in our country--motor vehicle crashes. The fatality rate \nfor drivers ages 16 to 19 is approximately four times that of drivers \nages 25 to 69. In 2005, approximately 7,500 of our Nation's teenagers \nwere involved as drivers in fatal car crashes.\n  According to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, 13 of 67 counties in Pennsylvania had six deaths or \nmore in 2005 as a result of traffic accidents involving teens. In \nLackawanna County alone, where I reside, there were 13 accidents among \ndrivers ages 19 and under that resulted in death or an incapacitating \ninjury.\n  It is essential that we focus a heightened degree of public attention \nand awareness upon this tragic--and preventable--crisis. A majority of \nteen driver crashes are due to driver error and speeding. We must \nprovide more numerous and effective interventions that will help reduce \naccidents involving teen drivers.\n  We all know that learning to drive is an important rite of social \npassage and independence for teenagers. The Children's Hospital of \nPhiladelphia, in partnership with the State Farm Insurance Companies, \nis conducting ongoing research on teen drivers and recently completed \nthe National Young Driver Survey, questioning thousands of students \nacross the country. The survey was designed to be representative of the \n10.6 million public high school students in the United States. Thanks \nto this new data, we know more about what teens themselves think about \ndriving and how we can more effectively instill safe driving habits.\n\n[[Page S7198]]\n\n  I would like to mention three key findings from this survey:\n  1. The critical role of parents. As parents, we are often our \nchildren's first driving teachers. But our role does not end when our \nchildren get their licenses. Parents play a major role in setting and \nenforcing safe driving behavior, supervising their teen drivers, and \nensuring that teens assume responsibility for driving, including \nfinancial responsibility.\n  2. The prevalence of risky distractions. With 80 percent of teen \ndrivers reporting that they own cell phones, these technological \nadvances pose a serious threat to our children's safety while driving. \nNearly all--93 percent of--teens in the survey report that they witness \ndistractions such as cell phone calls, loud music, other teens in the \ncar, and their own emotions. Nearly half of all teens say they have \nwitnessed road rage in fellow teen drivers.\n  3. The prevalence of risky driving behaviors. While 50 percent of \nteens report seeing other teens drive drunk, nearly three fourths of \nteens report seeing their peers drive while fatigued. Half of teens \nreport driving 10 miles over the speed limit at least some of the time. \nOnly 65 percent of teens say they consistently use seat belts.\n  This superb research from Children's Hospital will continue to \nprovide us greater insight and strategies for reaching our young \npeople.\n  Our resolution will designate the third week in October, when schools \nare back in session, as a time for intensive outreach and programming \nto encourage teens to drive more safely--to minimize risky driving \nconditions, to manage peer-to-peer interactions around driving, and to \nlearn the skills they need to detect and react to hazards more \nappropriately.\n  As a member of the Senate, and as a father, I want to do everything \nin my power to ensure our children are safe on the road. Losing even \none child to a preventable death is a tragedy beyond words. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution recognizing a National Teen \nDriver Safety Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7198-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7198-S7200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1334.

HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) The United States has a tradition of advancing \n     fundamental human rights.\n       (2) Because the people of the United States remain \n     committed to protecting individual freedom, there is a \n     national imperative to eliminate human trafficking, including \n     early or forced marriage, commercial sexual exploitation, \n     forced labor, labor obtained through debt bondage, \n     involuntary servitude, slavery, and slavery by descent.\n       (3) To combat human trafficking in the United States and \n     globally, the people of the United States and the Federal \n     Government, including local and State governments, must be \n     aware of the realities of human trafficking and must be \n     dedicated to stopping this contemporary manifestation of \n     slavery.\n       (4) Beyond all differences of race, creed, or political \n     persuasion, the people of the United States face national \n     threats together and refuse to let human trafficking exist in \n     the United States and around the world.\n       (5) The United States should actively oppose all \n     individuals, groups, organizations, and nations who support, \n     advance, or commit acts of human trafficking.\n       (6) The United States must also work to end human \n     trafficking around the world through education.\n       (7) Victims of human trafficking need support in order to \n     escape and to recover from the physical, mental, emotional, \n     and spiritual trauma associated with their victimization.\n       (8) Human traffickers use many physical and psychological \n     techniques to control their victims, including the use of \n     violence or threats of violence against the victim or the \n     victim's family, isolation from the public, isolation from \n     the victim's family and religious or ethnic communities, \n     language and cultural barriers, shame, control of the \n     victim's possessions, confiscation of passports and other \n     identification documents, and threats of arrest, deportation, \n     or imprisonment if the victim attempts to reach out for \n     assistance or to leave.\n       (9) Although laws to prosecute perpetrators of human \n     trafficking and to assist and protect victims of human \n     trafficking have been enacted in the United States, awareness \n     of the issues surrounding human trafficking by those people \n     most likely to come into contact with victims is essential \n     for effective enforcement because the techniques that \n     traffickers use to keep their victims enslaved severely limit \n     self-reporting.\n       (10) The effort by individuals, businesses, organizations, \n     and governing bodies to promote the observance of the \n     National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness on January 11 of \n     each year represents one of the many examples of the ongoing \n     commitment in the United States to raise awareness of and to \n     actively oppose human trafficking.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of Congress \n     that Congress supports the goals and ideals of observing the \n     National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness on January 11 of \n     each year and all other efforts to raise awareness of and \n     opposition to human trafficking.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1457.

Res. 223\n\n       Whereas the United States Government established the \n     American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of \n     Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas in 1943 to \n     promote and coordinate the protection and salvage of works of \n     art and cultural and historical monuments and records in \n     countries occupied by Allied armies during World War II;\n       Whereas the American Commission for the Protection and \n     Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas is \n     also known as the Roberts Commission, in honor of its \n     chairman, Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts;\n       Whereas, in connection with the establishment of the \n     Roberts Commission, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives \n     program (MFAA) was established under the Civil Affairs and \n     Military Government Sections of the United States Armed \n     Forces;\n       Whereas the establishment of the Roberts Commission and the \n     MFAA provided an example for other countries, working in \n     conjunction with the United States, to develop similar \n     programs, and more than 100 foreign MFAA personnel, \n     representing at least seventeen countries, contributed to \n     this international effort;\n       Whereas the MFAA was comprised of both men and women, \n     commissioned officers and civilians, who were appointed or \n     volunteered to serve as representatives of the Roberts \n     Commission and as the official guardians of some of the \n     world's greatest artistic and cultural treasures;\n       Whereas members of the MFAA, called the ``Monuments Men'', \n     often joined frontline military forces and some even lost \n     their lives in combat during World War II;\n\n[[Page S7270]]\n\n       Whereas, during World War II and for years following the \n     Allied victory, members of the MFAA worked tirelessly to \n     locate, identify, catalogue, restore, and repatriate \n     priceless works of art and irreplaceable cultural artifacts, \n     including masterpieces by Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, \n     and Vermeer, that had been stolen or sequestered by the Axis \n     powers;\n       Whereas the heroic actions of the MFAA in saving priceless \n     works of art and irreplaceable cultural artifacts for future \n     generations cannot be overstated, and set a moral precedent \n     and established standards, practices, and procedures for the \n     preservation, protection, and restitution of artistic and \n     cultural treasures in future armed conflicts;\n       Whereas members of the MFAA went on to become renowned \n     directors and curators of preeminent international cultural \n     institutions, including the National Gallery of Art, the \n     Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the \n     Toledo Museum of Art, and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, as \n     well as professors at institutions of higher education, \n     including Harvard University, Yale University, Princeton \n     University, New York University, Williams College, and \n     Columbia University;\n       Whereas other members of the MFAA were founders, \n     presidents, and members of associations such as the New York \n     City Ballet, the American Association of Museums, the \n     American Association of Museum Directors, the Archaeological \n     Institute of America, the Society of Architectural \n     Historians, the American Society of Landscape Architects, the \n     National Endowment for the Humanities, and the National \n     Endowment for the Arts, as well as respected artists, \n     architects, musicians, and archivists; and\n       Whereas members of the MFAA have never been collectively \n     honored for their service and contributions to humanity, and \n     they are deserving of the utmost acknowledgment, gratitude, \n     and recognition, in particular the 12 known Monuments Men who \n     are still alive: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the men and women who served in the \n     Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program (MFAA) under the \n     Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the United \n     States Armed Forces for their heroic role in the \n     preservation, protection, and restitution of monuments, works \n     of art, and other artifacts of inestimable cultural \n     importance in Europe and Asia during and following World War \n     II;\n       (2) recognizes that without their dedication and service, \n     many more of the world's artistic and historic treasures \n     would have been destroyed or lost forever amidst the chaos \n     and destruction of World War II;\n       (3) acknowledges that the detailed catalogues, \n     documentation, inventories, and photographs developed and \n     compiled by MFAA personnel during and following World War II \n     have made and continue to make possible the restitution of \n     stolen works of art to their rightful owners; and\n       (4) commends and extols the members of the MFAA for \n     establishing a precedent for action to protect cultural \n     property in the event of armed conflict, and by their action \n     setting a standard not just for one country, but for people \n     of all nations to acknowledge and uphold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/06/senate-section/article/S7270-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 7, 2007\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
