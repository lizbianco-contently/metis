First, this gas crisis is really a crisis. If someone in \nLas Vegas, for example, becomes concerned, as many people are, about \nhow much it costs to drive to work every day, there are things that can \nbe done. Maybe they can carpool, maybe there is public transportation. \nAt least there are some alternatives. If you live in rural Nevada, the \nproblem becomes a little more difficult, because you have to drive such \nlong distances. But there are ways that extra travel can be avoided. If \nyou are a mother or father, taking children to soccer games or \nbasketball games, there is a way you can avoid that by going with your \nneighbor, by working out arrangements so more than one family goes in a \ncar.\n  But if you are a senior citizen on a fixed income, and you see winter \napproaching, there are no alternatives. The alternatives are very \nbleak. If you cannot afford the fuel in your tank or heating oil in the \nNortheast, it is very difficult. You are subject to freezing and \ngetting sick. That is why we have to do something with LIHEAP.\n  I have had Democrats and I have had Republicans come to me: When are \nyou going to do something on LIHEAP? So I have a couple of unanimous \nconsents I am going ask on LIHEAP.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6879-7", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6879-S6880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUESTS--S. 3186\n\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, I understand the \ndistinguished majority leader and the distinguished Republican leader \nare going to be discussing a process by which amendments might be \nallowed to this important piece of legislation. Therefore, pending \nresolution of that, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I certainly understand that.\n  I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 882, S. 3268.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (S. 3268) to amend the \n     Commodities Exchange Act to prevent excessive speculation \n     with respect to energy commodities, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I hope matters can be arranged today so we \ncan move to this without having to try to invoke cloture again. This \nwould be the 83rd or 84th time we would have to do that. I hope we can \nwork something out.\n  I have said, I say again today: Is speculation the only problem with \nhigh gas prices? No. But it is a problem. Everyone acknowledges that. \nThat is evidenced by the fact that the Republican part of the energy \npackage has a provision in there dealing with speculation. So I hope if \nthe Republicans, when they look at the speculation bill that we have \nintroduced, if there is a way that can be changed, we will be happy to \nwork with them.\n  I would be happy to continue discussions with the minority to \ndetermine how we can proceed through this to see what amendments need \nto be offered.\n  One of the things I want to make sure everyone understands, I have \nbeen obviously here a long time, more than a quarter of a century. And \nduring my tenure here in the Senate, it has always been, with rare \nexception, when we get to a bill, whether you have a Republican \nmajority leader or a Democratic majority leader, you find out what \namendments people are interested in offering and take a look at those \namendments. We look at theirs, they look at ours. This does not mean \nyou have to approve or disapprove of the amendments. But there needs to \nbe an idea to find out if this is worth the time of the majority or \nminority in entering into this debate.\n  So I hope we can work out something. It is extremely important that \nwe do something on speculation and other issues relating to energy, \nbecause it is a problem.\n  Madam President, I am so sorry, these scripts are prepared and \nsometimes I do not look up to see--on our side we have 11 women now in \nthe Senate.\n  I commented to my wife today, now in our family we do not do \n``short'' jokes, about people being short, because my wife is 5 feet \ntall, I have a son who is 5 feet 2 inches, and a boy who is 6 feet 2 \ninches. And we do not do short jokes.\n\n  We were very busy here yesterday, and I looked to the back of the \nChamber, and there were Patty Murray and Barbara Boxer, both about 5 \nfeet tall, back there talking, I am sure scheming as to what they were \ngoing to do to get something done.\n  This place has changed so much in the years I have been in the \nSenate. When I came here, we had Barbara Mikulski. Now, of course, we \nhave, just on the Democratic side alone, 11 Democratic Senators who are \nwomen. And without any qualifications, this Senate is such a much \nbetter place because of women.\n  Men and women are different. They have, at least in my opinion, \ndifferent thought processes and they have different abilities. So, \nanyway, I am sorry if I referred to the Chair as ``Mr. President'' when \nI know that the Senator from Arkansas is one of the fine Members of \nCongress, having served in the House and in the Senate, and what a \npleasure it is to work with her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6880-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, the \nranking member, Senator Specter, wishes a block of time for Senators to \nspeak. He would agree if the distinguished majority leader would agree \nto modify his unanimous-consent request. Senator Specter would agree to \ndebate from noon to 3:00 today with the votes to follow.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am not going to agree to that \nmodification; I will tell you why.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the hue and cry of the Republicans is that \nwe do more judges. We wanted to do more judges. I say to my friend, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, we have lots of time on the \nfloor. The American public sees it all the time, where we are in quorum \ncalls. Anytime we are in a quorum call, with rare exception, Senators \ncan come and ask that it be called off and proceed to speak for as long \nas they want.\n  We have a number of things we need to do today. There is going to be \na conversation on energy. And I recognize there are some problems with \nthe economy. Housing is a difficult problem. Energy is a difficult \nproblem, as are gas prices and global warming, education. But I am \ntelling you, I cannot ever remember going home and someone coming up to \nme and saying: Could you guys do some more judges? We need to take care \nof this judges problem.\n  As Senator Lott said when he was the majority leader, and I am \nrepeating my friend Senator Lott's statement: Frankly, judges are not a \nbig issue as it relates to the other problems we are facing here in \nAmerica today.\n  So I say, if the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee wants to \ncome and talk for 3 hours, he can do it on his own time. There is lots \nof time here. We have made an offer giving reasonable time to confirm \ntwo judges, and we are happy to do that. An hour is certainly more time \nthan is normally taken. And if Senator Specter wants to come and talk \nabout the plight of the American judiciary system, he can do that, but \nI wish to get these two judges approved.\n  If they are not going to agree to that, we are not going to do the \njudges. It is the Republicans' call.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6880-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, after the last election in 2006, the \nDemocrats gained control of both the House and Senate. With that \nvictory comes responsibility; that is, to manage the agenda in a way \nthat addresses America's most urgent priorities. Unfortunately, we have \nseen a record that does not reflect well and, perhaps, is one reason \nwhy poll numbers for the Congress are at a historic low. The American \npeople, according to the latest Rasmussen and Gallup Polls I have seen, \nhave given Congress the lowest ratings since polling began. One might \nask, why is that? It is something we should all be concerned about.\n  First, we know it took 145 days until we finally passed a \nreauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Thanks to \nthe good work of Senators Rockefeller and Bond on a bipartisan basis, \nthey came up with a good bill. Unfortunately, we dawdled for 145 days \non our ability to gather intelligence by listening to communications \nbetween foreign terror subjects. We waited for 145 days to finally get \nthat done. Thankfully, we finally did. The rest of the record is not as \ngood as even that. For 604 days, the Colombia Free Trade Agreement has \nbeen left pending. In Texas, we sell $2.3 billion worth of agricultural \ngoods and manufactured goods to Colombia each year. It bears a tariff \nbecause Congress has refused to take up, principally because of the \nSpeaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, the Colombian Free Trade Agreement \nthat would remove those barriers to American goods being sold in \nColombia. Unfortunately, it is not a two-way street, because Colombian \ngoods bear no tariff coming into the United States. This is an example \nof the congressional inaction shooting American agriculture and the \nmanufacturing sector in the foot when it comes to their ability to \ncompete in a global economy, due to mismanagement of the agenda.\n  For 749 days, judicial nominees have been waiting for an up-or-down \nvote on the Senate floor. I disagree with the distinguished majority \nleader. Judges do matter. People need access to courts. We might as \nwell put a padlock on the front door of the courthouse if we are not \ngoing to confirm well-qualified judicial nominees to serve. Whether it \nis victims of crime who need access to the courts or a small \nbusinessman or woman who has a civil dispute they need resolved in a \ncourt of law, those people are being denied access to justice because \nwe are not confirming enough judges nominated by the President.\n  Finally, it has been 815 days since Speaker Pelosi, before she ran \nfor her current position, said Democrats, if elected and given the \nresponsibility and the privilege of serving as leaders of the Congress, \nwould come up with a commonsense plan to relieve prices of gasoline at \nthe pump. Back when she assumed control of the House and when Democrats \nassumed control of the Senate, gasoline was $2.33 a gallon. Today it is \n$4.11, and we are still waiting for that commonsense plan to relieve \nthe pain at the pump.\n  It is no secret the price of energy is driving up the price of all \nsorts of commodities, including food. I recently was at a food bank in \nHouston where they said the demand for their services to provide food \nto people who can't otherwise provide for themselves has gone through \nthe roof because the cost of food has gone up, along with the cost of \ngasoline and energy.\n  We want to try to work with our colleagues on the other side. I hope \nwe can on this Energy bill the majority leader has brought to the \nfloor. But it only addresses a narrow aspect of the problem, \nspeculation on the commodities futures market. We need a comprehensive \nbill to deal with the law of supply and demand and to acknowledge that \nCongress has been part of the problem and not part of the solution by \nimposing moratoria on development of oil and gas reserves on the Outer \nContinental Shelf for 27 years. Last year, when Congress put a ban on \ndevelopment of the oil shale in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah, Congress \nbecame part of the problem and not part of the solution, when it comes \nto producing more oil domestically and relying less on imported oil \nfrom the Middle East.\n  I have been fascinated by the Presidential campaigns, the slogans the \ndifferent parties have adopted. I know we have seen Senator Obama say \n``Yes, we can'' and talk about change. But unfortunately, the answer \nfrom our friends on the other side of the aisle, when it comes to a \ncommonsense energy policy, when it comes to bringing down the price of \noil by producing more American supply, seems to be: No, we can't.\n  We would love to work with our friends on the other side of the aisle \nto say, yes, we can address the needs of the American people and help \nrelieve some of the pain they are suffering at the pump. But every time \nwe bring up an energy proposal, whether it is on nuclear energy, clean \ncoal, offshore exploration, oil shale or ANWR, it seems we get an \nanswer of no. The so-called energy bills our friends on the other side \nof the aisle have proposed do not produce one drop of additional energy \nor one kilowatt of additional electricity. How can you call that an \nenergy policy?\n  The new energy produced as a result of our friends on the other side \nsaying no, instead of yes, to bipartisan efforts to solve the problems \nhas been no new energy produced. Our friend, Senator Menendez from New \nJersey, said we need to talk less and act more. I would agree with \nthat. We need to talk less and act more. Unfortunately, what we have \nreceived so far is a lot of talk and no action. We need action to help \nbring down the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  Republicans believe we need a comprehensive policy that conserves \nenergy and eliminates waste. Recently, I was in Tyler, TX, at a \nBrookshire Grocery, where they have modified their tractor-trailer rigs \nto use less diesel and modified the speed at which they drive. They are \nreducing consumption of the skyrocketing prices of diesel. We can \nconserve and use less, but we also need to find more. It makes no \nsense, as some have suggested, that we ought to sue OPEC to get them to \nopen the spigot even wider so we can send more money overseas to the \nMiddle East and to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. \nThat makes no sense whatsoever, to pass higher tax burdens on those \npeople who produce domestic energy. We tried that back in the 1980s \nduring the Carter Presidency. All it did was drive down domestic \nproduction and drive up foreign imports. Eventually, as we all know, \nhigher taxes get passed on to the consumer. That is not an answer.\n  We believe the answer to our energy problems is to find more and use \nless. As we travel this bridge to a clean energy future, we know we \nneed more renewable fuels--wind energy, solar--to develop electricity. \nYes, we need biofuels, but we have to work through the problem of using \nfood for fuel that has contributed to higher food prices. We need a \nbalanced energy policy.\n  We implore the distinguished majority leader not to try to check the \nbox to try to say we have done something, when, in fact, we have done \nnothing to address high prices at the pump, and to work with us to \nallow us to increase supply of domestic energy. We could produce as \nmany as 3 million additional barrels of oil a day from American \nsources, if Congress would simply get out of the way, lift the \nmoratoria, and allow that exploration and production to begin. If we \ndid that, it would send an important signal to the commodities futures \nmarkets that Congress is not going to stand in the way and that more \nsupply will be available in the future. I believe it would have a \ndramatic impact and a dramatic reduction on the price of future \ncontracts for\n\n[[Page S6882]]\n\noil, much as we saw the President's announcement that he was lifting \nthe executive moratorium on offshore exploration seemed to have a \ndramatic impact in one day, lowering the price of oil by about $8.\n  We ask, as respectfully and earnestly as we know how, the majority \nleader not to make this another political exercise but to work with us \nto try to create a real solution. It would reflect well on all of us, \nRepublicans and Democrats, and we would see our basement-level \npopularity ratings go up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise to talk about the issue of gas \nprices. As I have done over the last several weeks, I wish to read a \ncouple of letters I have received from Georgians. I know everybody in \nhere is similar to me. You have thousands and thousands of these. But \nthis shows how critically important this particular issue is to every \nsingle American.\n  Scott Needling of McDonough, GA, writes:\n\n       Senator Chambliss: I'm fed up with Congress ignoring the \n     will of the American people. Stop playing politics, and act \n     on the will of the people. We have been demanding that you \n     drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil. We need other \n     resource avenues that the last three administrations [have \n     not] addressed. Stop the partisan politics and pass the will \n     of the people. The American people do not want a socialistic \n     society, period. Fix the problem.\n\n  That is a very frustrated constituent.\n  Robin Lasseter of Tifton, GA, writes:\n\n       Senator Chambliss: Please do something about the gas \n     prices. I am a stay at home mom and with raising a family on \n     one income, the price of gas is cutting us short on our \n     needs. Something needs to be done soon. We are having to cut \n     corners in a lot of different places in order to afford gas \n     to and from work. Everything is increasing except wages. We \n     both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars, \n     but the money we bring in just isn't stretching far enough.\n\n  This is a sample of the issues facing real people out there and they \nare looking to Congress for relief. I just left an Energy Committee \nhearing or roundtable discussion. The Presiding Officer was also there. \nThere were two energy experts there. I wish to read several bullet \npoints that were mentioned by these individuals who deal with this \nissue every single day and have a long history of studying it.\n  The first gentleman said, at the bottom line, supply and demand is \nthe cause of the increase in prices today, but it is a complex issue. \nIt ranges from the Iranian risk factor, all the way to the markets. He \nalso said the cost of exploration has doubled in the last 4 years. The \nreason is a shortage of labor, a shortage of engineers, and a shortage \nof steel. In the markets, while speculation is a hot topic and \ntransparency is a good thing, why have commodities risen? His answer \nwas: First of all, the value of the dollar; secondly, oil is a good \ninvestment, and it is a good hedge against inflation.\n  The second gentleman said that between 2003 and 2005, there has been \na shock of increased demand and decreased supply. As a result of that, \nthe excess capacity of oil on hand by oil-producing countries has been \nexhausted. He said there are fears that new fields are not coming \nonline. There are fears there is disruption in the marketplace. Between \n2004 and today in the market, there has not been enough supply. There \nis barely an increasing amount of supply each and every year. He said \noil is now a financial asset, that this happened sometime not in recent \nweeks or months but back in 2006 and that the primary driver of the \nincrease in oil prices is the value of the dollar, just like the first \nspeaker commented. He said people are looking for a place to invest. \nPension funds are looking for a place to invest. They are looking for a \nway to hedge against the value of the dollar. Lastly, the increase in \ndemand, which we have seen in the United States over the last couple \nyears, is not being met by our global partners.\n  I say this to indicate to the American people how complex this \nproblem is. We, as policymakers, have to take our time to make sure \nthat we get it right with respect to whatever type of policy we set \nwith legislation.\n  I think there are four issues we have to think about with respect to \ntrying to find a solution to gas prices.\n  First of all, I do not think there is any question that we have to \nhave more domestic production of oil. Today, we depend upon foreign \nimports for 62 percent of our petroleum needs. That has gotten way out \nof bounds. So it is imperative that we look for additional resources \ninside the United States. We have those resources. The resources are \navailable from different assets. Some are controversial. Some are not \ncontroversial. We as policymakers have an obligation to find those \nareas for domestic exploration that we can get done in the short term \nand make sure we move that balance away from 62 percent to certainly \nsomething that is much lower and much more reasonable.\n  Secondly, from a gas supply standpoint--not oil supply, a gas supply \nstandpoint--we simply have to have more gas refined in this country. \nThere may be some oil companies that do not have excess capacity. They \nmay be producing all they can produce. We need to make sure there are \nincentives out there, as we have on the books today, to incentivize \nadditional production. If they do not have excess capacity, we need to \nmake sure they are able to build new refineries. We have not seen a \nrefinery built in the United States in the last 25 years. Certainly, we \nknow what has happened with demand for gasoline in the last 25 years.\n  The third thing we need to do is continue down the road of research \nand development of alternative fuels, alternative fuels such as ethanol \nand biodiesel. These, again, are not the total answer to the problem, \nbut we have taken steps in this body to make sure we have an increase \nin the supply of alternative fuels, particularly ethanol, over the next \nseveral years.\n  In my home State--which has never been an ethanol-producing State; \nthus, we have never been an ethanol user--we now have two ethanol \nproduction plants under construction. In the farm bill we just passed, \nwe greatly expanded the energy title. I am very proud of that energy \ntitle we put in place in the current farm bill because here is what it \ndoes: We recognize that we need more production of ethanol in this \ncountry. We also recognize that, with the mandates we have put in place \nover the last couple of years, we have had some unintended consequences \nthat have arisen.\n  We have 101 ethanol-producing facilities in this country today. We \nhave an additional 100 that are either under construction or are on the \ndrawing board to be completed within the next 14 to 16 months. All but \ntwo of those ethanol-producing facilities are resourced with corn. So, \nas a result of the mandates we have put in place, the demand for corn \nhas risen for the production of ethanol, to the point where we are now \nseeing food prices increase.\n  The price of food at the grocery store today, based on the increase \nin commodity prices, is truly not reflected yet. The increase in food \nprices we are seeing today, in my opinion, is solely the result of \nadditional transportation costs or energy costs. This fall, when our \nmanufacturers of food products start taking in new commodities at the \nnew prices, that is when you are really going to see an increase in the \ncost of food.\n  As a result of that, in the farm bill, when we looked at this issue, \nwe said: We don't need to incentivize the additional production of \nalternative fuels from corn-based ethanol-producing facilities. What we \nneed to do is to incentivize the production of ethanol from alternative \nsources, such as cellulosic products.\n  In Georgia, we cannot grow corn in the quantities they do in the \nMidwest. We have a hotter climate, a longer growing season. Our soil is \nnot quite as rich, and we do not have the dependable rain resource they \nhave. But there is one thing we can grow like nobody else in the \ncountry; that is, a pine tree.\n  The two exceptions to the 201 facilities I mentioned earlier--one \nlocated in Colorado, one located in my home State of Georgia--are going \nto be manufacturing ethanol from cellulosic products. In our case, in \nGeorgia, it is going to be from pine trees. That is the type of \ninnovation and creation we have provided for in the farm bill, and it \nis part of the equation we need to have in place as we move forward.\n  There is one other area, and that is the area of conservation. We \nsimply have to move down the road of making sure we have alternative \nvehicles available for those individuals who really\n\n[[Page S6883]]\n\nwant to implement conservation measures from a personal household \nperspective. Electric cars, battery-operated cars--those types of \nvehicles need to be available.\n  We have a bipartisan effort underway to help solve this problem. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with Republicans and Democrats to \nsee a resolution of this issue regarding gas prices.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator's time is expired.\n  The senior Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am grateful to the majority leader for \nmoving to a discussion of energy. Energy is one of the most important \nsubjects I hear about when I go back to Missouri.\n  Americans are suffering record pain at the pump. They want help now. \nIt is clear, if you are listening to the people at home, they are \nsaying: We are all suffering. Farmers, truckers, families, and small \nbusinesses are suffering from record-high prices. Farmers are telling \nme their costs for farming and transportation have gone up. Nitrogen, \ndrying--those costs have gone up. Truckers, small trucking company \noperators are laying off people. They are shutting down because the \nprices are so high and they are not able to pass along all the full \ncosts. Families are telling me they have had to change their family \nbudgets, their plans, because their budgets will not accommodate it. \nThey will not accommodate $4-plus gas, going to $5. They are telling \nme--they are telling us--stop fighting, stop the gimmicks, stop half-\nmeasures. Do something now that will bring gas prices down.\n  So this morning, I ask my colleagues in the Senate: Let's get real \nabout lowering gas prices. Any real plan that has a chance to lower gas \nprices must increase production, increase conservation, look at \nspeculation and marketplace impacts. That is what I support. That is \nthe Gas Price Reduction Act that more than 40 of my colleagues and I \nhave introduced, and we hope more will join us.\n  It is like a three-legged stool: without all three legs, it will not \nstand up, it will not pass the test. Too many plans, such as the \nDemocratic leadership's speculation-only bill, have only one leg. We \nknow how long a one-legged stool will hold up.\n  Fundamentally, we must find more and use less, as the Senators from \nTexas and Georgia said. It is economics 101. It is amazing how well the \nAmerican people out in the real world--where we live when we are not \nhere working--understand that when prices are going up so rapidly, that \nis because demand is outstripping supply. We need to find more oil to \nrelieve the pressure and get prices down.\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act will supply more oil. Right now, there \nare at least 18 billion barrels of oil waiting for us off our Atlantic \nand Pacific coasts. Many think there are many times more. That is a 10-\nyear supply we are blocking from ourselves by our legislative action. \nThe Gas Price Reduction Act will open those offshore areas and allow us \nto put American oil to use helping America.\n  For those who say it will take years to get, they ignore the \nimmediate price-lowering effect of the news of new supplies. It \nhappened this past week. Since the President announced the suspension \nof the Presidential moratorium on offshore drilling earlier this week, \nprices have fallen $10. It is now up to Congress to do the same thing \nand bring immediate and long-term, lasting relief to the American \nfamilies and workers. The fact that we do that will bring prices down.\n  For those States concerned about opening and drilling off their \nshores, we allow States to opt in or opt out of the program. If \nCalifornia does not want to participate, that is fine, but that should \nnot block the people of the State of Virginia from saying: We want to \nexplore for oil and gas and share in the revenues and provide our \npeople the benefits of a greater supply, which will bring the prices \ndown.\n  For those who are concerned about the environment--and I hope all \nare; we should be--one only needs to look at how environmentally safe \nmodern oil-drilling technology has become. We put in all kinds of \nstandards and controls. I have seen oil drilling above the Arctic \nCircle, at Prudhoe Bay. The caribou, the birds, the flora flourish. \nEven the mosquitoes love it. It has caused no environmental damage. \nPlease note that when we compare our environmental standards to those \nin other countries, our standards for development, exploration, and \nrefining are much higher than other countries.\n  Some people want to go beg OPEC to produce more. Does anybody think \nthey are going to be concerned about the air emissions, which affect \nthe entire world, as we are in the United States? Do you believe \nVenezuela or Iran is going to have the same high standards we have? No, \nthey will not.\n  Here in the United States, the terrible tragedy of Katrina at least \nproved that modern offshore drilling is environmentally safe. There was \nno significant spillage of oil when the hurricane blew over thousands \nof oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. It shut them down, drove the prices \nup, with no environmental damage.\n  Some say we need to force the oil companies to use leases we have \nbefore we issue new leases. They want to say: Use it or lose it. Well, \nwelcome to the party. Guess what. That requirement is already in the \nleases. The leases are 6, 8, 10 years, and if they do not find any oil, \nthen they go back to the Government. Maybe somebody else can. But they \npay. They take the chance. They go into areas they have not explored, \nnot done any seismic testing. If they do not find it, then they do not \ndo it. That is the reason they call it exploration, because a lease is \nno guarantee that oil is actually present. They have to take an eyeball \nlook at it and guess. Only after they sign the lease do they have the \npermission to begin seismic exploration. There is a lot of land. The \noil people tell me they have a lot of goat pastures. Goat pastures are \noil leases which appear to be good but are great for raising goats \nbecause they won't produce any oil. Most of these leases show no \nprospects for oil that is worth extracting.\n  Now, I would be happy to lease them a few acres in my backyard. I \nwould be happy to have them look for it. Unfortunately, we have not had \nany history of having oil there, but I would be happy to have them \nexplore for it. If they find it there, I would welcome their drilling \nin my backyard.\n  But instead of real plans to supply the American people with \nsignificant amounts of oil, we get half-measures that will do little, \nalthough calling them half-measures is probably giving them too much \ncredit.\n  One plan from Democrats in the House is to raid the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve and divert 10 percent of its volume to consumers--70 \nmillion barrels. Putting aside that the Reserve is for national \nemergencies, such as in times of war, that plan would only provide 3\\1/\n2\\ days' worth of oil. We consume over 20 million barrels a day.\n  What would have made a difference would have been if President \nClinton had signed the authorization we passed in Congress in 1995 to \nexplore in ANWR. The best estimates are--well, he said at the time: It \nwill not do anything for 10 years. That was 1995. Ten years was up in \n2005, and we would have been getting at least a million, and probably \nmore, barrels a day.\n  But we have introduced the Gas Price Reduction Act that would provide \nstruggling families and workers the equivalent of 10 years of new oil \nsupplies versus the 3 days of new supplies from raiding the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  The facts are clear: Only real relief will come from the Gas Price \nReduction Act.\n  Of course, there are other things we can and should do to cut our oil \nuse down the road and ensure there is no abuse. We are already using \nrenewable fuels, lots of corn ethanol and beginning soy diesel. When we \nget the project right, I agree with my colleague from Georgia that \ncellulosic ethanol will be a help. But corn ethanol is not the reason \nwhy food prices are up. Eighty percent of the price of food is off \nfarm. Corn production went up by 2.6 billion bushels last year. Only \n900 million went into ethanol. Stop scapegoating ethanol. It is part of \nthe solution, not part of the problem.\n\n  I will reserve the rest of my remarks for later, and I appreciate the \nchance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  We have before the Senate in the next couple of days a number of \nimportant pieces of legislation, but one of the debates going on right \nnow in the Senate and beyond across the country is the response by the \nSenate and by the administration on housing. In particular, we have a \nraging debate about what to do about the two so-called mortgage giants, \nFreddie and Fannie, as we know them by their acronyms.\n  There is no question that these two entities play a substantial role \nin what has been happening to our housing market. By one estimate, they \nhold half of the value of all the mortgages in the United States of \nAmerica--trillions and trillions of dollars--by one estimate as much as \n$5 trillion. We have to apply a lot of scrutiny and exercise the kind \nof due diligence as it pertains to the administration's proposal to \nshore up Fannie and Freddie. It is vitally important. However, I think \nthe Congress has to be able to do two or three things at once.\n  We have to be able, as we are applying the kind of due diligence and \nthe kind of review the taxpayers expect us to provide--and we should do \nthat. There is a long way to go. We can't just sign off and say the \nTreasury Department and the administration or any other entity can do \nwhatever they want and we will just rubberstamp it. We have to make \nsure the taxpayers' interests are protected, but while we are doing \nthat, we have to get housing legislation passed.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, not just because of the families in \nOhio and Pennsylvania and across the country who are suffering from the \nroot of our economic trouble, which is one word, ``housing,'' or the \nproblems with housing--as he knows, this legislation has been held up. \nThere are some in Washington who are using this debate about scrutiny \nof the Fannie and Freddie proposal, scrutiny about taxpayer interests, \nwhich are legitimate and real, using that debate as a way to slow down \nthe bipartisan housing legislation. I think we have to make sure we \ncommit ourselves to a path over the next couple of days and do it with \na sense of urgency about what is happening in America today because no \nmatter what we do on due diligence with regard to the mortgage \ncompanies, if we don't provide relief to families across America on the \nquestion of housing, we will not be doing our jobs.\n  I think the people across this country, just as they hope we do on \ngas prices--they certainly believe that on the price of gas, or any \nother prices rising for them, especially on the question of housing--\nexpect us to get something done. So far, there are people in this body \nwho want to slow things down. So I think we can provide the kind of \noversight and due diligence for this proposal with the mortgage giants. \nWe can provide that oversight but at the same time move forward with \nhousing legislation.\n  The fact is, for a lot of Americans, this is not some remote, \ntheoretical question. Every day in America--every weekday, because the \ncourthouses are not open on the weekends--every weekday, by the latest \nestimates, 8,400 to 8,500 enter the nightmare of foreclosure. We can \ndebate a lot of theoretical issues, but unless we focus on that central \nreality for families in America, we are going to miss the boat. So all \nof those families every day--8,500 families every day--are entering the \nnightmare of foreclosure.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, Senator Brown, Senator Schumer, and I, \nthe three of us, a long time ago, way back in the spring of 2007--more \nthan a year ago--put on the table the Borrowers Protection Act, which \nwas a way to deal with this problem early, to say to mortgage \noriginators and mortgage brokers: You are not being regulated. You are \ncausing a good bit of this problem, if not most of the problem. We are \ngoing to regulate your conduct so that if you have a mortgage \ntransaction and you are a broker and you are part of that and there is \na homeowner, a family sitting in front of you, we are going to make \nsure you escrow for taxes and insurance, for example. It is not a \nradical idea, but they were not doing it. We are going to provide more \nscrutiny of the kind of activity that you have as a mortgage broker. We \nare going to make sure if a mortgage broker wants to make money and \nwants to bring families into a transaction that they have more \ndisclosure; that they tell that family sitting in front of them more \ninformation about the mortgage documents, about the interest rate, and \nwhat this family is signing up for.\n  That legislation has been in front of the Senate for far too long \nnow. That kind of bipartisan approach to this crisis is what we need \nmore of.\n  I have worked with Senator Martinez on the other side of the aisle on \nappraiser independence. We have too many appraisers in these high-end \nmortgages that were in some cases committing fraud and in other cases \nnot providing enough information. We have to make sure when someone \ndoes an appraisal, they are truly independent.\n  What our legislation called for was having two appraisals to force \nappraisers to be more independent. Senator Specter and I have worked \ntogether in Pennsylvania to promote a great idea in the city of \nPhiladelphia. Sometimes all the great ideas aren't in Washington, as we \nwell know.\n  A judge in Philadelphia, Judge Darnell Jones, a distinguished jurist \ncame up on his own, working with people in the city, and then supported \nby Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia with funding, with a program that says: \nWe may not be able to legally force people in the marketplace to do \ncertain things, if you have a contract between a lender and a borrower, \nbut we can at least say that before a foreclosure moves forward, you \nhave to have some mediation, some discussion, some meeting between the \nlender and the borrower. The borrower has to do something. They can't \njust hope for the best. They have to be able to commit themselves to \npaying back the mortgage, and the lender has to give as well.\n  These kinds of ideas in the city of Philadelphia and across the \ncountry should inform what we do here. So Senator Specter and I have \nworked to promote foreclosure mitigation. The Presiding Officer knows \nforeclosure counseling is not just a good thing to do; it is not just a \ncouple of hundred million dollars that we have been able to put into \nlegislation and become part of our law--and we need more money--but the \nPresiding Officer knows how important that money is to get dollars into \nthe hands of people and entities across the country, most of them \nnonprofit organizations that understand not just how to work with the \nborrower, to work with the family when they are signing those \ncomplicated documents that mean they have to enter into an agreement \nwhere they have to pay money back over a long period of time. It is \nvery complicated. Even if you are sophisticated in finance matters, it \nis pretty complicated.\n  This foreclosure counseling money will give dollars to entities \nacross the country to work with families, gain the families' trust, and \nthen work with the borrowers when they are entering into transactions. \nWe have to do more with foreclosure counseling.\n  So I think on a whole series of fronts, there is bipartisan work \nbeing done in the Senate. There are good ideas on the table from \ncommunities across the country and from people in Washington. We have \nto continue to work together in a bipartisan way. The worst thing we \ncould do is stop the train from moving down the track on getting \nhousing legislation passed because we are having a debate about how \nmuch scrutiny or oversight or review there is to a Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac proposal, the kind of review we should apply to do it. We \ncan do both at the same time.\n  Once in a while the Congress can walk and chew gum at the same time. \nThis is one of those instances where, with the families out there who \nare suffering under the weight of this housing problem, this subprime \nproblem that has been hanging over the country and affecting \ninternational markets and international transactions right now, it is \none of those instances where we have to do everything we can to push \nthis forward.\n  If you are standing in the way of getting housing legislation passed \nand you are using the figleaf or the argument that somehow we have to \napply more scrutiny to Fannie and Freddie, I don't think you are being \nstraight with the American people. We can do both at the same time. We \ncan serve the interests of taxpayers on this proposal and\n\n[[Page S6885]]\n\napply all the scrutiny and due diligence we should, but we also have to \nget something done on housing because the mortgage companies are going \nto do fine no matter what.\n  Fannie and Freddie will do just fine, thank you very much. But if we \ndon't get housing legislation passed, the people who will suffer, as \nthey have already suffered, are families, borrowers, real people out \nthere in places such as Ohio and Pennsylvania and across the country.\n  So I will yield the floor but just reiterate that I urge people on \nboth sides of the aisle to continue to work together, but we cannot \nleave here this summer without dealing with major housing legislation, \nwhich is already in front of us and which is already bipartisan. We \ncan't leave here without doing that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I recently received a letter from a senior \ncitizen named Harriet, from Bartlett, IL, just outside of Chicago. She \ntold the story that last January, when the average high temperature was \nabout 28 degrees, she was sitting at home in a sweater, bundled up in a \nblanket, with the thermostat set at 62 degrees. She had cut back on her \npurchases of vital prescriptions for her stroke medication because she \ndidn't have enough money to pay for her drugs and also heat her home.\n  Unfortunately, Harriet is not alone. Even though we are in the midst \nof summer with the heat outside, we have to be very sensitive to the \nfact that, in a few months, many people across America will face \nfreezing temperatures, and Harriet is one of those people. Seniors \nliving on fixed incomes, working families with limited incomes, and \ndisabled individuals will face recordbreaking energy costs. In the New \nEngland area of our country, they anticipate that heating oil costs \nwill double this winter over last winter. I saw that headline when I \nvisited Maine a few weeks ago.\n  I know this isn't just a problem in the upper Midwest. It affects \nmany parts of the Nation. So when you have this choice between paying \nutility bills and getting the prescriptions you need to stay alive, you \nunderstand how, in desperation, many seniors turn to us in Washington \nand ask for help.\n  These are choices no American should ever be faced with.\n  In 1981, Congress enacted a program called the LIHEAP program, Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program. Today, it helps almost 6 million \npeople across our Nation--low-income families and seniors--to pay their \nhome energy costs--air-conditioning in the summer and heating in the \nwinter. For more than 400,000 people in my State, this means air-\nconditioning during the sweltering 100-degree-plus days, on the worst \ndays.\n  This year, funding isn't enough. A majority of the Americans who are \neligible for LIHEAP don't receive any assistance because this program \nis not adequately funded. For those who do receive it, the average \ngrant pays as little as 18 percent of the cost of that utility bill. \nEnergy costs are going up, and the program's purchasing power continues \nto drop. Utilities are raising power prices by as much as a third--\nsometimes doubling--with the sharpest jump since 1970. In addition, \ntens of thousands of Americans have had their electricity and natural \ngas services cut off. Millions more are facing the danger of losing \ntheir service.\n  Unless we significantly increase LIHEAP, two things will happen: \nFewer Americans will receive the assistance they need to keep their \nhomes warm in the winter and cool in summer; second, those who receive \nassistance will receive less as energy prices soar. I have joined with \n40 of my Senate colleagues, cosponsoring the Warm in Winter, Cool in \nSummer Act, introduced by Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He has been our \nleader on this issue. I commend him for that. The bill is endorsed by \nAARP, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Alliance for \nRural America, the American Corn Growers, and a lot of others. It \nnearly doubles funding for LIHEAP, from $2.5 billion to $5 billion. The \nextra money is needed desperately.\n  This morning, as I understand it, the majority leader, Senator Reid \nof Nevada, on behalf of the Democrats, came to the floor and asked \nunanimous consent that we bring the LIHEAP bill out for consideration. \nAs you will notice, we are not bustling with activity and business on \nthe Senate floor. Senator Reid said let's move to this bill. \nUnfortunately, Senator Cornyn of Texas objected. He blocked a unanimous \nconsent request to pass this critically needed funding for LIHEAP.\n  Senator Cornyn argues that we ought to be talking about lower \ngasoline prices. I don't argue with that. But why are we pitting one \nagainst the other? The people who are going to face desperate \ncircumstances in their homes are going to need help, whether it is air-\nconditioning now or heating in the winter. We should do both. We ought \nto pass this LIHEAP bill on a bipartisan basis, and we ought to also \naddress the energy issues around the cost of gasoline.\n  I don't know why the Republicans blocked this effort to bring the \nLIHEAP bill to the floor. We could have done it today and passed it \ntoday and brought some piece of mind to people across America, such as \nHarriet, who sent me this letter. We also know we are faced with a \ndebate on what to do about gasoline prices.\n  Yesterday, Senator Reid came to the floor and brought a bill I am \ncosponsoring on the issue of speculation. Some of the business experts \nin our country tell us the price of gasoline today and jet fuel and \nheating oil and the cost of a barrel of oil has a lot to do with people \nwho are speculators--folks who are guessing where the prices are going \nto go, which tends to lead the market and even push the market in the \ndirection of higher prices. Now, you might expect that theory coming \nfrom an economics professor or maybe someone on the left of the \npolitical spectrum, but that theory comes from a lot of business \npeople, including folks who are running our airlines today. The CEOs of \nairlines are struggling to survive. They tell us they think speculation \naccounts for up to 30 to 40 percent of the cost of gasoline and jet \nfuel today.\n  There is no rational explanation of what happened in terms of energy \npricing. It is understandable if the price of oil goes up 10 percent \nbecause of some instability in the Middle East--a war or blocking of \nthe Strait of Hormuz or an interruption of pipelines. That would be \nunderstandable. You could say: All right, that is something that would \naffect supply and demand. But we are in the situation where the price \nof oil can go up 10 or 20 percent, or more, for no reason at all--no \nreason at all. Sometimes the only thing they can pinpoint is that some \nanalyst on Wall Street made an announcement at a press conference that \nhe thought the price of a barrel of oil might go up to $200. Lo and \nbehold, it goes up $10 the next day. You think to yourself, something \nis dreadfully wrong.\n  This isn't a question of supply and demand. Something else is at \nwork. So we brought a bill to the floor--or we will, maybe as soon as \ntoday--that addresses speculation. The bill says the agency responsible \nfor overseeing the trading in energy speculation, energy futures, will \nneed more people. The number of trades has gone up 10 times what it was \na few years ago, and they don't have the people to keep an eye on it. \nSo there will be 100 more employees in the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission and more computer technology.\n  We also talk about bringing all these energy speculation markets \nunder one basic disclosure requirement, so we know what is going on. \nThe fact is, when I asked the Acting Chairman of the CFTC, Walter \nLukken, how big this market was in the speculation of oil prices, he \nsaid he could not tell me; he didn't know. The biggest part of this \nmarket is happening outside the public eye and outside any Government \nsupervision or regulation.\n\n[[Page S6886]]\n\n  So this bill that we will bring to the floor will to try to bring \nsome reason to this market of speculation. Speculation is all right if \nit is based on market fundamentals, but if it is a matter of \nmanipulation, it goes too far. So we want this bill to come to the \nfloor. We would like it to be a bipartisan bill. The Republicans said \nthey support it. Let's hope we can do that.\n  The LIHEAP bill ought to be something we can agree to on a bipartisan \nbasis, along with doing something about speculation to bring down \nenergy prices and gasoline prices. Shouldn't both parties agree on \nthat? We can do that as well. There is an issue we are debating. You \ncannot turn the television on recently without seeing President Bush \ntalking about let's drill here or there and open areas for drilling.\n  The suggestion of the administration is our oil companies have \nnowhere to turn to drill for oil, and that is why gasoline prices are \nso high. It turns out that is not true.\n\n  Take a look at this map. Look at the areas in red on this map. This \nis the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. \nThese areas in red are federally owned and controlled areas under lease \nto oil companies, where they are not drilling. In the blue area, they \nare drilling. In the red area, they are not drilling. Look at this \nliteral sea of opportunity for oil, where the oil companies are not \ndrilling. In fact, 68 million acres of land controlled by our \nGovernment has been leased to the oil and gas companies. They believed \nthere is something there. What are they doing with it? It turns out \nthey are only drilling on about a fourth of those acres.\n  So the argument that we need to dramatically increase the acreage for \nopportunities to drill flies in the face of reality. Why aren't the oil \ncompanies drilling on the land they are currently leasing?\n  Today, the House of Representatives is considering a bill called \n``use it or lose it,'' saying to the oil companies: If you are not \ngoing to drill on it, you are going to lose your lease. We will offer \nit to another oil company that might drill on it. So for the President \nand many people in his party to stand and say there is nowhere to turn \nto drill, look at this--all this red area in the Gulf of Mexico. But \nthat isn't it alone. There is also a great deal of land in the United \nStates, onshore, with the same story, Federal land that is leased for \nthe purpose of exploration to oil companies. All the red areas are \nunused today. That is 34.5 million acres onshore, on land, in America, \nwhich is leased by oil companies that they are not exploring at all.\n  The Republicans argue--or at least suggest--they know there is some \ngreat plot of land somewhere that has lots of oil and gas, and we are \nrestraining and restricting the oil and gas companies from exploring \nand producing there. I don't know where that might be. The only one \nthey have pointed to with any specificity is the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge in Alaska. That is 1.5 million acres. We know anything \nyou go after in that pristine area, which has been protected for 15 \nyears, will take 10 or 12 years to put into production and will have an \nimpact of pennies on the price of a barrel of oil. So I am afraid this \nargument falls on its face.\n  There are opportunities to drill right now--plenty of them--68 \nmillion acres' worth--and the oil companies, though they are leasing \nthe land, are standing idly by and not doing it. When you ask why not, \nthey say they have not had a chance to explore these or map these. In \nother words, there is the possibility oil and gas might be there, there \nis speculation there, but if they don't know whether there is oil and \ngas on the lands they are already leasing, how can they argue there is \nsome other area they have never looked at that might have more oil and \ngas? It doesn't follow. It is a pretty weak argument.\n  I think most Americans would agree we cannot drill our way out of \nthis situation. America has 3 percent of the known oil reserves in the \nworld. Each year, we consume 25 percent of the oil produced in the \nworld. We cannot drill our way into lower gas prices. We want to have \nresponsible exploration and production; both parties support that. We \nbelieve these 68 million acres offer that opportunity and the oil \ncompanies have paid for that chance there and they should exercise it. \nBut we need to do more. We need to explore renewable, sustainable \nsources of energy in America.\n  In my State, wind turbines all over downstate Illinois are generating \nelectricity without creating pollution or adding to global warming.\n  In addition, solar panels are being installed and research is going \non at Federal labs so we can use solar power in a way that the next \ngeneration will be able to derive electricity and fuel our economy with \nsources that are not going to create environmental havoc in the years \nto come.\n  We need to look at biomass. We have to look at so many other things. \nBiofuels--we are exploring ethanol now that is based on corn. We are \nnow going to move into a new generation of ethanol that will use \ncornstalks and corncobs, literally, to make the same ethanol so that \nthe kernel of corn can go into food and not be diverted to ethanol. All \nof this is on the horizon, and we should push it forward.\n  We need battery technology. The cars and trucks we are driving today, \nsadly, do not meet the requirements and demand of the energy crisis we \nface. I am saddened that General Motors announced cutbacks in \nemployment in the factories across America. It is a great company which \nis now on hard times. But I have to say in all honesty, they were \nforewarned. They were making these big heavy SUVs and trucks when the \nrest of the world was waking up to the reality that people wanted fuel \nefficiency. I hope they catch up. I want them to catch up. I want \nAmerica to be in the lead again when it comes to cars and trucks.\n  We need to push forward on battery technology so you can plug in the \ncar when you get home at night and get up in the morning and drive 40 \nmiles without ever using a drop of gasoline, so the electricity that is \ngoing to fire up your car is being stored in a battery that is being \ncollected from the Sun during the day. Does it sound like a wild idea?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I close by saying that there are many opportunities for \nus in the area of energy. I hope the Republicans will join us and do \ntwo things: Let us agree to move forward, let us approve LIHEAP so we \ncan get peace of mind to families concerned about heating and air \nconditioning bill. Let us also move forward on speculation. We should \noffer our alternative, Republicans should offer theirs, and then each \noffer an energy bill, give us their best ideas on the Republican side \nand the best ideas on the Democratic side. Let's vote on them. Maybe we \ncan merge some of them. That would be a constructive debate America \nwould like to see.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The junior Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6886-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6886-S6892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me say on the point my friend from \nIllinois made, while there may well be room for dealing with \nspeculation as part of the overall approach to our energy crisis today, \nit is clear that speculation cannot be the only or even a major piece \nof it. Without new production, we are destined to continue to rely on \nforeign sources for our oil and very high oil prices.\n  We will be interested in getting into the debates about the relative \nmerits of different approaches to speculation. But let me talk about a \nlittle different angle to this than has been discussed so far, and that \nis not only the fact that people, when they go to the gas pump, find \nthemselves paying very high prices for oil, which hurts their family \nbudgets and, in many cases, businesses that have to rely on fuel, but \nalso that it is a national security problem for the United States \nbecause of our undue reliance on these other countries.\n  The point I want to make today is this: A lot of these countries have \nthe ability to actually increase the price because of the instability \nthey can create around the world. I think of the Iranians, for example. \nEveryone knows that we get a great deal of our oil from the Persian \nGulf region, that the Strait of Hormuz is the very narrow area\n\n[[Page S6887]]\n\nthrough which about 40 percent of all the oil has to go. Forty percent \nof the world's oil tankers have to exit the Strait of Hormuz as they \nare picking up their oil from the Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, \nand so forth. That creates an opportunity for mischief, and the \nIranians have been very good at exploiting that. Whenever they rattle \ntheir saber, whenever they engage in a naval exercise in that area, or \nwhen, recently, they shoot off missiles to show everybody they can be \ntough guys and throw their weight around in the world, that gives the \nmarkets a lot of jitters, and we saw what happened: The price of oil \nshoots up.\n  Ironically, countries that are no friends of the United States would \ncreate great mischief if they could have an additional reason for this \nbelligerent behavior. It drives up the cost of oil, which is where they \nmake all their money. So they literally have the ability to help \ndictate the price of the commodity that sustains their economy.\n  Iran is not the only country. Russia actually produces more than \nSaudi Arabia. The United States is third. But Russia, as the world's \nlargest oil producer--about 9.84 million barrels per day--has produced \nabout a fourth of the non-OPEC crude oil since 2007. At today's prices, \nthat would be about $1.4 billion per day--think about that--and over \n$500 billion for the year; almost $1.5 billion a day into Russia's \nTreasury.\n  As a result, Russia has been able to do some things that are not in \nthe interests of the United States. They are rearming their military \nwith oil dollars. That is how they are able to afford all of the new \nthings they are doing in terms of their nuclear program, their missile \nprogram, and all of the other things they are doing that are \nantithetical to United States national security interests.\n  Moreover, they have shown no reluctance to use their oil and natural \ngas production as a weapon as well. When countries next to them or even \nfar away that rely on Russian natural gas or oil do something the \nRussians do not like, they simply cut off the supply. And they have \ndone this numerous times. It has much of Europe, which relies on \nRussian natural gas, very jittery because if you make the Russian bear \nmad, he cuts off your source of natural gas and, in some cases, oil. \nThis creates a very unstable and very difficult situation for these \ncountries, and also has the effect of driving up the price of oil and \nnatural gas.\n\n  Because both of these products are fungible; that is to say, they can \nbe produced all around the world and everybody around the world buys \nthem, there is a world market for them. So even though the jitters are \nin the Persian Gulf or in Europe, for example, the price is reflected \nall around the world, and the United States ends up having to pay more \nat the gas pump because these countries can affect the price of the \ncommodity they rely on to fund their government.\n  Recently, it happened to be that Russia shut off oil to the Czech \nRepublic. They have shut off oil or natural gas to other countries in \nEastern Europe, especially when they did not agree with the Russian \nposition on something. They have shut off natural gas supplies during \nthe dead of winter to countries in Eastern Europe that wanted to join \nNATO. Russia says: We don't like that so we will shut you off.\n  The Czech Republic decided it wanted to help the United States and \nitself to be protected against missiles. So they are helping to \nestablish a missile defense base in the Czech Republic. Russia doesn't \nlike it, so half of what is sent from Russia to the Czech Republic is \ncut off.\n  This is the problem of relying on other countries, not to mention a \ncountry such as Venezuela. The United States gets a good deal of its \noil from Venezuela. We all know the head of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, has \ndone everything he can to undermine United States influence in Central \nand South America and does everything he can to get in the face of the \nUnited States. If he wants to affect the price of oil, all he has to do \nis rattle his saber as well.\n  In each of these cases, we have a situation where the price of the \nproduct and the availability of the product is dependent upon positions \nover which we not only have no control but countries that have \ninterests very inimical to ours, and the end result is it costs more \nfor people in the United States for a very necessary product, namely, \nthe oil and natural gas product we use to fuel our economy. This is one \nof the reasons why I say it is a national security issue as well as \naffecting the price at the pump.\n  It is one of the reasons why the United States has to begin to rely \nless on the oil produced in foreign countries and more on oil we can \nproduce right here in the United States. It is not well known, but the \nUnited States is the third largest producer of oil in the world, after \nRussia and Saudi Arabia. We have huge reserves here of which we are not \ntaking advantage. This is one of the reasons why Republicans are \ninsisting that any legislation that comes to the floor dealing with \nthis energy crisis include taking advantage of the resources we have. \nLet's free up these resources. We have them. They can be obtained in a \nvery environmentally sensitive way, and they can help not only to \nreduce the cost of gas in the United States or natural gas but also to \nreduce the ability of other countries around the world to influence \nbehavior in a bad way, such as shutting off the oil or natural gas for \ncustomers of theirs or driving up the cost of oil for everybody else.\n  I got to thinking about this in terms of the taming of the West. One \nof the reasons the United States became such a great country so rapidly \nwas that we bought land with the Louisiana Purchase. We explored the \nWest. We took advantage of natural resources that were in this country, \nand we quickly became a very strong power economically. We had natural \ngas, we had oil, we had minerals--copper and gold and all of the rest. \nWe took advantage of the resources that we had to become a wealthy and \npowerful country.\n  One hundred years ago, we didn't mine in a very environmentally safe \nway, but no one can deny that the way we produce our wealth today is \nwith great environmental sensitivity. Everyone agrees with that. It is \nnot any longer hurting the environment. All of this production can be \ndone, for example, offshore or in the deep waters of the gulf in a very \nenvironmentally sensitive way. We are hoping the same thing can be done \nwith oil shale.\n  So when our friends say we need to be able to deal with the commodity \nmarkets here and that is going to make a big difference, the answer is, \nthere is a lot of dispute as to whether it will make any difference at \nall. But we do know something that will make a difference but it will \nnot make a difference just in the long run, it will make an immediate \ndifference. The decision to explore and produce right here in the \nUnited States where we know we have the resources, where we are not \ndependent on other people, where they cannot drive up the price because \nthey can rattle their sabers in the Strait of Hormuz or cutting off oil \nand natural gas supplies as Russia has done, we can stop all of that by \nsimply producing more in the United States where we know we have it and \nwe can produce it safely and in an environmentally sound way.\n  It is like the settlement of the West, as I said, in taking advantage \nof our natural resources. We have always been a can-do nation. We have \nalways said we can take care of ourselves. We don't want to be \ndependent on others. What we have learned today is that for depending \non others, we pay a very high price, and I don't mean just a high price \nat the gas pump but a high price in terms of our national security as \nwell. That is the reason we are insisting on removing some of these \nmoratoria, strictly illegal moratoria. It is a moratorium from being \nable to explore for energy off our coasts or in the deep waters in the \ngulf or on Federal lands.\n  There is a big up side to the Federal Government in terms of revenue \nroyalties, as well as to States as a result of this action. So instead \nof paying money to foreign countries, we can be gaining some of that \nwealth right here in the United States.\n  Bear in mind that other countries are the recipients of the payments \nfor oil around the world, not oil companies as is the case primarily in \nthe West. We send more than $1 billion a day, not to some oil company \nabroad but to foreign governments. They control the oil in Russia, in \nIran, in Iraq, and so on. Let's get off of sending our money to foreign \ngovernments that are working against our interests and that can affect \nthe price of the commodity simply\n\n[[Page S6888]]\n\nby their bad actions and rely more on the resources we have in the \nUnited States, that we know we can extract in an environmentally \nsensitive way, that can reduce the price immediately. That is the last \npoint I wanted to make.\n  Martin Feldstein had an interesting piece in the Wall Street Journal \nabout 2 weeks ago in which he made the point that there will be an \nimmediate downward effect on oil prices if we simply announce that we \nare going to go after these resources in the United States. As a \nresult, I urge my colleagues, when the opportunity arises and we debate \nthis issue over the next week or so, that we support increased \nproduction in the United States for the benefit of American citizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a very important subject. My \ncolleague from Arizona speaks of the issue of energy. The price of \ngasoline is skyrocketing. The price of oil has doubled in a year. It \nhas an impact on everything and everybody in this country. It is \nimportant as we discuss this issue, however, that we not create false \nchoices.\n  It is a false choice for anybody to suggest that, because we do one \nthing, we cannot do another. It is a false choice to suggest that \nbecause we take the first needed step, we are ignoring subsequent \nsteps. We ought to do a lot of things here.\n  I mentioned yesterday that we had a witness come to a hearing and \ndescribe this situation. If you have someone being hauled into a \nhospital emergency room who is grossly obese and also suffering a heart \nattack, do you think some doctor who meets the gurney at the emergency \nroom is going to look at this grossly obese person suffering a heart \nattack and say: All right, let's start working on a diet. We have to \nwork on this obesity. No, of course not. He will say: Let's take \nemergency action to deal with the heart attack.\n  Now, my point is this: We have very serious energy problems. One part \nof it is a gross amount of excess speculation in the commodity market \nthat has driven up--actually doubled--the price of crude oil in the \npast year, for which there is no justification in the supply and demand \nof the commodity. It seems to me, at least as a first step, we ought to \naddress this excess speculation.\n  My colleagues then say you have to drill. I don't disagree with that. \nIn 2006, I was one of four Senators who cosponsored the legislation \nthat resulted in the law that opened lease 181 for oil and natural gas \nproduction. This is 8.3 million acres in a portion of the eastern Gulf \nof Mexico that is now open for drilling. Senators Bingaman, Domenici, \nTalent, and I were the people who first introduced that bill. It is now \nlaw. So that is fine.\n  But if the only answer is to drill then I would ask those who say \nthat, how many airlines do you think will be serving this country if we \nwait for 5 or 7 years until somebody gets all the permits, undertakes \nthe testing, builds a drilling rig up in an area and pumps new oil out \nof the ground? How many airlines will be serving this country? I tell \nyou, a number of them have already gone bankrupt. Several are out of \nbusiness, and others will follow quickly. How many small-mom-and-pop \ntrucking firms that can't afford to pay for the diesel in their saddle \ntanks are going to be out of business in the next 5 or 7 years before \nthis notion of drilling, which is going to produce the additional \nsupply they are talking about, will be effective? How many fewer \nfarmers are going to be around? How many people will be around trying \nto figure out: How on Earth do I afford to fill my gas tank in my car \nin order to get to work next week because I don't have the money for \nthe gas?\n  My point is, we need to do a lot of things. Yes, we need to produce \nmore, and we need much greater conservation. By far, the most effective \nachievement of additional oil production is to save a barrel of oil. We \nare such prodigious wasters of oil and energy in this country. It is \nunbelievable. There is so much to be gained by conservation and energy \nefficiency. In everything we use from our lights, better doors and \nwindows, insulation, virtually every appliance, hot water heaters, \nrefrigerators, and stoves, conservation and energy efficiency are a \nvery significant part of this issue.\n  So, too, is a renewable energy future. We need game-changing \napproaches. I want to go from here to 10 years from now in a game-\nchanging way that says: I don't want us 10 years from today to be so \ndependent on Saudi oil. My colleagues, all they talk about is drilling. \nI am for drilling. But if that is all you are for, that is a yesterday \nforever strategy. Good for you. But every 10 or 20 years you are going \nto have exactly the same debate--drill more. You are not going to \nchange this country's energy future at all.\n  So my proposition is this: How about working together on steps, a \nstep at a time, doing a lot of things and doing them right. How about \nthe first step? We just had testimony this morning in the Energy \nCommittee from someone that cited a recent report from the CFTC which \nindicated that more than 73 percent of those trading in the commodity \nfutures market have nothing at all to do with hedging a physical \ncommodity. That is not what they are interested in. They are \nspeculators. He called them investors, but they are speculators. In \nfact, he said speculators. He said I actually called them investors.\n  But if 73 percent of that market for the oil futures is now devoid of \npeople who are actually trying to hedge a physical product between \nconsumers and producers, then that market is broken. That market has \ngone far afield of what it was created to do.\n  The market was created in 1936. When it was created, Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt warned about excess speculation when he signed the bill. And \nthe bill itself had a provision dealing with excess speculation because \nof concern that speculators could take over a market and ruin the \nmarket.\n  The proposition is this: What has happened in the last 14 months that \nhas allowed that market to price oil to double in price? What has \nhappened with respect to the fundamentals of oil supply and demand that \nwould justify that? The answer is: Nothing. Nothing. It has been pure, \nrelentless, excess speculation moving massive quantities of money into \nthis marketplace speculating on crude oil futures.\n  I have mentioned many times the description of Will Rogers about \nspeculation because it is not new to America. It happens. When it \nhappens and markets are broken, we have a responsibility to take some \naction. Will Rogers described it as someone buying things they will \nnever get from people who never had it. You can add, in this day and \nage, with money they don't possess.\n  So what we had is unbelievable excess speculation in the marketplace. \nThere are some who scoff and say that is not happening. One of my \ncolleagues this morning said what is happening is supply and demand. \nWell, I ask my colleagues to come to the floor and describe to me the \nevents that have occurred in the last 14 months or so that would \njustify doubling the price of gasoline or oil. They will not come to \nthe floor because they can't. The knowledge of the significant change \nin supply and demand in the last 14 months does not exist.\n\n  This is not about supply-and-demand fundamentals. Go back 2 or 3 \nyears and ask yourself: What do we know about the desire of the Chinese \nor Indians to drive more cars? What do we know about all those factors \nthat might, in the longer term, increase demand for gasoline or diesel? \nDid we not know them a year ago? Is that new knowledge? Not at all.\n  The fact is, nobody is going to come to this Chamber and tell us \nthere is something that has happened to supply and demand that \njustifies the doubling of the price of gasoline and oil because it does \nnot exist. This doubling existed because, in my judgment, of excessive, \nreckless speculation in the futures markets for oil. We have a \nresponsibility to do something about it.\n  Now, the legislation that we introduced yesterday is the Stop \nExcessive Energy Speculation Act of 2008. Let me say that again: Stop \nExcessive Energy Speculation Act of 2008. I worked with Senator Reid \nand others on the legislation. It is not brought here, as my colleague \nfrom Arizona just suggested, to\n\n[[Page S6889]]\n\ndo this and nothing else. That is a false choice, and it is being \npresented on the floor of the Senate every chance they get. If we do \nthis, it means we don't want to do anything else. I say let's do this \nand everything else.\n  Now, I am not suggesting, as some perhaps would, that we drill in the \nGrand Canyon or drill in the Everglades. There are certain areas where \nwe ought not drill. We have a substantial amount of area that is \navailable for drilling. And when they say: Well, we are not drilling. \nWhy don't you go north of Kidder, ND, and take a look at a rig right \nnow. We have about 70 to 80 of them in North Dakota, and they are \ndrilling right now in something called the Bakken shale.\n  Some may not understand, but in the last 2 months, the U.S. \nGeological Survey put out an assessment that said the Bakken region has \nthe largest assessment of recoverable oil ever recorded in the lower 48 \nStates. This is 3.6 billion barrels to 4.3 billion technically \nrecoverable barrels, and they are pulling oil out of that formation. \nThere are drilling rigs all over western North Dakota and eastern \nMontana.\n  So when someone suggests we are not drilling, that's nonsense. Get a \ncar and drive around a little. I will show you where the rigs are. We \nare drilling onshore and offshore. We have, in fact, opened lease 181, \na portion of the Gulf of Mexico that was not previously opened until \n2006. We don't see a lot of activity there at the moment, but we did \nthat because there are substantial oil and gas reserves there.\n  I will make one additional point. There are a half million barrels \nthat can be potentially produced off the coast of Cuba. Spain, Canada, \nIndia, and others are interested. But U.S.-based companies are not able \nto get involved in leasing off the coast of Cuba because we have an \nembargo against Cuba, among other things. President Bush doesn't want \nus to be involved in this region.\n  So it is not a case where those who come to the floor suggesting that \nwe drill, drill, drill, would want us to drill everywhere. In fact, the \nlegislation they brought to the floor of the Senate that touts drilling \nconveniently left out a substantial portion of the eastern Gulf of \nMexico because a Member on their side doesn't support that. So they \nleft that out of their proposal. Oh well. I guess one doesn't have to \nbe consistent to come to the floor to make presentations.\n  The issue is this: Let's do something together because this country's \neconomy is being damaged. American families are being injured, and \nfarmers, truckers, and airlines are getting killed with these prices. \nLet's do something together to address it.\n  What would make sense? What is the first step, or at least a sensible \nfirst step? Does it make sense to say let's do something that will \nprovide some relief in 7 years? That will be great to tell Aunt Millie: \nI know you won't be able to pay your fuel bill this winter, but 7 years \nfrom now, just wait, we will have another field in production \nsomeplace.\n  What about taking first steps first? What about stopping excessive \nenergy speculation with the bill we introduced yesterday? Now, how does \nthe bill do that? It requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, \nwhich has been a regulatory agency that I have had fairly strong words \nabout recently, to actually stand up, put on striped shirts, blow the \nwhistles and be the referees for this marketplace. They have been an \nabysmal failure, in my judgment. They have an acting chairman, who \nsays: What, me worry? The only thing going on here is the market \ndemands and the fundamentals are working. It is just supply and demand.\n  In fact, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been issuing \nover the years what are called ``no action letters.'' Boy, that is a \nfitting tribute to this agency--no action letters--that have said, \nessentially: We are not interested in seeing what is going on. In fact, \nwe will be willfully blind to what is going on, and here is a letter \nthat demonstrates we are interested in that position.\n  So what we say in the bill is: Look, there is a regulatory agency \nhere, and we believe it ought to function and we require it to function \nin a certain way. No. 1, we say it ought to distinguish between groups \nof traders. There are those who are hedging their risk, the consumers \nand producers of a physical product, because that is the purpose for \nwhich this market was established and all others. All the others are \nspeculators.\n  And this bill would impose substantial position limits on what are \nthe nonlegitimate hedge trading transactions. Again, very specific. \nWithin 30 days, we would require the regulator to impose very specific \nand strong position limits on all non-legitimate hedge trading. What \nthat does is to take some of the air out of this balloon and put some \ndownward pressure on oil and gas prices.\n  Now, I have shown this chart many times, but it is worth going over \nsome of the things we have heard here in the Congress, and it is worth \nit because of those who come to the floor to say: What speculation? \nThere is no speculation.\n  I had Fidel Gheit, an interesting guy, testify in front of our \ncommittee before, and I have talked to him by phone, and here is what \nhe says:\n\n       There is no shortage of oil. I'm convinced oil prices \n     shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel.\n\n  And he said, talking of the futures market:\n\n       I call it the world's largest gambling hall. It is open 24/\n     7. Unfortunately, it's totally unregulated. It's like a \n     highway with no cops and no speed limits and everybody going \n     120 miles an hour.\n\n  Energy Secretary Bodman, who is one of these people who says there is \nnothing going on with respect to these marketplaces and this \nspeculation, says:\n\n       There is no evidence that we can find that speculators are \n     driving futures prices for oil.\n\n  He says he can't find the evidence. Well, let me find evidence that \nindicates the opposite. Here are at least two examples. First, the \nHouse Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations released a report \nshowing that speculators in the oil futures market went from 37 percent \nto 71 percent. It seems to me that is some pretty substantial evidence. \nSecond, testimony this morning before the Energy Committee revealed \nthat speculators represented 73 percent of the market--almost \nidentical.\n  So I would say to the Secretary: If you can't find the evidence, I \ncan. If you have the right evidence, maybe you could search for the \nright solution.\n  Our Energy Information Administration--the EIA--doesn't do anything \nwith respect to policy. We spend $100 million for this agency, and it \nis supposed to simply provide the best information available. Here is \nthe information they have provided: In May 2007, they said here is \nwhere we think the price of oil will be--right across here, about a \nstraight line. In July 2007, they said: Here is where the price of oil \nwill be. In September 2007 and in November 2007, they said here is what \nwe think. Now, in March 2008, here is where we think it will be.\n  Well, guess what. These lines were so far off, I mean it is almost \nlaughable. Here is where the price of oil went. Why is that? I assume \nthese folks were taking a look at supply and demand and the normal \nrelationship that determines a price, and they didn't understand that \nwhat has happened is that this market is perverted and broken as a \nresult of excess speculation. The price went just like a Roman candle.\n  There is no way to describe this as anything that is rational. We are \nnot off not by a mile, but by a country mile.\n  I had a hearing on this subject. Of course they couldn't answer the \nquestion of why they were off so far.\n  The senior vice president of ExxonMobil:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50 to $55 per barrel.\n\n  The same with the president of Marathon Oil, same answer.\n  My sense is that we ought to do everything, but we have folks coming \nto the floor of the Senate to say: You can't do anything unless you do \ndrilling first.\n  We are doing drilling right now, but we will not allow you to do \nanything unless you do something that is going to affect something 5 or \n7 years from now.\n  It doesn't make much sense to me. It seems to me, if this is an \nopportunity to move forward, you address the hurdles that are in front \nof you. The first hurdle, it seems to me, is to set this market \nstraight. I believe the market we have with respect to the futures\n\n[[Page S6890]]\n\nmarket is broken. There is reason to debate that. I respect those who \ndisagree, but I think the evidence is not on their side.\n  What I think we should do is decide we have a very serious problem, \nand we should address it three steps. The first step would be to tackle \nthis speculation issue. We introduced that legislation last Tuesday. \nThat legislation brings everything under the control of the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission so they can see all of it, including the \nover-the-counter trades on foreign exchanges. It requires strong \nposition limits. The fact is, it requires that a distinction be \ndeveloped between legitimate hedgers and just pure speculators. We \nshould do that. So that is step No. 1.\n  Step No. 2, it seems to me we should develop a broader position with \nthe six or eight things we need to do as a country in a much more \naggressive way that increases additional production, conservation, and \nenergy efficiency measures because all of these opportunities in the \nfuture.\n  For step three, we ought to do something that is game changing \nbecause we come here every 10 years or so, every 20 years, and the \ndrillers come in and say: The only way to solve our energy problem is \nto drill. As I said, that is a yesterday forever policy. That is fine \nif you are comfortable coming back to the same debate and putting our \ncountry in the same position. But the game-changing approach, in my \njudgment, is to say there are a lot of ways for us to develop renewable \nsources of energy, a lot of ways for us to develop renewable sources of \nenergy in a way that really changes our energy future significantly.\n  Those are the three things I think we ought to do and do them in that \norder and fairly close order, and I believe we ought to do it \nunderstanding that this is an emergency.\n  If all we do is just to deny that this market is broken and deny that \nthere is excess speculation, then we will just be talking past each \nother. If that is all we do, I wonder how many airlines will be left in \nthis country 5 or 7 years from now, if that is the time period in which \nmaybe you get some additional drilling up and get some additional \nproduction? How many trucking firms are going to be operating out \nthere? How many mom-and-pop firms go belly-up in the next 6 months or \nyear or 2 years? How will the folks who are trying to fill their tanks \nand figure out how they are going to pay gas prices go to work? How \nwill they fill that tank to get to work next week or next month or next \nyear?\n  I think there is an urgency. One of the things to respond to with \nrespect to that urgency is the first challenge in front of us. That \nurgency is to set straight the excess speculation in this marketplace. \nWe can do that. There is nothing Republican or Democratic about that. \nIt is just to look at this with a level head and say: Here is a \nproblem, let's address it. The underlying law that created the futures \nmarket was created in 1936. It has a provision dealing with excess \nspeculation.\n  I will make one final point. The regulatory authority here has been \nan abysmal failure, but that is not just in this case. We face a lot of \nchallenges today. We face challenges with respect to banking. We face \nchallenges with respect to the subprime scandal and a whole range of \nother things, and you can trace it right back to the root that so many \npeople felt regulation was a four-letter word. They decided we want to \nhave regulators who decided not to regulate. That is certainly the case \nwith this market. It is the case with other issues as well.\n  I think we have a Congress that has the responsibility and \nopportunity to set it straight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The senior Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe Senator Stevens is going to \nspeak, but I ask unanimous consent that he be recognized on the \ncompletion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, obviously the issue of energy is at the \ncenter of everybody's concern.\n  Does the Senator from Alaska wish to go forward?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask to reserve my time and ask that I be \nrecognized at the completion of the presentation by the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The senior Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am here once again because the price of \noil remains at a historic high. It has come down slightly today, and I \nhope that will continue. As a matter of fact, I hope people listen to \nwhat we are saying so it will come down because I do think this drop \nhas something to do with the fact that everybody is talking about \nspeculation.\n  There is no question that my people, Alaskans, are paying more for \nfuel oil and gasoline and petroleum products than anyone in the country \ndespite the fact that we produce almost a million barrels of oil a day. \nWe don't have any gasoline refineries. We have refineries for jet fuel \nbecause we have such an enormous traffic, through our State, of \ncommercial cargo planes. Of course, during the summertime we have \nenormous tourist traffic to our State by the airlines.\n  It is a great problem for us right now because we have less than a \nmillion people spread out over an area that is more than twice the size \nof Texas. We are absolutely fuel-intensive in terms of our lifestyle \nbecause 70 percent of our cities can be reached only by air year round. \nWe really have to deal with the problems that are presented by this \nenergy crisis.\n  I applaud the President lifting the offshore drilling ban. I do think \nit sent a signal to the country that it is a very serious thing. After \nall, his father placed that in effect, and it has been there, and it \nreally is something that has to be dealt with.\n  The difficulty is that even with the ban lifted and even with full \napproval of the Congress, we are going to the Outer Continental Shelf \nnow to determine how much we can produce. We know we can produce a \ngreat amount, but how much we can produce from the Outer Continental \nShelf? Two-thirds of the Outer Continental Shelf is off our State, and \nthere is only one oil well there now. There are hundreds of thousands \nof wells in the other one-third, but because of the constant opposition \nof those who oppose exploration and development in our State, we are \nstymied.\n  Take for instance the leases on the Chukchi Sea, which is the area \noff the northwest coast of Alaska, some 70 miles off the coast. The oil \nindustry has obtained leases there to explore for and develop that area \nfor its oil and gas potential. That has been, now, tied up for over a \nyear by a series of lawsuits. One of them is claiming that oil and gas \nexploration would harm the polar bear. I want the Senate to know that \njust a week ago, the ice at that area was 17 feet deep. The ice is not \ndisappearing the way people say it is, particularly in the period of \ntime when the polar bears are there. But beyond that, the difficulty is \nthere is a whole series of things that--these people who are against \nexploration and development in my State have caused wildlife to be \nlisted as endangered or at least threatened, and they are using those \nfindings in order to delay the development of new facilities to bring \nus the new production we need, the new production the Government needs.\n  It reminds me of the time I spent here on the floor--almost 4 years--\nin the seventies when the first group litigated again and again to \ndelay the oil pipeline. Finally, we reached the stress point where we \nhad to ask the Senate to do something it had never done before and \nhasn't done since, and that is to close the courts of the United States \nto this constant delay in building that pipeline. We finally brought \nthat amendment to the floor. It was debated at length for 4 days, and \nit ended up with a tie vote--the only tie vote at\n\n[[Page S6891]]\n\nthe time of the then Nixon administration. Vice President Agnew broke \nthe tie. It was 49 to 49.\n  Think of what that means. At that time, there was a paradigm that the \nSenate would not filibuster anything that involved national security. \nThe availability of oil to meet our needs is a matter of national \nsecurity, but we faced a filibuster ever since then, in terms of trying \nto develop the Arctic.\n  One of the things we ought to look to today, though, is the letter \nthat has been sent by almost all the airlines in the United States. \nAirTran, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Continental, Delta, \nHawaiian, JetBlue, Midwest Airlines, Southwest, United, and U.S. \nAirways, all joined in sending a letter to the holders of their \nfrequent flier programs dealing with the problem of the skyrocketing \noil and fuel prices and what they are doing to destroy the capability \nto provide air transportation to the United States.\n  I read before and let me read again this one paragraph. I think it is \nabsolutely something everyone should understand. I am quoting now from \nthis letter signed by all the presidents and heads of these companies.\n  Mr. President, I ask again to have it printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. The letter says:\n\n       Twenty years ago, 21 percent of oil contracts were \n     purchased by speculators who trade oil on paper with no \n     intention of ever taking delivery. Today, oil speculators \n     purchase 66 percent of all oil future contracts, and that \n     reflects just the transactions that are known. Speculators \n     buy up a large amount of oil and then sell it to each other \n     again and again. A barrel of oil may trade 20-plus times \n     before it is delivered and used; the price goes up with each \n     trade and consumers pick up the final tab. Some market \n     experts estimate that the current prices reflect as much as \n     $30 to $60 per barrel in unnecessary speculative costs.\n\n  If those pieces of paper that represent future delivery of oil are \npurchased by people who are just speculating and that purchaser ends \nup, after selling the paper, acquiring it again, to me, that is \nabsolute proof of a criminal conspiracy in this country.\n  I think this speculation has to stop. We have to start talking more \nabout it, and we have to do something about it. What I would do is make \nsure it is a criminal matter if someone acquires the same piece of \npaper dealing with futures in oil and has no ability to use the oil. I \nreally do not think there is any reason--I can understand a company \nmight buy ahead for 2 or 3 years in oil and buy futures and hedge \nagainst the price, that, in fact, it might go up, but people who buy \nthose pieces of paper solely to manipulate the price--and that is what \nhappens when someone not involved, these institutional investors, buys \na piece of paper to buy oil in the future and then sells it to another \ninstitutional investor and then another one. If that piece of paper \nends up in the same hands the second time, to me, that is a criminal \nconspiracy, and it is time we looked at that and understood it. This \nletter sets it forth.\n  Believe me, any Member of the Senate who ignores this letter ignores \nthe fact that every single frequent flier person in the country has it \nin their hands. I don't know about the rest of you, but I am getting \nthousands of letters from people who are sending me this letter and \nsaying: What are you going to do about it? I say what we have to do \nabout it is send a signal to these speculators to take notice that \nCongress is serious about speculators.\n  I know there is a difference of opinion out here on the floor of the \nSenate, there is no question about it, but in the last 5 years, \ninvestments in commodity index funds jumped from $13 billion to $260 \nbillion. That means institutional investors have gone from owning $13 \nbillion worth of oil futures to $260 billion in oil futures.\n  Now, someone tell me that is not a conspiracy.\n  Let me put up this chart. This chart represents the so-called NYMEX \noil futures. The red on the chart represents the price of oil; the gold \nrepresents the volume of trading. The volume of trading has gone up, \nbut the price has gone up more than twice as much as the volume.\n  There is only one thing that can drive up a spike like that. That is \nspeculation, it is not demand. Someone told me not to try to understand \nsupply and demand in the oil business. I think I know something about \noil demand in the oil business, because we tried to meet that demand in \nterms of our State. We had a better chance of satisfying the demand of \nthe United States than any State. But to have this situation go along I \nthink is wrong, to go forward I think is wrong.\n  I have personally talked to one of the economists. I must say he does \nnot share my feelings that we ought to make this a crime immediately, \nbecause, it is my understanding, he does not believe we have seen \nevidence of criminal conduct yet.\n  But I say it is criminal conduct if someone owns one of those pieces \nof paper twice. There is no reason to sell a future in oil and then \nturn around and buy it later at a higher price. They are actually being \nacquired and turned over more than 20 times before the oil is \ndelivered. That ought to be something the Justice Department and the \nCFTC should have notified us on before it took the time of all of these \npresidents of these companies to send this letter to their customers so \nthey can send it on to us. These people have told their customers to \ncontact us. Well, this is one time I hope all of us listen to what they \nare saying. Because there is no question that we have to find some way \nto restrict this trading to those who need oil in the future, those who \nlegitimately hedge to try and save their customers money, not to cost \nthem more money but to save money. A true hedge would save money for \nthe customers of the particular person who acquired the futures.\n  I think the legislation Senator Feinstein and I introduced some time \nago represents an important step toward breaking this bubble. The \nposition limits we would place on institutional investors would be very \nminimal and would make them stay away from market manipulation.\n  If we can see these investments shift away from the energy \ncommodities and back to the stock markets the way we have in the last \nfew days, I think the stock market would recover.\n  I thank my friend from New Hampshire for letting me use part of his \ntime. But I say, we cannot stop at mandating transparency. We have to \ndo something to put these people in fear before they will stop this \naction of driving this price up.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       An Open letter to All Airline Customers:\n       Our country is facing a possible sharp economic downturn \n     because of skyrocketing oil and fuel prices, but by pulling \n     together, we can all do something to help now.\n       For airlines, ultra-expensive fuel means thousands of lost \n     jobs and severe reductions in air service to both large and \n     small communities. To the broader economy, oil prices mean \n     slower activity and widespread economic pain. This pain can \n     be alleviated, and that is why we are taking the \n     extraordinary step of writing this joint letter to our \n     customers. Since high oil prices are partly a response to \n     normal market forces, the nation needs to focus on increased \n     energy supplies and conservation. However, there is another \n     side to this story because normal market forces are being \n     dangerously amplified by poorly regulated market speculation.\n       Twenty years ago, 21 percent of oil contracts were \n     purchased by speculators who trade oil on paper with no \n     intention of ever taking delivery. Today, oil speculators \n     purchase 66 percent of all oil futures contracts, and that \n     reflects just the transactions that are known. Speculators \n     buy up large amounts of oil and then sell it to each other \n     again and again. A barrel of oil may trade 20-plus times \n     before it is delivered and used; the price goes up with each \n     trade and consumers pick up the final tab. Some market \n     experts estimate that current prices reflect as much as $30 \n     to $60 per barrel in unnecessary speculative costs.\n       Over seventy years ago, Congress established regulations to \n     control excessive, largely unchecked market speculation and \n     manipulation. However, over the past two decades, these \n     regulatory limits have been weakened or removed. We believe \n     that restoring and enforcing these limits, along with several \n     other modest measures, will provide more disclosure, \n     transparency and sound market oversight. Together, these \n     reforms will help cool the over-heated oil market and permit \n     the economy to prosper.\n       The nation needs to pull together to reform the oil markets \n     and solve this growing problem.\n       We need your help.

The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have 10 \nminutes to speak as in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to participate in this discussion on \nenergy. I agree with the Senator from Alaska, and I agree, in part, \nwith the Senator from North Dakota, that there has to be an addressing \nof the issue of speculation.\n  I think any deal that takes shape on this floor will help if we do \nthat. In addressing the issue of speculation, there are a lot of \ndifferent factors, however. One of them is that we make sure to \nmaintain control over these commodity markets, and we not create an \natmosphere where these commodity markets move offshore and therefore we \nlose any regulatory control on our part.\n  But, in addition, I do not think we can repeal the laws of common \nsense. The essence of the law of common sense is that you have India \nand China moving toward fairly developed nations and creating massive \nincreases in the demand for oil. There are 2.5 billion people in those \ntwo countries. We have 300 million people in our country. We still use \nthe majority of the world's oil. But the simple fact is that demand for \noil has radically increased, and we are not going to be able to reduce \nour energy costs in this country unless we produce more American \nresources, and also conserve more. That is the simple fact. It is a \nfunction of supply and demand. And part of producing more means that we \nhave got to look at those places where we have sources of energy. Two \nof the key places we have sources of energy are offshore and also oil \nshale. Both of those resources and, in fact, in the case of oil shale, \nthose resources, the reserves of oil there, exceed the reserves of \nSaudi Arabia by a factor of two or three. In both of those instances we \ncan recover energy by exploring and drilling in a manner that is \nenvironmentally safe. We have proved that beyond any question relative \nto offshore drilling, when you see that Hurricane Katrina came right up \nthe gulf coast and destroyed one of our great cities but at the same \ntime there was essentially no oil leak or no gas leak from any of the \nproduction facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  We have proven we can produce this energy in a safe and \nenvironmentally sound way, and we need to produce it. If you want to \nsee the price of energy drop in this country, you have got to show the \nworld community that we as a nation are willing to step forward and \nproduce and conserve more energy. The way you produce more energy is by \ndrilling, drilling offshore and using the underground resources of oil \nshale which exceed the reserves of Saudi Arabia. So if we want to \naddress the cost of energy, we should do it, and we should do it now. \nWe should not be waiting.\n  That is why I congratulate the President for lifting the moratorium. \nThe Senate should lift the moratorium that was put in place by the \nSenate, by the Congress, on both oil shale and offshore drilling.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Gregg pertaining to the introduction of S. 3279 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: \nCalendar Nos. 687 and 688, and that the Senate proceed to vote on \nconfirmation of the nominations; that upon confirmation of the \nnominations, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc, \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, with no \nfurther motions in order, and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession; and that any statements relating to the nominations be printed \nin the Record; and that after this consent is granted, Senator Specter \nof Pennsylvania be recognized for 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate will go into executive session \nand proceed to the consideration, en bloc, of Executive Calendar Nos. \n687 and 688, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Paul G. \nGardephe, of New York, to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of New York; and Kiyo A. Matsumoto, of New York, to \nbe United States District Judge for the Eastern District of New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nominations of Paul G. Gardephe, of New York, to be U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Southern District of New York, and Kiyo A. \nMatsumoto, of New York, to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York?\n  The nominations were confirmed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we continue to make progress by \nhaving confirmed two more nominations for lifetime appointments to the \nFederal bench: Paul Gardephe for the Southern District of New York and \nKiyo Matsumoto for the Eastern District of New York.\n  These nominees each have the support of the New York Senators, who \nworked with the White House to identify a slate of consensus nominees. \nI thank Senators Schumer and Clinton for their consideration of these \nnominees. I also thank Senator Schumer for chairing the hearing on \ntheir nominations.\n  It is ironic that again this week the Senate Republicans have made \nanother attempt to make a partisan, election-year issue out of the \nconfirmation of judicial nominations. This is the one area where the \nnumbers have actually improved during the Bush Presidency while the \nlife of hardworking Americans has only gotten more difficult. Inflation \nis now on the rise, jobs are being lost, gas prices have skyrocketed, \nfood prices have soared, health care is unaffordable and what \nRepublicans come to the floor to pick a partisan fight about today is \nthe pace of judicial confirmations.\n  Americans have seen the unemployment rate rise to 5.5 percent and \ntrillions of dollars in budget surplus have turned into trillions of \ndollars of debt. This week General Motors announced layoffs. The annual \nbudget deficit is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the dollar \nhas lost half its value and the costs of the Iraq war and interest on \nthe national debt amount to $1.5 billion a day. And today Republicans \nspent their time on the Senate floor--after the Democratic leadership \nof the Senate had pushed through two more judicial confirmations to \nlifetime appointments--to complain about the pace of judicial \nconfirmations.\n  When President Bush took office, the price of gas was $1.42 a gallon. \nToday it is at an all-time high of over $4.10 a gallon. The Nation's \ntrade deficit widened 8 percent in April alone due to the surging gas \nprices, and is now at its highest level in 13 months. The housing \ncrisis and mortgage crisis threaten the economy. The Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve gave sobering testimony this week to the Senate and the \nHouse. The stock market lost 2,000 points in the first 6 months of the \nyear and went\n\n[[Page S6893]]\n\nunder 11,000. But Republicans want to talk about judicial \nconfirmations, an issue that they hope will charge up rightwing voters.\n  Struggling Americans--no not whiners, but hardworking Americans \ntrying to do the best they can for their families--are more concerned \nabout critical issues they face in their lives each day. They are \nconcerned about affording to heat their homes this winter. They are \nconcerned about gas prices that have skyrocketed so high they do not \nknow how they will afford to drive to work. They are concerned about \nthe steepest decline in home values in two decades. More and more \nAmericans are affected by rising unemployment, with job losses for the \nfirst 6 consecutive months of this year tallying over 438,000. \nAmericans are worried about soaring health care costs, rising health \ninsurance costs, the rising costs of education and rising food prices. \nThe partisan, election-year rhetoric over judicial nominations, at a \ntime when judicial vacancies have been significantly reduced, is a \nreflection of misplaced priorities.\n\n  Our progress today in confirming two more nominations for lifetime \nappointments shows that when the President works with home state \nSenators to identify consensus, well-qualified nominees, we can make \nprogress, even this late in an election year.\n  Paul Gardephe has been a partner and chair of the Litigation \nDepartment at the New York law firm of Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler \nLLP since 2003. Previously, Mr. Gardephe worked in the private sector \nand also held several positions with the Department of Justice, \nincluding special counsel for the Office of the Inspector General.\n  Kiyo Ann Matsumoto is a U.S. magistrate judge in the Eastern District \nof New York. Prior to her appointment to the bench in 2004, Judge \nMatsumoto served as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District \nof New York and also worked in private practice. Judge Matsumoto is \nonly the fourth Asian-American judge appointed by this President in \nnearly 8 years. Her mother and father spent time in an internment camp \nduring World War II, one of the dark days in American history when we \nallowed fear and prejudice to undermine our commitment to liberty and \njustice. Now Judge Matsumoto is poised to be confirmed to a lifetime \nappointment to the Federal bench, charged with protecting the rights of \nall Americans.\n  I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmation \ntoday. The Federal judiciary is the one arm of our Government that \nshould never be political or politicized, regardless of who sits in the \nWhite House. I will continue in this Congress, and with a new President \nin the next Congress, to work with Senators from both sides of the \naisle to ensure that the Federal judiciary remains independent, and \nable to provide justice to all Americans, without fear or favor.\n  Even while we hear a steady stream of grumbling from Republicans, \nresponding to partisan pressure from special interest groups, the \nSenate continues to make progress in reducing judicial vacancies to \nlows not seen in decades. We have gone quite a ways to make up for the \nabuses the Republicans committed during the Clinton years. Since the \nyears in which Republicans pocket-filibustered more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's moderate and qualified judicial nominees, and \njudicial vacancies topped 100, we have cut vacancies by more than half \nand reduced circuit court vacancies by almost three-fourths from a high \npoint of 32, to just nine throughout the entire country and throughout \nall 13 Federal circuits.\n  The contrast is stark between the Democratic majority that cut \nvacancies dramatically during the Bush Presidency and the Republican \nmajority that doubled them during the Clinton Presidency. The 100 \nnominations we confirmed in only 17 months in 2001 and 2002, while \nworking with a most uncooperative White House, reduced the vacancies \nby 45 percent by the end of 2002. Consider this snapshot: On July 15, \n2000, when a Republican Senate majority was considering the judicial \nnominees of a Democratic President in Presidential election year, there \nwere 61 judicial vacancies. Twenty were circuit court vacancies On July \n15 of this year, before today's two confirmations, there were 42 total \nvacancies throughout the country, and for the first time in decades, \ncircuit court vacancies were in single digits, at just 9. For the first \ntime since Republicans began their obstruction of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees in 1996, circuit vacancies had been reduced to single \ndigits.\n\n  With 40 additional confirmations last year, and another 16 so far \nthis year, the Senate under Democratic leadership has already confirmed \nmore judges than in the entire last Congress. In 2 full years with a \nRepublican chairman and a Republican Senate majority working to confirm \nthe judicial nominees of a Republican President, 54 nominations were \nconfirmed. After the two confirmations today, we will have already \nreached 56 judicial confirmations for this Congress. Two additional \nnominations remain pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. With a \nlittle cooperation from Republican Senators, who objected earlier today \nto the majority leader's proposal to consider two judges today with a 1 \nhour time agreement, those two judicial nominations could also be \nconfirmed. Then we will not only have exceeded the total of the last \nCongress but equaled under Democratic leadership the total number of \nnominees confirmed in 4\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the Senate. \nTruth be told, President Bush's judicial nominees have been confirmed \nfaster by the Democratic majority than by the previous Republican \nmajority of the Senate. To date, the Democratic majority has confirmed \n156 of President Bush's judicial nominations in the 3 years that I have \nchaired the Judiciary Committee. Judicial vacancies have fallen from \n9.9 percent at the start of the Bush administration to just 4.7 percent \ntoday.\n  The colloquies on the Senate floor today included misinformation \nabout judicial emergency vacancies. Many of these resulted from the \nRepublican slowdown during the Clinton years. In fact nearly half of \nthe judicial nominees the Senate has confirmed while I have served as \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee have filled vacancies \nclassified by the Administrative Office of the Courts as judicial \nemergency vacancies. Eighteen of the 27 circuit court nominees \nconfirmed while I have chaired the committee filled judicial \nemergencies, including 9 of the 10 circuit court nominees confirmed \nthis Congress. This is another aspect of the problem created by \nRepublicans that we have worked hard to improve. When President Bush \ntook office there were 28 judicial emergency vacancies. Those have been \nreduced by more than half.\n  Republicans playing to the far right wing of their political base \nignore this progress. They also ignore the crisis they had created by \nnot considering circuit nominees in 1996, 1997 and 1998. They ignore \nthe fact that they refused to confirm a single circuit nominee during \nthe entire 1996 session. They ignore the fact that they returned 17 \ncircuit court nominees without action to the White House in 2000. They \nignore the public criticism of Chief Justice Rehnquist to their actions \nduring those years. They ignore the fact that they were responsible for \nmore than doubling circuit court vacancies during their \npocket filibusters of Clinton nominees or that we have reduced those \ncircuit court vacancies by almost three quarters.\n\n  In fact, as the Presidential elections in 2000 drew closer, and when \nthe judicial vacancy rate stood at 7.2 percent, then-Judiciary \nCommittee Chairman Orrin Hatch declared that ``There is and has been no \njudicial vacancy crisis,'' and that 7.2 percent was a ``rather low \npercentage of vacancies that shows the judiciary is not suffering from \nan overwhelming number of vacancies.'' As a result of their inaction, \nthe vacancy rate continued to rise, reaching 10 percent when the \nDemocrats took over the Senate majority in 2001.\n  Democrats have reversed course. We have cut circuit court vacancies \nby nearly three-quarters, from a high of 32 to only 9. With the \nconfirmation of two nominees today, the vacancy rate will be just 4.7 \npercent.\n  I have yet to hear praise from a single Republican for our work in \nlowering vacancies. I also have yet to hear in the Republican talking \npoints any explanation for their actions during the 1996 congressional \nsession, when the Republican Senate majority refused to allow the \nSenate to confirm even one circuit court judge.\n\n[[Page S6894]]\n\n  Republicans' childish antics this year include boycotting business \nmeetings of the Judiciary Committee, cutting hearings short or \nobjecting to them being held and cutting short business meetings of the \ncommittee. Today we were scheduled to consider a number of bipartisan \nmeasures. Several are important items on which Republicans had already \ndelayed consideration since June. They include the bipartisan bill to \nreauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, a \nbipartisan OPEN FOIA bill and the bipartisan William Wilberforce \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. In addition, we had \nbefore us the Fairness in Nursing Home Arbitration Act, the Fugitive \nInformation Networked Database Act, the Methamphetamine Production \nPrevention Act and the National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Act.\n  I had hoped that today we would be able to report these measures. A \nfew words about one of them--the legislation to reauthorize the William \nWilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act. This bill would \nstrengthen our efforts to stop the abhorrent practice of human \ntrafficking around the world. Our bill enhances protections for victims \nof these terrible crimes. Human trafficking is a modern-day form of \nslavery, involving victims who are forced, defrauded or coerced into \nsexual or labor exploitation. These practices continue to victimize \nhundreds of thousands around the word, mostly women and children, and \nwe must do all that we can to be more effective in confronting this \ncontinuing problem. I thank Senator Biden for his leadership. \nUnfortunately, Republican partisan antics have gotten in the way of \nprogress on this front and delayed the Judiciary Committee and the \nSenate from acting on this measure.\n  Rather than meet and work on the human trafficking bill and the \nothers, a number of the Republican Senators who serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee came to the Senate floor while Republicans objected to the \ncommittee meeting. That is too bad.\n  They previously boycotted business meetings for the month of February \nwhen we were trying to report judicial nominations. That only slowed \nour progress. Then, when we tried to expedite consideration of two \ncircuit court nominations in May, they objected. Those judicial \nnominations were finally confirmed late in June.\n  As my friend, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania may recall, while \nchairman of the committee, I helped him move forward with the judicial \nnominations of Nora Barry Fischer, and Thomas Hardiman to the Third \nCircuit, and with Legrome Davis, Michael Baylson, Cynthia Rufe, \nChristopher Conner, John Jones III, David Cercone, Timothy Savage, \nTerrence McVerry, Arthur Schwab, James Gardner to the Federal district \ncourts in Pennsylvania despite the way President Clinton's Pennsylvania \nnominees were treated. I also had the committee proceed to the Third \nCircuit nomination of D. Brooks Smith, a nomination which I did not \nsupport. As ranking member, I worked with Chairman Hatch and Chairman \nSpecter in connection with the confirmations of Michael Fisher and \nFranklin van Antwerpen to the Third Circuit, as well as the nominations \nof Thomas Hardiman, Gene Pratter, Lawrence Stengel, Paul Diamond, Juan \nSanchez, and Thomas Golden to Federal district court in Pennsylvania. \nWith the exception of two nominees from Pennsylvania currently pending \nbefore the Judiciary Committee that do not have the support of their \nhome State Senators, every judicial nominee for a Pennsylvania vacancy \nnominated by President Bush has been confirmed by the Senate. That is \n23 nominations in all, including four to the Third Circuit.\n  As my good friend from Iowa may recall, I expedited confirmation of \nJohn Jarvey and Michael Mellow to the Eighth Circuit, and James \nGritzner and Linda Reade to the Federal district court in Iowa. As we \ndiscussed at a recent committee business meeting, thanks to all our \nwork, there is no Federal judicial vacancy in Iowa, not one.\n  I did not hear the Senator from Arizona recall my cooperation over \nthe years in the confirmation of a number of Federal judges in Arizona. \nThe Senate confirmed David Campbell, Neil Vincent Wake, Frederick \nMartone, Cindy Jorgenson, and David Bury. Among the last judges \nconfirmed in 2000 was the Senator from Arizona's close friend James \nTeilborg. I accommodated Senator Kyl as recently as last month in \nconnection with the most recent Federal judge appointed in Arizona, \nJudge Murray Snow. That filled the only vacancy on the Federal bench in \nArizona. So like Iowa, given our action, there is no Federal judicial \nvacancy in Arizona, not one.\n  As for my friend from Alabama, he is another member I have gone out \nof my way to assist over the years. In particular, I remember the \nconfirmation of Kristi Dubose. There were also the confirmations of \nKaron Boudre, Callie Granade and Mark Fuller while I chaired the \ncommittee. The Senate has also confirmed William Steele, L. Scott \nCoogler, R. David Proctor, Virginia Hopkins and W. Keith Watkins, all \nof whom I supported. Having helped confirm 10 Federal judges in Alabama \nsince 2001, I wondered why he did not note that Alabama is another \nState that, thanks to our efforts, has no judicial vacancy, not one.\n  I look forward to a time when Senators from the other side of the \naisle return to work with us on the important legislative business of \nthe Judiciary Committee. It would be refreshing if they recognized the \nprogress we have made on filling judicial vacancies. We have not \npocket-filibustered 60 of President Bush's judicial nominees, as they \ndid to President Clinton. We have not engaged in tit for tat. But, as \neven Senator Specter acknowledged this morning, nothing we do will \nsatisfy Republican Senators.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in calling for \nup-or-down votes for the President's judicial nominees. I supported the \ndecision not to attend the Judiciary Committee's Executive Business \nMeeting this morning because the committee does not appear to be \nserious about its responsibility to process nominees. Today's agenda \ncontained no nominees, and no hearings have been scheduled for the many \nqualified individuals who await them. One of our highest constitutional \nresponsibilities in the Senate is the consideration of judicial \nnominees. If the Judiciary Committee agenda does not include nominees, \nthere is little point in attending its meetings. I hope the chairman \nwill take note of Republicans' absence and schedule nominees for both \nhearings and markup without further delay.\n  Now I would like to take a minute to respond to a comment made by the \nmajority leader this morning. He said, ``I can't ever remember going \nhome and somebody . . . saying, `Could you guys do some more judges? We \nneed to take care of this judges problem.' ''\n  For the record, I would like to say that I have not had the same \nexperience with my constituents in Oklahoma. In fact, I frequently hear \nfrom them regarding their interest in judicial nominations. Here are \njust a few examples:\n  Lou Baber, from Oklahoma City, writes: ``I am incensed by the U.S. \nSenate's lack of action on the federal judicial nominees President Bush \nhas proposed for seats on district and appeals courts. . . . I hope you \nwill take action in the coming weeks on an issue that has already \nseriously damaged the Senate's reputation.''\n  Samantha Jones, from Claremore, writes: ``Please . . . vote for . . . \njudicial nominees in the confirmation process. They deserve fair \ntreatment . . . we need good judges.''\n  Peggy Low, of Yukon, writes: ``Will you please press the other \nsenators to give the judicial nominees an up-or-down vote, pronto? That \nis their job and [it is] so overdue.''\n  Barbara Tipton, of Chandler, writes: ``Please push to have the \njudicial nominees come to the full Senate for a vote.''\n  John and Pam Rawlins, of Ponca City, write: ``I want to applaud and \nthank Senator Coburn for bold[ly] standing up for the many judicial \nnominees that are blocked in the Senate. KEEP IT UP! That is what you \nare elected to do. We in Oklahoma understand this and [are] 1000 \npercent behind you.''\n  As I said, there are just a few of the many letters I have received \nfrom home about this issue. I will ask that they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  As demonstrated by the statements I just read, my constituents \nunderstand what some in this body do not: The\n\n[[Page S6895]]\n\nissue is not about getting more judges, it is about confirming quality \njudges who will uphold the Constitution. Isn't this our clear \nconstitutional responsibility?\n  Part of the reason I decided to run for the Senate was my desire to \nsee judicial nominees receive an up-or-down vote and my desire to \nrestore a restrained judiciary, bound by our Constitution, laws and \ntreaties. Too often fundamental liberties and important decisions are \ntaken away from the American people by judicial fiat. The Constitution \ngives the American people, through their elected officials, the right \nof self-determination by allowing legislative bodies closest to the \npeople decide the important issues of the day.\n  You don't have to look far to find examples of judges overriding the \npeople's will--one recent example affected my home state of Oklahoma. \nLast month, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court held that the death \npenalty is an unconstitutional punishment for the rape of a child. The \nmajority assumed a ``national consensus'' that the death penalty for \nchild rape was unconstitutional and then substituted its own \nindependent judgment for that of the people and the law, declaring it \ninconsistent with ``evolving standards of decency.'' Yet Oklahoma, \nalong with five other States, had laws permitting the death penalty for \nsuch offenses. Congress had even adopted the penalty, a fact somehow \noverlooked by the Court. One decision by five unelected judges struck \nthose laws down.\n  Americans are right to be outraged by this kind of judicial activism. \nOklahomans chose to protect their children by allowing the death \npenalty for anyone convicted twice of rape, sodomy or lewd molestation \ninvolving children under 14. Now, because a handful of judges halfway \nacross the country declared the state's decision to be inconsistent \nwith so-called ``evolving standards of decency,'' their sound judgment \nhas been overruled.\n  Given this example and many others like it, it is clear that \nAmericans are concerned about the Senate's treatment of judicial \nnominees. If further evidence is needed to prove the point, a recent \nRasmussen poll shed light on the issue. It found that, by a 69 percent \nto 20 percent margin, voters believe that judges should interpret the \nlaw as it is written. Sixty-one percent say they trust voters more than \njudges or elected officials to decide important decisions facing the \ncountry.\n  The obstruction that has occurred in the 110th Congress is \nunacceptable. It is time to break this stalemate and confirm more of \nthe President's highly qualified nominees.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am incensed by the U.S. Senate's lack of action on the \n     federal judicial nominees President Bush has proposed for \n     seats on district and appeals courts. For this reason, I am \n     urging you to use your influence to urge the Judiciary \n     Committee and the Majority Leader to prioritize this \n     important issue.\n       Many of the nominees for these important positions are \n     well-qualified and have already gone through the Senate's \n     confirmation process before. There is no reason not to \n     consider their candidacy for a federal judgeship. As a member \n     of the Center for Moral Clarity, a national Christian \n     grassroots organization, I hope you will take action in the \n     coming weeks on an issue that has already seriously damaged \n     the Senate's reputation.\n       Thank you for considering my opinion.\n                                                        Lou Baber,\n     Oklahoma City, OK.\n                                  ____\n\n       Please make a vote for the judicial nominees in the \n     confirmation process. They deserve fair treatment in this. We \n     need good judges.\n                                                   Samantha Jones,\n     Claremore, OK.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Dr. Coburn, will you please press the other senators \n     to give the judicial nominees an up or down vote pronto? That \n     is their job and so overdue. Thank you for all your good work \n     on behalf of the unborn and for our country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Peggy Low,\n     Yukon, OK.\n                                  ____\n\n       Please push to have the judicial nominees to come to the \n     full Senate for a vote. Thank you.\n                                                   Barbara Tipton,\n     Chandler, OK.\n                                  ____\n\n       I want to applaud and thank Senator Coburn for boldly \n     standing up for the many judicial nominees that are blocked \n     in the senate. KEEP IT UP! That is what you are elected to \n     do. We in Oklahoma that understand this are 1000 percent \n     behind you.\n       Go with our blessings!\n\n                                             John and Pam Rawlins,\n                                                   Ponca City, OK.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today \nconfirmed the nomination of two New Yorkers to the Federal bench.\n  Kiyo Matsumoto had served as a magistrate judge in the Eastern \nDistrict of New York since 2004. Prior to her appointment, Judge \nMatsumoto served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District \nof New York for more than two decades and held the position of deputy \nchief of the civil division in that office. Judge Matsumoto has taught \nas an adjunct law professor at the New York University School of Law as \nwell as worked as a legal research and writing instructor at the \nBrooklyn Law School. Judge Matsumoto has also served as a member of the \nFederal Court Committee of the City of New York Bar. Now that she has \nbeen confirmed, Judge Matsumoto becomes only the eighth active Asian-\nPacific American Senate-confirmed judge on the Federal bench out of \napproximately 850 judges nationwide.\n  Paul Gardephe was most recently a partner and chair of the Litigation \nDepartment at the New York law firm of Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler \nLLP. Previously, Mr. Gardephe was a special counsel for the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice Inspector General's Office. He has also worked \nfor the law department of Time Inc., where he held the positions of \nvice president, litigation deputy general counsel, and Associate \nGeneral Counsel. Prior to this work, Mr. Gardephe served in the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for nearly 10 \nyears. For the past 15 years, Mr. Gardephe has taught trial advocacy at \nNew York Law School as an adjunct professor.\n  The careers of both nominees have been marked by a record of \nachievement and a commitment to public service. I am certain that each \nof these individuals will be a credit to the Federal judiciary and will \ncontinue to exhibit the qualities that have defined their entire \ncareers: devotion to justice and respect for the rule of law. I am \nproud to have supported each of their nominations, and I commend \nSenator Schumer and the members of the Judiciary Committee on their \ndiligence in ensuring that our Federal courts are served by men and \nwomen of such distinction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me emphasize to my colleagues on the \nRepublican side who have requested time to speak that we do have an \nhour. I will speak for only a few minutes. We have the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa who is available to speak next. We are open to have \nothers come to take part of the time.\n  Today, the other Republican members of the Judiciary Committee chose \nnot to attend an Executive Business Meeting because there were no \njudges on the agenda. We have seen that there is tremendous \npartisanship, acrimony, and bitterness about the facts regarding the \nwhole confirmation process in this Chamber at the present time. We find \na situation where President Bush's confirmation numbers are far behind \nPresident Clinton's in the comparable period. President Clinton, in the \nlast 2 years of his Presidency, had 15 circuit judges confirmed, 57 \ndistrict judges confirmed, contrasted with 10 circuit judges for \nPresident Bush and 44 district court judges. We have found, \nregrettably, that this pattern has been evolving over the past couple \ndecades. We have seen in the last 2 years of President Reagan's \nadministration, when the Senate was controlled by the Democrats, the \nconfirmation process was slowed. Similarly, in the last 2 years of \nPresident George H.W. Bush, the Democrats controlled the Senate, and \nthe process was slowed. Then, for 6 years during President Clinton's \nadministration, the last 6, the Senate was controlled by Republicans \nand the matter was exacerbated. There were determinations to not \nconfirm President Clinton's judges. I spoke out at that time and voted \nto confirm President Clinton's qualified judges and disagreed with my \ncaucus because I thought we ought not to be partisan and impede the \nconfirmation of judges due to the importance and public interest of \nhaving the courts handle litigation in a timely way. But the situation \nwas ratcheted up, first by Democrats, and then by Republicans.\n  Then we saw this Chamber badly divided in 2005, with filibusters by \nthe Democrats and threats by Republicans to put into effect the nuclear \nor constitutional option to change the rules on filibusters. So the \nmatter has gone from bad to worse. It is hard to see how it can get \nmuch worse, but it seems to be getting worse. It is my hope we will \nfind a way to break this cycle.\n  What we find is the minority party, whichever party that is, has been \nturned into recidivists. We have a cycle of recidivism blocking the \nconfirmation of judges. Nobody knows for sure what is going to happen \nin the Presidential election this year or what is going to happen in \nthe Senatorial elections, but it may be that there will be a Democratic \nPresident. It may be that the Democrats will control the Senate. I \nwould not like to see the rapidly deteriorating situation which we now \nhave now turn into a situation where there will be filibusters by the \nRepublicans in the 111th Congress. For a long time the Democrats \nfilibustered Fifth Circuit nominees, claiming Clinton's nominees were \nfilibustered years back. Now we have a good many Fourth Circuit \nnominees who are not receiving hearings or votes. I am afraid we are \ngoing to have the same situation exacerbated with Republicans taking a \nposition similar to the Democrats current position. It is my hope we \nwill yet be able to do something about it.\n  Earlier today, Senator Reid came to the floor and mentioned me by \nname. I gave Senator Reid notice that I would be on the floor at 12:15 \ntoday, when I had some time allotted. I believe it is a good practice, \nnot only a good practice, not only a preferable practice, but it ought \nto be the practice to let a Senator know if you are going to talk about \nhim on the floor so he can come and reply, if he chooses to do so. But, \nSenator Reid was commenting about the excessive amount of time \nRepublicans wanted, an hour and a half. We had an hour equally divided \na few weeks ago, and that left Republicans with a half an hour. Senator \nWarner had a judge on the list and didn't have any time to speak. \nSenator Bond came to the floor, and there was no time for him on \nRepublican time. I understood later--I found out this morning--that he \ngot some time from Senator Leahy.\n  But, all any Senator has to do is call. If Senator Reid doesn't like \nthe time request and wants it at an hour, he can call me. I realize he \nhas a responsibility to administer this Chamber, and I am prepared to \ncooperate with him. But, it is my hope we will yet move ahead.\n  We have a large number of individuals who have been waiting a very \nlong time in the confirmation process. Tomorrow marks the 750th day \nthat Peter Keisler has waited for Committee action. Steve Matthews in \nthe Fourth Circuit has been waiting 315 days for a hearing, and Judge \nRobert Conrad in the Fourth Circuit from North Carolina has been \nwaiting for a year today.\n  One further comment before yielding to Senator Grassley. There has \nbeen a lot of talk about the so-called Thurmond rule. The contention \nhas been made that there is a rule, articulated by Senator Thurmond, \nwhich dictating that there are no judicial confirmations late in the \nfinal year of a Presidency, not after the summer. Allegedly, the \nconcept was discussed at the Republican National Convention, where \nSenator Thurmond reportedly made a comment, although no quotation is \ndirectly attributable to Senator Thurmond, that they ought to wait \nuntil after the election to see who was elected before there were \nconfirmations of other judges. But the facts are that no such practice \nwas ever implemented. The facts are exactly to the contrary. It is true \nthat on September 10, 1980, Senator Thurmond blocked 13 pending \njudicial nominations, but he gave his reasons why. He said: ``Our \ninvestigation has not been entirely completed on some of them.'' A week \nlater, on September 17, Senator Thurmond withdrew the objections, and \nall 10 were confirmed on September 29. Then, the most conclusive \nevidence that there is no Thurmond rule was pertains to the situation \nwith now-Supreme Court Justice Breyer. Justice Breyer was nominated by \nPresident Carter on November 13, 1980, after President-elect Reagan had \nbeen elected. So there was a vacancy that, had the Senate not confirmed \nhim, would have awaited the next President. The nomination was acted \nupon very promptly, with the receipt by the Senate on November 13 and a \nhearing on November 17, even faster than the 1-week rule, which was \nwaived. Breyer was reported out by committee on December 1 and \nconfirmed by the full Senate on December 9. So how can you have a \nThurmond rule if a circuit vacancy on the First Circuit is confirmed, \neven after a new President has been elected?\n  The evidence shows there are many confirmations late in the \nPresidential\n\n[[Page S6897]]\n\nterm. I cite only a few. There was an additional circuit nominee \nconfirmed in September of 1980. After September 1, 1984, 5 circuit \ncourt and 12 district court judges were confirmed. After September 1, \n1988, five circuit court and nine district judges were confirmed. After \nSeptember 1, 1992, three circuit court and nine district court judges \nwere confirmed.\n  We have found, understandably, that arguments are made, depending \nupon what suits the purpose of the particular advocate. But, it is \nworth noting that Senator Leahy said on May 4, 2000:\n\n       There is a myth that judges are not traditionally confirmed \n     in Presidential election years. That is not true. Similarly, \n     Senator Reid said, on March 7 of 2000:\n       It is a myth that judges are not traditionally confirmed in \n     Presidential election years. It is simply not true.\n\n  So, in the year 2000, when the Democrats sought to confirm President \nClinton's nominees, reference was made to the fact that the Senate \nregularly confirms judicial nominations late in the term--the substance \nof the so-called Thurmond rule.\n  We ought to try to move, I suggest, away from positions where we \narticulate a view when it suits our purpose and then articulate a \ndifferent view later. We ought to try to come to a point in this body \nwhere we understand reciprocity and understand that the rules ought to \napply both ways. There is no Thurmond rule for Democrats when \nRepublicans are in control and there is a Democratic President, and \nthere is no Thurmond rule when the situation is reversed.\n  We have a similar situation, which is tearing at the heart of Senate \nprocedures, where in modern times both Republican and Democratic \nleaders have adopted a process of taking procedural steps to prevent \namendments from being offered. That practice has been engaged in by \nSenator Mitchell for the Democrats, Senator Lott and Senator Frist for \nthe Republicans, and now, more by Senator Reid for the Democrats.\n\n  Bills come to the floor, and the traditional right of a Senator to \noffer amendments is foreclosed by this procedural device, and the \nresponse is a filibuster. Senator Reid then points to Senator \nMcConnell, saying that the filibuster is blocking Senate action. \nSenator McConnell points to Senator Reid saying that the filibuster is \nonly in response to filling the tree.\n  These are just a couple of examples where positions are taken. And, \nit is understandable that they are taken to promote whatever objective \nSenators want at any particular time. But, I suggest the interests of \nthe public and the procedures of the Senate would be much better served \nif we accepted principles and applied them to Democrats when it \nbenefits Democrats and applied them to Republicans when it benefits \nRepublicans. It is my hope, to repeat--which I do not like to do--that \nwe are going to have to find a way out of this impasse, and we are \ngoing to find a way to restore some comity and to confirm judges in \nplaces where there are judicial emergencies and the public is suffering \nso that we do not repeat this cycle of recidivism and set the stage for \nthe next Congress and the Congress after that to continue this \nnefarious practice which is harmful to the public.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n       Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to ask if the \n     Senator would yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do yield.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, he talked about \njudicial emergencies. I think it would be good if the public knew what \na judicial emergency is and why it is so important that we emphasize \ngetting those positions filled ahead of others and why there should be \nno excuse for holding them up, if you have any respect for the work of \nthe judicial branch of Government.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa for the \nquestion.\n  A judicial emergency has been defined by the Administrative Office of \nthe Courts according to the backlog of cases and depending on the \ncircumstances, as to how long litigants have had to wait. What it means \nin real world terms is, if somebody is injured, for example, in an \nautomobile collision--a diversity case--and is out of work and has big \nmedical expenses, that person's case does not come to trial and he does \nnot get a decision as to what has happened. Or it may be a matter \ninvolving jobs in a community where there is an antitrust case, and it \nis delayed, both in the trial court and on appeal. But, every one of \nthese judicial emergencies--and I put them in the Record before, but I \nask unanimous consent to have them printed again at the conclusion of \nour discussion here--means that people are waiting to have their \ncontroversies decided, and they are undergoing very difficult \ncircumstances being out of work, no salary, medical expenses, \nillustratively, while they wait for their case to come up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further--and I \nonly remember two names, but I think these two names would permit me to \nask a question that I think is legitimate and that the public ought to \ntake into consideration as to the holding up of those nominations--I \nremember the Senator mentioned a Peter Keisler, who has been waiting \nfor 750 days, and Robert Conrad, who also has been waiting for a long \nperiod of time, 365 days. Now, obviously, if these nominations are not \nbeing processed, there must be people who think these individuals are \nincompetent and should not be nominated. So what are the accusations of \nincompetency for these individuals not being approved?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, responding to the question, there are no \nallegations of incompetency. Quite to the contrary. Nobody is saying \nthat.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, if they are competent, shouldn't they be \napproved?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, they should be. The reason they have not been \napproved is that there is an interest in holding open these vacancies \nin the event there is a President of the other party to fill them with \nthe Democrats. Nobody is making any bones about that, I say to Senator \nGrassley. That is the obvious and admitted reason.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So I draw the conclusion, I say to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, that the people blocking these nominations really are not \nconcerned at all about the efficient operation of the judicial branch \nof Government. But we should get our job done and confirm these \nnominees because that is what it takes for the judicial branch to get \ntheir work done. The judiciary needs to have the personnel to get their \njob done.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I respond by saying to the Senator from \nIowa that is a very harsh accusation, very harsh accusation he has just \nmade. But, since he has made it, I will say that it is true.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see the distinguished ranking member \nof the Judiciary Committee is here and has been so experienced in these \nmatters and been through the wars and battles over nominations for some \ntime. And we have had a good bit of that, but we have also, in the end, \nhad a pretty decent understanding of the responsibilities the committee \nhas to honor the President's nominations and give them an up-or-down \nvote and not just shut down the process.\n  I guess my question would be, I say to Senator Specter, Senator \nLeahy's statement at the Judiciary June 12 executive business meeting--\nhe announced he was invoking the so-called Thurmond Rule, and he said: \n``We are now way past the time of a Thurmond rule named after Senator \nThurmond when he was in the minority, and I'm trying to respect that. \nWe are still putting judges through. But I must note this point; \nfurther judges will be moved only by a consent of the two leaders of \nthe Senate and the two leaders of this committee,'' which, of course, \nsays fundamentally that unless Senator Leahy and Senator Reid approve \nof a nominee, from this point on, it is not moving forward.\n  I know you conducted an open hearing and discussion of that. I ask \nthe Senator basically how he feels about the definition of the \n``Thurmond Rule'' and what it really means and whether\n\n[[Page S6898]]\n\nwe are doing something that is unprecedented here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for the \nquestion. There was a Republican forum on Monday of this week to \nexamine the Thurmond Rule. I had notified Chairman Leahy of it and had \nwritten to him about it, and I ask unanimous consent to have that \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 2008.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pat: Following up on our telephone conversation late \n     yesterday afternoon in which I advised that I would raise no \n     technical objection to the Thursday hearing, I am amplifying \n     my comments about the forum which the Senate Republican \n     Conference has scheduled for next Monday, July 14th, at 2:00 \n     P.M. in SR-385.\n       That Republican forum, one in a series, will deal with the \n     issue of the so-called Thurmond Rule. As I mentioned to you \n     on the phone yesterday, it seems to me that is one which \n     could benefit from participation by Democratic members of the \n     Judiciary Committee if there is any interest on your part in \n     doing so.\n       Obviously, there is a fuller development of any issue when \n     there are pros and cons; and, not unexpectedly, the \n     Republican view is there is no rule, Thurmond or otherwise, \n     to preclude confirmation of judges this year.\n       Distinguished experts have been invited as follows: \n     Professor John McGinnis, Northwestern Law School; Mr. Roscoe \n     Howard, former U.S. Attorney, District of Columbia; David \n     Bohm, Assistant Executive Director of the North Carolina Bar \n     Association; Mr. Steve Rutkus, Congressional Research \n     Service.\n       If there is any interest on your side of the aisle or if \n     you would like to add an additional witness (witnesses), we \n     would be pleased to try to accommodate.\n       My best.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. During the course of that forum, to answer the question \ndirectly from the Senator from Alabama, we had an expert from the \nCongressional Research Service--the nonpartisan body--come in to trace \nthe origins of the so-called Thurmond rule. He stated that it arose \nback in the Republican Convention in 1980, when Senator Thurmond raised \nthe possibility of holding up confirmations until after the election, \nbut it was never done.\n  The facts are that there were 10 district court judges confirmed in \nSeptember of 1980, and now-Justice Breyer was nominated to the First \nCircuit by President Carter after the election, on November 13, and was \nconfirmed in December 1980. Another circuit judge was confirmed after \nSeptember of 1980.\n  I put in the Record earlier a litany of district and circuit judges \nconfirmed after September in the last year of a Presidential term. I \nalso put into the Record statements which had been made by Senator Reid \nand Senator Leahy that there was no practice, no rule of not confirming \njudges at the last part of a President's term, say after Labor Day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague would yield for a \nquestion.\n  I would like to ask our distinguished ranking member of the \ncommittee, aren't there several well-qualified judicial nominees \ncurrently pending in the Judiciary Committee who have been denied fair \nup-and-down votes? For example, Mr. Peter Keisler, the former Acting \nAttorney General, has been rated unanimously ``well qualified'' by the \nAmerican Bar Association and has earned bipartisan praise from \nattorneys, professors, and even editorial pages. I know the Washington \nPost and the L.A. Times have praised his nomination, calling him a \n``moderate conservative'' and a ``highly qualified nominee'' who \n``certainly warrants confirmation.'' Notwithstanding those outstanding \nqualifications, tomorrow, I believe, will mark 750 days that Mr. \nKeisler has been waiting for a committee vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, responding to the question, the Senator \nfrom Arizona is correct. Peter Keisler has been praised in all quarters \nfor his capabilities. He served as Assistant Attorney General and as \nActing Attorney General. He has drawn editorial praise and is extremely \nwell qualified, both academically and professionally, and is simply \nbeing held up because at one time in the past there was a Republican \nconcern about the need for additional judges on the Circuit Court for \nthe District of Columbia. And, that issue has since been satisfied.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire of my colleague further on \nthat precise point?\n  With regard to the filling of the circuit court for the District of \nColumbia, we had testimony by Mr. Roscoe Howard, very recently in the \nSenate Republican caucus forum on judicial confirmations--this was just \nlast Monday--that the numbers the majority relies on for that argument \nthat the Senator identified are outdated. He noted that the Judicial \nConference recently issued statistics indicating that in recent years \nthe DC Circuit Court's docket has increased and that it has been \nprocessing appeals more slowly because of additional workload, and this \nhas corresponded with an increase in the median wait time between the \nnotice of appeal and disposition of a case, which, in fact, he notes is \nthe longest since 1995.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is correct. The \ncurrent statistics show a need for another judge there, and there is no \nreason to withhold the confirmation of Peter Keisler, except to keep a \nvacancy open with the hope of having the new President of the other \nparty fill it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, just one more point.\n  I also note, when I heard Mr. Howard's testimony demonstrating \nfurther the need to fill this seat, he noted that Judge Raymond \nRandolph of the DC Circuit recently announced he would be taking senior \nstatus on November 1 of this year, which means the seat to which Mr. \nKeisler is nominated is actually the 10th seat on that circuit. Is that \nnot correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Arizona is correct again.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, again I say to Senator Specter, just to \nconfirm my understanding here, in addition to Judge Randolph, Judge \nDavid Sentelle currently is eligible for senior status. Next year, \nJudge David Tatel and Judge Judith Ann Rogers will be eligible for \nsenior status. Judge Karen Henderson and Judge Douglas Ginsburg will be \neligible in 2009 and 2011, respectively. Am I correct on that?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is correct, yes.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                       CURRENT JUDICIAL EMERGENCIES WITH NOMINEES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Nominee                            ABA               Date vacant      Nomination date         Senate action               Pending\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWilliam E.

Mr. President, it seems to me, given these facts, it is even \nmore imperative that Peter Keisler be at least voted on, and I would \nargue confirmed, to the DC Circuit, and it seems to me no other reasons \nthan purely political motivations seem to be blocking his confirmation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask Senator Kyl, aren't there a lot of \nother well-qualified nominees being blocked as well?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the answer to my colleague from Iowa is yes. \nMr. Steve Matthews of South Carolina and\n\n[[Page S6899]]\n\nJudge Robert Conrad of North Carolina, for example, are both impressive \nnominees who are exactly the kind of judges the severely understaffed \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals needs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How close are they to being confirmed?\n  Mr. KYL. That is a very good question. Judge Conrad has been waiting \nfor a hearing for 365 days. Today is the 1-year anniversary of his \nnomination, even though he was unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by \nthe American Bar Association, and Mr. Matthews has been waiting for a \nhearing for 315 days.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask Senator Kyl, didn't Chairman Leahy and the other \nDemocratic members of the Judiciary Committee say that a unanimous \n``well qualified'' rating by the American Bar Association is somewhat \nof a ``gold standard'' by which all nominees should be judged?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. I guess I would say that was then, this is now. But in \naddition to the ABA rating, I note that Judge Conrad in particular \nmeets the other three criteria that Chairman Leahy has stated are his \nstandards for quick confirmation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Of course. Isn't he nominated to fill a seat deemed ``a \njudicial emergency'' by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the \nCourts?\n  Mr. KYL. The answer is yes. Chairman Leahy has said--and I think all \nof us would agree--that judicial emergencies should be addressed \nquickly. In fact, in a press release in January of last year, he \nstated:\n\n       There are several outstanding judicial emergencies. . . . I \n     hope to expeditiously address some of these emergency \n     vacancies in the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. We have always had an understanding around here \nthat if both Senators of the home State supported a nominee, they would \nmove forward. Doesn't Judge Conrad satisfy this third prong of the \n``Leahy standard'' for confirming judges since he has the strong \nsupport of both his home State Senators?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. Both Judge Matthews and Judge Conrad have the support \nof their home State Senators. In fact, on October 2 of last year, \nSenators Burr and Dole sent a letter to Senator Leahy asking for a \nhearing for Judge Conrad, and they spoke on his behalf at a press \nconference on June 19 that featured numerous friends and colleagues of \nJudge Conrad's who had traveled all the way up from North Carolina to \nDC to offer their support for his nomination. On April 15, 2008, \nSenators Burr, Dole, Graham, and DeMint sent a letter to Senator Leahy \nasking for a hearing for Judge Conrad and for Mr. Matthews.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I believe it is also true, that Judge Conrad meets the \nfourth and final prong of Chairman Leahy's standard because he \npreviously received bipartisan approval by the Judiciary Committee and \nthe Senate when he was confirmed by a noncontroversial voice vote to be \na U.S. Attorney in North Carolina and when he was confirmed by voice \nvote to the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. \nIt seems to me that these bipartisan voice votes indicate that Judge \nConrad is a noncontroversial consensus nominee.\n  Mr. KYL. I absolutely agree with that assessment. Those are the \nconsiderations that underscore my great regret that no nominees were on \nthe agenda for the executive business meeting of the Judiciary \nCommittee this morning.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, to my colleague from Iowa, I asked \nearlier of Senator Specter regarding his statement that Chairman Leahy \nwas saying he was going to enforce a Thurmond rule and that nobody \nwould be moved henceforth--no nominee--unless both he and the ranking \nmember and the majority leader and the Republican leader each approved. \nSo I ask Senator Grassley how he feels about that statement.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, I have had a chance to review that, and I can say \nthat as you know, in May of 2000, during President Clinton's last year \nin office, Senator Leahy, referring to the Thurmond rule, said:\n\n       There is a myth that judges are not traditionally confirmed \n     in presidential election years. That is not true. Recall that \n     64 judges were confirmed in 1980, 44 in 1984, 42 in 1988 when \n     a Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed Reagan nominees \n     and, as I have noted, 66 in 1992 when a Democratic majority \n     in the Senate confirmed 66 Bush nominees.\n\n  That is the end of the Leahy quote in regard to the Thurmond rule.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator is correct. He has been a long-time \nsenior member of the Judiciary Committee who is active in that entire \nprocess. In fact, Senator Reid, now the majority leader, made a similar \nstatement in March of 2000 and those statements are more accurate \ndescriptions of the history of the Thurmond rule over the past 25 \nyears.\n  Isn't it also true that the majority asserts the purported Thurmond \nrule originated in the summer of 1980 when Senator Thurmond was the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, the answer is yes, of course. Let me explain that \nSenate Democrats allege that Republicans, then in the minority and \nanticipating a change in power in the 1980 election, stalled the \napproval of President Carter's judicial nominees. The Majority points \nto a discussion at an executive business meeting which took place on \nSeptember 10, 1980, when Ranking Member Thurmond asked Chairman Kennedy \nto hold over 13 nominees for 1 week because their background \ninvestigations were not complete. However, this allegation is not \naccurate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, is it not true, Senator Grassley, based on your \nexperience, that it is standard procedure to hold nominees over until \ntheir background checks have been completed?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, it is. In fact, a 1-week holdover in the Judiciary \nCommittee is any Senator's prerogative--in fact, prerogatives I have \nused a few times myself--and over the last 2 years, the Majority has \nheld over virtually all of President Bush's nominees for 1 week before \na committee vote. Do you recall whether the Senate later confirmed any \nof these nominees who were held over?\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I think that is, in fact, true. The Senate \nconfirmed 10 of the 13 nominees, and Senator Thurmond stated at an \nexecutive business meeting that the committee did not report favorably \non the other three because: ``The minority had some questions of \nsubstance that would have to be discussed.''\n  The committee did not hold another executive business meeting that \nyear, so the other three nominees were not considered again.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think it is pretty clear then, Senator Sessions, \nreferring to the accusations made about Senator Thurmond, it doesn't \nsound to me as though Senator Thurmond was blocking nominees in \nanticipation of an upcoming election.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No, it doesn't. In fact, the record shows that on \nSeptember 29, 1980, in a floor statement, Senator DeConcini, a \nDemocratic member of the committee, commended Senator Thurmond for:\n\n       demonstrating leadership on the Committee on the Judiciary, \n     a willingness to take case-by-case appointments, obviously \n     from a different administration than he might prefer, but \n     willing to proceed with the advancement of these \n     appointments, because the need of the judiciary does come \n     before party preference.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let me also point to a nonpartisan source. Didn't Mr. \nSteve Rutkus from the Congressional Research Service testify at the \nSenate Republican Conference's forum on the judicial nomination process \non Monday that the facts do not support a Thurmond rule? Would that be \ncorrect? Is that the way you understand it?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is what he said. In addition, between June 1 and \nSeptember 1 of 1980, President Carter's last year in office, didn't the \nSenate confirm four circuit court nominees and 15 district court \nnominees?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. The record shows the Senate did. That is entirely \ntrue.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In fact, wasn't one of those circuit nominees ACLU \ngeneral counsel--the American Civil Liberties Union general counsel, \nRuth Bader Ginsburg, who was later confirmed to the DC Circuit on June \n18, 1980?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. It doesn't sound to me like the conservative \nSenator from South Carolina was using any power he had on the Judiciary \nCommittee to hold up a person who has turned out to be very much a \njudicial activist. I would say even more remarkable, in regard to your \nstatement, after September 1, 1980, the Senate confirmed 11 district \ncourt nominees and 2\n\n[[Page S6900]]\n\nadditional circuit court nominees, including Stephen Reinhardt, who has \ngone on to earn a reputation as one of the Nation's most liberal \njurists. The other post-September circuit court confirmation was that \nof Stephen Breyer, who at that time was Senator Kennedy's chief counsel \non the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, Senator Grassley, I know, is aware of that, but \nwasn't Mr. Breyer nominated by President Carter on November 13, 1980, \nafter President Carter had lost the election to President Ronald \nReagan? And didn't the Senate Democrats, who had just lost control of \nthe Senate, hold a swift confirmation vote on Breyer during that lame \nduck session on December 9, 1980?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is right. In fact, the Senate confirmed a total of \n10 circuit court nominees and 53 district court nominees during 1980, \nPresident Carter's last year in office. And 1980 was not an aberration. \nAs Senator Leahy noted in 2000, the pattern continued in subsequent \nelection years. Also in 2000, the year Senator Leahy called the \nThurmond rule a ``myth'' when he was complaining about the pace of \njudicial confirmations, the Senate confirmed 8 circuit court nominees \nand 31 district court nominees.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleague from Iowa. He has been a stalwart, \ncapable member of this committee for many years. He is known for plain \nspeaking and honest talk. I think that is what we have had here. It is \na shame we are looking at an unprecedented circumstance. I note we are \nput in a position where I think it is difficult to respond, other than \nto go to the American people, because what Senator Leahy has done is \nstate that the Thurmond rule is something that it is not and indicate \nthat further judges will be moved only by consent of the two leaders of \nthe Senate and the two leaders of the committee.\n  He made that statement very recently. So it looks as though we are at \na point where the normal procedures of moving judges have been \nabrogated and that it is unlikely additional nominees will be \nconfirmed.\n  I have a few more comments, but my senior colleague Senator Grassley \nis here, and I am glad to yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No. Go ahead.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I wish to talk a little bit about \nRobert Conrad. I was a U.S. Attorney, Federal prosecutor for 12 years, \nand an assistant U.S. attorney for 2\\1/2\\ years. It was a great job, a \nwonderful opportunity to serve the public.\n  I remember not too long after I came here, President Clinton was \nembroiled in quite a number of scandals and allegations were made. \nJanet Reno was then the Attorney General of the United States, and she \ndecided to appoint a counsel to conduct an investigation of allegations \nagainst President Clinton, as I recall. I don't remember what the \nsubstance of the complaints were at that time. There were a lot of them \non different things. She looked all over the United States of America \nto pick a top prosecutor, somebody who had credibility, and judgment \nshe could trust to undertake this difficult thing that the entire \nNation was watching, and do you know who she selected? She selected Mr. \nConrad of North Carolina. He was then an assistant U.S. attorney and he \nundertook this challenge.\n  He investigated at some length, and all I recall about it was that he \ndid not choose to indict anyone. I remember he testified before our \ncommittee and he was such a straight shooter. He was so mature in his \nresponses to the questions. He was a relatively young person, but an \nexperienced attorney in the Department of Justice. He did a good job. \nHe was asked a lot of tough questions because people were concerned \nabout those issues. He handled them well. So I have a vivid memory of \nthat. Janet Reno said her respect for him continued to grow throughout \nhis service in that capacity, in that most difficult challenge that she \nasked him to undertake. Later, he was confirmed to be a Federal judge \nin North Carolina and has served there and has moved up.\n  Now he is the chief presiding district judge in the State of North \nCarolina. President Bush, of a different party than Janet Reno, chose \nhim and nominated him to be a judge on the Court of Appeals, one step \nbelow the U.S. Supreme Court, an important and prestigious position, \nand that went forward. Now, 365 days have gone by and he has not even \nhad a hearing.\n  Let me interject and say those of us on the conservative side have \nfelt many times that the American Bar Association tends to favor \nliberal judges, but I value its opinion.\n  I always have. I think it is an important opinion because they talk \nto lawyers throughout the community and judges throughout the \ncommunity. There are about 15 members on this committee. Then the \njudges come together and review all of the reports and interviews from \nthe most prominent lawyers in the community, fellow judges, and State \njudges. They say: What kind of person is he? Does he have good \njudgment? Has he handled his docket well? Is he a man of integrity and \nability? Does he understand complex rules of law?\n  Those are the kinds of things they talk about. They do an evaluation. \nMost nominees are not rated ``well qualified,'' and usually there is a \ngood bit of dispute within the communities about what kinds of \nrecommendations should occur. That committee met and discussed it, and \nthey unanimously rated him ``well qualified,'' which is the highest \nrating the American Bar Association can give to a nominee for judicial \noffice. He served ably as an assistant U.S. attorney. He handled one of \nthe most important cases in the entire Nation as an assistant U.S. \nattorney. The Democratic Attorney General looked over the entire United \nStates and reached out and picked him to handle a case involving the \nPresident of the United States of America, and she had nothing but high \ncompliments for his performance. The ABA has evaluated him. He was \nconfirmed previously as a district judge, became the presiding district \njudge for that area, and has now been nominated to be a Federal circuit \njudge. He has been denied even a hearing, even though he got a \nunanimous ``well qualified.''\n  A lot of people think this is just politics. But I hope the American \npeople understand that it is not just politics. This Nation has as its \nbedrock foundation for our prosperity and our liberty a belief in the \nrule of law. It is something we inherited even before we became a \nnation. Those of us on this side believe a Federal judge should not be \nan activist. A Federal judge should not be attempting to carry out some \npersonal agenda. A Federal judge should be a neutral umpire to decide \ncases in a neutral and fair way. The policy decisions should be made by \nthe State legislatures or the Federal Congress or the President of the \nUnited States.\n  I feel as though we need to understand that there is a clear \ndifference between the kind of judges our Democratic colleagues tend to \nfavor for the bench and those President Bush has been nominating. They \nthink Judge Conrad is not activist enough. They think he won't promote \ntheir agenda, which they are not oftentimes able to win with at the \nballot box. His nomination has been blocked. I don't appreciate that. \nHe is a fabulous nominee who is highly respected by Democratic Members. \nWe had a wonderful hearing where a whole roomful of people came from \nNorth Carolina to testify on his behalf, to plead with the Senate to \ngive this man an up-or-down vote. No, they invoke the Thurmond rule--\nand that is not an accurate invocation of the Thurmond rule--as an \nexcuse to block him.\n  There are already four vacancies on the Fourth Circuit, including \nfrom Virginia, down to the Carolinas. He is one of them.\n  I think the man deserves an up-or-down vote. He deserves to be \nconfirmed. We will not have better nominees than Judge Conrad. He has \nproven himself on the bench and as a Federal prosecutor, both times in \nFederal court, where he will now be called upon to serve.\n  I have to tell you, I will add one more thing on why I think he is \nspecial. Judge Conrad was a point guard on the Clemson University \nbasketball team in the Atlantic Coast Conference. You have to make \ndecisions in that job. He was an outstanding academic All-American. I \nthink the man is fabulous, and he ought to be confirmed. I am upset \nthat he has not been.\n  I say the same for Mr. Matthews, also nominated to fill one of those \nfour vacancies on the Fourth Circuit, and Mr. Keisler, who was rated \nunanimously\n\n[[Page S6901]]\n\n``well qualified'' for the DC Circuit. They have been waiting hundreds \nof days, and it is not right. They ought to be confirmed.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue that is important \nto my constituency--the confirmation of qualified judicial nominees. I \nthank the Senator from Alabama for his explanation of what is happening \nin his area. I want to speak a little bit on what is happening in my \narea.\n  I have heard the majority leader say that when he hears from \nconstituents, it is about energy, housing, and other issues; but he \nnever hears about judges. I can tell you my experience is different. \nYes, constituents talk about energy and health care and housing and \nabout the economy, but they also bring up the need to confirm qualified \njudicial nominees.\n  I am specifically before the Senate to ask my colleagues to consider \nconfirming a qualified candidate for my home State of Wyoming. The \nnominee is Richard Honaker. Despite the fact that he was rated \nunanimously ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association, and \ndespite the fact that he has strong bipartisan support in Wyoming, he \nhas been pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee for 486 days. \nThat is just the committee. He isn't even to the floor yet--486 days in \ncommittee. It seems as though they could at least do an up-or-down vote \nand get that decided instead of just keeping him in limbo.\n  Why has Mr. Honaker's nomination been pending so long? He meets all \nof the tests that have been laid out for qualified judicial nominees. \nAs I mentioned, the ABA has given Mr. Honaker its highest rating of \nunanimously ``well qualified.'' He has the support of both home State \nSenators. My colleague will be speaking to this shortly as well. In \nfact, he not only has the support of myself and Senator Barrasso, his \nname was submitted to the White House for consideration by my friend, \nthe late Senator Craig Thomas. Senator Thomas submitted Mr. Honaker's \nname after it was recommended to him by a panel Wyoming lawyers who \nevaluated about fifty individuals who were interested in serving on the \nFederal bench. Richard was the unquestionable choice of those \nattorneys. This wasn't the unquestionable choice of Senator Thomas; it \nwas the unquestionable choice of a panel of attorneys who chose him \nfrom a whole range of people who were interested.\n\n  My recollection is that this is the first time that a Republican \nSenator has ever nominated a trial lawyer for a judgeship from Wyoming.\n  Mr. Honaker doesn't only have the support of Republicans, his \nnomination is supported by former Wyoming Democratic Governor Mike \nSullivan, who also worked as the Ambassador to Ireland for President \nBill Clinton. He is an attorney operating in Wyoming. Mr. Honaker is \nsupported by Robert Schuster, another attorney, a former committeeman \nof the Democratic National Committee, who was a Democratic nominee for \nthe House of Representatives. He has the support of Lee Reese, the \nPresident of the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 1499.\n  With all that in mind, you would think Mr. Honaker would be confirmed \nquickly. But, no, his nomination has been pending before the Judiciary \nCommittee for more than a year because of an action he took more than \n20 years ago as a Democratic State legislator. Acting as a State \nlegislator on behalf of his constituents who are generally pro-life, \nMr. Honaker drafted a bill called the Human Life Protection Act. The \nbill failed in committee and didn't move forward.\n  Mr. Honaker has had no involvement in the abortion issue for more \nthan 20 years. Yet that is being used as a litmus test. Some liberal \ngroups are claiming he is an extremist and saying he would come to the \nbench to overturn Roe v. Wade. They obviously don't know him because, \nif they did, they would understand that Mr. Honaker knows the \ndifference between acting as a legislator and acting as a jurist. He \nknows there is a difference. He gave sworn testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on February 12, 2008, saying that he would uphold \nthe precedent of Roe v. Wade.\n  Yet even with that information, he is being blocked from a vote in \nthe Judiciary Committee. It is even more ironic that he is being held \nup because of legislation he introduced because the pro-choice \nlegislators who blocked the bill he sponsored in the Wyoming \nLegislature support his nomination to the Federal bench.\n  We are in a dangerous place when it comes to confirmation of Federal \njudges in the Senate. With Mr. Honaker's nomination, my colleagues are \nsaying that we do have a litmus test for judges: If you have ever been \ninvolved in the abortion issue, you cannot be confirmed as a judge, \nregardless of how you were involved, and regardless of your \nqualifications. I know this is the case with Mr. Honaker's nomination \nbecause, if my colleagues looked at the other legislation he sponsored \nin the Wyoming State Legislature, they would see that much of it is \nmore favorable to their policies than the policies of the Republicans.\n  Mr. Honaker is well qualified to be a Federal judge, as evidenced by \nthe strong support he has from a diverse group of people in Wyoming. He \ndeserves to be confirmed. I hope my colleagues will look beyond one \nbill he introduced as a legislator 20 years ago and give his nomination \nthe consideration it deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I am here today to ask the Judiciary \nCommittee to hold a simple vote--hold a vote on the nomination of \nRichard Honaker, to be a U.S. District Judge for the District of \nWyoming.\n  Mr. Honaker was recommended to President Bush by Senators Thomas and \nEnzi on January 10, 2007.\n  The recommendation occurred following an extensive vetting process in \nWyoming by a committee that was formed by Senator Thomas. This \ncommittee consisted of a diverse group of attorneys from across the \nState. They reviewed and they vetted all of the applicants.\n  Nearly four dozen attorneys from around the State of Wyoming \nexpressed an interest in this position. Mr. Honaker was selected from a \nvery competitive and highly qualified pool of Wyoming attorneys. \nPresident Bush agreed with the recommendation, and he sent Mr. \nHonaker's name and nomination to the Senate March 19, 2007--over a year \nago.\n  Senators Thomas and Enzi and I all notified the committee over time \nthat the home State Senators support this nomination.\n  Well, the nomination languished in the Senate Judiciary Committee \nuntil February 12 of this year. That is when a nomination hearing was \nfinally held. Four nominees were considered that day. Mr. Honaker was \nthe only nominee at the hearing that received the ``gold star'' seal of \napproval by the American Bar Association, and that is a unanimous \n``well qualified'' rating.\n  The American Bar Association interviewed more than 50 Wyoming \nattorneys and judges to come to the conclusion that Mr. Honaker is well \nqualified to serve on the bench.\n  Despite this unanimous support of the home State Senators and the \nAmerican Bar Association, Mr. Honaker continues to be denied a vote in \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  To put Mr. Honaker's situation into context, two of the other \nnominees who appeared at that February 12 hearing received a committee \nvote and were approved by the Senate back in April.\n  Mr. Honaker is an outstanding attorney. He is widely regarded by his \npeers. It is evidenced by the fact that he is the first attorney in the \nhistory of Wyoming, in our 118 years of statehood, to serve Wyoming \nboth as president of the Wyoming State Bar Association and the Wyoming \nTrial Lawyers Association. He has earned the respect of the legal \ncommunity.\n\n  As I mentioned, the Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary of \nthe American Bar Association unanimously--unanimously--voted that Mr. \nHonaker is well qualified. His 30-plus years of legal work is \nexemplary. There is no question at all that he is ready to fill the \nseat for which he has been nominated.\n  I know Mr. Honaker. I respect him as an individual. I admire his \nlegal abilities and his passion and his love of the\n\n[[Page S6902]]\n\nlaw. That respect is shared by many of Wyoming's finest legal minds. \nWords I have heard from members of the Wyoming bar to describe Mr. \nHonaker: bright, fair, civil, ethical, passionate about his clients, \nand devoted to the law. He expects the same of others that he requires \nof himself: be well prepared, observe the rules of courtroom procedure \nand decorum, treat every person in the courtroom--whether lawyer, \nlitigant, witness, or juror--treat every person in the courtroom with \nthe greatest measure of courtesy and respect.\n  There is no more qualified person to serve on the Federal bench in \nthe District of Wyoming than Richard Honaker. You don't have to take my \nword for it. Ask the attorneys of Wyoming or of the American Bar \nAssociation. This outstanding nominee deserves the courtesy of a vote \nin the committee and consideration by the full Senate. That courtesy is \nlong overdue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6902-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6902-S6903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this morning there was some remarkable \ntestimony given by Dr. Peter Orszag, the head of the Congressional \nBudget Office, which, in my view, is going to set the bar for how this \nCongress contains skyrocketing health care costs. Dr. Orszag has zeroed \nin on the question of health care costs, as my friend from Colorado \nknows, saying that escalating health care costs are essentially the \npremier determiner of this country's fiscal condition. So when Dr. \nOrszag, in effect, lays out what it is going to take for America and \nthe Congress to contain medical costs, it seems to me that is a real \nwake-up call for this body and for the country.\n  What Dr. Orszag did is to spell out the extent of the inefficiencies \nin American health care. We are going to spend this year about $2.3 \ntrillion on medical care. Dr. Orszag has said that the system is now so \nriddled with inefficiency that perhaps $700 billion of that $2.3 \ntrillion is going to be spent on care and services that is of \nrelatively little value as it does not contribute toward improved \nhealth outcomes.\n  Given this enormous economic challenge for our country--and, in \neffect, economic insecurity to a great extent is determined by rising \nhealth costs and rising gasoline prices--I wanted to get to the bottom \nof what the Congressional Budget Office thinks is going to be necessary \nto contain medical costs. So what I asked Dr. Orszag, specifically, was \nabout his sense of what it will take to bend the health cost curve \ndownward. Dr. Orszag said, in response to my questions, that it is \ngoing to take two things:\n  First, it is going to be essential to demonstrate to our people very \ndirectly how much these inefficiencies cost them, for example, in their \nreduced take-home pay at work. Second, Dr. Orszag made it very clear \nthat to contain cost and to wring out these inefficiencies, it is going \nto be necessary for the Congress to pass health reform legislation so \nthat in a more efficient, more fair health care system our people will \nhave a new financial incentive to select health care carefully.\n  The reason I say Dr. Orszag set the bar today for containing health \ncosts is because it is clear there are a lot of ideas for how to go \nabout this task. I know the Senator from Colorado is very interested in \nhealth information technology, for example--virtually all Senators \nare--and all those new approaches are going to be very important. But I \nasked Dr. Orszag was it the only way that you could contain costs, to \ntake those two steps--one to make sure people see directly what they \nlose if we continue a system with all these inefficiencies; and, \nsecond, what happens if there are no new financial incentives--and Dr. \nOrszag said very specifically that to contain medical costs you need to \ntake those two steps: demonstrate to people what they are losing and \ngive them new incentives to hold down costs.\n  Now, I have been honored to be able to join with 16 Members of this \nbody, 8 Democrats and 8 Republicans, around legislation that is built \non the two principles that Dr. Orszag affirmed today are going to be \nessential to contain health care costs. We make sure everybody \nunderstands what the implications are for propping up all these \ninefficiencies in their wages, because for the first few years under \nour legislation we would stipulate that workers are entitled to the \ncash value of what their employer is now spending on health care. So \nwith that requirement, we address what Dr. Orszag has said is \nessential--to demonstrate to workers what they lose out on with the \nstatus quo.\n  The second thing we do in our legislation, which tracks Dr. Orszag's \nplan to contain costs, is we make sure that in a new system--where \ninsurers have to take all comers, where people are part of a large \ngroup so that they have bargaining power, where there are lower \nadministrative costs because you use the tax system to sign up people, \nand there is uniform billing--we also give a cash reward to individuals \nfor making more careful purchases of their health care.\n  For example: Under our legislation, if their employer has spent \n$15,000 on their particular health care, and the individual worker \neither chooses an employer's package or, say, another package, and the \npackage they chose would cost $14,200, that individual worker has $800 \nin their pocket to go on a great fishing trip in Oregon or Colorado, \nwhere we have some of the best recreation in the country.\n  So in our legislation, by way of giving a reward to workers, a cash \nreward for a careful selection of their health care, we do what Dr. \nOrszag has recommended as the second approach for containing medical \ncosts.\n  I made clear this morning--and I especially appreciate Chairman \nBaucus's leadership because these hearings are a follow-up to our \nFinance Committee summit--and Chairman Baucus has made it clear we are \ngoing to work in a bipartisan way. He and Senator Grassley, in my view, \nare sort of the example of how to work in a bipartisan fashion. I said \nthis morning I think there are probably other approaches that ought to \nbe examined in this whole discussion, but what we do know from this \nmorning is that Dr. Orszag has said you have to have those two \nessentials to contain costs--workers understanding what they lose out \nof the current system and new financial incentives for making careful \npurchases.\n  That is why it seems to me that what Dr. Orszag did today was to set \nthe bar; to, in effect, lay out a vision of what it is going to take to \nhold down medical costs. It seems to me, when we look at the double \nwhammy our people are facing today--the combination of skyrocketing \nmedical bills and getting clobbered at the gasoline pump--we see that \nthose are the two areas where you need to take action.\n  Under the leadership of the Majority Leader, Senator Reid, we are \ngoing to go after those gas price hikes before the Congress breaks for \nthe recess. I am pleased to be part of our caucus's efforts to work on \nthis and pleased that we are reaching out across the aisle so, \nhopefully, there will be bipartisan support for our efforts to hold \ndown gasoline price hikes. But I think we need to start laying out, as \nDr. Orszag did today, the strategy for holding down medical costs.\n  I have been very fortunate to be able to work with Senator Bennett, \nthe Senator from Utah, as part of a group of 16 Senators--8 Democrats \nand 8 Republicans--in what is the first bipartisan effort in the \nhistory of the Senate. This is the first time where there has been a \nsignificant coalition, a bipartisan coalition, working for universal \ncoverage. Today, what Dr. Orszag did was to affirm the guts of what we \nhave been advocating for. He affirmed it specifically, that this was a \nway to achieve the cost containment in our health care system that is \nso essential. There may be other ways, but this is one way to do it. We \nnow have an opportunity over the next few months, as\n\n[[Page S6903]]\n\nwe get ready for a new President, to work together, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to address this critical question.\n\n  I will close with one last comment. On the floor last night were \nSenator Landrieu and Senator Crapo. I am very honored to have both of \nthem as cosponsors of the Healthy Americans Act. We were talking about \nolder workers. Today one of the worst spots to be in is if you are 57 \nor 58 years old and you are laid off from your job, because if you are \nlaid off at 57 or 58, you go off into the broken individual health \ninsurance market. You better not have any illnesses. It is going to be \nhard to get coverage. It is going to be very hard to afford it because \nyou are going to be out on your own rather than in a group. And \nfinally, you are not going to get the tax break, if you are all on your \nown, that you would get if you were with an employer health plan.\n  The Healthy Americans Act addresses each of those three concerns and, \nboy, those are not abstract questions for anybody in Colorado or Oregon \nor Idaho. Ask the GM retirees who got clobbered a few days go. If you \nare 57 or 58 and you are 8 years away from Medicare, you have a lot to \nworry about.\n  Our bipartisan coalition is working, I think, effectively and in the \nbipartisan fashion it is going to take to address those concerns as \nwell.\n  I hope colleagues will reflect on what Dr. Orszag said this morning \nwith respect to cost containment. We will have a lot more discussion in \nthe days ahead about the concerns of older workers, as we started last \nnight with Senator Landrieu and Senator Crapo. We are especially \nthrilled that the distinguished Senator from Colorado is a member of \nthe Finance Committee and I know we will have a chance to work together \non those issues as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6903-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I came to the floor on June 19 to address \nmy colleagues and the Senate about energy prices, as many of us have, \nbecause there is no question that the Senator from Colorado and I, when \nwe go home on the weekends, hear as the No. 1 concern on the part of \nColoradans or Idahoans their energy bill--the price of gas at the pump.\n  We are big western States. We travel long distances. When you roll \ninto a gas station with your Ford F-150 and you start filling it up and \nyou drive away, because it has dual tanks on it, having paid over $100 \nto fill it, you have a problem. You have a problem because you had \nbought that vehicle to facilitate your ranch or your farm or your job \nand you had anticipated that the most you would probably ever pay was \n$25 or $30 to fill up. That is what you budgeted. That is what you \nunderstood the economic impact of that vehicle, necessary to your job \nor your business, would be on your job or your business. But in less \nthan a year, that changed.\n  That is the working man or woman's side of it. What about the soccer \nmom who travels around all over the community every day, dropping off \nher kids and going to the store and picking up goods and services and \ncoming home and all of a sudden having an energy bill in the family \nbudget that she and her husband had never anticipated would be there. \nWe all know their salaries or their jobs are not going to compensate \nthem because they are going to spend $500, $600, $1,000 or $2,000 more \nthis year on their energy bill. That is only at pump, let alone at the \nmeter that monitors the electricity at their home that is going to be \ngoing up; and the natural gas that is going to go through and into \ntheir heating systems and their stoves. That is going to be going up. \nThere is no way for them, other than taking money from something else \nin their life, to offset that impact.\n  Those people such as myself who spend a good deal of time, and have \nfor 28 years, on the issue of energy, were very fearful that a day such \nas today would come, a day of reckoning, a day when our country that, \nalmost 20 years ago, decided it would no longer be a producer but \nbecause of environmental policy and political attitude, we began to \nchange. We decided we would try to offset production with conservation \nand, in large part, we said to the energy-producing segment of our \neconomy it could no longer drill in America, go elsewhere.\n  I will never forget meeting with the President of Amoco in Los \nAngeles about 15 years ago. He opined to me that the day would come \nwhen his company would have to leave this country because it could no \nlonger produce in this country--and that is what happened. And doggone \nit, that is the truth. You can document it. You can see it happening. \nIt happened. We put millions of acres off limits for one reason or \nanother but largely because of an attitude in this country that somehow \nwe were going to muck it up a little bit environmentally and we ought \nto leave it alone and it ought to be pure and it ought to be pristine. \nAnd, oh, by the way, energy is cheap. It was inexpensive at the time \nand we could buy it from somebody else. So basically we set the rest of \nthe world to producing and we became increased consumers and increased \nbuyers of foreign oil.\n  During that last 20-year period, something else began to happen. The \noil we were consuming was no longer owned by companies we had interests \nin, it was owned by nations. It was owned by nations that were \nsometimes friendly to us, sometimes not so friendly to us, but nations \nthat began to recognize they could gain the wealth of America by \nselling it oil because America no longer wanted to produce. We grew \nfrom about 35 percent dependent upon oil when I came to Congress in \n1980, to, today, nearly 70 percent dependent. And those nations have us \nright by the gas nozzle today. They can do what they want. They are \nreaping our wealth at unprecedented rates--$1.2 billion a day--and they \nare turning around and buying back our companies and buying back our \nreal estate with our money. But it is now under their ownership.\n\n  The greatest wealth transfer in the world is taking place as we \nspeak, as America drains itself dry for the need of energy, and a \nCongress unwilling to act responsibly and having failed to act \nresponsibly for the last 20 years. It is a dilemma unparalleled in \nAmerican history.\n  When I came to the floor on June 19, I said there is an old country \nwestern song that says ``a little less talk and a lot more action.'' \nThat was June 19. Now we are into mid-July. Oil prices went up nearly \n$15 more a barrel during that period of time and gas went from about \n$3.90 on average to $4.11 on the pump nationwide. Guess what. We still \ngot a lot more talk but very little action.\n  Why is America angry today at their politician? Because their \npolitician is fearful of action.\n  I once voted to lock up ANWR. I once voted to put off limits drilling \nout on the Outer Continental Shelf. It was for all my environmental \nfriends. How do I change? How do I shift the political gears to meet \nthe American people today who are saying simply go where the oil is, \nexplore and develop and bring it on line. We need it desperately. It is \ndraining our pocketbooks dry.\n  That is the domestic economics side. What about the national security \nside, when we are 70 percent dependent on foreign oil? So it is a \nnational domestic economic issue and it is a U.S. national security \nissue. Guess what, folks. A lot more talk and hardly any action. So \nwhen the President stepped up a month ago and said why don't you in \nCongress lift the ban on Outer Continental Shelf oil drilling, I turned \naround and called the White House and said: Why don't you, Mr. \nPresident? You did it by Executive order a couple of years ago for the \npolitics of Florida. Why don't you act?\n  He did act. He acted last week, in a responsible fashion, to lift the \nExecutive order that limited the exploration\n\n[[Page S6904]]\n\nand development in the Outer Continental Shelf. Guess what happened. \nBetween the combination of a realization that Americans were consuming \nless in the summer of 2008 versus the summer of 2007--down by nearly 15 \npercent because they simply can't afford the oil and the gas anymore--\ncoupled with the President saying to the marketplace, there is a \npotential for development and more production, the oil price began to \nslide. In the last few days it has dropped from $147 to $134. If it \ncontinues to do that, we might see gas prices at the pump slip 15 cents \nor 20 cents. But I doubt that it will unless this Congress acts.\n  The majority leader, the Democratic leader, came to the floor \nyesterday with a bill, 3268. What is it about? He says it is about \nspeculation. What is speculation today? Is speculation the futures \nmarket that anticipates that gas may be going up so you hedge your \ninvestment against the future so you can offset the expense of new \nenergy? Is that speculation or is that wise investment? I don't know. \nBut I do know this, that in the legislation the Democratic leader has \nput up, there is not one drop of new oil in it; not one gallon of new \ngas in it; not one oil rig worth of new production in it.\n  We listened to two experts today who came to the Senate to talk about \nenergy. They said there is no easy way out. You have to have some \nproduction, but you need conservation.\n  OK, look at the speculation side. Create greater transparency. Do all \nof those things. But it is truly a supply-and-demand market today and \nwe are supplying less and demanding more. In this country in the last \n10 years, our demand curve went up dramatically as everybody rolled out \nin their F-150 Ford pickups--and I don't mean to be picking on Ford \nMotor Company or their big SUVs--and they were getting 12 or 15 or 16 \nmiles to the gallon and it was $2 and aren't we having fun, until it \nhit $4. Now they are mad and frustrated and angry and fearful of their \nfuture--and they have a right to be.\n  Many of us believed this day would come; we just didn't know what day \non the calendar it would occur. Because the old principle of supply and \ndemand in the marketplace, you can't divert. It happens. When you are \nsupplying less and demanding more, it happens.\n  Here is a simple formula. Take every oil field in the world today \nthat is producing, that has those big rigs on it pumping the oil--it \ndepletes, meaning it uses up the oil in the strata that is underneath, \nat a rate of 4 percent to 5 percent a year. So the ability to have a \nfield to continue to produce at the level it is begins to decline.\n  On top of that, the world is demanding about 1.5 percent more oil \nevery year than it did the year before. Why? We are growing, we are \nbuying big cars, our economy grows--but something else has happened. \nThere is a new economy across the Pacific known as China. All of a \nsudden, they became consumers of oil. They begin to buy in the world \nmarketplace.\n  Then there is another country further on across Asia known as India. \nThey are consuming more and they are buying out of the same pools we \nare buying out of. All of a sudden the perfect marketplace storm \noccurred. We began to consume a great deal more than we were willing to \nproduce. In this country we were consuming a great deal more than we \nwere willing to produce, so the marketplace looked at it and said: Oh, \nwe have a problem here. All of a sudden those who look at markets began \nto try to protect their future by buying into the future through the \nsystem--with no indication from us that we were going to do what was \nnot politically correct, from the standpoint of our politics back home, \nbut what was politically right for the American consumer; and that is, \nto get us back into the business of production.\n\n  So I am telling the majority leader, you can bring a speculation bill \nto the floor, but this is a Senator who will not support it and will \nnot vote for it if it does not have production in it. We cannot talk \nour way out of this one, we cannot manipulate our way out of this \nproblem. We have to produce our way out of this problem, and we have to \nconserve our way out of this problem.\n  Is it not interesting that when the world market began to discover \nthat Americans had tightened their belts because they could no longer \nafford the gas at the pump and the consumption rate from last summer to \nthis summer is down 15 to 20 percent and you have a world leader, this \nPresident, our President, stand and say: America, I am taking the \nlimits off, in the ability of my office as President, through an \nExecutive order, I am taking the limits off the Outer Continental \nShelf, where we know there could be oil.\n  Some of us have said we ought to do the same thing here. Next week \nthere will be plenty of amendments, if the majority leader allows true \nlegislative dynamics on this floor, a bill to come up and a bill to be \namended because we will add production to his lots-more-talk and \nlittle-to-no-action bill.\n  We will add production. If we do, and if it makes it to the President \nand if he signs it, I will bet you the price of oil in the world \nmarkets will begin to decline a little. Now, while that is all \nhappening, in the next months and years, we have a lot of other work to \ndo as a country. We have to bring on the hybrids, we have to bring on \nthe electric cars, we have to learn to conserve in other ways.\n  Last year, I broke stride with the auto industry. I said: Mandatory 4 \npercent increase in CAFE fleet average standards. I had not done that \nin 28 years of my politics here. The auto companies came to me and \nsaid: Gee, why are you leaving us now?\n  I said: I have not changed in 28 years and neither have you.\n  I changed. I partnered with a Democrat, Byron Dorgan. We set a \nmandatory 4-percent CAFE standard for fleet averages of automobiles in \nthis country. It became law. When it is fully implemented, over a \nperiod of time, it is akin to bringing on an oilfield that produces 1.5 \nmillion barrels of oil a day because that is the amount that is saved.\n  So as a Senator who has always been a supporter of production, I also \nrecognize there is a lot that can be saved through conservation. There \nis a lot that can be saved through new technology. I believe the \ngeneration ahead of us, this next 10 years in the economy, is going to \nbe the decade of energy.\n  I think Americans are going to invest more and understand more about \ntheir energy and do more about their use of energy than they ever have \nin the decades before. Why? Because it is going to cost more. If it is \ngoing to cost more, there is probably more profit to be involved. If \nthere is more profit to be involved, there is going to be more \ninvestment in it. But Congress, get out of the way. Quit being \npolitically correct. Demand standards. Demand quality environmental \nprocedure. But get out of the way, politicians. Let America produce \nonce again. When we do, our economy will strengthen, the American \nfamilies will fear less, our national security will be more assured, \nand we will not let the Venezuelas or the Nigerias or the Saudi Arabias \nor the Irans jerk us around by the gas nozzle the way they are doing \nnow because, once again, as a great nation, we begin to stand on our \nown two feet.\n  We have arrived at that break point in the world of energy. It is \ntime we act, responsibly, directly, and that we deal with a lot more \naction and a lot less talk because our Nation became a nonproducing \nnation today because of politics and public policy, not because the oil \nwas no longer there.\n  Shame on us. Shame on the American politics of the last 10 years that \ndenied production in this country. The American consumer, listen up: \nCall your Senator or call your Congressman right now and say: Pass a \nbill that allows us to drill.\n  It is quite simple. Pass a bill that allows us to drill. The futures \nmarket will decline and gas at the pump will begin to drop and the \nAmerican economy will begin to stabilize. It is going to take some \ntime, but you have to act first. So, Mr. Leader, you can bring a \ntalking bill to the floor but allow us to make it an action bill. Allow \nus to make it a production bill. Americans, call your Senators and say: \nAllow us to drill.\n  It is that simple. That is how we change the world of American \npolitics today, that for the last 20 years has denied the right of the \nAmerican marketplace to produce the energy necessary to stay \nindependent, free, and reasonable in price.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6905]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I have been coming to the Senate floor \nto address the price of oil for several months now. It continues to \nastound me that every time I speak, the prices continue to go up.\n  The average price of a gallon of regular gas hit $3.95 in Minnesota \nand $4.11 cents nationwide. The price of diesel fuel is at $4.76 per \ngallon. The price of crude oil recently hit an unbelievable $145 per \nbarrel.\n  There seems to be no relief in sight. Prices have gone up more than \n$1 per gallon over the last 6 months. Everyone knows that demand has \nnot gone up 25 percent over the last 6 months, but the prices have gone \nup $1 per gallon over the last 6 months.\n  This increase is astonishing. Even more astonishing is the fact that \nthe administration has continued to do nothing about the speculation \nissue, continues to do nothing to push the CFTC to use the tools it has \nand to push for more tools to do something about the excessive \nspeculation that is going on in this market.\n  We cannot continue to do business as usual. I have heard from people \nin Minnesota who have canceled their trips up to their cabins because \nthey simply cannot afford to fill their car with gas anymore. They have \ncanceled their summer vacations. These are not glamorous summer \nvacations, these are little cabins up on the lakes of Minnesota.\n  I have heard from farmers who are having a hard time making ends \nmeet, even in spite of the high commodity prices, because the cost of \ntheir input, diesel fuel for farm equipment and fertilizer made from \nnatural gas, has spiraled out of control.\n  I have heard from the CEO of Northwest Airlines, based in Minnesota, \nabout how the speculation in the oil markets has so greatly contributed \nto their cost and made it very difficult for them to continue business \nas usual with prices going up, grounding flights, not having as many \nflights leaving, leading to more delays in the summer, because if a \npassenger misses it, and we had a hearing on this in the Commerce \nCommittee--there are not as many backup flights because there are not \nas many flights.\n  So the list goes on. The high price of energy has inflated the price \nof everything from groceries, to transportation, to home heating. It \nhas impacted every sector of the economy, from manufacturing to \nforestry, to farms and small businesses.\n  Middle-class families are already struggling, as you know, with the \nhigh cost of health care and college education. We know we need to do \nthings about that, but we keep getting blocked. We are very hopeful, \nwith the new President, that we are going to be able to get things done \nfor the middle class.\n  But for now, we have people in my State who simply cannot afford the \nprice of gas when you couple it with everything else that has been \ngoing on in their lives. We know the statistics. We know what has been \nhappening, where average families in the last 8 years, their wages have \ngone down about $1,000 a year, but their expenses have gone up about \n$4,000; so that is a net loss of $5,000 a year to them.\n\n  Many of the people in my State, and I know you know this, Mr. \nPresiding Officer, in Colorado, many of the people in my State are in \nrural areas. They do not have access to public transportation. They do \nnot have a choice in how much they drive. They have to get to work. \nThey have to get to the grocery store. They have to get to the doctor. \nAny pay increase they have gotten in the last year, if they have gotten \none, has been eaten up by the cost of gas.\n  More often than not, I will tell you, there has not been a pay \nincrease. But yet, as recently as February of this year, the President \nseemed taken aback when someone asked him about $4-a-gallon gas. He \nsaid:\n\n       You are predicting $4-a-gallon gasoline? That is \n     interesting. I had not heard that.\n\n  The fact is this administration has failed to provide Americans with \na meaningful energy policy that would provide relief from high gas and \nenergy prices. They saw this coming. They saw it was going on in the \ninternational markets but they failed to act. This country needs a bold \nenergy policy for the future, a policy that will stabilize prices and \ngive consumers more alternatives and reduce our dependence on foreign \noil and provide us with the next generation of homegrown biofuels.\n  In short, I believe we have to invest in the people, the farmers and \nthe workers, from my perspective, of the Midwest, not the oil cartels \nof the Mideast. The same could be said of any area of this country. \nThis country spends $600,000 every minute on imported oil. That money \nleaves the pockets of American drivers, going overseas, and \ncontributing to our enormous trade deficit. It amounts to a tax on the \nfamilies and businesses of this country, and it undermines our national \nsecurity.\n  Why does it affect our national security? That is because America has \nroughly 3 percent of the world's proven crude oil reserves, but we are \nresponsible for about 25 percent of the world's oil consumption. Now, \nwe know we cannot continue on this path without becoming more and more \nvulnerable to other parts of the world, some of which are politically \nunstable, some of which we do not want to do business with.\n  But there is another way. If you look at what is going on in Brazil, \nthey have achieved energy security with a combination of biofuels. Now, \nthey have sugarcane, so it is easier. But we have all kinds of things. \nWe have all kinds of things: Switchgrass, prairie grass, that has not \neven been developed, other parts of the corn. We know we cannot do it \nall with corn. We are talking about algae, we are talking about \nbiofuels. We are talking about residue from logging. There are all \nkinds of possibilities.\n  But Brazil was able to do it with a combination of sugarcane and \ndomestic production and a government policy that drove them to energy \nindependence. We need to put together a forward-looking energy policy \nwith the same sense of urgency we had 40 years ago when we put a man on \nthe Moon.\n  In the long term, this is going to mean strategic investment, putting \nthese standards in place so people will push to buy the hybrid cars, \nelectric cars, new solar technologies, cellulosic ethanol, other forms \nof energy for biomass.\n  We need to have better fuel efficiency standards for our cars and \ntrucks. I am proud the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, for the first \ntime since I was in junior high school, increased the gas mileage \nstandards on cars by 10 miles a gallon. But there is so much more we \ncan do.\n  We need a renewable electricity standard, we need to look at other \nsources, as I said, solar, we need to do more with nuclear, we need to \ndo more to increase responsibly our domestic production. We need to \nhave functioning refineries.\n  These are long-term solutions. I believe very strongly they are \nimportant, and we need to get them done.\n  But there is also something we can do in the short term about high \ngas prices that will bring immediate relief; that is, to address the \nrole market speculation is playing in driving up energy prices. The \nadministration likes to tell us these high gas prices are just a simple \ncase of supply and demand; more people are driving, so the price of gas \ngoes up. We know that is not true in our country. Fewer people are \ndriving. There have been some increases internationally, but when the \nexpert, Mr. Yergin, testified before our committee, he said there has \nbeen sort of a leveling off in terms of demand for world oil. Whatever \nit is, we know that even if there has been an increase in demand, it \nhasn't been 25 percent, such as we have seen with the dollar-a-gallon \nincrease in only the last 6 months. The answer that it is just supply \nand demand doesn't hold true any longer.\n  Listen to the oil executives on this matter. On October 30, 2007, the \nCEO of Marathon Oil said:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  On April 11 of this year, the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell said:\n\n       The [oil] fundamentals are no problem. They are the same as \n     they were when oil was selling for $60 a barrel.\n\n  On April 1, a senior vice president of ExxonMobil testified before \nthe House:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50-55 per barrel.\n\n\n[[Page S6906]]\n\n\n  If oil should be roughly $50 to $60 a barrel given market \nfundamentals, as we heard from the oil executives, why is it trading so \nhigh? Why is it trading at over $100 a barrel? If supply and demand, \nwhich should be the market forces which determine price, don't explain \nthe high price of gas, what does? According to the experts, there is a \nfrenzy of unregulated market speculation in the oil futures market that \nis driving prices up to record highs.\n  I would like to share a quote from an energy market analyst with \nOppenheimer and Co. who was recently named by Bloomberg as the top-\nranked energy analyst in the country:\n\n       I'm absolutely convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a \n     dime above $55 a barrel . . . Oil speculators include the \n     largest financial institutions in the world. I call it the \n     world's largest gambling hall . . . It's open 24/7 . . . It's \n     totally unregulated . . . This is like a highway with no cops \n     and no speed limit, and everybody's going 120 miles per hour.\n\n  Why are these trades in a commodity as vital as oil unregulated? You \nhave to go back in time, to the middle of the night in 2000. A \nprovision was inserted into the Commodities Futures Modernization Act \nthat exempted electronic energy trades from Federal regulation. In the \nabsence of oversight, what was once a small niche market became a \nbooming industry, attracting rampant speculation from hedge funds and \ninvestment banks, the largest financial institutions in the world. Oil \nand natural gas prices became volatile. The provision came to be known \nas the Enron loophole because it made possible the many abuses that \ntriggered the Western energy crisis and led, in part, to the collapse \nof Enron and cost the economy $35 billion and 600,000 jobs.\n  I am pleased to say that we succeeded in partly closing the Enron \nloophole in the farm bill. Those provisions will provide new \nprotections in the natural gas market. They will put a new regulatory \nstructure on ICE, the electronic exchange in Atlanta, where large \ntraders try to game natural gas futures on an unregulated electronic \nexchange. But we need to do more. That is why I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act of 2008. It was \nintroduced by our leader, Harry Reid, and my colleagues, Senators \nDurbin, Schumer, Dorgan, Murray, and others.\n  This bill has a number of provisions that will fight the kind of \nexcessive speculation that drives up energy prices for hard-working \nAmerican families.\n  This bill will close the so-called London loophole. It will stop \ntraders from routing transactions through offshore markets in order to \nget around limits on speculation put in place by U.S. regulators. \nSpecifically, the Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, in London allows \ntrading in American oil futures, gasoline and home heating oil, with \nfar less stringent reporting requirements than what we have at home. \nThis has driven a lot of energy trading offshore and out of the reach \nof our regulators. This bill will make those foreign trades in American \noil and gasoline futures subject to the same reporting requirements as \ntrades made at home, so we can stop a glut of overseas trades from \ndriving up our energy prices.\n  The bill would also require the CFTC to review letters of no action \nit has issued to the ICE electronic exchange in Atlanta and the Dubai \nelectronic exchange which operates in cooperation with NYMEX in New \nYork. With those no-action letters, the CFTC gave these exchanges \npermission to operate in this country and trade in American energy \nfutures with no oversight from U.S. regulators. I don't think I can \ntell the people of my State, in Duluth or Rochester, that they should \nrest easy because the Dubai Financial Services Authority is looking out \nfor them. They know that is not true. We need to let speculators know \nthat if they want to trade in American energy futures, they are going \nto be subject to American regulation.\n  We had the head of the CFTC testify before a joint meeting of the \nAgriculture and Appropriations Committees. I still can't quite believe \nthe meeting. He was happy that we will give him more people to work in \nhis agency since they have had an enormous decrease at the same time we \nhave seen an enormous increase in rampant speculation. But I tried to \npush him. I said: When I was a prosecutor, I would want every potential \nway of trying to get evidence, trying to prosecute a case or get a \nsentence or a bill if it made sense and we could use it in going after \na crook. It wouldn't mean we always used them. Some of them we maybe \nused once a year. With some of them, we have a hammer over someone's \nhead. Some of them we used all the time. But you want to have those \ntools. He didn't seem that interested. That was the moment I thought: \nWe are going to do everything we can to prop up this agency and get it \nmoving, but we have to have people in charge who really want to do the \njob.\n  That is why I am so concerned about this administration. You haven't \nseen the same thing in the financial services area, where you have \nSecretary Paulson and Ben Bernanke working hard on this crisis, along \nwith people in Congress on an equal footing, trying to get things done, \ncommunicating with us. I just didn't get that same feeling when we had \nthat testimony before our committee.\n  What else will this bill do? This bill will also convene an \ninternational working group of financial market regulators to develop \nuniform reporting and regulatory standards in the major trading centers \nof the world to put an end to this problem of speculators shopping \naround the world for the weakest regulations.\n  The bill will require the CFTC to impose position limits on \nspeculators who trade in energy futures but don't actually produce \nenergy or receive physical delivery of energy commodities. So if you \nare an investor who buys and sells oil futures but you don't plan to \neven take delivery of actual barrels of oil, this bill will limit how \nmuch you can buy and sell so that you won't be distorting prices for \nyour own personal gain. We know that has been going on. A lot of these \npeople took the money, the funds, out of the subprime mortgage market \nand then started playing around in the oil market even though they are \nnot truly involved.\n  Lastly, this bill is going to give the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission the funding authority to hire at least 100 full-time \nemployees so that the Commission can strengthen its regulations and \nimprove its enforcement over the energy derivative markets. As a former \nprosecutor, I can tell you that good laws are not enough. You also need \nstrong enforcement. You need the cops on the beat so that you can \nfollow the money. When we follow the money in this $4-a-gallon gas, \nwhen we follow the money, we know where it is going to lead. We know it \nis going to lead--at least a piece of it--to market manipulation and \nspeculation.\n  In conclusion, the cost of energy is hurting Americans from all walks \nof life and businesses in every sector of the economy. I don't think \nthere is one silver bullet that will solve our energy crisis. It is \nmore like a silver buckshot. We need a bold energy policy to carry the \nNation forward. It needs to include both short-term and long-term \nsolutions.\n\n  In the short term, we need to pass this bill and place stronger \nlimits on market speculation. That will make a difference in the short \nterm.\n  In the long term, we need to develop our energy resources at home. We \nneed to improve refining capacity. We need to improve our domestic \nproduction. This is for the long term, so when speculators, even \nlegitimate ones, are looking at America and thinking how much the price \nof oil is, they need to know we actually have a long-term plan. That, \nultimately, is what will bring down the price, when they know we are \nready to compete with big oil, that we have a plan, using increased \nefficiency of cars and trucks, that we have a plan which means looking \nat biofuels and truly having a competitive force. Maybe it is not E85; \nmaybe it is E10, E20, so we have a blend of fuel. We have to invest in \nthe research to get us those vehicles and get us that energy. We have \nto make a national commitment to generate electricity from renewable \nsources, just as my State of Minnesota does. I know there is \ngroundbreaking work occurring in Colorado.\n  Finally, we have to embrace conservation. This is no longer Jimmy \nCarter going on TV in a sweater and looking glum. The people of this \ncountry see this not only as an environmental issue, they see it as an \neconomic issue. They want to save a few\n\n[[Page S6907]]\n\nbucks, whether it means putting in the right kind of lightbulbs or \nmeters on their washers and dryers so they can figure out when to run \nthem, whether it is more fuel-efficient cars. They want to do something \ndifferently. They are ready in my State to embrace conservation as a \nway to save money for their families.\n  The time is now for Congress to take strong steps toward creating a \nbold energy policy. American families are depending on us.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is nice to be here with you in the \nchair, since we are discussing issues that are very important, of which \nyou have been a part for a while around here.\n  First of all, I wish to talk for a minute about the good news. The \ngood news is that crude oil prices have gone down $16 a barrel in 3 \ndays. That is a bigger drop in the prices of crude oil in history in \nterms of actual dollars. One of those 3 days it was an $8 drop. I do \nnot know what this bodes for the future, but today it looks good, it \nsounds good, and it ought to make us feel good.\n  What we ought to do is something positive that will have a chance of \nshowing the world; that is, the world that is buying and selling oil \nand buying and trading oil futures on the market, that there is going \nto be more oil coming on because the United States has awakened; we \nhave decided that after 27 years of being asleep. We have all this \nproperty called the continental offshore, which is owned by the people \nof our country, and for 27 years we kept all but small portions of it \nunder lock and key. We had decided it was not worth opening that to \ndrilling, even in modern days, when we have the cleanest and best way \nto go into deep waters and drill for oil. With oil spills being at a \nminimum, we kept it locked up.\n  The year before last, we passed a bill that started the process of \nopening parts of this great valuable offshore owned by our people. Yes, \nthe President of the United States waited around for us to act and \nfinally decided he would lift the Executive ban, the Presidential \nmoratorium that was on 85 percent of the offshore that has been locked \nup.\n  Make no bones about it, now, when people say we have already let a \nlot of that land out to bid, 85 percent of the offshore--85 percent of \nthe offshore--was under lock and key by moratorium until the President \nlifted the Executive ban. We now have imposed, on that same 85 percent, \nmillions and millions of acres of offshore property.\n  Now we have the situation where, come the first day of October, the \nCongress will have to act to put on another 1-year moratorium; the \nmoratorium of Congress is 1 year at a time. We will have to act to put \nit on or there will be no moratorium, and it will be open for leases \npursuant to the law of the land.\n  This morning, I attended a workshop held by the Energy Committee to \ndiscuss the price of oil. We had two leading experts, and we were very \nfortunate, except that I would say we have heard about enough from \nexperts, and we have talked enough about the problem. We ought to do \nsomething within the next couple weeks.\n  But at this workshop was Dan Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy \nResearch Associates, publisher of a very popular book on oil. He was \naccompanied by Roger Diwan of PFC Energy. Their message to us this \nmorning, with many Senators asking questions, coming in and out of the \nroom, was the same as I have been hearing from leading economists for \nthe last several weeks. What did they say? Supply and demand problems \nare the reason why gas prices are so high, why crude oil prices are so \nhigh.\n  The majority leader stopped by our workshop this morning to talk \nabout the bill he has introduced today on speculation. He said that \nwhile he understood that speculation was not the only problem, he \nthought it was a big part of it and we should start there. Well, \nobviously, he controls how we start, so perhaps we will start with \nspeculation. I, for one, think speculation is not nearly the problem of \nsupply and demand, it is not nearly the problem of opening more \nproperty we own for drilling. I think that is the real problem: to put \nmore of that out to the oil operators of the country and get started on \nsome real new production.\n  I am puzzled by the decision our leader has made about going first \nwith speculation, antispeculation statutes. I am not against looking at \nthat, but if there is something we can do to increase transparency, \nthat is fine. But why would we start by addressing problems when the \nexperts tell us they are not the real problem?\n  What do the experts say? I will share with you a few comments of what \nthey say.\n  David Yergin, a great expert, a very fluent man:\n\n       The rise in oil prices can be explained by basic economic \n     factors, such as limited growth in supplies in recent years, \n     a weakening dollar, a global surge in energy demand, and a \n     string of production disruptions in countries such as \n     Nigeria.\n\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke:\n\n       There is speculation, but speculation, under most \n     circumstances, is a positive thing. It provides liquidity and \n     allows people to hedge their risks. And it provides price \n     discovery. It can help allocate oil availability over time, \n     depending on the pattern of future prices and so on.\n\n  Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway:\n\n       It's not speculation, it's supply and demand. We don't have \n     excess capacity in the world anymore, and that's what you're \n     seeing in oil prices.\n\n  So why would we start with speculation, instead of supply and demand? \nEighty-five percent of the continental U.S. lands offshore are being \nlocked up by Congress; that is, we have a prohibition. The most \nconservative estimates of how much oil is in the Atlantic and Pacific \noffshore is 14 billion barrels. Now, I actually think that is totally \nwrong. I think we have many times that, perhaps as much as three times\n\n[[Page S6908]]\n\nthat. We have not done a current evaluation, so we are doing some \nenlightened guessing. Yet we are coming up with 14 billion barrels that \nis out there that we might be able to drill for and bring on board.\n  Let me assure everyone that is no pittance. That is a lot. For some \nperspective, that is more oil than the United States has imported from \nthe Persian Gulf in 15 years and more oil than we have gotten from the \nGulf of Mexico in 50 years.\n  We have a plan to allow States to tap into those resources. The \nAmerican people support that plan overwhelmingly. Why shouldn't we \nstart there?\n  From 1998 to 2002, global demand rose by 4 million barrels per day. \nSince 2002, it has risen by 8 million barrels per day.\n  In China, the number of cars on the road double every 5 years. The \neconomy there is growing by 10 percent annually. Yet, through problems \nin places such as Nigeria, we have lost global supplies.\n\n  It should be no surprise that prices have gone up. It is clear what \nthis Senate needs to do about it: increase American production now.\n  I close by saying, the time has come to act on supply and demand. \nThat means, as the American people are saying it: Start drilling on our \nproperty to produce oil and gas for our people instead of getting more \nand more from others overseas and actually sending all our wealth \noverseas, putting us in a ruinous situation, where we are growing \npoorer and poorer by the day.\n  With that, I wonder if the distinguished Senator from Virginia would \nlike to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have a long history of supporting \nopening the OCS to drilling. Aside from being a longtime supporter of \nopening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, I have also engaged in \nattempts to open the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf Coasts to drilling.\n  While we were successful in opening a portion of the gulf, the \nPacific and Atlantic coasts remain off limits.\n  Instead of focusing my effort on all the off-limit portions of the \nOCS, I have concentrated over the last year on opening the coast of \nVirginia, for exploration of natural gas only. I think the history on \nthis effort demonstrates a momentum shift in the minds of my \ncolleagues.\n  In June 2007, I offered an amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2007 \nthat would allow for the exploration of natural gas in Virginia only. \nExtraction of natural gas could only occur if the Governor and State \nlegislature approve such a move.\n  That vote lost by a vote of 44 nays and 43 yeas.\n  Of those 44 nays, there are two Senators who are now cosponsors of \nthe Gas Price Reduction Act, a bill that includes a drilling title.\n  With the nonvoting Members, I think we could win this vote today, on \nan up-or-down vote.\n  This fact is significant because it represents a shift in momentum \nand the way my colleagues are now thinking of rectifying this energy \ncrisis in which our Nation finds itself.\n  Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague, whom I have been \nthese 30 years sharing this floor with from time to time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is right.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have collaborated on so many things together.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is right.\n  Mr. WARNER. But now, as both of us are looking forward to quietly \nstepping down, I say to the Senator, you are carrying as full a weight \nas you ever did, and you are the man of the hour among our peer group \nto work on this energy question because of the depth and background you \nhave on this subject.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, sir.\n  Mr. WARNER. So I commend you on your efforts with respect to \ndrilling. But I wonder if you would bear with me a minute. Several \nyears ago, I started on this, trying to drill offshore. Do you remember \nthat?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, sir, I do.\n  Mr. WARNER. You always said to me, well, there will come a time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. WARNER. But I kept putting in bill after bill, and Senator \nAlexander joined me on one. And now--\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The time is here.\n  Mr. WARNER. The President has joined, and the time is here.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of the votes that were actually cast on my amendment at one \ntime, where I lost by--it was actually 44 to 43--1 vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Or I would have received a majority vote at that time, \nnotwithstanding the 60 votes required for passage, and we might be a \nlittle further down the road if that had happened.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 110th Congress--1st Session\n\n  (As compiled through Senate LIS by the Senate Bill Clerk under the \n               direction of the Secretary of the Senate)\n\n\n                              vote summary\n\n       Question: On the Amendment (Warner Amdt.

But I wish to say how pleased I am to see you vigorous \nand strong, and with our distinguished leader, Senator McConnell, \nleading the charge. I hope we get it up here and let these 100 Senators \nspeak their will.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you. I am glad to be at our Republican leader's \nside on this issue and help wherever I can.\n  Mr. WARNER. We share that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are aware this is a real big, big-time American \nproblem, as hard as any kind of problem as we have had.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the Senator, go back and look at your mailbox, \nlook at your e-mail, look at the hundreds of communications each of us \nare receiving every day.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You bet.\n  Mr. WARNER. These people are gathered--I would say almost a quarter \nof Americans are gathered around the kitchen table every night looking \nat the increased costs in their food, the increased costs in their \nheating and their gasoline, trying to figure out how they are going to \nmake ends meet, with relatively small amounts of dollars in the overall \npicture. But to them, it is the difference between buying a little \nextra food and having the choice to forego it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Rhode Island \nis recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me just say to my good friend \nfrom Rhode Island, I am sorry we have gotten a little bit behind. My \nremarks are not very long, and I will be happy to proceed on leader \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am happy the leader should proceed. I simply wished \nto have an idea of how long it might be so I know when I would begin.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Ten minutes or less.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I could make an inquiry of the \ndistinguished leader while he is on the Senate floor, at some point I \nwould like to work into the queue. If my good friend from Rhode Island \nis following the leader, perhaps I could follow him. Is there a \nstanding order?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If I could indicate to the Senator from Virginia, we \nare under an order that allocates the time of one-half-hour blocks, and \nI have our first Democratic half hour. So it would probably be more \nconvenient and better, if the Senator simply followed the Republican \nleader, and I just deferred some additional time to allow him to speak \ndirectly after the Republican leader, and we can adjust the order \naccordingly.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I appreciate that courtesy, and I will \njust take, say, 6 minutes following the distinguished Republican \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, my remarks are on another issue, but \nI was here for the colloquy between my good friend from Virginia and my \nequally good friend from New Mexico. We all know they are both retiring \nfrom the Senate later this year, but it is serendipitous that this \nissue has arisen at this particular time, when the American people are \ndemanding the kind of action that the Senator from New Mexico and the \nSenator from Virginia have been promoting for years. So I think it is a \ngood thing that while they are still here in their service to our \ncountry, we will be debating this issue vigorously next week, and all \nof us hope for success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6909-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6909-S6911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on another issue, this is the 1-year \nanniversary of the nomination of Judge Robert Conrad to be a member of \nthe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. When this Congress began, the \nmajority leader and I agreed that partisanship in the judicial \nnominations process was unhealthy, and we said this Congress would be \ndifferent. The Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post acknowledged \nthe President did his part to get the process off to a good start back \nin the beginning of this Congress. They, and many others, complimented \nhis good faith in not resubmitting circuit court nominees whom some of \nour Democratic colleagues did not like.\n  The majority leader himself said how much he appreciated the \nPresident's good faith. He said:\n\n       I personally want the record to reflect that I appreciate \n     the President not sending back four names that were really \n     controversial.\n\n  The majority leader also said he and his colleagues had an obligation \nto reciprocate and treat circuit court nominees fairly. He said:\n\n       I think we have to reciprocate in a way that is \n     appropriate, and we are going to try to do that by looking at \n     these nominees as quickly as we can.\n\n\n[[Page S6910]]\n\n\n  So the question is, have the Democrats treated these nominees fairly? \nHave they, in fact, reciprocated?\n  Let's look at the facts. This President is in his final 2 years of \noffice, and the Senate Democrats, of course, hope to recapture the \nWhite House. So, obviously, there is a partisan incentive not to \nconfirm President Bush's judicial nominees. This is, of course, human \nnature, but this situation is not new. President Bush is not the first \nPresident to be in his final 2 years in office when the opposite \npolitical party controls the Senate, and he will not be the last.\n  Even with lameduck Presidents, there is a historical standard of \nfairness as to confirming judicial nominees, especially circuit court \nnominees. The majority leader and I agreed that this Senate should meet \nthat standard. The average number of circuit court confirmations in \nthis situation is 17. President Clinton had 15. This Senate has \nconfirmed only 10 circuit court nominees. What happened?\n  Unfortunately, old habits are hard to break and, in my opinion, \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee found it hard not to play \npolitics. It started with the renomination of Judge Leslie Southwick.\n  Judge Southwick was a distinguished State court judge and an Iraq war \nveteran. Moreover, he was someone the committee Democrats had already \napproved unanimously to the district court. So at the beginning of this \nCongress when the President tried yet again to fill a vacancy on the \nFifth Circuit that had existed for his entire Presidency, he did not \nresubmit a nominee the Democrats opposed. Instead, he quite reasonably \nnominated someone whom committee Democrats had already approved: Leslie \nSouthwick.\n  How did the Judiciary Committee Democrats respond? With one \nexception, they did a total about-face and actually tried to filibuster \nJudge Southwick's nomination.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Southwick isn't the only consensus nominee who \nbecame ``controversial.'' Judge Robert Conrad is the chief judge of a \nFederal district court in North Carolina. The Senate has already \napproved him to important positions not once but twice; first, as the \nchief Federal law enforcement officer in North Carolina, and then to a \nlifetime position on the Federal trial bench. In addition, the ABA gave \nJudge Conrad its highest rating, unanimously ``well qualified.'' Former \nAttorney General Janet Reno called him ``an excellent prosecutor'' and \nsaid she was ``impressed with his judgment . . . and his knowledge of \nthe law.''\n  Again, to resolve a dispute--this time over a Fourth Circuit seat--\nPresident Bush did not resubmit a nominee whom Senate Democrats \nopposed. As with Judge Southwick, he nominated someone they had already \napproved, Judge Robert Conrad.\n\n  Guess what has happened. Well, nothing has happened. As of today, \nJudge Conrad has been sitting in the committee for 365 days, 1 full \nyear, without a hearing, even though he meets all the chairman's \ncriteria. He has the highest possible ABA rating, he has strong home \nState support, and he would fill a judicial emergency.\n  What is the result of all of this? While Judge Conrad waits in \ncommittee, the circuit court to which he is nominated is over 25 \npercent vacant. Over one-fourth of its seats are empty. Its chief judge \nstates that to keep up with its work, the court must rely heavily on \ndistrict court judges. In short, it is robbing Peter to pay Paul. ``It \ngoes without saying,'' she says, ``that having to use visiting judges \nputs a strain on our circuit. In particular, it forces the circuit's \ndistrict judges to perform double duty.''\n  The situation on the Fourth Circuit is so bad that the ABA has made \nthe crisis on the Fourth Circuit its lead story in the most recent \nedition of its professional journal. It is on the cover page.\n  Now, my friend, the majority leader, comes to the floor this morning \nand essentially says judges aren't important, and no one cares about \nthem. Given the crisis in the Fourth Circuit--a crisis that is so bad \nthe ABA is highlighting it--I can't imagine he would suggest such a \nthing. I am sure the millions of citizens of the Fourth Circuit don't \nthink that having their appellate court over 25 percent vacant doesn't \nmatter. I am sure they care very much about that. But evidently that is \nwhat the majority leader believes, and apparently he is not the only \none in his conference who feels that way, given the lack of action in \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  The committee refuses to move Judge Robert Conrad's nomination or any \nother pending Fourth Circuit nominee. We are told Democrats do not \nsupport Rod Rosenstein's nomination to the Fourth Circuit--which is \nsupported by the Washington Post--because he is doing too good a job as \nU.S. attorney. That is an interesting rationale for not moving someone.\n  We have another Fourth Circuit nominee, Judge Glen Conrad from \nVirginia. He is a Federal district court judge whom the Senate \nconfirmed to the trial bench without any controversy. He has the \nsupport of both his home State Senators, one Democrat and one \nRepublican. After he was nominated, the chairman said he would move him \nas long as there was time to do so. Specifically, he stated:\n\n       I have already said that once the paperwork on President \n     Bush's nomination of Judge Glen Conrad to the Fourth Circuit \n     is completed, if there is sufficient time, I hope to move his \n     nomination.\n\n  Well, the chairman's conditions have been met with respect to Judge \nGlen Conrad's nomination. His paperwork has been ready for a month, and \nit is only July 17. The last time I looked, there were 12 months in a \nyear. This is July 17. Clearly, we have time to confirm him, but yet we \nhave no action on his nomination.\n  Now, our Democratic colleagues continually talk about the so-called \nThurmond rule under which the Senate supposedly stops confirming judges \nin a Presidential election year. I am concerned that this seeming \nobsession with this supposed rule--which, by the way, doesn't exist; \nSenator Specter has researched that thoroughly and there is no such \nrule. Anyway, I am concerned that this seeming obsession with this rule \nthat doesn't exist is just an excuse for our colleagues to run out the \nclock on qualified nominees who are urgently needed to fill vacancies.\n  No party is without blame in the confirmation process, but what is \ngoing on now--or, more accurately, what is not going on--is yet another \nstep backward in politicizing the confirmation process--something we \nhad all hoped we would get beyond.\n  It is the American people, especially those in the five States that \nmake up the Fourth Circuit, who are suffering the consequences, and I \nam sorry the majority leader doesn't think that matters.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the Chair. I again thank my \ncolleague from Rhode Island.\n  Before the distinguished leader departs the floor, I simply wish to \nsay that I appreciate his bringing up the nomination of Judge Glen \nConrad to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. I \nwas privileged to recommend Glen Conrad to President Bush for his \ncurrent seat on the U.S. district court for the Eastern District of \nVirginia. Judge Conrad has served in this position for five years, and, \nprior to his confirmation by the Senate, he was a magistrate judge in \nthe Eastern District for twenty-seven years. He has devoted his \nprofessional life to serving the Federal court system and is eminently \nqualified to fill one of those Fourth Circuit vacancies that \ndesperately need it.\n  I wish to thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Webb, who \njoined me in recommending Judge Conrad for the Fourth Circuit. We have \nsubmitted our blue slips to the Judiciary Committee, and I have \nconfidence that the majority leader and the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee will find time to look at his \nnomination. Glen Conrad is a true public servant who is ready to take \nand fill a badly needed post.\n  I thank the leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, if I could just take a moment, I \nhaven't given up hope, I would say to my good friend from Virginia, \nthat Judge Conrad will be reported out of committee and confirmed. But \nthere are no remaining obstacles. All of the paperwork is done and has \nbeen finished for\n\n[[Page S6911]]\n\nover a month. I hope my good friend from Virginia, and his colleague \nwho supports the nominee who is of the other party, will continue to \npress the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the majority leader \nto move forward with a nominee who appears to me by all accounts to be \nabout as noncontroversial as can be come up with. So I thank my \ncolleague from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank again our colleague from Rhode Island.\n  I spoke earlier when the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nDomenici, was on the Senate floor talking generally about the drilling \noffshore. I mentioned that for many years I have been working on it \nwith other colleagues in this Chamber and lost the majority by one \nvote.\n  I ask unanimous consent to amend those statements with further \ncriteria.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, now I wish to briefly address what I \nthink is a very important aspect of the ongoing debate on energy. I \nwant to laud many Senators on both sides of the aisle who are looking \nat the gravity of the situation. Families sit around the kitchen table \nin the evenings and work out problems among themselves, including the \ngravity of the problems associated with the rising gas prices at the \ngas pump, food prices, and many other issues. I went in and made a \nstudy of the increased cost of a loaf of bread, dishwasher fluid--I \ncould go on and on--hot dogs, hamburgers. The extent to which prices \nare going up is extraordinary, coupled with the increased price at the \ngas pump.\n  We are all working together, and I firmly believe that under the \nleadership of Senators Reid and McConnell, we can come up with some \nsort of a bipartisan effort consistent with the overall policy the \nPresident has urged recently in his speech.\n  As important as offshore drilling is--and I yield not a foot of \nground on that; I think it is important, and that is why I have been \nadvocating it for many years. I support battery-powered automobiles, \nwind energy, and all of the other renewables. But we have to do \nsomething now, today, and tomorrow to help the people sitting around \ntheir kitchen tables trying to solve their problems. I have been \nlooking at several options, and I will review them briefly.\n  I anticipate that one-third of Americans today are virtually \ndesperate and trying to make ends meet with their family budgets, and \nthe necessity to drive their automobiles to go to work, pick up their \nchildren, to visit their elderly grandparents--all of these things are \nmatters of necessity, and they are trying to balance that out among \nthemselves. What do we do about it?\n  I introduced the Immediate Steps to Conserve Gasoline Act--an odd \ntitle but straightforward in what it says. My idea is as follows: Many \nfolks--a third of them--are conserving; they are taking conservation \nsteps. Look at the statistics. You see less driving. Quite a few \nstatistics are coming in about less driving, which translates into less \ndemand at the gas pump. A free marketplace should lead to some measure \nof reduction. We recognize that gasoline and petroleum is at worldwide \npricing, and we are in a one-world market. We are competing with other \nnations, which are likewise experiencing the rising costs of fuel.\n  My brother recently returned from a business trip to Europe. He is \nquite familiar with Central Europe and Austria. He said on the famous \nautobahn they are cutting back on the speed because there is a savings \non gasoline. The faster you drive, the less efficient the carburetion \nprocess in the engine is in terms of delivering power.\n  I suggested to the President, to the Secretary of Energy, and I have \nasked the Government Accounting Office to look at a chapter in American \nhistory. I remember it quite well, 1973 to 1974. I was at the Navy \nDepartment. My friend from Rhode Island, John Chafee, and I were \ntogether at that time. I remember the President, together with the full \nsupport of the Congress, enacted legislation whereby America imposed a \nhardship on itself; it was a program all across America--and it is all \na matter of public record--that made the speed limit 55 miles per hour. \nWhat I have asked the President, the Secretary of Energy, the GAO, and \nothers to do is to go back and examine that period, take a look at it. \nFifty-five might not be the speed limit; it might be 60 or even a \nslightly higher speed limit because of the improved carburetion process \nand efficiency achieved in this nearly quarter of a century in today's \nmodern automobiles compared to the 1973-1974 automobiles.\n  It is interesting, in that period of time--and these are Government \nstatistics--when the national speed limit was imposed, it saved 167,000 \nbarrels of oil a day. The significance of that figure is that, in that \nperiod, 1973-1974, we were only 30 percent dependent upon importing oil \nfrom abroad. Now we are at 60 percent. So there has been a doubling of \nour dependency on foreign oil. Also, the number of vehicles on the road \ntoday--a quarter of a century later--is approximately twice the number \nof vehicles that were traveling America's highways and roads in 1973-\n1974.\n  I realize it is not popular to talk about it. Believe me, around my \nown dinner table at night, I have heard from my children, who are not \nat all pleased with this.\n  Anyway, I think we have an obligation as a Congress, working with the \nexecutive branch, to look at it. That is all I am asking. Go study it, \nthose who are far more knowledgeable than I and those who have all of \nthe facts at their fingertips, and let's bring in the private sector to \ngive their views and look at this potential. If we were to bring about \nsome reduction of the high speeds on America's roads and highways \ntoday, I think you could translate that into less demand at the pump \nand less demand in terms of out-of-pocket costs.\n  So there we are, simple as that. It is history, it worked, so let's \nlook at it. That 55-miles-an-hour speed limit that was put in back then \nstayed for 20 years. Congress finally repealed it in 1995. Guess what. \nThe cost of fuel had dropped to $2 a gallon or thereabouts.\n  The other measure that I bring to the attention of my colleagues is \nthis: The American people are using their own initiatives to save \nenergy, and I am calling on the entire Federal Government, under the \nleadership of the President, and all of the agencies and departments to \nsee whether they can reduce their overall use of gasoline by 2 to 3 \npercent--just by a small margin.\n  We passed an energy act here not long ago, and I use that as a model. \nWe were talking about other forms of energy there. That is becoming \nlaw.\n  For 1 year, the Federal Government can say we are going to join the \ncitizens and reduce our overall consumption of gasoline by 2 to 3 \npercent, give it a try--anything to bring off pressure at the pump.\n  My two concepts fall clearly under the area of conservation. As I \nlook at the various options my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nare exploring and looking at, I do not see therein the conservation \npotential, thus far, which can bring about some relief. I am confident \nthis can be done if it is done properly. The American people are not \ngoing to like it. Politically, it will be a tough one. Somehow, I have \nalways felt, in the 30 years I have been privileged to be a part of \nthis body, that we are called upon now and then to make tough calls and \nstand up to the American public and say we have to all pull together--\nthe people and the Government, State and Federal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after I \nhave concluded my remarks, the control of the time go back and forth \nbetween the Republicans and the Democrats, alternating in half-hour \nincrements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6911-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6911-S6916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am very pleased to have a chance \nto speak today about the problem of health care in our country.\n  We are coming into a potentially very exciting time, when a new \nPresident and new administration will open up new opportunities to \nreform our ailing and broken health care system. It is a matter of \nurgency that we do so. It is also a matter of urgency that we get it \nright.\n  I have spoken on this issue on a number of occasions on the floor and \nelsewhere, and I often describe the marks\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\nof failure of our health care system, which are many. For example, the \nnumber of uninsured Americans is now climbing toward 50 million people. \nThe fact is that despite the best doctors, the best nurses, the best \nmedical equipment and procedures, the best medical education in the \nworld, as many as 100,000 Americans are killed every year by avoidable \nmedical errors. In the United States, our life expectancy, our obesity, \nand our infant mortality rates are an embarrassment compared to other \nnations.\n  The health care system cost is over $2 trillion. The last report I \nsaw was at $2.3 trillion, and it is anticipated shortly to reach $4 \ntrillion. At this point, we are spending 16 percent of our gross \ndomestic product on health care, which is far more than any other \nnation; the closest nation comes to 11 percent. The average of the \nEuropean Union countries is only 8 percent. So we are putting twice as \nmuch of our national product into our health care system as our \nEuropean competitors are.\n  Within our own system, the insurance companies' overhead eats up 31 \npercent of private insurance health care expenditures. In the battle \nbetween insurers and providers over getting paid--which is becoming \nincreasingly an arms race--$20 billion per year gets burned up and \nlost.\n  More American families are bankrupted by health care emergencies and \nhealth care expenses than any other cause. It is not just uninsured \nfamilies who are being bankrupted. It is the insured as well because of \nthe thinness of so much of our coverage. There is more health care than \ncoffee beans in Starbucks coffee. There is more health care than steel \nin Ford automobiles.\n  So when you look at it from that perspective, you truly see a \ntroubled system.\n  The Commonwealth Fund has recently put forward a report that drills \ninto the problems of our system even further. I would like to take some \ntime to share with my colleagues the findings from the Commonwealth \nFund study. They are quite impressive, but not in a positive way.\n  They found that Americans spend more on health care expenses than any \nother of the countries they tracked. This axis of the graph shows total \nhealth care spending. This axis of the graph shows the out-of-pocket \nspending in addition to the insured health care spending. You can see \nthat the United States stands as an extreme outlier to all of these \nother nations, including France, Germany, Canada, Netherlands, \nAustralia, New Zealand, and Japan, and the average of the OECD \ncountries--a group of 30 market economy countries that are very \ncompetitive with ours.\n  It is astonishing. We cannot remain competitive when total health \ncare spending is this much above those countries, plus out-of-pocket \ndemands on individual Americans, in addition to that national health \ncare spending, is so much greater than those other countries.\n  People who spent more than $1,000 out of pocket for medical care in \n2004 when the study was done: In the United States, nearly a third of \nthe above-average income people; a quarter of below-average income \npeople, compared to the United Kingdom, 2 percent and 5 percent; New \nZealand, 4 percent and 6 percent; Canada, 10 percent and 12 percent; \nAustralia, 8 percent and 21 percent. We are not even close.\n  Spending on physician services: In the United States, we pay $1,362 \nevery year per capita on physician services. In the Nations with which \nwe compete: Japan $563; OECD, the average is $482; Australia, $436; \nFrance, $371; Canada, $319; Germany, $307. That is a quarter of what we \nspend. And they are not receiving bad health care in those countries.\n  Pharmaceutical spending is a little bit more even but, once again, \nwho has to spend the most? Good old USA, more than twice what the OECD \naverage is or The Netherlands; about twice what Australia is. Over and \nover, we see persons punished by the cost of the health care system.\n  Here is what I mentioned earlier, the percentage of the gross \ndomestic product spent on health care: America, 16 percent; the next \nhighest is just under 11; OECD, the average is 8.7 percent. This is not \na sustainable situation.\n  Health care spending per capita, $6,102 for Americans, compared to \nthe competing systems: Canada, $3,165; France, $3,159; The Netherlands, \nGermany, Australia, OECD, UK, Japan, New Zealand, down to $2,083, about \na third of what we spend in the United States of America. And they have \nvery decent health care systems and, in many cases, better health care \noutcomes.\n  This is similar to the other graph showing that $6,102 goes per \ncapita per year to support our health care system. This shows that if \nyou break it up into public spending in the yellow, out-of-pocket \nspending in the white, and private insurance spending in the blue, if \nyou take the private and out-of-pocket spending, it is more than every \nother country with which we compete. That entire $2,572 per person in \nprivate insurance spending is all above what everybody else has to pay \nfor health care in their countries. No wonder facts such as these \nemerge.\n  Physicians perceive that patients often have difficulty paying for \nmedications: 51 percent of American doctors have observed in their \nprofessions that we Americans have difficulty paying for our \nprescriptions--51 percent. In New Zealand, the next highest, it is 27 \npercent; Canada, 24 percent; Germany, 23 percent; Australia, 15 \npercent; UK, 13 percent; down to Netherlands, 7 percent. Wouldn't we be \nbetter off as a country if only 7 percent of physicians reported that \ntheir patients often had trouble paying for medications?\n  And for all of that, look at some of the results we get. Deaths due \nto surgical or medical mishaps per 100,000 population: America leads \nthe nations with .7 mishaps per 100,000; .6 for Germany; .5 for Canada \nand France, all the way down to .2 for Japan and The Netherlands. We \npay more, but we don't get better results.\n  This one makes me cringe to look at. Infant mortality rate for our \ncountry: 7 deaths per 1,000 live births. Look at the countries that \nbeat us in infant mortality: New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom, \nGreece, Ireland, Portugal, Australia, Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, \nDenmark, Belgium, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, France, Spain, \nNorway, Sweden, Finland, Japan, and Iceland, with many countries with \nan infant mortality rate half our country's, despite the fact we are \nspending twice as much on health care.\n  If we look at potential years of life lost to circulatory illness, \nwhich means dying younger than you should have, America leads: 825 \npotential years of life lost per 100,000 population; Australia, 419; \nFrance, 411, half as much. It is embarrassing.\n  Potential years of life lost due to diabetes: In the U.S., again, \n101, down to Japan, 25, four times better. Look at how we are outliers \nagainst the rest of our competitors and against these other developed \nnations.\n  Diseases of the respiratory system: Here we go again. Who is the \nworst? The USA.\n  Obesity: This is a huge indicator of future illness and future health \ncare expense. Again, who is the worst? Madam President, 30.6 percent in \nthe U.S., down to 9.5 percent in France; 10.9 percent in The \nNetherlands; 12.9 percent for Germany; the OECD average, 13 percent. We \nare twice as bad as the OECD average.\n  Look at the system that is backing it up. Patients reporting any \nerror based on the number of doctors they have seen: If they have 4 or \nmore doctors, 48 percent of American patients reported errors; with 1 \ndoctor, it is 22 percent. We are worse than all the other countries \nagain and again.\n  It is similar for medical, medication, and lab errors. Who is the \nworst? The United States, with 34 percent compared to 22 percent in the \nUK; 23 percent for Germany; 25 percent for New Zealand; 27 percent for \nAustralia; 30 percent for Canada.\n  Incorrect lab and diagnostic test or delay in receiving abnormal test \nresults: Again, who has the worst record? The U.S., 23 percent. The \nGermans managed to get that down to 9 percent. We are more than twice \nas bad as they are.\n  Coordination of care, vitally important for people who have multiple \nillnesses and multiple treatments, reporting of coordination problems: \nThe U.S., 43 percent for those with 4 or more doctors; 22 percent for \nthose with 1 doctor. That is again, worse than all of our competitors \nthat were in the study.\n\n  Difficulty getting care on nights, weekends, and holidays without \ngoing\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\nto the ER: It has become standard in America that the place you get \ncare on nights, weekends, and holidays is the emergency room, and that \nis why 61 percent of adults who sought care reported it was very or \nsomewhat difficult to get care without going to the emergency room. In \nGermany and New Zealand, they managed to get that to 25 percent and 28 \npercent respectively, another measure that the system is not serving \nthe American people.\n  Test results or medical records not available at the time of \nappointment: 23 percent compared to 11 in Germany. Again, we are the \nworst on the table.\n  Doctors who report they routinely receive alerts about potential \nproblems with drug dosage or drug interactions: In the United Kingdom, \n91 percent report they receive alerts about a potential problem with a \ndrug dosage or interaction; 97 if you include those who use a manual \nsystem; 93 percent total in New Zealand; 95 percent in The Netherlands; \n90 percent in Australia; 51 percent in the United States. We are not \neven close by a lot of these measures.\n  Here is our public investment per capita in health information \ntechnology, which is probably the platform to the solution of our \nhealth care dilemma: United Kingdom, 192 bucks per person in 2005; \nCanada, $31; Germany, $21; Australia, $4.93. Here is what we invest in \nthe U.S.: 43 cents--43 cents--to develop health information technology. \nNo wonder we are getting those results we saw.\n  And here they are, primary care doctors' use of electronic patient \nmedical records: 98 percent of primary care doctors use electronic \npatient medical records in The Netherlands; 92 percent in New Zealand; \n89 percent in the UK; 79 percent in Australia; 42 percent in Germany; \nand look at us, 28 percent. It is pathetic.\n  And where are the financial incentives to encourage doctors to do it? \nWhy is it at 28 percent? Look who reports they have financial \nincentives for quality of care improvements: 95 percent do in the UK; \n79 percent in New Zealand; 72 percent in Australia. Who, again, is the \nworst? Who again is trailing the civilized, developed world? The United \nStates of America. Again, it is embarrassing.\n  If you are managing patients with chronic disease, which is where the \nbig money is and where the biggest health risks are, how many primary \ncare doctors get financial incentives for quality of care improvement: \n79 percent do in the United Kingdom; 68 percent do in New Zealand; 62 \npercent in Australia; in The Netherlands, 47 percent; in Canada, 37 \npercent; in Germany, 24 percent. Look at us, 8 percent. And we wonder \nwhy there is a problem.\n  We are not even happy about the system and our interactions dealing \nwith it. Does your doctor always listen carefully? Who comes in last? \nThe U.S.\n  Does your doctor always explain things so you can understand them? \nWho comes in last? The U.S.\n  Does your doctor always spend enough time with you? Who comes in \nlast? The U.S.\n  I know I have taken everybody through a lot of graphs. There are a \nlot more in the overall study by the Commonwealth Fund. This is the \nwrap-up of the ranks for 2004, 2006, and 2007 of the six nations. Who \nis last every year? Sixth place for six; sixth place for six; sixth \nplace for six; and for $6,102 per person compared to about $3,000 or \nless for almost every other one of our competitors.\n  This is what it leads to. This is spending on health per capita. Back \nin 1980, all the nations were grouped fairly closely together. The \nother nations have remained fairly closely grouped. But look at what \nhas happened to our cost profile, and it is going to continue to go up \nand up and up and up, and we are going to come to a breaking point.\n  David Walker, the former Comptroller General, has said the cost of \nthe unfunded liability we bear for the future costs of entitlement \nprograms is $53 trillion. I come from Rhode Island. We don't deal in \ntrillions of dollars. Our whole State budget is a little over $5 \nbillion.\n  What is $53 trillion? If a penny is $1 billion and 5 pennies is a \nstack about this high, which will be the entire State of Rhode Island \nbudget, $53 trillion is a stack of pennies more than 250 feet high, \nthrough the roof of this building and hundreds of feet into the air.\n  What we are going to have is a health care calamity. We have two \nchoices as to how we deal with it. We can wait around. We can wait \nuntil the wolf is at the door and then we can decide we cannot afford \n$53 trillion. We can make fiscal adjustments to that. We know what \nfiscal adjustments we can make. We have done some already. You pay \nproviders less. You throw more people off health care. You make \ninsurance coverage thinner. You raise taxes to pay for it. But we have \ngone down all those roads already. We have gone too far down those \nroads already. And if we are left with only those tools in the toolbox \nto solve this health care problem, we will be doing one of the gravest \ndisservices this Congress has ever done to the country we are here to \nserve. Instead, we have to go and look at the health care delivery \nsystem and repair it so it provides better results.\n\n  The good news from all the bad news on those charts is that there is \nenormous room for improvement. We can substantially reduce the cost. \nThere are three important ways I think we can go about doing this. The \nfirst is to improve our health information technology. We need to have \na national health information technology infrastructure. The RAND \nCorporation values having a national health information technology \ninfrastructure at somewhere between $81 billion and $346 billion per \nyear. That type of savings is worth spending some serious money to \nachieve--not the 43 cents per person we saw on the graph. We have to \nengage in a national urgent construction project of a health \ninformation technology infrastructure.\n  The second thing we have to address significantly is the problem of \nquality and the underinvestment in prevention in our system right now. \nThere are enormous savings to be reached there. In a project we are \ndoing in Rhode Island, copying the Keystone project in Michigan, we are \nseeing significant savings in our intensive care units and improving \nquality of care. In Michigan, in 15 months, they saved about 1,500 \nlives, and they saved about $150 million. And it wasn't even in all the \nintensive care units in Michigan. There are huge savings from quality \nimprovement if you can set up the incentives so people will do it.\n  When we set this up in Rhode Island, the hospitals came to me--I was \nattorney general then--and they said: we will do this, but it is going \nto cost $400,000 a year. And I said: Yes, but it saves money. Keystone \nshowed that. We think it will save $8 million. That is a 20-to-1 \nreturn. Go. And they said: No, no, no, you don't understand how it \nworks in the health care system. That $400,000 comes out of our \nexpenditures. That is a negative on our bottom line. That $8 million \nsavings comes out of our revenues. We get reimbursed for that care. So \nwe will lose $8 million in revenues if you ask us to spend this \n$400,000. That is a big hit.\n  They agreed to do it, but I have taken aboard in my mind and my heart \nthe lesson of how badly our health care system supports providers when \nthey try to improve the quality of care in this very tough financial \nenvironment they are in.\n  That brings us to the third piece. Health information technology was \nfirst, quality prevention investment in ways that will save costs is \nsecond, and the third is to reform the reimbursement system so the \nprice signal that gets sent into the market by our health care system \ndirects people in ways we want.\n  We can't do this on a piecemeal basis any longer. These three ideas \ncan dramatically reform our health care system. They have one problem. \nThey will take some time. You can't turn the switch and make them go. \nWe have some work to do to develop the strategy, to implement it, and \nto build what new infrastructure has to be constructed to make it work. \nI would guess, based on an experience I had in Rhode Island with a \nsimilar reform, that it is a 10-to-15-year lead time to have the full \neffect begin to show itself.\n  And you know what, if you dial back from the time when that $53 \ntrillion fiscal tsunami is going to hit this country, that 10 to 15 \nyears is probably right now. So not only is a new administration with a \nnew President and new energy and new opportunities a great chance in \nthe coming year to begin to\n\n[[Page S6914]]\n\nget this work done and to open a substantial reform of our health care \nsystem, but it is also, in many respects, a deadline.\n  You can go by a highway exit and it is too late to come back to it, \nand I am afraid that is where we are right now. So as I prepare to \nconclude my remarks and yield the floor, I want to say to my \ncolleagues: we are going to have to work very hard together to fix our \nhealth care system in the coming year. I know the financing problems \nand the access problems are real, but I urge and implore you to \nconsider that it is not enough to repair the finance and the access \nproblems of our health care system. We need to get into the delivery \nsystem and fix it so it provides better, less expensive, more efficient \nhealth care for Americans.\n  I believe we can do it, and I believe it is not a partisan issue. It \nis a question of right versus wrong, smart versus stupid, wasteful \nversus efficient, and not right versus left or Republican versus \nDemocrat. So I challenge my colleagues to join me in this fight, and I \nlook forward to the important results from it that America needs.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for recognizing me, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am introducing two bills today, the \nsecond of which resolves the problem of the gas price crisis at the \npumps today.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 3280 \nand S. 3281 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today to speak about an issue \nthat weighs heavily on the minds of every Ohioan--the skyrocketing cost \nof gasoline. There have been many elaborate theories bandied about on \nthe floor of the Senate in the last month as to why gasoline is so \nexpensive. We have heard that investors are driving up the cost of oil \nby 20 to 30 percent. But businessman Warren Buffett has said ``it's not \nspeculation, it's supply and demand.'' And Paul Krugman wrote in an op-\ned, ``the hyperventilation over oil market speculation is distracting \nus from the real issues.''\n  Madam President, I will insert for the Record an article which \nappeared in the July 7-14 Newsweek edition by Robert Samuelson titled \n``Let's Shoot the Speculators!'' The quote I want to make as part of my \nspeech is:\n\n       Gosh, if only it were that simple. Speculator-bashing is \n     another exercise in scapegoating and grandstanding. Leading \n     politicians either don't understand what's happening or don't \n     want to acknowledge their complicity.\n\n  There have also been calls to increase production in the 68 million \nnonproducing acres that are already leased. Some of my colleagues are \nclaiming that hundreds of small, medium, and large oil companies are \ncolluding to not drill on their current leases because they want to \nrestrict the supply so they can increase profits. At the same time, \nthose same colleagues accuse the industry of wanting to open ANWR and \nthe OCS to more drilling to increase profits by increasing supply. That \nmakes absolutely no sense.\n\n  I think we can all agree this is a complicated issue with moving \nparts. Congress cannot afford to address the factors contributing to \nthe high gas prices individually as we are doing today. We must look at \nthe pieces comprehensively and find solutions to combat this crisis \nfrom all angles, and we have to act now.\n  Over the past months, I have heard loudly and clearly from thousands \nof Ohioans how this crisis is directly affecting them and their loved \nones. In fact, this past July 4 recess I was talking with folks about \nhigh gas prices. They are frustrated and angry--frustrated at the high \ncost of gasoline and angry that Congress wasn't getting off its you \nknow what to do anything about it. They told me about how the price of \ngasoline is affecting them where it hurts--right in their pocketbook. \nIt is affecting vacation plans for those families who planned to take \nlong trips this summer. It is affecting people who have to drive long \ndistances for a living. And it is particularly affecting people who \nlive on the financial edge.\n  The truth is, with the high cost of natural gas, and the high cost of \ngasoline and food, the standard of living of millions of Americans is \nbeing impacted substantially.\n  Other Ohioans have written to me, and one letter I think about quite \noften was from Mary Keener, who works at the James Cancer Center in \nColumbus. She wrote to my office to tell me about her concerns for \npatients living in Ohio's Appalachian region. She says:\n\n       Patients call our office and say: ``I know I need this \n     cancer treatment to live, but I can't afford to buy the gas \n     to get it. Can you help me?''\n\n  Every day, more and more Ohioans contact me and it is becoming clear \nthat they get it. They realize we need to increase our oil supply and \ndevelop a comprehensive energy strategy.\n  Sadly, this crisis could have been averted. We have known for years \nthat we need a comprehensive energy strategy, and I have been calling \nfor one since I came to the Senate in 1999. In 2002, after the Senate \nfailed to pass the provision that would have opened ANWR and \ndramatically increased our domestic energy production, I said:\n\n       As we go down the road, I think those that voted against \n     this amendment will regret their vote when we face the \n     sticker shock at the gas pump and the eventual impact that \n     continued dependency on foreign oil will have on our national \n     security, economy, and our foreign trade deficit.\n\n  Since that vote, gas prices have increased more than 200 percent. \nMeanwhile, it took 5 years and 6 weeks of floor debate for Congress to \npass the 2005 Energy Policy Act, a bill that only provided limited \nstrides forward. And while the bill took modest steps to improve \nnational energy efficiency, boost research and development funding for \nadvanced energy technologies, and promote increased use of biofuels, it \ndid not go far enough toward increasing our domestic energy supply.\n  For years, the gap in the United States between demand and domestic \nsupply has been widening. In fact, U.S. oil production has steadily \ndeclined since 1970, when it was nearly 10 million barrels per day, to \n5.1 barrels in 2007. So with less domestic resources available, we have \nbeen forced to seek energy abroad.\n  In 1973, the United States imported 6 million barrels of oil per day, \nor 34 percent of our total supply. By 2006, net oil imports were 12.4 \nmillion barrels per day, or 60 percent of our total liquid fuel use.\n  This chart gives you an idea of what has happened. Our domestic oil \nproduction has gone down and our need for imported oil has gone up. You \ncan see the gap that exists. And the only way we are going to make any \nprogress is to reduce that gap that is so pronounced today.\n  While Americans understand we need to increase the supply of oil, I \nam not sure they fully realize to what extent our life is threatened by \nour reliance on foreign sources of oil. Every year we send billions of \ndollars overseas for oil to pad the coffers of many nations that don't \nhave our best interest at heart, such as Venezuela, whose leader has \nthreatened to cut oil off to the United States.\n  In fact, in 2007, we spent more than $327 billion to import oil. \nSixty percent of this, or nearly $200 billion, went to the oil \nexporting OPEC nations. In 2008, the amount we will spend to import oil \nis expected to double to more than $600 billion, $360 billion of which \nis going to go to the OPEC nations. Let's take a moment to put those \nfigures into context, when compared to our fiscal year 2008 budget for \nour national defense, which was more than $693 billion. The $600 \nbillion we will spend to import oil in 2008 is nearly equal--it is \nnearly equal--to the entire defense budget of the United States.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil has serious national security \nimplications. In addition to funding our enemies, as I explained, we \ncannot ignore the fact that much of our oil comes from and travels \nthrough the most volatile regions of the world. A couple of years ago I \nattended a series of war games hosted by the National Defense \nUniversity. I saw firsthand how our country's economy could be brought \nto its knees if somebody wanted to cut off our oil, as was done in \n1973.\n  Do you know that 80 percent of the global oil routes flow through \nunstable countries, such as Iran? Over 40 percent of the world's oil \ntravels through the Strait of Hormuz.\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\n  Just to give an idea, this graph reflects where we are getting our \noil. Here is Venezuela--Chavez, the dictator down there who is working \nagainst our interests constantly in South America. He is no friend of \nours. The Middle East. We know what we have over in this unstable part \nof the world. Our concern about Iran is also impacting on the price of \noil, because people are not certain what is going to happen in terms of \nIran.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil is even more troubling when you \nconsider our Nation's financial situation. The decline of the dollar \nhas had a direct effect on increasing prices of gasoline. In fact, many \nexperts say we are paying substantially more to export oil today \nbecause of the weak dollar.\n  We cannot overlook our national debt. Today, 51 percent of the \nprivately owned national debt is held by foreign creditors, mostly \nforeign central banks. That is up from 6 years ago. Foreign creditors \nprovided more than 70 percent of the funds the United States has \nborrowed since 2001, according to the Department of the Treasury.\n  Who are these creditors? According to the Treasury Department, the \nthree largest holders of U.S. debt are China, Japan, and OPEC. This is \ninsane. It has to stop. We cannot afford to allow at this time \ncountries that control our oil and our debt to control the future of \nthe United States of America.\n  We need to enact an energy policy that broadens our base of energy \nresources to create stability, maintain reasonable prices, and protect \nour Nation's security. It must be a policy that will keep energy \naffordable, and it must be a policy that will not cripple the engines \nof commerce that fund the research that will yield environmental \nprotection technologies for the future.\n  We need a second Declaration of Independence to move us away from \nforeign sources of energy in the near term and away from oil in the \nlong term.\n  This is not going to be easy. As you know, oil is not easily found \nnor substituted, and it will remain an integral part of our economy in \nthe short term. But we must make investments today that will help us \nachieve our goal tomorrow. To do this, I believe we must increase our \nsupply, reduce our demand through alternative energies, and conserve \nwhat we already have.\n  We are trying to get folks to understand that if we want relief from \nhigh gas costs, we must begin to make investments today that will help \nus achieve our goal tomorrow. We talked a lot in recent weeks about \nfinding more and using less. If we had accomplished this 10 years ago, \nI would not be here talking about the high price of gasoline and the \nsuffering of Ohioans in my State.\n  In order to stabilize our Nation's energy supply, we must enact \npolicies to increase development of domestic oil. While these resources \nwill not physically come on line for a number of years--and people \nbetter understand it--moves to expand the development will send a clear \nsignal to the market that we are serious about meeting our future \nenergy demands and immediately begin to drive down the cost of oil \nbecause our investors will know that gas will not be worth as much in \nthe future, and therefore they will sell it off today. It will have an \nimpact on the price.\n  The fact is, we have more energy resources in the United States than \nany other country in the world. We are the No. 3 oil producer in the \nworld, but the majority of our oil resources are locked up. Madam \nPresident, 85 percent of our offshore acreage and 65 percent of our \nonshore acreage is off limits. I was embarrassed that we have gone to \nSaudi Arabia with our hat in our hand to beg them to increase oil \nproduction. Rather than begging the Saudi Government, we need to be \nutilizing our own resources.\n  The other day I said if I were King Abdallah of Saudi Arabia, I would \nsay to President Bush: Mr. President, why do you come to me asking for \nmore of our oil when you have great resources in your country? You want \nto use all of our resources. In Alaska you have more than 10 billion \nbarrels of oil. You had a chance to open ANWR to responsible \nenvironmentally friendly oil exploration in 1995, but President Clinton \nvetoed it. Your country could be producing an extra 1 million barrels \nof oil today, an increase of 20 percent over your current production.\n  Did you know that Prudhoe Bay, located west of ANWR, has cleanly \ndelivered billions of barrels of crude oil since the 1970s, providing a \nstrong example of the drilling that can be done safely with minimal \nenvironmental impact with today's technology and environmental \nsafeguards.\n  You could also give your States the option of drilling on the Outer \nContinental Shelf. These reserves are believed to equal 8.5 billion \nbarrels of oil, and undiscovered resources could equal 10 times that. \nThat is 85 billion barrels of oil. But a moratorium currently prohibits \naccess to the OCS.\n  By the way, I commend President Bush for lifting the executive \nmoratorium. I will just keep talking for King Abdallah.\n  I know some of your environmentalists are concerned, but it is my \nunderstanding that there has not been a significant oilspill on the \ngulf coast for nearly 30 years, and in 2005 Hurricane Katrina passed \noverhead nearly 4,000 rigs without causing a significant spill.\n  You could make use of your vast reserves of oil shale. There are \ncurrently 800 billion barrels of oil, technically recoverable reserves, \nin the United States. That is three times larger than the total proven \noil reserves of Saudi Arabia. Think of that, three times as much.\n  The Rand Corporation noted that:\n\n       If oil shale could be used to meet a quarter of United \n     States' demand, 800 billion barrels would last for more than \n     400 years.\n\n  Again, you passed a moratorium that prohibits access to these \nreserves--regulations even to go in there. Your friend up north, \nCanada, has some of the largest tar sand reserves in the world. A \nCongressman named Waxman passed a provision that jeopardizes access to \nthose resources.\n  Don't forget coal. You have 250 years of coal in the United States, \nmore than any other nation in the world. You are being prevented from \nusing coal to liquid. As a matter of fact, in the State of Ohio, Baard \nEnergy is planning a coal-to-liquid and biomass facility that will \nproduce 53,000 barrels a day of jet and diesel fuel and other \nproduction from coal and biomass feedstocks.\n  Advances in carbon capture sequestration technology would lower the \ngreenhouse gas emissions, but again, because of Congressman Waxman, \nyour coal-to-liquid industry has slowed the Air Force's plans to run \ntheir entire fleet on synthetic fuel by 2016.\n  We ought to realize this. How did the Germans stay in the war effort \nwhen they had no oil? They took the coal they had, they converted it to \noil, and that is how they kept their war machine going. It seems to me \nwe ought to at least give recognition to the fact that we should make \nsure that our defense has all of the resources it needs in terms of \noil.\n  I think we have to get real. We say to all these other countries that \nwe want them to use their reserves, increase their supply. Frankly, \nthey should say: Why don't you do it yourself? Why don't you do it?\n  The other thing we have to do is we have to use less. It is long past \ntime for our Government to provide the spark to rekindle our Nation's \ncreativity and innovation. Following Russia's launch of Sputnik, \nPresident Kennedy challenged us and said we are going to put a man on \nthe Moon in 10 years, and we did it. By golly, if we could put a man on \nthe Moon in 10 years, we can figure out how we can become the country \nthat uses oil the least in the world. We do need a new Apollo project \nto encourage further advances in ethanol to cut consumption and the \ndevelopment of more efficient, hybrid electric and plug-in vehicles. I \nhope my grandchildren will be using plug-in vehicles. They will not be \nusing any oil at all in terms of their transportation. If half our \nfleet of 240 million vehicles were converted to electric hybrids, we \ncould reduce our oil imports by 4 to 5 million barrels a day.\n  Last week I chaired an energy forum and had the opportunity to hear \nfrom David Vieu, president of A123 Systems, which company is developing \nAmerican-made battery technology. He explained that this technology is \nalready commercially viable.\n  We are making some headway. We have to make up our minds that we are \ngoing to get the job done. We have to let the world know. Can you \nimagine what we could do? Let the world know we are going to go after \nevery drop we\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\nhave available, in terms of our supply, and we are going to do \neverything we can to reduce our demand. We are going to do everything \nwe can to conserve what we have. I believe that will send the fear of \nGod through those individuals, and we will see an impact on the cost of \noil in this country, even though it is going to happen in the future.\n  Do you know what is funny. These folks are betting that we will not \ndo what we ought to do because they have watched us. They have watched \nus. They have seen that we have not used our resources. They have \nwatched us and seen that we have not used the best technology to reduce \nour demand for oil. They have watched us as we have not conserved as we \nshould have been doing during the last number of years.\n  I think the chickens have come home to roost. High gas prices are \nhurting Americans. The problem we have had in this country is, we \nhaven't had an energy policy, but we have not harmonized our \nenvironment, our energy, our economy, and our national security. I am \nconfident we can come together on a bipartisan basis and work something \nout so the American people understand that the Senate and Congress have \ncome together on an issue that is of crisis proportion to our fellow \nAmericans, and that we care more about them and our country's future \nthan we do about bickering with each other.\n\n  I go home all the time, and people just say: the reason your numbers \nare so bad is because we think you guys, men and women, are more \ninterested in partisan politics and bickering than you are in getting \ntogether and getting the job done.\n  I have to say, from my perspective, it is very frustrating. I was the \nmayor of Cleveland, an 8-to-1 Democratic city; 21 councilmen and the \nmost powerful council president. We worked together. We figured out how \nto move the city of Cleveland ahead for 10 years.\n  I became the Governor of Ohio, and Vern Rife was the speaker of the \nhouse 24 years, the most powerful Democratic speaker we had. After he \ndiscovered I was Governor after 6 months--it took a while--Vern and I \nsat down and said: You know what. Let's work together and move Ohio \nahead.\n  I think it is time we got together and said: Republicans and \nDemocrats, let's move America ahead. Wouldn't it be great for our \nchildren and grandchildren to one day celebrate the time America put \naside its differences and came together to reaffirm its independence a \nsecond time and rekindled the American spirit of self reliance, \ninnovation, and creativity to usher in a new era of prosperity?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Newsweek article by Robert \nSamuelson be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, June 28, 2008]\n\n                      Let's Shoot the Speculators!\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       Tired of high gasoline prices and rising food costs? Well, \n     here's a solution. Let's shoot the ``speculators.'' A chorus \n     of politicians, including John McCain, Barack Obama and Sen. \n     Joe Lieberman, blames these financial slimeballs for piling \n     into commodities markets and pushing prices to artificial and \n     unconscionable levels. Gosh, if only it were that simple. \n     Speculator-bashing is another exercise in scapegoating and \n     grandstanding. Leading politicians either don't understand \n     what's happening or don't want to acknowledge their \n     complicity.\n       Granted, raw-material prices have exploded across the \n     board. Look at the table below. It shows price increases for \n     eight major commodities from 2002 to 2007. Oil rose 177 \n     percent, corn 70 percent and copper 360 percent. But that's \n     just the point. Did ``speculators'' really cause all these \n     increases? If so, why did some prices go up more than others? \n     And what about steel? It rose 117 percent--and continued \n     increasing in 2008--even though it's not traded on \n     commodities futures markets.\n       A better explanation is basic supply and demand. Despite \n     the U.S. slowdown, the world economy has boomed. Since 2002, \n     annual growth has averaged 4.6 percent, the highest sustained \n     rate since the 1960s, says economist Michael Mussa of the \n     Peterson Institute. By their nature, raw materials (food, \n     energy, minerals) sustain the broader economy. They're not \n     just frills. When unexpectedly high demand strains existing \n     production capacity, prices rise sharply as buyers scramble \n     for scarce supplies. That's what happened.\n       ``We've had a demand shock,'' says analyst Joel Crane of \n     Deutsche Bank. ``No one foresaw that China would grow at a 10 \n     percent annual rate for over a decade. Commodity producers \n     just didn't invest enough.'' In industry after industry, \n     global buying has bumped up against production limits. In \n     1999, surplus world oil capacity totaled 5 million barrels a \n     day (mbd) on global consumption of 76mbd, reckons the U.S. \n     Energy Information Administration. Now the surplus is about \n     2mbd--and much of that in high-sulfur oil not wanted by \n     refiners--on consumption of 86mbd.\n       Or take nonferrous metals, such as copper and aluminum. \n     ``You had a long period of underinvestment in these \n     industries,'' says economist John Mothersole of Global \n     Insight. For some metals, the collapse of the Soviet Union \n     threw added production--previously destined for tanks, planes \n     and ships--onto world markets. Prices plunged as surpluses \n     grew. But ``the accelerating growth in India and China \n     eliminated the overhang,'' Mothersole says. By some \n     estimates, China now accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of \n     the annual increases in world demand for many metals.\n       Commodity-price increases vary, because markets vary. Rice \n     isn't zinc. No surprise. But ``speculators'' played little \n     role in the price run-ups. Who are these offensive souls? \n     Well, they often don't fit the stereotype of sleazy high \n     rollers: many manage pension funds or university and \n     foundation endowments. Their modest investments in \n     commodities aim to improve returns.\n       These extra funds might drive up prices if they were \n     invested in stocks or real estate. But commodity investing is \n     different. Investors generally don't buy the physical goods, \n     whether oil or corn. Instead, they trade ``futures \n     contracts,'' which are bets on future prices in, say, six \n     months. For every trader betting on higher prices, another is \n     betting on lower. These trades are matched. In the stock \n     market, all investors (buyers and sellers) can profit in a \n     rising market and all can lose in a falling market. In \n     futures markets, one trader's gain is another's loss.\n       Futures contracts enable commercial consumers and producers \n     of commodities to hedge. Airlines can lock in fuel prices by \n     buying oil futures; farmers can lock in a selling price for \n     their grain by selling grain futures. What makes the futures \n     markets work is the large number of purely financial \n     players--``speculators'' just in it for the money--who often \n     take the other side of hedgers' trades. But all the frantic \n     trading doesn't directly affect the physical supplies of raw \n     materials. In theory, high futures prices might reduce \n     physical supplies if they inspired hoarding. Commercial \n     inventories would rise. The evidence today contradicts that; \n     inventories are generally low. World wheat stocks, compared \n     with consumption, are near historic lows.\n       Recently the giant mining company Rio Tinto disclosed an \n     average 85 percent price increase in iron ore for its Chinese \n     customers. That was stunning proof that physical supply and \n     demand--not financial shenanigans--are setting prices: iron \n     ore isn't traded on futures markets. The crucial question is \n     whether these price increases are a semi permanent feature of \n     the global economy or just a passing phase as demand abates \n     and new investments increase supply. Prices for a few \n     commodities (lead, nickel, zinc) have receded. Could oil be \n     next? Barron's, the financial newspaper, thinks so.\n       Politicians now promise tighter regulation of futures \n     markets, but futures markets are not the main problem. \n     Physical scarcities are. Government subsidies and preferences \n     for corn-based ethanol have increased food prices by \n     diverting more grain into biofuels. A third of the U.S. corn \n     crop could go to ethanol this year. Restrictions on offshore \n     oil exploration and in Alaska have reduced global oil \n     production and put upward pressures on prices. If politicians \n     wish to point fingers of blame for today's situation, they \n     should start with themselves.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about two judicial \nnominees who were approved by this Chamber a few hours ago, both from \nmy home State of New York. Happily, earlier today, they were confirmed \nby voice vote to be district judges in the Southern and Eastern \nDistricts of New York. Both of these nominees, Magistrate Judge Kiyo \nMatsumoto and Paul\n\n[[Page S6917]]\n\nGardephe, were rated unanimously ``well qualified'' by the American Bar \nAssociation, and both were unanimously reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee before they were confirmed today.\n  In New York, we have actually worked out a wonderful system for \nnominating judges to the district and circuit courts in which the \nPresident and I have worked extremely well together to name mainstream, \nconsensus candidates to the Federal bench such as these two nominees.\n  Some of my Republican friends were here on the floor earlier making \nall kinds of assertions about the judicial nominations process. \nUndoubtedly, there has been rancor when it comes to judges from other \nparts of the country, but it doesn't have to be that way. When the \nadministration works closely and cooperatively with home State \nSenators, as we have done in New York, things work out extremely well. \nHighly qualified, mainstream judges, not too far on either side, are \napproved--some nominated by the President and some nominated by the \nSenators from New York. In my State, we work well together. The results \nare not only mainstream consensus nominees but mainstream consensus \nnominees without the acrimony. Two of the consensus nominees were \nbefore us earlier today.\n  I am particularly pleased to support Judge Matsumoto in the Eastern \nDistrict to be judge because I personally recommended her to the \nPresident. When I interviewed her, I was deeply impressed by her poise, \nintellect, temperament, and thoughtfulness. The sitting judges in the \ndistrict speak extremely highly of her, and her record of public \nservice and accomplishment speaks for itself. Her confirmation, \nmoreover, is historic. She now becomes only the second Asian-American \nwoman ever to be confirmed to the Federal bench. We hope another and \nanother and another will come soon.\n  Judge Matsumoto graduated with high honors from the University of \nCalifornia at Berkeley and received her J.D. from Georgetown. Her \ndistinguished career has included work in the private sector, in \nacademia, and public service. For years, Judge Matsumoto has been a \nwell-respected Federal magistrate judge in the Eastern District. In \nfact, on only one occasion has a reviewing district court judge \ndeclined to adopt Judge Matsumoto's report or recommendations. That is \nan extremely impressive record.\n  I am not only proud to support the nomination of Judge Matsumoto \nbecause of her integrity and qualifications but also because I believe \nshe will contribute to a diversity of perspectives on the Federal \nbench. I have always believed that our Federal bench should reflect the \nsame broad diversity of experience as America writ large. I have \nendeavored to add minorities to the benches of New York State. I am \nendeavoring now to add women as well because fewer than one-third of \nsitting judges in the Eastern District are women, and Judge Matsumoto \nwill help narrow the gap. I have also nominated a woman to sit in the \nSouthern District whom, hopefully, we will nominate next week, as she \nwas approved by the Judiciary Committee unanimously.\n  Of course, there is an unfortunate underrepresentation of Asian \nAmericans on the bench. With her confirmation, Judge Matsumoto becomes \nonly the third Asian-American Federal judge outside of the Ninth \nCircuit and only the second ever in New York. The only other, Denny \nChin, was confirmed to the Southern District bench 14 years ago.\n  Judge Matsumoto has received the enthusiastic support of other \ngroups, including the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association. \nThey call Judge Matsumoto's nomination ``a potential milestone for the \nAsian Pacific American community.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  Judge Matsumoto's father and mother, merely because they were of \nJapanese descent, were forcibly removed to an internment camp during \nWorld War II. Fifty years later, their daughter ascends to the Federal \nbench. This shows that in America, we make our mistakes, but we also \nhave greatness. Judge Matsumoto's life and career show the greatness of \nthose who believe in America and push our Nation to its best potential. \nThe woman whose family was subject to the worst injustice under law, \nnow, as a result of her own talent and hard work, has a seat of legal \npower to judge others with intellectual excellence and fairness. God \nbless America for these kinds of things that happen.\n  Finally, I would like to say a few words in favor of Judge Paul \nGardephe, who was earlier confirmed as a judge in the Southern District \nof New York. Mr. Gardephe has an impressive and eclectic legal resume \nthat includes work in both the public and private sector, work on \ncriminal prosecution, criminal defense, civil litigation, and corporate \nlaw. He is a magna cum laude graduate of the University of Pennsylvania \nand Columbia Law School. He served as a law clerk to Judge Engel on the \nSixth Circuit, has spent 9 years as a prosecutor in the Southern \nDistrict, and worked as deputy general counsel for Time, Inc. Mr. \nGardephe also worked for the inspector general in the Department of \nJustice, where he was involved in the review of the Department's \nperformance in the Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames spying cases. Mr. \nGardephe was also honored with the Thurgood Marshall Award for his work \nrepresenting a death row inmate pro bono.\n  When I decide whether to support a nominee to the Federal bench, the \nmost important criteria to me is this: Is the nominee an ideologue or \nwill the nominee place the rule of law ahead of his or her own personal \nideological views? I believe both of these nominees will make excellent \njudges who will be impartial and thoughtful guardians of the rule of \nlaw. I am pleased that my colleagues voted to confirm both of them. I \nheartily congratulate the nominees and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I think we all agree that balancing \nenvironmental with energy goals can be a challenge, but it is a \nchallenge we must confront now.\n  Members of this body have discussed various proposals to regulate the \noutput of greenhouse gases. Some advocate doing it though a cap-and-\ntrade approach. Others have advocated a carbon tax. Such proposals are \naimed at limiting future carbon output into the atmosphere.\n  Discussion and debate is not enough. We need action now. One resource \noften overlooked is coal. Despite the recent pace in developing clean \ncoal technologies, America cannot afford to simply give up on this \nchallenge. Coal is an abundant, affordable, reliable, and secure energy \nsource. It has the potential to become an even cleaner fuel.\n  I believe another solution to protect our environment and our economy \ncan be found in the GEAR Act. This bill takes a new look at climate \nchange by tapping into human potential and the American spirit to \ndevelop the technological solutions we need to address climate change.\n  Recently, there was a very thoughtful editorial written by Shawn \nTaylor which was printed in the ``Wyoming Livestock Roundup'' on July \n12, 2008. Shawn is the executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric \nAssociation. I believe he does a terrific job of summing up the \nfeelings of Wyoming people on the need to take action balancing climate \nchange goals while keeping bills affordable.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the editorial to which I referred \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Was Chicken Little Right?\n\n                           (By Shawn Taylor)\n\n       Is the sky falling? In the past I would have responded to \n     this question by saying, ``It depends on whom you ask,'' but \n     in today's world you'll be hard pressed to find anyone \n     involved in the energy/environmental/business/agriculture, \n     etc. industries that would argue with Chicken Little.\n       Whether you agree with those who subscribe to the man-made \n     global warming theory, or those who think the status quo is \n     acceptable, or somewhere in between, you can find a scientist \n     with numbers to argue your case. But I would like to try to \n     focus on some political, physical and, economic realities.\n       First, pressure is mounting in Congress to do something \n     about climate change. Both presidential candidates have \n     stated they support a cap and trade approach to curb \n     emissions of carbon dioxide. While political debates in \n     Washington, D.C. may seem far away the outcome will have a \n     direct impact on you, whether you're in the agriculture \n     industry, a small business owner or just own a house and have \n     to pay your utility bill.\n\n[[Page S6918]]\n\n       Experts now say some areas of the country will be short of \n     power within one or two years. Climate change is but one \n     aspect of a looming energy crisis created by increasing \n     demand and decreasing capacity to meet that demand.\n       While Wyoming's elected representatives in D.C. are \n     sympathetic and understand these issues, many in D.C. aren't \n     spending a lot of time on the energy supply issue. The desire \n     to reduce greenhouse gas emissions quickly without regard to \n     our national economy and giving short shrift to technology-\n     driven solutions, and the growing demand for power are about \n     to collide and form, excuse the cliche, the perfect storm.\n       Second, while all Americans need to start being more \n     efficient with their energy usage, energy conservation cannot \n     meet the nation's power needs alone. While the development of \n     more renewable resources helps diversify and strengthen our \n     energy supplies, they are not the silver bullet solution to \n     climate change. We need everything we can get our hands on in \n     the near future, just to keep the lights on, to say nothing \n     of a long-term energy policy.\n       Third, to avert an energy crisis, the federal government \n     must exercise true leadership. Without that leadership--\n     without a sound, responsible plan--government risks not only \n     the reliability of our electric system, but literally the \n     ability of many Americans to be able to afford to pay their \n     electric bill. Consumers could be paying a higher bill each \n     month without the guarantee the lights will stay on.\n       Folks in Wyoming and across the country need to start a \n     dialogue with their elected officials at every level by \n     asking the following questions:\n       Balancing electricity needs and environmental goals will be \n     difficult. How much is this effort going to increase my \n     electric bill; what will you do to make it affordable; and in \n     the end, will these emissions reduction goals have a global \n     impact?\n       Experts say our nation's growing electricity needs will \n     soon go well beyond what renewable energy and energy \n     conservation and efficiency can provide. What is your plan to \n     make sure we have the electricity we'll need in the future? \n     What are you doing to fully fund the research required to \n     make emissions free electric plants an affordable reality?\n       I encourage you to contact your representatives and \n     senators and ask them these questions and ask they pose the \n     same questions to their colleagues.\n       You don't need to be an energy expert to ask questions. You \n     I do need to be aware you may not be able to pay your utility \n     bill in the future, or that there might not even be a utility \n     bill to pay! Asking questions helps find the answers to solve \n     the problem of balancing climate change goals while keeping \n     your electricity reliable and your bills affordable.\n       Right now members of Congress, as well as state elected \n     officials, are hearing from lots of different interest groups \n     with ideas about how to address climate change or global \n     warming or emissions reductions, whatever you want to call \n     it. While I write this as the Executive Director of the \n     Wyoming Rural Electric Association, the problems we face are \n     pretty much universal, and the one group that, to date, has \n     been left out of the conversation is the consumer. We need a \n     plan people can live with today while we deal with the long-\n     term issue of balancing energy policy and environmental \n     policy.\n       To make things easy there is a website to allow you, the \n     consumer, to contact your Congressional delegation and ask \n     them the questions mentioned above. The website \n     www.ourenergy.coop was established by the National Rural \n     Electric Cooperative Association but you don't have to be a \n     member of a co-op to ask these questions, you just have to be \n     concerned about the approach D.C. is taking.\n       Policy makers far too often don't ask questions until \n     something goes wrong. We believe it makes sense to know the \n     answers before the laws are passed. You can help your elected \n     officials and yourself by having this conversation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know we are moving to the bill that \ndeals with speculation, which is designed to bring down the price of \ngasoline. I think there is a bubble out there of some kind in the price \nof gasoline, at least I hope so. If that is so, I think we could see \nthat bubble burst or some of the steam come out of it. I think it is \nsomething we ought to encourage.\n  Some of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, \njustifiably, are concerned that we are trying to pass a law that will \nend the right to contract, end the right to protect yourself from \nrising costs, and those kinds of things. I, frankly, am not that \nworried about it. I think there is a danger we could overregulate the \nfutures market. I do not think, historically, we have ever attempted to \ndo that in any fundamental sense.\n  It is pretty clear, if we do not have a futures market here, one will \nexist in some other place in the world, as they already do today. So I \nguess I would say, if you can come up with a good bill that does not do \nany real damage, that it might help reduce speculation, I would be \ninclined to consider it and give it a fair shake.\n  But I do not believe that is the problem we have today. I believe \npeople are speculating and driving up prices from that speculation, if \nit is occurring--and it probably is to some small degree--because there \nis a shortage of the amount of oil on the world market, that the demand \nis greater than supply. When the price of oil on the world market was \n$20 a barrel--that was not too long ago--$40 a barrel, if the \nspeculators were so powerful, why didn't they drive it up then?\n  What happened, according to most experts, is we are consuming about \n87 billion barrels of oil a year, and we are producing about 86 \nbillion. Supply is inelastic and demand is inelastic. So when the price \ngoes up, people do not stop using it much.\n  We are beginning to see about a 3-percent reduction in the American \nuse of gasoline, after a doubling of the price. So most people would \nlike to use less, but between their work and their family and their \njust needs, they have to use automobiles in this country, and they are \nnot able to go out and sell their pickup truck or their SUV and buy \nsome hybrid automobile this week. It would be nice, but people cannot \nafford to give away those things they have invested large amounts of \nmoney in.\n  We have done the calculations on it, and I have concluded that based \non 24,000 miles traveled by a typical two-car American family per year, \nthe increase in gasoline prices, in 1 year, means that family is paying \napproximately $105 more per month--per month--than they were just 1 \nyear ago\n\n[[Page S6919]]\n\nfor the same number of gallons of gasoline.\n  This is after your taxes are paid, after your retirement \ncontributions are made, after your insurance is paid, after your house \npayment is paid. After that, there is not that much aftertax money for \nthe average American. They have to watch how they spend it. To have, \nout of the blue, in 1 year, another $105 a month out of that paycheck \nis something that is a real hit to them. I believe it is impacting \nfamilies significantly, individuals significantly, and it is hurting \nour economy also. There is no doubt about it, to my way of thinking.\n  There are some things we can do. I wish to be frank with my \ncolleagues. I have been disappointed in the Democratic proposals. Some \nweeks ago, when we first started talking about energy, the proposals \nthat came forth had three basic criteria--three principles.\n  The first one had to do with taxing oil companies. Now, I am not \nsaying we should never tax oil companies any more than they are being \npaid. But if our problem is a shortage of oil--and I believe \nfundamentally that is the situation--to tax the people who produce it \nis not a way to get more of it. What you tax, you get less. What you \nsubsidize, you get more. So that certainly is not a long-term solution \nto the crisis we are facing today.\n  Another proposal that was in the package at that time was that we \nwould sue OPEC, we would sue the oil-producing nations that collaborate \ntogether and decide they are going to constrict the world supply of \noil, therefore creating shortages, therefore driving up the price of \noil, and allowing them to make even more money per gallon than they \nwere making before.\n  They are doing that. They are absolutely meeting to control the \nproduction of oil, with a goal to drive up the price of oil and gas on \nthe American consumer. In one sense, as I have said for several years, \nwhen OPEC meets, they meet to decide how much to tax the American \nconsumer. We need a systemic, long-term strategy to confront that \nproblem politically and any other way we can do it because it is not \nright what has been happening.\n  So production in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Russia, and even Mexico is \ndown. They do not have much incentive to increase their production \nbecause the price has gone from $40 a barrel on the world market to \n$140 a barrel--now dropping maybe 10 percent in the last few days. \nThank goodness we are beginning to see a little better trend. But who \nknows whether it will be permanent. So by reducing their production, \nshortages have been created, and that has spiked the prices. I am very \nunhappy about that.\n  But I am a former U.S. attorney, Federal prosecutor, as the Presiding \nOfficer is, and I am not aware of how it is possible for the United \nStates of America to file a lawsuit against a sovereign nation to try \nto order them, I guess--what court is going to do this--to order them \nto produce more of the oil that is in their ground, if they do not want \nto produce it.\n  I do not think we are going to be successful on that. I think that is \njust talk. That is just ``flapdoodle.'' That is not going to work. But \nI tell you, it might be possible, frankly, let me say, that if we had \nto have a lawsuit of that kind, we would probably have a better chance \nof having it filed against the Congress. Maybe Senator Reid would \naccept service because this Congress is keeping America from producing \nour own oil and gas offshore, onshore, in Alaska, and other places.\n  We have systematically passed laws and regulations that have \nprohibited the production of our own resources. Yet we are going to \ncomplain about some other country that does not produce? I think that \nis rather silly. I think the speculation matter--and I am open minded. \nI do not have an automatic rejection of a speculating bill. I would \nsupport, certainly, more investigators to see if there is fraud \ngoing on out there, and I suspect in some places there is. But, \nfundamentally, I am convinced from my study that the problem we are \nhaving is we are using more and more. China is using more and more. \nIndia is using more and more oil and gas.\n\n  I visited South America a couple years ago as a part of a \ncongressional delegation. All those countries are growing at 6, 7, 8, 9 \npercent a year. They are using more and more oil and gas. So the world \nsupply is not growing. In some of the biggest countries it is \ndeclining. As a result, we have a shortage here, and we need to develop \nsome ideas to go forward.\n  We passed CAFE standards, on a bipartisan basis, that I think was a \ngood piece of legislation. Several years before that was attempted--\nmaybe 6 or so years ago--it was attempted, and some of us voted against \nit. I think perhaps a good case can be made that was a bad vote. Things \nwere going along well at the time. The price of oil and gas was not too \nhigh, and we did not want to tell our consumers they had to have \nsmaller automobiles and have more expensive automobiles that got better \ngas mileage.\n  But after the prices went up last year, a lot of us saw we had a \ncrisis facing the country, and we have now passed a lot higher \nstandards, which I think will help us, and we would have probably done \nbetter had we passed those standards some years before.\n  Likewise, I would note it was pretty clear, at that same time period, \nwe were coming to a point where oil was going to become more valuable, \nwe were going to have a crisis in the future, and many of us spoke--and \nI have spoken many times on this floor--about the need to produce from \nthose great reserves in Alaska, the need to produce oil and gas off my \ncoast of Alabama. Off the gulf coast, it is being produced safely. \nPeople go fishing around the oil rigs. Large amounts of oil and gas are \ncoming out of those wells. But huge portions of our gulf and both the \nAtlantic and Pacific coasts are totally blocked from producing.\n  We have hundreds of wells in the Gulf of Mexico, some of them way out \nthere, that are producing large amounts. They have been so much better \ntoday in knowing how to prevent spills, and we have almost no spills \noccurring in the last 20 or 30 years. So we need to do more of that. We \nhave had vote after vote after vote and people have blocked it.\n  So I say people who have been blocking more production need to do \nlike some of us who were not supportive of the higher efficiency \nstandard mandates on automobiles, to begin to rethink their position. I \nthink that is happening. I do believe a lot of Members of this body are \nconcerned about this increase in prices. They know it is hurting \nAmerican citizens. They know it is taking money out of their \npocketbooks. They know it is going to many of these rich Gulf States \nthat have so much money they don't know what to do with it. They are \nbuilding skyscrapers and five-star hotels and golf courses in the \ndesert and all kinds of incredible things with our money. Seven hundred \nbillion dollars a year is going abroad to purchase the 60 percent of \nthe oil we import to use in our automobiles. Over half of the oil and \ngas in our automobiles is imported. This is not good. This is impacting \nour economy negatively. All things being equal, which would you rather? \nHave us produce oil off our coast and keep all that money at home--\nAlabama gets to share a little bit of the resources. This is what \nhappens in the gulf today: The States that approve deep gulf production \nget 37\\1/2\\ percent. We passed this 2 years ago, 3 years ago, in this \nCongress. Twelve-and-a-half percent goes to the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, a prime environmental fund of the U.S. Government, \nand 50 percent goes to the U.S. Treasury.\n\n  Now, some of us have read--and I think most Americans have seen with \nsome positive feeling--that Brazil has identified what appears to be \nvery large reserves off the coast of Brazil. We are so happy. We are \nhappy they are in the Atlantic. We want them to produce, because that \nwill bring on more supplies and can help bring down the price of oil, \nbut we have our own right off our shores. Why would we prefer to send \nour money to Brazil by the billions and tens of billions, hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to purchase oil when we can be keeping it all at \nhome, helping this economy? I have to tell you, it is not in good \nshape.\n  This drain of wealth to buy foreign oil is a negative factor in this \neconomy today and it is hurting us in ways a lot of people don't fully \nrealize. If you are now paying, on top of your house note that you \nstretched yourself to be able to pay when you bought that house as a \nyoung person and now you have to\n\n[[Page S6920]]\n\npay another $105 for gasoline--and, in fact, according to the Cato \nInstitute, electric bills have doubled in 5 years because of primarily \nincreased energy costs--is that not a factor why a lot of people are \nnot able to pay their mortgages? Well, I think it is. However, there \nare some who are so determined to fight fossil fuels that even though \nthey are not able to stop the importing of oil into America that we \nburn in our automobiles, they have been successful in blocking America \nfrom producing its own. We do it cleaner and safer and protect the \nenvironment to a far greater degree than I would think any country in \nthe world, except maybe the people in Europe who are doing it in the \nNorth Sea, which is a rougher, more dangerous area to produce oil than \noff our gulf.\n  I ask: How have we gotten ourselves in this predicament? When the \ngreat party--the great Democratic Party which has the majority in the \nSenate and a majority in the House of Representatives--is called upon \nto respond to a national crisis where the price of oil is surging and \nAmerican pocketbooks are being drained every month, they propose the \nonly bill we have now on the floor, which is a bill that is going to \ndeal with speculation. I don't think that is good enough. I think it is \nnot the fundamental values of most of our colleagues--Democratic or \nRepublican.\n  I am prepared to look very hard with all of my colleagues in a \nbipartisan way to consider how we can produce more than just fossil \nfuels, more than oil and gas and coal and those things. Let's look at \nthe biofuels. Let's look at solar. Let's look at wind. Wind is coming \naround. Wind is becoming more feasible today than we have seen it. The \nGovernment has a big subsidy in wind and that has encouraged the wind \npeople to produce lots and lots of energy, but it is not the most \nreliable source of energy. Electricity, that is what it produces--\nelectricity, not oil for our gasoline, for our car engines. I am \nprepared to consider other things.\n  Why have we created a system in America in which 97 percent of our \nautomobiles burn gasoline, whereas in Europe 50 percent of the cars are \ndiesel? We have new clean diesel technology today. Diesel engines get \n35 to 40 percent better gas mileage than our gasoline engines. Can you \nimagine that, 35 to 40 percent better gas mileage. It is actually \nbetter. According to Popular Mechanics, it gets better gas mileage than \na hybrid engine. Why don't we go back to more diesel energy and work in \nthat way? I am seeing in my home State several facilities that are \ncoming on line that I believe will soon prove we can take waste wood \nproduct and convert it to a liquid fuel that we can burn in our \nautomobiles. Ethanol--or biodiesel, which is even better fuel than \nethanol--and we can do it well below the world price of gasoline. I \nhave my fingers crossed. I believe that is going to happen. I have been \nlooking at that closely and I have supported the efforts that will \npromote that.\n  About 5 percent of the fuel we utilize in automobiles is ethanol, \nwhich comes primarily from corn. The next step is to use wood, \nparticularly waste wood products that are left in the woods after sawn \nlogs are cut. Wood is taken out of cities that you have to pay to \nlandfill and it becomes a waste product. Paper, automobile tires, all \nof this can be converted to fuel and maybe we can get that up to 10, \n12, 15 percent of our supply on biofuels.\n  We are also excited about the possibility of plug-in hybrid \nautomobiles. These are automobiles that have a hybrid engine, but you \nplug them in at night, you charge your battery from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. \nwhen the grid has a low demand on it, charge your battery, and be able \nto drive back and forth to work. The goal is 40 miles without ever \nusing a drop of gasoline, all electricity coming out of the grid. It is \nclean, more cleanly produced, more friendly to the environment, and \nreduces our dependence on foreign oil because our electricity is all \nAmerican produced.\n  Finally, let me not ignore what I believe has perhaps the greatest \npotential for America and the world environmentally and economically, \nand that is nuclear power. We have 104 nuclear powerplants in America \ntoday. They produce about 20 percent of all electricity. Not a single \nAmerican in the 40 years we have been producing electric power has died \nas a result of a nuclear accident--not one. It has continued to be more \nand more efficient. In fact, right now the cost is as low as any source \nof energy we have.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, we are getting to a point now where the lines \nbetween electricity and automobile transportation are being blurred. \nEnergy is energy. We will be able to transform electricity into a power \nsource to turn the wheels of our vehicles and that will be a tremendous \nadvance. If that electricity is produced at a very cost-effective rate \nby nuclear power that emits not one bit of CO2 into the \natmosphere, that emits no pollutants into the atmosphere--you only have \nthis small amount of nuclear waste that I believe should be \nreprocessed.\n  Senator Domenici and I have offered legislation to do that, but the \namount of waste that is now being produced is still very small in size. \nEvery bit of it in the United States can be placed on one football \nfield and not too many feet deep. It is not a problem that can't be \nsolved, and it doesn't blow up. You have to reprocess it or put it away \nfrom people so it doesn't damage anyone or the environment.\n  I think we are heading in the right direction. I believe our Nation \nis getting its feet on the ground. I think the American people know--\nthey know, they are not going to be fooled; they have no \nmisconceptions--the way to contain the growth in the price of energy is \nto reduce our demand by conservation and increase our supply, and it \nwill help our economy dramatically if the increase in supply is \nAmerican energy, not imported energy. Those ought to be our goals. We \ncan do that. We can reduce CO2. We can use more biofuels. We \ncan use more clean nuclear power. As a result, this economy can \ncontinue to function and be the envy of the world.\n  I note it should never, ever be a policy of our country to drive up \nthe price of energy. Low-cost energy is a wonderful event for the \nworld. It is one of the great things about this Nation. We have had \nrelatively low-cost energy for many years. I was flabbergasted when one \nof the Presidential candidates, Senator Obama, said he wasn't worried \nso much that the price was going up, it just went up faster than people \nliked. That is not what I think is good policy. Our policy should be to \ntake the steps now. Even if they take 5, 10, or 20 years to come to a \nreality, that will help ensure this surge in price does not continue; \nthat we can maintain our American independence so we are not held \nhostage by foreign powers, this unprecedented transfer of wealth will \nend, and we can fight pollution and continue to clean up our \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, America faces a great many challenges \ntoday, particularly with regard to our economy, but none greater than \nour dangerous dependence upon foreign oil.\n  I have come to the floor several times in the past few months to talk \nabout what I call the ``terrorism tax.'' The terrorism tax is the \ntransfer of wealth outside of this country to import billions of \nbarrels of foreign oil. A substantial portion of American dollars spent \non foreign oil goes to countries that wish to do us harm.\n  This year, with regard to oil prices, the terrorism tax will total \n$700 billion. That $700 billion could have been used to pay for health \ncare, groceries, or alternative forms of domestic energy. That $700 \nbillion terrorism tax is more than the annual budget of the Department \nof Defense and is four times the annual cost of the war in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S6921]]\n\n  The record high price of gas has been hurting American families and \nbenefitting foreign adversaries for way too long. It is now the No. 1 \nissue on consumers' minds, and the Senate has been debating this issue \nfor months. However, the Senate has failed to act on reasonable \nprovisions to address historically high energy prices.\n  Variable and oftentimes unpredictable forces impact cyclical gas \nprices. However, over the long run, increasing supply while decreasing \ndemand will moderate, if not lower, gas prices for American consumers. \nThe very simple equation is to produce more and to use less.\n  A comprehensive national energy policy that is focused on finding \nmore energy while using less will put us on the path toward affordable \nand reliable energy.\n  Recently, the President made a historic announcement that he ended \nthe Executive moratorium on Outer Continental Shelf energy exploration. \nCongress cannot wait another day to follow suit by lifting the \ncongressional moratorium as well. This outdated moratorium is blocking \naccess to offer 18 billion gallons of proven reserves in the Outer \nContinental Shelf. In addition to the proven reserves, an estimated 86 \nbillion gallons of undiscovered reserves exist off of our shores, 85 \npercent of which is still off limits. Congress should give coastal \nStates the right to explore for oil and natural gas more than 50 miles \noff their shores.\n  Another promising area for domestic production is the development of \noil and natural gas in section 10-02 of the Alaska Wilderness Wildlife \nRefuge. Congress authorized production in this remote area of Alaska's \nNorth Slope over 12 years ago. If it hadn't been vetoed by the Clinton \nadministration, the United States would have an additional 1 million \nbarrels of domestic production each and every day. One of the \nobjections that gets raised by those who oppose exploration on the \nNorth Slope of Alaska is something that has been used for a long time: \nIt would take 5 or 10 years to bring that energy on line. That is an \nold and tired argument. Evidence of that is when it becomes the \npunchline on the Jay Leno show. Jay Leno himself, in a monolog, has \nmade that very same observation--that the argument being used today by \nour political leaders to avoid having to deal with this issue of \ndeveloping some of our domestic resources is that it would take 5 or 10 \nyears to develop. That is the very same argument that was made by \npolitical leaders over a decade ago.\n  It is important that we get past that argument, that we deal with the \nissue of our dangerous dependence upon foreign countries for our energy \nsupply, and that we do so by developing the resources we have here at \nhome, including the 6 to 16 billion barrels we know exist on the North \nSlope of Alaska.\n  In addition to the traditional sources of oil and gas, unconventional \nsources of oil are an important solution to our energy crisis as well. \nCoal to liquids and oil shale in Western States and oil sands in Canada \nare abundant supplies of fuel and should be fully developed to meet our \ngrowing energy needs. Unfortunately, Congress is once again standing in \nthe way of domestic energy production.\n  The United States has an estimated 2 trillion barrels of oil shale in \nWestern States--more than three times the reserves of Saudi Arabia. \nUnbelievably, politicians here in Washington are keeping this resource \noff limits.\n  As we continue to debate this issue, American energy companies stand \nready to invest billions of dollars to make oil shale production \neconomical and environmentally sound. This investment remains stifled \nsince Congress is prohibiting the rules for such production from moving \nforward.\n  In addition to oil and natural gas, the Federal Government needs to \nstand by its commitment to renewable energy.\n  According to Merrill Lynch:\n\n       Biofuels are making up a huge portion of oil supply growth.\n       Biofuels are now the single largest contributor to world \n     oil supply growth.\n\n  As biofuel production increases, our infrastructure to transport and \nuse this fuel must increase as well. Congress has to break the monopoly \nof oil on the U.S. economy by investing in renewable fuel dedicated \npipelines, biofuel refueling stations, and by requiring the production \nof flex fuel vehicles. Approximately 7 million flex fuel vehicles are \non the road today. This is significant progress from a few years ago, \nand American automakers deserve to be applauded for their dedication to \nbiofuels. However, millions of vehicles are still being produced and \npurchased without the flex fuel option.\n  That means the vast majority of Americans have no choice but to pull \nup to the pump and fill up on traditional gasoline at whatever price \nthe oil company wishes to charge. In this sense, there is virtually no \ncompetition in our transportation fuel marketplace.\n  Congress should also continue to promote the use of hybrid vehicles \nand create incentives for plug-in electric hybrids, which will lessen \nthe use of gasoline and diesel fuel.\n  Finally, we should enact moderate reforms and reasonable reforms to \nlimit excessive speculation. Noncommercial investors are playing a \nhistorically high role in all commodities, including oil futures. Many \nanalysts say this is adding a premium to the price of oil, which does \nnot reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand. Congress needs to \ntake commonsense steps to limit excessive speculation, without \noverreacting. Any overreaction will simply move trading overseas to \nmarkets with less transparency and oversight.\n\n  It is important to note that regulation alone is not going to bring \ndown the price of gas. We need a comprehensive plan that includes all \npromising solutions to our energy crisis.\n  I want to make one observation, as well, regarding this issue of \nspeculation, because I know a bill has been filed, and cloture was \nfiled on a motion to proceed to legislation that would be a speculation \nresponse, or answer, to the energy crisis in this country. Frankly, I \nmay vote for it. I haven't seen all of the details of it. I understand \nfrom people who are close to it that a lot of it is good--about 80 \npercent, and 20 percent might be things I won't like. I might be \nwilling to vote for something like that, but it cannot be that alone. \nThat is a minimalist solution and we don't have a minimalist problem. \nThis is a problem that demands a major and comprehensive solution and \nattention from the Congress that includes not only addressing that \nissue--the narrow issue of speculation--but also the important issue of \ndomestic production, increasing our supply, increasing the production \nof energy in this country, and also looking at ways to reduce our \ndemand.\n  With regard to the issue of speculation, I want to read from an op ed \nin the Wall Street Journal by Martin Feldstein, back on July 1. This is \nwhat it says:\n\n       Now here is the good news. Any policy that causes the \n     unexpected future oil price to fall can cause the current \n     price to fall, or to rise less than it would otherwise do. In \n     other words, it is possible to bring down today's price of \n     oil with policies that will have their physical impact on oil \n     demands or supply only in the future. For example, increases \n     in government subsidies to develop technology that will make \n     future cars more efficient, or tighter standards that \n     gradually improve the gas mileage of the stock of cars would \n     lower the future demand for oil and therefore the price of \n     oil today.\n       Similarly, increasing the expected future supply of oil \n     would also reduce today's price. That fall in the current \n     price would induce an immediate rise in oil consumption that \n     would be matched by an increase in supply from the OPEC \n     producers and others with some current excess capacity or \n     available inventories. Any steps that can be taken now to \n     increase the future supply of oil, or reduce the future \n     demands for oil in the U.S., or elsewhere, can therefore lead \n     both to lower prices and increased consumption today.\n\n  The best thing we can be doing for American consumers is not a narrow \nminimalist response to the narrow issue of speculation but one that \naddresses the fundamental issue of supply and demand, because that \ndrives marketplace prices. I believe if the world market believes we in \nthe Congress are serious about addressing that issue--the fundamental \nissue of supply and demand--it will be reflected in those future \nprices. That isn't to say we should not have a solution that addresses \nthe issue of speculation as well.\n  I am for a number of ideas being proposed. I think we need to have \nmore cops on the beat. We need to authorize increased funding and staff \nfor the CFTC, and I think we need to require the CFTC to gather \ninformation on index traders and swap dealers, to codify position \nlimits and transparency for foreign boards of trade. Those are reforms \nthat I think are important to address in any comprehensive energy bill.\n\n[[Page S6922]]\n\nBut you cannot address the narrow issue of speculation and expect to \nimpact, in the long term, the dangerous dependence we have on foreign \nsources of energy. We could address the issue of speculation, but what \ndoes that do to affect the basic fact that every single day we get 60 \npercent of our oil from outside the United States? We use 20 million \nbarrels a day in the United States, or about 24 percent of the world \ndemand, and about 12 million barrels of that, or 60 percent, comes from \noutside of the United States. That is not a sustainable place to be for \na country that is worried about the impact high gas prices are having \non its economy, and the impact it could have on our economy in the \nfuture if we don't address that dependence upon foreign energy.\n  We have to have production, and I think the American people get this. \nI think the American people are interested in this issue of \nspeculation. I think they believe there is a role that plays in the \nprice of oil and the price of a gallon of gasoline. I also think they \nunderstand we cannot solve the problem we have in this country absent \naddressing the issue of domestic production.\n  Increasing our domestic supply, reducing domestic demand--that is how \nwe go about solving, in the long term, an issue or addressing a problem \nI think will affect the economy for years to come and make future \ngenerations of Americans continue to be held over a barrel by countries \naround the world that are hostile to the United States.\n  We cannot address the issue of energy by this bill alone. As I said, \nI am open to supporting and voting for the bill that is going to be \nintroduced that addresses speculation, but that cannot be it. If that \nis all we do, we have done very little to address the long-term problem \nwe have, and that problem is that we get 60 percent of our energy from \noutside the United States. You cannot say no to domestic production. \nYou cannot say no to offshore production. You cannot say no to oil \nshale. You cannot say no to coal to liquids. You cannot say no to \nnuclear or to new refineries. You cannot say no to all those things \nthat would help increase our domestic supply and affect that \ncalculation, that basic equation of supply and demand, which is \nabsolutely disastrous for the economy of this country.\n  I have traveled my State, as most Members of Congress do, on a \nregular basis. I had a number of meetings over the Fourth of July break \nwhere I met with people who are impacted by energy. I met this morning \nwith corn growers who are in town, and also with agriculture and the \ntourism industry--all of those types of small business interests, \npeople who are impacted, and families who are impacted by the high cost \nof gasoline. In my view, there is probably no bigger issue in the short \nterm, and no bigger issue in the long term, that impacts the American \neconomy and that could do more harm to that economy than this issue of \nhigh gas prices and the dangerous dependence we have on foreign sources \nof energy. We cannot solve it by saying no. We have to say yes to \nadditional domestic production, yes to conservation measures that will \nuse less energy, yes to renewables and biofuels, and yes to addressing \nthis issue of speculation.\n  We need a comprehensive approach, not a rifle shot that deals with \none aspect of it but doesn't solve the fundamental problem we have, and \nthat is the fact that in every single State we pay a terrorism tax to \ncountries outside the United States.\n  There is $700 billion of wealth this year that we will shift outside \nof the United States and pay to other countries around the world--in \nmany ways, petro-dictators--a ``terrorism tax,'' because we have to get \nenergy from them. They set the price and we pay it.\n  Until we change that fundamental calculation and dynamic, we are \ngoing to continue to see high gas prices and high oil prices. And that \nis not something this economy can withstand. It is certainly not fair \nto the American people for us to sit by and not take serious, \nmeaningful action.\n  When the markets recognize we are serious, I believe we will see \nrelief for the American people on the price of a gallon of gasoline and \nthe price for a barrel of oil. That is why we need a comprehensive \nsolution.\n  When this debate gets joined in the next week and following week, I \nam going to do everything I can to see that it is not addressing just \none narrow issue but addresses this issue of production, addresses the \nissue of demand. That is the only way, in my view, that we will solve \nthis problem.\n  I look forward to that debate. I hope we have opportunities to offer \namendments. I hope it is not going to be one of those deals where the \ntree gets filled and we do not have a chance to vote on meaningful \nsolutions to our energy crisis. The Senate needs to be heard. All of us \nneed to have an opportunity to offer amendments and have them voted on, \nand I hope the process will allow for that.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have also come to the floor to speak \nabout the direction I believe our country needs to move to lower gas \nprices and decrease our dangerous dependency on oil from places in this \nworld that do not share our values and are not friendly, safe places to \noperate.\n  I wish to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague, the good \nSenator from South Dakota. I have been very pleased to work with him in \na group of five Democrats and five Republicans. We hope to expand our \ngroup as there is more interest in trying to find a centrist approach, \na commonsense center core that can move us away from saying no to \nsaying yes in a smart way, yes to more production--not everywhere but \nin certain places where we believe there are reserves of oil and gas \nthat our country most certainly needs, in a safe environmental way that \ncan protect our coasts.\n  I know that issue is very sensitive to you, Mr. President. You have \nspoken eloquently about that on the floor, and you have made some \nexcellent points, as other Senators. I know the Senator from New Jersey \nwas here earlier today, and there have been Senators from different \ncoastal communities.\n  I am not insensitive to the needs of coastal communities. I represent \none myself. We might not have the beaches that Florida, Alabama, \nMississippi, and New Jersey have, but we do have very special coastal \nareas that we also want to keep clean and pristine because of our \nfishing, because of our boating, and because of our other recreational \nsports that involve more than just sitting or playing on a beach. We do \na lot of water activity, and we need that water to be clean and \npristine. So we are not unaware of those challenges.\n  My colleague who just spoke is absolutely correct. Not only he but \nothers have talked about the importance of saying yes, and this morning \nin a bipartisan energy summit conducted by the Democratic chairman, \nChairman Bingaman, and the ranking member, Ranking Member Domenici, \nDaniel Yergin, who is the chairman of the Cambridge Energy Research \nAssociation, had a great deal of wisdom to share with us. I think, Mr. \nPresident, you were at that hearing. There were many good, insightful \ncomments made. Statements were made this morning that could help guide \nus to a more secure approach.\n  One that stuck with me--I am going to paraphrase it because I don't \nhave his quote. He said something along the lines of it has taken us 20 \nyears to get into this tight oil market, and it is going to take us \nsome time to get out, but there is a way out. He said it is imperative \nthat we increase our supply of oil in the world, and particularly for \nthe United States since we are consuming so much of it, and there are \nmany places that production can be found and improved.\n  He went on to say: We have made some real progress in conservation, \nbut, of course, we have to do more.\n  Again, we have been saying no for 20 years--no to this refinery, no \nto producing here, lawsuit after lawsuit, actions that shut down \nproduction. We must begin to say yes. Twenty years of saying no, and I \nam not leaving this, of course, at the doorstep of only Democrats, \nwhich is what some of our friends on the other side want, to blame just \nthe Democrats. The Republicans have been in charge of this Congress for \nthe majority of those years. Now they are claiming they were the ones \nsaying yes all along. No, it was their Congresses that were saying no.\n  But this is not about blaming Democrats or Republicans. This is about\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\nstarting all of us to say, yes, we can; yes, we can get prices down; \nyes, we can make America more energy independent.\n  I would like to correct something I said the other day that is not \ntrue, and I am very sorry because I was not clear, but I am clear now.\n  I came to the Senate floor with this chart and said that all of these \nlight blue places represented moratoria areas. While it is true for the \nlower 48, all of this entire west coast is off production, the eastern \nGulf of Mexico under Alabama and next to Florida is off production, for \nthe most part, with very few exceptions, with wells here. All of this \narea on the east coast is off limits to production.\n  I also said Alaska was off limits to production, and that is not \ntrue. This was changed very recently, and Alaska has now opened up, not \nANWR, which is this little tiny point which is so hard to see on this \nmap, but the rest of Alaska has opened up. I am going to show another \nchart that describes it a bit better.\n  This is a more accurate chart, and it is up to date. Again, I \napologize, but that was an old chart. This is all off limits. \nEverything on the west coast is off limits and has been for decades. \nAll of this area on the east coast, except for this blue diamond, is \noff limits by executive and congressional moratoria. The President has \nlifted his moratoria. He has lifted the executive moratoria, but the \ncongressional moratoria still remain.\n  The place that has been the most open--and we are very proud of this \nin Louisiana and Texas--is the gulf. This is the western gulf, this is \nthe central gulf, and this is the eastern gulf. The reason the eastern \ngulf is a different color than the rest of the chart is because this \nmoratoria was extended actually under an agreement that was made on the \nSenate floor--and I was part of that action--to extend this moratoria \nlonger than the moratoria on the east and west coasts.\n  The west and east coast moratoria are year-to-year moratoria. They \nare done in the Interior bill, and they have been routinely passed year \nto year. The eastern gulf moratoria is in law, and it extends until \n2022.\n  Alaska is now basically opened, these blue sections. It is going to \nbe very hard for people to realize this because it is really shocking \nto me, and I look at this all the time, but this dot approximately \nright here, this little dot right here is ANWR. This dot is what we \nfight over really, let me say--we fight over this little dot. Here is a \nwhole State with lots of opportunities, and yet every discussion for \nthe last 20 years has been about this little dot.\n  I know that little dot has a lot of oil and gas in it, and I voted to \nopen it. But I am to the point now where we have to stop talking about \nANWR and start thinking about other places in and around ANWR--with the \nhelp of our Senators from Alaska, who are very knowledgeable and \nvery good on this issue, Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Lisa \nMurkowski--where we can get oil and gas in places that are not so \nremote where the infrastructure exists to move this gas from Alaska, \nwhich sits up north, to the lower 48, either by pipeline or by tanker \nto get oil safely to us.\n\n  There are benefits to drilling in Alaska. There are not many people \nthere to aggravate. There are only 500,000, and people in Alaska, like \npeople in Louisiana, want to have oil and gas drilling. They believe in \nusing their natural resources, whether it is oil and gas or trees. We \nbelieve in actually cutting a lot of our trees because they grow back. \nWe don't believe in cutting old, primitive forests and special places, \nbut we actually believe that cutting trees and growing them back helps \nprovide the good products we need, and we know how to manage our \nforests.\n  Alaska is a lot like Louisiana. We could find oil and gas here. And \nthere is a lot of it. The problem is the transportation and the \ninfrastructure, and there are some risks associated with moving oil \nthrough tankers. There is always a risk associated with long pipelines. \nWe have that same infrastructure in the gulf where we have pipelines \ncoming up from Louisiana.\n  I would like to show what some of this infrastructure actually looks \nlike so people get an understanding when we talk about opening areas to \ndrill. This is the kind of infrastructure that it takes to actually get \nit done.\n  This is a picture of the Gulf of Mexico. This is the tip of Louisiana \nand the coast of Texas and Mississippi. This is Mobile Bay, and this is \nthe Florida panhandle, and it goes down. This pipeline, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, is a pipeline that is laid under the gulf to \nmove gas to Florida from Mobile Bay because the eastern gulf is closed \nright now to production. But yet Florida has great need for gas, and \nthe good people of Alabama send it to the people of Florida. There was \na lot of controversy about this pipeline. There were people in Alabama, \neven Members of Congress, who said: Why send the gas to Florida? Let \nthem drill their own gas. That is not part of this debate today, but it \nis a good question. There are answers to it. It is an interesting \ndiscussion.\n  These are pipelines, every one end is a rig or at least a well. These \nplatforms are large. They are very deep. They are almost like \nskyscrapers out in the gulf. You cannot see them from the shore. This \nis invisible to the naked eye. You don't really see this. If you are in \na boat, plane, or swimming, it is all subsea.\n  This is a picture of the network of pipelines required to move \nmillions of barrels of oil from the ocean to people. If you took a \nsnapshot onshore of where there is production in Wyoming or Utah or \nColorado or New Mexico, you would see much the same thing--a maze of \npipelines and wells--because it takes more than waving a magic wand for \nthe oil to jump out of the ground and into people's tanks. There are a \nlot of steps that have to go into it.\n  So part of opening the OCS and opening more onshore is you want to \nopen it in places that it is likely for the industry to reach and to \nhave people--because even though robots are doing a lot of this work, \nwe need people to show up on the rigs to build the platforms. That is \nwhy I fought so hard for money to come from these activities. When \npeople tell me and some of my colleagues say, But, Senator, this \nresource belongs to the United States of America; why should Louisiana \nshare any of these resources, I say, because Louisiana is the platform \nfor oil and gas production, just like Texas. And with all due respect \nto the United States of America, the United States could not access \nthese resources if we did not allow these resources to be accessed and \nthen brought through our shores for distribution.\n\n  There is the distribution pipeline. It doesn't just affect Louisiana, \nit affects the entire country. I am going to show you the gas \ndistribution system. This is not an oil distribution system, this is \ngas. All of the manufacturers in the Midwest and on the east coast need \nnatural gas. There are very few places they can get it. They get it \nbasically from the Gulf of Mexico. This is the trunk, in real terms, of \nhow much gas there is. It says 6.4 billion cubic feet from the Gulf of \nMexico production. The other big trunk comes from Alaska, and there is \npotential gas in Canada. This comes from Alaska. Basically, that is it. \nThis is where the gas comes from.\n  So when prices of natural gas are high, it is because there is only a \nlimited source in America, and we are not opening gas reserves where \nthere might be more here, there might be some more here, and obviously \nthere are more in Alaska. So that is just an example. But as you can \nsee, the production in the Gulf of Mexico doesn't just benefit the \npeople in Louisiana and Mississippi. Without it, you couldn't keep \nlights on in this Chamber or in New York or Chicago and other places \nthat are very important.\n  I wanted to clarify that most of the OCS is off limits. Most of the \nOCS is off limits, and while you see lots of posters and pictures, and \neverybody is trying to move the numbers to justify their position, the \nfact is that in the lower 48--not counting Alaska, Alaska is not on \nhere--less than 19 percent of the OCS is open to development, less than \n19 percent. All of this is off limits, this is off limits, and this is \noff limits. The only area we can drill is here.\n  I would like to read this number here: It is 33 billion barrels of \noil here on this side of the gulf. When people say there is no more oil \nin America, it is because we are not looking for it. There is plenty of \noil onshore and offshore, not counting the oil we could actually get \nfrom coal--coal-to-liquids technology, clean--and not counting\n\n[[Page S6924]]\n\nthe oil we could potentially get from shale, which is boiling the rock \ninto a liquid and producing the oil, which could be billions of \nbarrels.\n  I agree with Senator Salazar that the technology is not quite there \nyet, and maybe it is going to be too much of a drain on the water \nsupply in the West. Perhaps it might be a very serious environmental \nproblem. But we don't know. I think we should find out. That is my \npoint. We don't know, but we need to find out because one day we may \nneed to boil that rock, and if we need to, we need to figure out how to \ndo it.\n  There is plenty of oil here. But when people say ``the science,'' \ntrust me, if there is a scientist in America who wants to come anywhere \naround Washington to say there is no oil because they have explored it, \nI will debate them until my last breath, because we have not looked. \nThere has been some seismic--not a lot of seismic--and the technology \nis so improved now that we can be much more certain of where oil and \ngas is. Just to say there are 33 billion barrels of oil here and then \nto jump to the conclusion that there is no oil here, that there has to \nbe no oil here and no oil here, is really defying common sense.\n  I will end with this, Mr. President. Do we need to do more than \nproduce? Yes, we do. Just increasing production is not the answer, but \nit is a step that must be taken. We are too great a nation to, every \ntime prices hit $5, send a little piddling letter over to countries \nsuch as Saudi Arabia begging and pleading, as if we are some second-\nrate power, asking them to increase their oil production when we won't \nincrease it at home. It is not right. We must increase our production, \nand we can do it safely.\n  I know there are others who wish to speak, so I will wrap up in just \na moment.\n  We need to also--and this is where my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle have not been very good in their own right. They have not \nbeen for mandates pushing conservation, and we must start driving a \ndifferent kind of automobile, and not just expanding mileage from 20 \nmiles per gallon to 27 miles, but CAFE standards reflecting \nefficiencies from 25 miles per gallon to 27 or 35.\n  We need to move to a different kind of automobile because it is the \nfuel demand, it is the gap between the 20 million barrels we use every \nday and the 8 million we produce. There is a 12 million-barrel-a-day \ngap. If we could close 6 million of that by more production \ndomestically and close the other 6 million by conservation, America \nwould have no more problem, the price would come down, and we would be \nfree and happy--a powerful, free people again. And we have to get that \nway.\n  We once dominated in this industry. That is how we won World War II. \nWe would not have won without our domination in the energy industry. We \nhave to dominate again, and we can do it through conservation and \nproduction.\n  I hope our leaders, both the Democratic leader and the Republican \nleader, understand that there is a group of us who don't want to go \nhome until this is done and that we are going to do everything we can \nbecause I don't believe we should be drifting out of this Capitol \nanytime soon until we have given a clear and unmistakable signal to the \nAmerican public that we hear them and that we understand the economic \nstrain.\n  Our economic model was not built for $5 gasoline, and we cannot \nsustain it. That is what we were told, and not by the Republican policy \npeople or the Democratic policy people but by two of the brightest \nminds on this subject. They said the U.S. model cannot sustain this \nhigh price for long. It will cause and has caused serious economic \ndisruption. It must be corrected.\n  So I hope, Mr. President, that we most certainly do this. I am open \nto things that perhaps I wouldn't have considered in the past, and I \nhope my colleagues will have that same open mind. If so, we can perhaps \nget some extraordinary things done.\n  Either tomorrow or next week, I am going to come back and talk about \nthe myth of oil spills because the signs I see on this floor about oil \nspilling in the gulf--I want to continue to remind people that less \nthan 1 percent of the oil in the ocean is caused from drilling in the \nocean. The majority of it is natural seepage, and I am going to have \nsome information that will show that. The people of Louisiana, Texas, \nand Mississippi are very proud of this industry that we have helped to \nbirth not just for our country but for the world, and we are determined \nto help people understand that it can be done in a clean and \nenvironmentally sensitive manner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6924-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6924-S6927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I understand that there are a lot of \ndifferences in this body on the issue of speculation, which presumably \nis going to come up next week, on the issue of the role of the large \noil companies and the enormous profits they are making, and there are \ndifferences of opinion about how fast and how aggressively we should go \nto sustainable energy and energy efficiency. But in one area, it \nappears to me there is less and less of a difference of opinion, and \nthat is that more and more Members of the Senate understand that we are \nfacing--right now, this summer, and in this coming winter--an energy \ncrisis in terms of people going cold and perhaps freezing or dying from \nheat exhaustion this summer.\n  I am very proud to say that we have had tripartisan support for a \nvery substantial increase in the LIHEAP legislation bill I have \noffered; that is, S. 3186, the Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer Act. \nThat bill now has 47 cosponsors--34 Democrats, 11 Republicans, and 2 \nindependents. At a time when more and more Americans are concerned \nabout the partisanship here in Congress, I am happy to say that this \nbill has very strong tripartisan support.\n  I wish to thank the 34 Democrats who are cosponsors, including \nSenator Obama, Majority Leader Reid, and Senators Durbin, Murray, \nLandrieu, Leahy, Clinton, Cantwell, Jack Reed, Kerry, Kennedy, Schumer, \nLevin, Cardin, Brown, Klobuchar, Menendez, Casey, Bingaman, Lautenberg, \nStabenow, Bill Nelson, Baucus, Salazar, Wyden, Whitehouse, Rockefeller, \nDodd, Tester, Mikulski, Biden, Kohl, Dorgan, and McCaskill. I thank all \nthose Democrats for their support, and the 11 Republican cosponsors we \nhave, including Senators Snowe, Stevens, Coleman, Smith, Sununu, \nCollins, Murkowski, Gregg, Lugar, Bond, and Dole. I also thank the \nIndependent, Senator Lieberman, for joining me as a cosponsor. Both \nIndependents are on that bill.\n  Let me also thank Majority Leader Reid for completing the rule XIV \nprocess and putting this bill directly on the calendar. Senator Reid \nunderstands, as I think most of us do, that this bill has very strong \nsupport. For the health and well-being of many millions of people, \nwhether in the Northeast or in the South, it is absolutely imperative \nthat we pass this legislation as soon as possible.\n  In that regard, I want to express disappointment that just this \nmorning, my Republican friend, Senator Cornyn, objected to a UC for \npassage of this bill and then objected to putting this bill on the \nfloor and even giving us the opportunity to vote on it today. I hope my \nRepublican friends and the Republican leadership reconsider this action \nbecause the truth is, there is a lot of support on the Republican side \nfor increasing LIHEAP. I think it is imperative that we work together \nand we work as quickly as possible and we take a very strong load of \nanxiety off the shoulders of people from all over this country by \npassing this bill and getting a similar bill passed in the House.\n  This tripartisan bill would nearly double the funding for LIHEAP in \nfiscal year 2008, taking it from $2.57 billion to $5.1 billion. That is \na total increase of over $2.5 billion. This, in fact, is the amount at \nwhich LIHEAP is authorized. We should make no mistake about it, the \nissue we are dealing with is a life-and-death issue. It is life and \ndeath today, and it will be life and death next winter.\n  I would like to report a statistic that is not widely known. When CNN \ngets its cameras out, they go to the tornadoes and the floods and the \nforest fires, and that is appropriate. Those are terrible tragedies we \nare all concerned\n\n[[Page S6925]]\n\nabout. The truth is that more people in this country have died from the \nextreme heat and hypothermia since 1998 than all natural disasters \ncombined. That is an interesting point, and you probably didn't know \nthat. I didn't know that. But that is the case. And that includes \nfloods, fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes.\n  The ``problem'' is what happens when maybe an old person in Florida \ncan't afford electricity and has her air-conditioning turned off. She \nwill die. Or a person with an illness in the State of Vermont, when the \nweather gets 20 below zero and he doesn't have the money to heat his \nhome, he will die as well. And people die one at a time, not in great \nCNN-type disasters, but the reality is that more people die from \nextreme heat and extreme cold than they do from other types of \nemergencies. In Vermont and throughout New England, people are \nextremely worried that they will not have enough money to afford the \nprice of heating oil next winter. A newspaper in my State of Vermont, \nthe Stowe Reporter, recently editorialized that the lack of affordable \nheating oil could turn into New England's version of Hurricane Katrina \nnext winter. We cannot allow that to happen.\n\n  The problem is not just in the Northeast. The point I have to \nreiterate over and over, this is not just a cold weather problem for my \nState of Vermont and New England. This is a hot weather problem as \nwell. It is not just a cold weather issue, it is a hot weather issue as \nwell.\n  Over the past decade, more than 400 people died of heat exposure in \nArizona. Let me repeat that. Over the past decade, more than 400 people \ndied of heat exposure in Arizona, including 31 in July of 2005 alone, \n31 people in 2005 in Arizona. All of these deaths could have been \nprevented if these people had air-conditioning.\n  Without increased support from the Federal Government, Arizona will \nbe out of LIHEAP funding before the end of this month. But if this bill \npasses, Arizona will see an infusion of $24 million in LIHEAP funding, \ntriple what they currently receive.\n  Let me quote a letter I received from the mayor of Phoenix, AZ. His \nname is Phil Gordon. I thank Mayor Gordon for sending me this letter. \nHe is strongly supportive of this legislation. This is what the mayor \nof Phoenix, AZ, Phil Gordon, writes:\n       I am writing to express my support for the Warm in Winter \n     and Cool in Summer Act. Currently Arizona can only provide \n     assistance to 6 percent of eligible LIHEAP households. . . . \n     To make matters worse, Phoenix continues to experience \n     extreme heat. In the past month alone, we have had 15 days \n     with temperatures at or above 110 degrees. This extreme heat \n     is especially hard on the very young, the elderly and \n     disabled who are on fixed incomes and can no longer afford to \n     cool their homes. . . . Arizona Public Service reported that \n     there was a 36 percent increase in the number of households \n     having difficulty in paying utility bills and an increase of \n     11,000 families being disconnected compared to a year ago. \n     Rising energy and housing costs are placing enormous strains \n     on low-income households across Arizona.\n\n  What Mayor Gordon of Phoenix is talking about is taking place all \nover this country. We are in the middle of a recession. People are \nlosing their work. Wages are going down. The price of fuel in general \nis going up. That includes electricity. If you are dependent on \nelectricity for air-conditioning, and your electricity gets shut off \nand you are old and you are sick, you have a serious problem. That is \nwhat this legislation is going to address.\n  In my State of Vermont and throughout New England and the Northeast, \npeople are extremely worried that they will not have enough money to \nafford the price of heating oil next winter.\n  A newspaper in my State of Vermont, the Stowe Reporter, recently \neditorialized that the lack of affordable heating oil could turn into \nNew England's version of Hurricane Katrina next winter. We cannot allow \nthat to happen.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, over 1,000 Americans \nfrom across the country died from hypothermia in their own homes from \n1999 to 2002, the latest figures we have available. In other words, \nthey froze to death because they could not afford to heat their homes. \nHow many of these deaths were preventable? All of them, according to \nthe CDC. We will probably not know for several years how many Americans \ndied last winter because they could not afford to heat their homes--but \none death is too many.\n  And, I want all of my colleagues to understand. This home energy \ncrisis that we are in extends far beyond New England and the Northeast. \nToday, people in the South and Southwest are struggling to pay for the \nskyrocketing price of electricity, which has tripled in some parts of \nthe country.\n  The result is that essential utility services are being cut-off \nbecause they cannot afford to pay their bills. What that means is that \nelderly, frail and sick people trying to stay alive in 110 degree \ntemperatures face a major health crisis if their electricity is shut \noff.\n  In other words, whether you are living in the north or the south or \nthe east or the west, our country is facing a national emergency and it \nis about time that the President of the United States and the Congress \ntreated it as such.\n  And, while energy prices are soaring, LIHEAP funding is 23 percent \nless than it was just 2 years ago, completely eviscerating the \npurchasing power of this extremely important program. In fact, after \nadjusting for inflation, the Federal Government spent more money on \nLIHEAP 20 years ago than it is spending today.\n  To demonstrate how important LIHEAP is right now for southern States \ndealing with a major heat wave, I want to give you just a few examples \nof what I am referring to.\n  Over the past decade, more than 400 people died of heat exposure in \nArizona, including 31 in July of 2005 alone. All of these deaths could \nhave been prevented if these people had air conditioning. Without \nincreased support from the Federal Government, Arizona will be out of \nLIHEAP funding before the end of this month. But, if this bill passes, \nArizona will receive an infusion of over $24 million in LIHEAP \nfunding--triple what they currently receive--to keep their residents \ncool this summer.\n  Due to a lack of LIHEAP funding, the State of Texas only provides air \nconditioning assistance to about 4 percent of those who qualify. \nRecently, I received a letter from Shawnee Bayer from the Community \nAction Committee in Victoria, TX. In her letter, Ms. Bayer writes:\n\n       The temperatures in our area have been 100 to 110 degrees \n     for 16 consecutive days. I fear it is going to be very tragic \n     at the current pace we are going with so little LIHEAP \n     funding available. . . . There are so many who need our \n     assistance, like the elderly lady in her 80s who recently \n     almost died due to kidney failure; now she doesn't want to \n     use her air conditioner because she is afraid she won't be \n     able to pay the bill. . . . She just called me last \n     Thursday and has pneumonia; she could hardly talk. . . . \n     Last year she was placed in the hospital in the ICU due to \n     a heat stroke as a result of using only a fan, not the air \n     conditioner. I see children every day who have not eaten \n     because the parents, grandparents and in some cases great \n     grandparents are just trying to keep the electricity on . \n     . . . the electric bills in our area have tripled.\n\n  That is in Victoria, TX. In addition, I also received an e-mail from \nDeAndra Baker from the Community Action Agency in Giddings, TX, who \nsaid:\n\n       We have a gentleman who is 78 years old and on a fixed \n     income of $770.00 a month. . . . Due to the extremely high \n     temperatures he is unable to afford to keep his home cool. \n     His doctor provided a statement that he must have his air \n     conditioner turned on at a minimum of 80 degrees to avoid \n     congestive heart failure and he is not even able to afford \n     that much. Sadly, he will not continue to run his A/C or fans \n     and will be at serious risk unless LIHEAP funding is \n     increased soon.\n\n  That is what is going on in the State of Texas. If this bill is \nsigned into law, Texas will receive over $47 million to help keep their \nresidents cool this summer. But it is not just Texas.\n  Without additional support from the Federal Government, the State of \nGeorgia will not be able to offer any LIHEAP assistance whatsoever to \nits residents this summer. Currently, Georgia has a waiting list of \n28,000 people hoping to receive some relief from the hot weather this \nsummer. To demonstrate the desperate need for more LIHEAP funding, let \nme tell you about an e-mail my office received from the executive \ndirector of the Community Action Agency in Gainesville, GA, Janice \nRiley. According to Ms. Riley, their agency has been out of LIHEAP \nfunding since last December. She was particularly distressed about two \nfamilies in Georgia who she could not help because of a lack of LIHEAP \nfunding. This is what she had to say:\n\n       One family that came in after we ran out of LIHEAP funds \n     was the Jones family. . . .\n\n[[Page S6926]]\n\n     Mr. Jones, came to our office requesting assistance with his \n     electric bill. He has a wife and five children. . . . They \n     got behind with all their bills when he was injured on the \n     job six months ago. . . . Their daughter is paralyzed from \n     the neck down from a fall she had at six months of age. I \n     wish we could help them. Another participant that did not \n     receive LIHEAP funds and is now facing disconnection or \n     homelessness is Ms. O'Brien, a 33 year old, single parent \n     with 5 children between the ages of 7-16, and a newborn \n     grandchild which she has taken in. . . . Her power was turned \n     off last week because she was unable to pay it. . . . Her \n     need for assistance is based on the high costs of living, not \n     from her lack of work ethic and heroic efforts to maintain \n     her household.\n\n  That is what is going on in the State of Georgia. If this bill is \nsigned into law, the State of Georgia would receive over $70 million to \nmake sure their residents stay cool this summer.\n  In addition, unless S. 3186 is signed into law soon, the State of \nKentucky will not be able to keep any of their residents cool this \nsummer through the LIHEAP program. According to the executive director \nof the Community Action Agency in Kentucky, Kip Bowmar:\n\n       February of 2008 marked the first time in the program's \n     history that all 120 Counties in Kentucky ran out of LIHEAP \n     funds, forcing us to close our doors as fuel prices were \n     soaring and people needed help.\n\n  If S. 3186 is signed into law, the State of Kentucky will receive \nnearly $35 million to keep their residents cool this summer and warm in \nthe winter.\n  In Florida, Hilda Frazier, the State director of the LIHEAP program, \nhas estimated that they will serve 26,000 fewer households this year \nbecause of the reduction of available LIHEAP funding and the rising \ncost of energy. According to Ms. Frazier, thousands of families in \nFlorida are being turned away from LIHEAP offices each and every month \nbecause they do not have any money. Of the 2 million LIHEAP eligible \nhouseholds in Florida, they will be able to assist fewer than 4 percent \nof them.\n  The State of Arkansas is also rapidly running out of LIHEAP funding. \nThe LlHEAP coordinator in Benton, AR, recently had to deny assistance \nto over 430 families there because they had no money. If this bill is \nsigned into law, Arkansas would receive nearly $26 million to help keep \ntheir residents cool this summer.\n  Moving on to California, Joan Graham, The deputy director of the \nCommunity Action Agency in Sacramento, CA, recently wrote that:\n\n       Every day, we are turning away at least 50 families who \n     qualify for LIHEAP because we lack resources. Energy bills \n     have increased 30% over last year, yet our funding has not \n     increased. In 2006, there were 29 heat-related deaths in \n     Sacramento County. One senior who passed away due to extreme \n     heat was afraid to turn on his air conditioner because he \n     knew he would be unable to pay the electric bill. We know \n     there are more like him out there at present.\n\n  If this bill is signed into law, California will receive over $100 \nmillion to keep their residents cool this summer and warm next winter.\n  Why is LIHEAP so important in the south in the summertime?\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, the annual mortality \nrate from extreme heat in the U.S. has exceeded the death tolls of \nfloods, tornadoes, and hurricanes combined since 1998. Meanwhile, fewer \nresources have been allocated to heat-related problems than to other \nextreme weather events.\n  In other words, while more people in this country are dying from heat \nexposure than any other natural disaster in this country combined; the \nFederal Government spends less money preventing these deaths from \noccurring than any other natural disaster we face.\n  From 1999-2003, over 3,400 deaths in this country were due to \nexcessive heat. All of these deaths were preventable and air \nconditioning is the best way to prevent these deaths, according to the \nCDC.\n  How many more heat-related deaths will occur in this country if we do \nnot increase LIHEAP? We cannot wait to find out.\n  My heart goes out to the people of Iowa and other areas in the \nMidwest that have been devastated by the recent flooding. I supported \nthe additional Federal resources that were included in the supplemental \nto help them through this difficult time.\n  But, let us not forget about senior citizens who will die of heat \nexposure if we don't help them out this summer. And, let's not wait \nuntil it's too late to provide the assistance needed to keep Americans \nwarm in the north this winter.\n  In addition to these facts, tens of thousands of Americans have had \ntheir utility and natural gas services shut off this year and millions \nmore are in danger of having these services shut off because they are \nat least 1 month late in paying their bills.\n  Increasing LIHEAP funding will allow these Americans to turn their \nelectricity and other essential utility services back on right now so \nthat they can cool their homes this summer and heat their homes next \nwinter.\n  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association, a \nrecord-breaking 15.6 million American families or nearly 15 percent of \nall households, are at least 30 days overdue in paying their utility \nbills.\n  USA Today recently reported that ``Electricity and natural gas \nshutoffs are up at least 15 percent in several states compared with \nlast year. Totals for some utilities have more than doubled.''\n  The article then goes on to give the following examples:\n\n       In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities disconnected 7,054 \n     customers through April this year, up 168 percent over the \n     same 2007 period.\n       Duke Energy in North Carolina is averaging about 11,000 \n     shutoffs a month, 14 percent above last year.\n       Disconnects are up 27 percent for Peoples Gas in Chicago, \n     14 percent for Southern California Edison and 56 percent for \n     Detroit Edison. In Michigan, where home foreclosures are \n     soaring and the unemployment rate is the USA's highest, more \n     than one in five Detroit Edison customers were behind in \n     their electric bills in May.\n\n  ``Some help is available,'' USA Today goes on to report. ``The Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is providing $2.5 \nbillion in fiscal 2008, but funds are depleted.''\n  Due to insufficient funding, the average LIHEAP grant only pays for \n18 percent of the total cost of heating a home with heating oil; 21 \npercent of residential propane costs; 41 percent of natural gas costs; \nand 43 percent of electricity costs. What this means is that low income \nfamilies with children; senior citizens on fixed incomes and persons \nwith disabilities will have to make up the remaining costs out of their \nown pockets.\n  And, only 16 percent of eligible LIHEAP recipients currently receive \nassistance with their home energy bills. What that means is that 84 \npercent of eligible low-income families with children, senior citizens \non fixed incomes and persons with disabilities do not receive any \nLIHEAP assistance whatsoever due to a lack of funding.\n  Unless we significantly increase LIHEAP funding, two things will \nhappen: fewer and fewer Americans will receive the assistance to keep \ntheir homes warm in the winter and cool in the summer; or the grants \nthey receive will become smaller and smaller even as the price of \nenergy soars. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  No family in our Nation should be forced to choose between paying \ntheir home energy bills and putting food on the table. No senior \ncitizen should have to decide between buying life-saving prescriptions \nand paying utility bills. For individuals and households that may have \nto face these difficult choices, LlHEAP makes a real difference in \ntheir ability to cope with adverse circumstances.\n  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Warm in \nWinter and Cool in Summer Act.\n  There are differences, obviously, in the Senate, differences within \nthe House, on a number of very important energy issues. I understand \nthat. I appreciated the differences. I have my point of view. Other \npeople have different points of view.\n  There is far less difference of opinion--I think widespread support--\namong Republicans, Democrats, and Independents that we need to move. We \nneed to move quickly to significantly expand LIHEAP funding. By \nexpanding it, by doubling it, we are doing nothing more than keeping \npace with inflation because the price of home heating fuel in my State \nhas doubled so all we are doing is keeping even.\n  I hope we will come together as a body--progressives conservatives, \nRepublicans, Democrats, Independents--and pass this legislation \nquickly. There is a companion piece in the House. I\n\n[[Page S6927]]\n\nhope we can get that done and bring the two pieces together. We are \ngoing to be able to provide some relief to millions of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6927-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6927-S6928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it looks as though I am the \ncleanup hitter tonight, before we close the session. It has been this \nSenator's privilege to be sitting in the chair while a number of these, \nour colleagues, have been speaking from their perspective. One of the \nunique features of this democracy is that there are 50 States, each \nwith two Senators who sometimes have points of view that are different \nfrom each other. But out of the collective will, by the give-and-take \nprocess--as the Good Book says, ``Come let us reason together''--we try \nto forge a consensus in which to govern the Nation and to set policy \nthrough law and then abide by the rule of law.\n  What a great privilege it is for this Senator to be a part of that \nand try to articulate the interests as I see the national interests \nthrough the lens as I perceive it, through the interests of my State, \nas well as the country as a whole.\n  The fact is, we are in a deplorable condition where we are now \nimporting 66.2 percent of our daily consumption of oil from places such \nas the Persian Gulf, Nigeria, and Venezuela. These are very unstable \nparts of the world. The President can certainly appreciate the fact \nthat if we did not have to do that, we would be not only economically a \nlot better off but just imagine what our defense posture would be if we \ndid not have to protect the sea lines. The U.S. Navy has to protect the \nsea lines, not only for our interests but a lot of the others of the \nworld's interests in all those areas coming around--out of the Persian \nGulf, on the west coast of Africa, and so forth.\n  It is also true that those sea lines and that flow of oil is \nincreasingly under jeopardy because of terrorist groups such as al-\nQaida that can figure it out and strike in undefended oil-producing \nfacilities, as they have tried to do in Saudi Arabia and who knows \nwhere else. All of those jitters that ripple throughout the economy \ncome because people think this tight oil supply is going to be cut \noff--as well it may be.\n  Back in the early 1970s it was cut off because of a cartel called \nOPEC, and they decided to cut back on production. You remember in the \nearly 1970s that drove oil from something like $2 a barrel up to $10 a \nbarrel.\n  This has progressively gotten worse to the point that the United \nStates is now dependent for almost two-thirds of our daily consumption \nof oil coming from foreign shores. The United States only has 3 percent \nof the world's oil reserves. Yet the United States consumes 25 percent \nof the world's oil production.\n  It does not take a mathematical genius to realize if we want to do \nsomething about our vulnerability, if we only have 3 percent of the \nworld's oil reserves but we consume 25 percent of the world's oil \nproduction, what is the ultimate solution? We have to wean ourselves \nfrom oil. We have to go to alternative fuels. We have to vigorously, \nthrough research and development, develop new engines. We have to use \nrenewables, such as solar and wind and geothermal. Indeed, we have to \nget serious about conservation.\n  This Nation simply has not done this with great vigor. It is clearly \nthe hope of this Senator that the next President of the United States \nis going to have this at the top of his agenda. Then, this Congress, \ncombined with the next President, is going to be able to make some \nmajor policy shifts about our energy consumption and from where we get \nour energy. But, in the meantime, the scare, the fright, the pain of \n$4.11-per-gallon gasoline; the scare, the fright of oil, what normally \nwould be at $55 a barrel, according to an ExxonMobil executive \ntestifying, under normal supply and demand--it is not anywhere close to \nthat. It is way up in the 130s, and it actually got up over $140 a \nbarrel.\n  Because of that pain right now we have to act. There are those who \nhave trooped in here and over and over their mantra is, as they hold up \na big sign--and it is primarily the ones on that side of the aisle who \nsay: ``Drill here. Drill now,'' as if that is the solution. This \nSenator has no problem with drilling if it is done responsibly and it \nis done in an area that there is not a prohibitively painful tradeoff.\n  What do I mean? I want to give you an example. It was this Senator \nwho, 3 years ago, had to start a filibuster to stop a punitive measure \nagainst the defense interests of the United States. I had to stop it \nwith a filibuster. That was an attempt to drill oil in the eastern Gulf \nof Mexico off of Florida. That happens to be the largest testing and \ntraining area for the U.S. military in the world. Why do you think we \ntrain all of our F-22 pilots at a base in Florida? Why do you think we \ntrain the pilots for the still-being-developed F-35 Joint Strike \nFighter in Florida? It is because they have all of that unrestricted \nspace over the Gulf of Mexico.\n  When the U.S. Navy shut down their training facility on the island of \nVieques next to the island of Puerto Rico, why did they bring all of \nthat U.S. Naval Atlantic Fleet training to the Gulf of Mexico? It is \nbecause it is restricted air space where they can have joint air, sea, \nand, at Eglin Air Force Base, land exercises in the training of our \nmilitary.\n  We are testing new weapons systems that go hundreds of miles. Where? \nIn the testing and training area of the Gulf of Mexico. And this \nSenator has shared with this Senate a letter from the Secretary of \nDefense that says: Do not drill for oil and gas in the military mission \narea of the eastern gulf testing and training area.\n  So 2 years ago, we put together a compromise. The oil forces wanted \nto have 2.5 million acres headed on a line straight for the west coast \nof Florida. This Senator worked it out with Senator Landrieu and \nseveral others. We arranged not 2.5 million acres to drill in, but 8.3 \nmillion acres, four times as much. But we kept it away from the \nmilitary mission area, the military testing and training area, which \nalso kept it away from the coast of Florida.\n  So when these folks come up with this mantra: Drill here, drill now, \nit is not taking into consideration that we have been through this \ndrill before, and we have crafted a compromise. You know, we put that \ninto law, as Senator Landrieu has shared, on different parts of the \noffshore. She showed you where we put that into law. It is prohibited \nunder law, not by Presidential proclamation, it is prohibited by law \nuntil the year 2022.\n  We did that for the reasons I have already said. We thought we \nbalanced the interests, and that was 2 years ago. And do you know what. \nNot one acre of that 8.3 million acres has been drilled. So this mantra \nof ``drill here, drill now,'' as if we do not have the area to drill, \nthis Senator worked his fingers to the bone to get a compromise to \nsatisfy all of the interests, including the drilling interests, and not \none acre of that has been drilled.\n  As a matter of fact, not any of the 32 million acres under lease in \nthe Gulf of Mexico has been drilled. This Senator is not opposed to \ndrilling. This Senator wants to drill in the 32 million acres that are \nalready available in the Gulf of Mexico and not harm the preparation \nand training of the United States military to defend our country.\n  Now, that is a simple message I want to share, and I had to wait \nuntil this hour in order to get the time to come out here and maybe, \nthrough the lens of that camera, some of this message is getting \nshared.\n  There is one more thing I want to share with the Senate that simply \nis not true. The folks who come out here with this simple message, \ndrill here, drill now, constantly say: In all the hurricanes that they \nhad there was not any oil spill. That is not true. I want to show you a \nsatellite photo 4 days after Hurricane Katrina had already hit land up \nhere on the Mississippi and the Louisiana coast. I want you to see the \noil spills as recorded in a photograph from space. That is what it \nlooked like 4 days after Katrina.\n  Now, I hope this debunks all of those folks coming up here and saying \nthere\n\n[[Page S6928]]\n\nwere no oil spills. I think they have gotten a lot safer, but don't \ncome up here and say there are no oil spills. Let's be realistic about \nit. Let's use the most modern techniques where we are going to drill in \nthose 32 million acres out in the gulf that are leased but not drilled.\n  After Katrina, 7.5 million gallons of oil were spilled. This \nsatellite image was taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration 4 days after Katrina.\n  If you do not believe me because I am saying it, let me point you to \nthe report that was produced by the Bush administration after Katrina. \nThis is from ``The Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina, Lessons \nLearned.'' It has the seal of the U.S. Government, written in February \n2006. I want to give you the quote on page 8 of this report:\n\n       In fact, Hurricane Katrina caused at least ten oil spills, \n     releasing the same quantity of oil as some of the worst oil \n     spills in U.S. history.\n       Louisiana reported at least six major oil spills of over \n     100,000 gallons and four medium spills of over 10,000 \n     gallons. All told, more than 7.4 million gallons poured into \n     the Gulf Coast region's waterways, over two-thirds of the \n     amount that spilled during America's worst oil disaster, the \n     rupturing of the Exxon Valdez tanker off the Alaska coast in \n     1989.\n\n  That is the administration's own report.\n  In the next hurricane that came a few weeks later, Hurricane Rita, a \nlarge vessel struck a submerged oil platform that sank during the \nstorm. Up to 3 million gallons of oil spilled in the gulf because of \nthat, and only half of that oil was recovered.\n  There have been plenty of technological advances on safety. But it \nhas not ensured the safety of all that oil infrastructure that Senator \nLandrieu showed you an aerial photo of in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Listen to what the Bush administration's Minerals Management Service \npredicts. They predict there will be one oil spill in the Gulf of \nMexico of 1,000 barrels of oil each year, and one spill of at least \n10,000 barrels of oil every 3 to 4 years in the future. That is their \nprediction.\n  And, of course, if we have another Katrina--and remember, Katrina was \nonly a Category 3 storm, which is up to 135 miles per hour. Guess what \nwould happen if you get to a Category 5, which are winds in excess of \n146 miles per hour, and the destructive forces of each mile per hour, \nwhen you get into that category, go up exponentially.\n  Well, I think I made my point. More intense hurricanes could mean \nmore big spills and more damage to our fragile coastline and wetlands, \nour military mission, our gulf coast beaches, and the tourism industry \nthey support, and the ecosystem. It could be devastating and decimated \nby a huge oil spill.\n  Now, we have to have balance because we are behind the eight ball \nsince we import two-thirds of our daily consumption of oil. What this \nSenator wants is for us to balance the approach to this: R, \nalternative fuels, conservation, stretch the envelope, develop new \nengines, drill for oil, and do it in a responsible way where we have \nalready provided the leases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6928-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMEMORATING THE ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA SORORITY, INCORPORATED\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I welcome the women of Alpha Kappa Alpha \nSorority, Inc., to Capitol Hill in celebration of its centennial \nanniversary.\n  Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. is our Nation's first African-\nAmerican sorority, and was founded on January 15, 1908. Since then, the \nsorority has always exemplified its motto of ``being of service to all \nmankind.''\n  Over the course of ten decades, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., has \ngrown its membership to include over 200,000 members throughout the \nUnited States, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean. Through the \nyears, the sorority has remained committed to improving the lives of \ncountless Americans through its involvement in programs including the \nMississippi Health Project, the Job Corps, and the African Village \nDevelopment Program.\n  In my home State of Nevada alone, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.'s \nTheta Theta Omega Chapter has provided over $100,000 in scholarships to \ndeserving African-American female Clark County high school students, \nwhile its Kappa Xi Chapter has a distinguished record of service both \non the University of Nevada Las Vegas campus and throughout the \ncommunity.\n  In the coming century, I am certain that this illustrious \norganization will continue to empower communities and respond to the \nincreasingly complex issues facing the world. I commend the women of \nAlpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., for their 100 years of distinguished \nservice to our great Nation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this year we are celebrating Alpha Kappa \nAlpha, Inc. sorority's 100th birthday. This week, more than 20,000 \nmembers from all over the country have come to Washington, DC, to \nparticipate in a week-long program of forums and seminars with a focus \non leadership, sisterhood and service, known as the Centennial Boule. \nThe theme of this week's celebration is the ``Centennial Commitment to \nLeadership.''\n  The week's events will culminate in today's Unity March where members \nfrom the nine African-American Greek fraternities and sororities \nmarched to the Capitol.\n  AKA's International President, Barbara McKinzie, who has lived in \nShreveport, LA, says the qualities that have sustained AKA for a \ncentury are ``sisterhood and service.'' Her administration is committed \nto ESP: Economics, Service and Partnership.\n  AKA is the first Greek-letter sorority established by African-\nAmerican women for African-American, college-educated women. It was \nfounded by nine enterprising Howard University women, led by Ethel \nHedgeman Lyle, on January 15, 1908.\n  Now the membership has grown to 975 chapters worldwide and is \n200,000-strong. Among the famous AKAs are Maya Angelou, Gladys Knight \nand Alicia Keys; and Members of the House of Representatives include \nEddie Bernice Johnson and Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, and Diane Watson \nof California. Powerful women across America both in the private sector \nand government represent the AKA sisterhood. Three members of my staff \nare proud to be a part of this sisterhood: my office manager Alicia \nWilliams, acting State director Tari Bradford, and my New Orleans \nconstituent services representative Sherae Hunter.\n  The AKA sorority, founded before women had the right to vote by women \none generation away from slavery, has been an instrumental group in \nraising the profile of African-American women and has worked tirelessly \nto knock down barriers to advancement in our society. The sisterhood \nhas consistently encouraged academic achievement, leadership and \nservice.\n  Members remain active for their whole lives and are encouraged to \ncontribute to their communities. Each chapter has its own community \nservice focus. The Gamma Eta Omega Alumnae Chapter in Baton Rouge, for \ninstance, raises money through an annual fashion show for scholarships \nfor high school seniors and sorority undergraduates and also sponsors \nthe Leadership Fellows Institute each year to promote leadership among \nhigh school students.\n  The Delta Lamda Omega Chapter in Shreveport gathers for ``A Day On \nand Not a Day Off,'' where sisters take off work to volunteer in the \ncommunity. Chapters all over Louisiana are similarly committed to their \ncommunities. In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, \nAKAs from all over the country came to the aid of hurricane survivors \nalong the gulf coast and helped with our recovery effort.\n  It is with great pride that we welcome all AKAs to the birthplace of \nthe sisterhood, Washington, DC, as they embark on another \ngroundbreaking century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6928-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6928-S6929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  40TH ANNIVERSARY OF SPECIAL OLYMPICS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today is the 40th anniversary of Special \nOlympics, an organization that has touched the lives of people with \nintellectual disabilities in Nevada and throughout the country. This \nspring, I had the chance to meet with one such Special Olympics \nathlete: Cari Davis, a resident of Henderson, NV, who has been winning \nmedals since beginning her athletic career in 1988. It is my privilege \ntoday to recognize the achievements of all Special Olympics athletes, \nas well as the\n\n[[Page S6929]]\n\nbroader impact of their participation in sports.\n  Forty years ago, Eunice Kennedy Shriver founded Special Olympics with \nthe belief that everyone, regardless of ability or disability, deserves \nopportunities to participate in sports. What began as Camp Shriver on \nthe lawn of her Maryland home has now grown into an international \norganization reaching over 180 countries. Through these programs, \npeople with intellectual disabilities can do more than just develop \nskills in a particular sport or improve their physical fitness. They \nalso get opportunities to form friendships, build self-confidence, \nlearn teamwork, and enjoy the sheer joy of the athletic experience. \nThat is why I was pleased to help enact the Healthy Special Olympics \nSport and Empowerment Act of 2004, which enabled Special Olympics to \nexpand its programs and increase the number of athletes served.\n  In my home State, Special Olympics Nevada provides year-round \ntraining and competition opportunities in a variety of sports, \nincluding alpine skiing, basketball, swimming, and gymnastics. In \naddition to providing these activities and sponsoring competitive \ntrials, Special Olympics offers services that promote good health, such \nas screenings through the Healthy Athletes Program. Larger events are \nalso held, like the Special Olympics Nevada Summer Games that took \nplace this June in Reno.\n  These events highlight more than the athletes' determination, \ntalents, and spirit. Their participation in sports is also serving to \ndispel myths and change attitudes, contributing to the greater \ninclusion, understanding, and acceptance of people with disabilities. \nIn fact, there are Special Olympics initiatives, like its collaboration \nwith the school district in Clark County, NV, that give students with \nintellectual disabilities and other students the chance to participate \nin sports together. Perhaps it is these young athletes who best embody \nthis remark by Mrs. Shriver: ``May you overturn ignorance; may you \nchallenge indifference at every turn; and may you find great joy in the \nnew daylight of the great athletes of the Special Olympics.''\n  Mr. President, I wish Special Olympics all the best as we celebrate \nits 40th anniversary and look forward to many more years to come.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today we are celebrating the 40th \nanniversary of the Special Olympics, an organization that has done an \nextraordinary job of improving the lives of individuals with \nintellectual disabilities. This remarkable organization was born in \nEunice Kennedy Shriver's backyard, where she used to host a day camp \nfor children with intellectual disabilities. Under her founding \nleadership--and for the last decade, under the leadership of her son, \nTim Shriver--the Special Olympics has grown into a truly amazing \nenterprise, serving some 2.5 million people in more than 180 countries. \nIt gives individuals with intellectual disabilities the opportunity to \nimprove their health, well-being, social skills, and other skills \nthrough competitive sports--and the opportunity to have fun, just like \neveryone else.\n  I have been a long-time advocate for people with disabilities. But it \nwas not until the 1980s, when Eunice Kennedy Shriver came to see me and \nasked me to get involved as an advocate for individuals with \nintellectual disabilities, that I learned about the unique challenges \nfaced by individuals with intellectual disabilities in our society. Of \ncourse, when Eunice Kennedy Shriver asked, I couldn't say no. She \ninvited me to a Special Olympics competition here in Washington, and I \nimmediately became a fan. It was extraordinary to see the athletes' \ntalents, enthusiasm, and courage.\n  Over the years, thanks largely to Special Olympics, I have developed \na better appreciation of the needs of people with intellectual \ndisabilities. They have health problems that many physicians do not \nknow how to address. For example, by and large, individuals with \nintellectual disabilities have little opportunity for exercise and \nother physical activity. Too often, they are relegated to the fringes \nof our society.\n  The brilliance of the Special Olympics is that it uses sports to help \nintegrate people with intellectual disabilities into our broader \nsociety. Special Olympics provides a kind of ideal world for \nindividuals with intellectual disabilities. The accent is on abilities, \nnot disabilities. Athletes have the opportunity to compete and achieve \non a level playing field. Special Olympics gives its athletes, like \nKyler Prunty, one of my constituents from Marshalltown, IA, the \nopportunity to compete in swimming and other sports, as all children \nand young adults want the opportunity to do. Kyler knows that his \nsuccess is determined by his own hard work, talent, determination, and \ncourage.\n  Special Olympics helps people overcome their fear and ignorance of \nindividuals with intellectual disabilities. It transforms athletes by \nempowering them as competitors and leaders. It transforms communities \nby changing attitudes about people with intellectual disabilities.\n  Special Olympics includes a number of associated programs. The \nUnified Sports program provides inclusive sports experiences with \nindividuals with and without intellectual disabilities playing together \non the same team.\n  Special Olympics also improves the lives of individuals with \ndisabilities by looking at health issues. I am a proud supporter of the \nHealthy Athletes program, which allows athletes to receive a variety of \nimportant health screenings and services in conjunction with local, \nState/Provincial, National, and World Games.\n  Special Olympics has come a long way since it began 40 years ago. \nWhen Special Olympics held its first event in Illinois, my home State \nof Iowa sent fewer than 100 athletes to the games. Today, more than \n13,000 Special Olympics Athletes, and 2,000 certified coaches, from all \n99 Iowa counties in Iowa, participate in Special Olympics programs.\n  I am proud that, in 2006, the first-ever Special Olympics USA \nNational Games were held in Ames, IA. In conjunction with those games, \nI held a field hearing of my Senate Appropriations Subcommittee \nfocusing on the status of people with intellectual disabilities in the \nU.S. That hearing taught us a great deal about the health and education \nneeds of individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n  As a result of the hearing, I introduced S. 1050, the Health and \nWellness for Individuals with Disabilities Act. This bill would promote \nthe training of medical and dental professionals to care for \nindividuals with intellectual disabilities. In addition, it would \ncreate model wellness programs, and standards for accessibility of \nmedical equipment to further level the playing field for the care of \nSpecial Olympics athletes and other individuals with disabilities.\n  Special Olympics and its emphasis on inclusion of individuals with \nintellectual disabilities through athletics is now a worldwide \nmovement. It shows what can be achieved when one individual, in the \nperson of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, pursues a cause with passion. Her \nvision is making a difference in the fabric of our society, where \nindividuals with intellectual disabilities can now participate in \nsports competitions in Iowa, across the country, and around the world.\n  I salute the Special Olympics for a brilliant 40 years of service, \nand I wish the organization even greater success in the decades ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6929-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6929-S6930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN REMEMBRANCE OF DOROTHY PHILLIPS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of Dorothy \nPhillips, who passed away yesterday at the age of 84.\n  Born in Utah in 1923, Dorothy was a dedicated mother of 7, \ngrandmother of 15, and great-grandmother of 14. She lived in the small \nsoutheastern Nevada town of Caliente for over 70 years and was known to \nits residents for her active leadership in the community. She was an \nenthusiastic participant in local, county, and State politics, and her \nprominence in local Democratic Party matters led many to seek out her \nsupport and advice, and one of my best ever campaign volunteers.\n  Dorothy was also passionate about the needs of Nevada's senior \ncitizens. For her 26 years of service as the director of the Caliente \nSenior Citizen Center, a senior housing development was named the \n``Dorothy Phillips Manor'' in her honor. She was even selected to\n\n[[Page S6930]]\n\nrepresent Nevada's seniors as a delegate to the 1995 White House \nConference on Aging.\n  In addition, Dorothy was a vocal opponent of the proposed nuclear \nwaste dump at Yucca Mountain. The Department of Energy's transportation \nplan would bring trainloads of nuclear waste right through Caliente. \nDorothy spoke out against this plan, fueled by concerns for how it \nwould impact her small town. In part, Dorothy's activism was inspired \nby tragedy. Dorothy recalled being told that the mushroom clouds \ncreated by the testing of atomic weapons at the Nevada Test Site during \nthe 1950s were not harmful. In fact, she said residents were encouraged \nto go outside and watch. Unfortunately, Dorothy's father and two \nsiblings died of cancer caused by radiation from the test site. It was \nin their memory that she fought against Yucca Mountain and the Caliente \nCorridor.\n  Dorothy will be remembered for her devotion to her family and her \ncommunity, and she will be missed by those who had the privilege of \nknowing her. I extend my most heartfelt condolences to her husband \nDonald and their family. They should all be proud of her legacy of \nservice to Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6930-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor on \nmany occasions to highlight a separate violent, hate-motivated crime \nthat has occurred in our country.\n  On the evening of July 7, 2008, Rev. Louis Braxton, Jr., was \nreturning to the shelter he runs for transgender and gay youth in \nQueens, NY, when he witnessed a group of teens attacking some of the \nshelter's residents. Father Braxton says he shouted at the attackers \nand they ran off. Four of them returned, however, holding a paint \nbucket, steel brackets, a miter box, and a belt. According to the \nQueens district attorney's office, two of the residents argued with the \nfour attackers and were punched in the face and body. Father Braxton, \nwho was also reportedly struck in the face with a metal object in the \nscuffle, says the assailants were yelling homophobic and \nantitransgender slurs as they beat the victims. The shelter apparently \nsuffers from weekly attacks from neighborhood teenagers. Father Braxton \nhas met with the Hate Crimes Division of the police department to \ndiscuss safety issues for the residents. The district attorney's office \nhas charged Shara Mozie, Tyreek Childs, and Trevaughn Payne with \nassault and weapons harassment, and the attack is also being \ninvestigated as a hate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6930-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6930-S6931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF THE FBI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was privileged to attend the event at the \nNational Building Museum this morning commemorating the FBI's \ncentennial anniversary. It was an extraordinary event honoring the \ndedicated men and women of the FBI. Four of the six FBI Directors who \nhave guided this agency over the last 84 years were present, and \nDirector Mueller made an inspiring speech to mark the occasion. He \nspoke about the history of the Bureau, paid tribute to those who have \nserved and are currently serving, and spoke about the elements in the \nFBI's motto of ``fidelity, bravery and integrity.''\n  I was especially struck by Director Mueller's description of the \nvalues that guide the Bureau, values that are important to effective \nlaw enforcement. He said:\n\n       It is not enough to stop the terrorist--we must stop him \n     while maintaining his civil liberties.\n       It is not enough to catch the criminal--we must catch him \n     while respecting his civil rights.\n       It is not enough to prevent foreign countries from stealing \n     our secrets--we must prevent that from happening while still \n     upholding the rule of law.\n       The rule of law, civil liberties, and civil rights--these \n     are not our burdens. They are what make us better. And they \n     are what have made us better for the past 100 years.\n\n  I commend the Director for his words and for his service. I \ncongratulate the men and women of the FBI and thank them for all they \ndo every day to keep Americans safe, establish justice, and allow us to \nsecure the blessings of liberty.\n  I ask that the remarks of Director Mueller be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             100th Anniversary Commemoration, July 17, 2008\n\n       Good morning to all. It is truly an honor to be here today \n     to mark this significant milestone in the Bureau's history, \n     and to share in the celebration of this occasion--the 100th \n     anniversary of the FBI.\n       My thanks to Attorney General Mukasey and the many other \n     distinguished guests for joining us today.\n       My special thanks, also, to Directors Webster, Sessions, \n     and Freeh, for being here with us on this day. Together, they \n     represent three decades at the Bureau in which we saw a \n     strong emphasis on white collar and organized crime, as well \n     as counterintelligence cases. We witnessed innovations in \n     crime-solving technologies, and a dramatic expansion of our \n     international program.\n       But let's go back a bit further in history.\n       One hundred years ago, Attorney General Charles Joseph \n     Bonaparte organized a group of investigators under the \n     Justice Department. In July, 1908, the Bureau of \n     Investigation opened its doors.\n       The first Bureau employees numbered just 34--nine \n     detectives, thirteen civil rights investigators, and twelve \n     accountants. They investigated, among other things, antitrust \n     matters, land fraud, and copyright violations.\n       Compare that to today's FBI--a threat-based, intelligence-\n     driven, technologically supported agency of over 30,000 \n     employees--employees who are working in 56 field offices here \n     in the U.S., and 61 Legal Attache offices overseas.\n       Employees who are combatting crimes as diverse as \n     terrorism, corporate fraud, cyber crime, human trafficking, \n     and money laundering. J. Edgar Hoover would indeed be proud.\n       Today's FBI is often, and I believe accurately, described \n     as one of the world's few intelligence and law enforcement \n     agencies combined.\n       The culture of the FBI is now, and for the past 100 years \n     has been, a culture of hard work and dedication to protecting \n     the United States, no matter what the challenges.\n       In the wake of the September 11 attacks, it became clear \n     that the FBI's number one priority must be the prevention of \n     another terrorist attack. We refocused our mission, revised \n     our priorities, and realigned our work force.\n       We strengthened lines of communication between the Bureau \n     and our partners in the global intelligence and law \n     enforcement communities.\n       And we are now stronger, and better equipped to confront \n     the threats we face today.\n       Today's FBI continues to reflect and to embody its motto--\n     Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity. It is a motto emblazoned on \n     the FBI Seal. And it is worth its weight in gold.\n       For the past 100 years, the men and women of the FBI have \n     lived out their commitment to Fidelity, Bravery, and \n     Integrity. And it is precisely because they have done so that \n     the Bureau has the reputation that it has today.\n       Even so, these are qualities that need to be constantly \n     burnished by the men and women of the Bureau, to ensure that \n     they do not rust for lack of use.\n       For most of us, fidelity is faithfulness to an obligation, \n     trust or duty.\n       For the men and women of the FBI, fidelity also means \n     fidelity to country. It means fidelity to justice and to the \n     law, fidelity to the Constitution, fidelity to equality and \n     liberty.\n       Bravery is the quality of being willing to face danger, \n     pain, or trouble; to remain unafraid.\n       Bravery is not merely the act of rushing in where others \n     flee. It is the quiet, diligent dedication to facing down \n     those who would do us harm and to bring them to justice.\n       The well-known tennis champion and social humanitarian, \n     Arthur Ashe, once said, ``True heroism is remarkably sober, \n     very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at \n     whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever \n     cost.''\n       Bravery is the capstone in the stories of Special Agents \n     Rodney Miller, John O'Neill, and Lenny Hatton. On September \n     11, Miller and O'Neill went up, not down, the stairs of the \n     North Tower of the World Trade Center to help others to get \n     out.\n       Rodney Miller went all the way up to the 86th floor, \n     offering assistance to fire and police personnel on the \n     scene.\n       Through radio transmissions, Lenny Hatton reported the \n     crash of the second plane, and then assisted with evacuation \n     efforts. Neither he nor John O'Neill survived.\n\n[[Page S6931]]\n\n       And we will never know how many lives were saved as a \n     result of their and the other first responders' extraordinary \n     bravery on that day.\n       Although their stories are unique, their bravery is \n     repeated by the men and women of the FBI working each and \n     every day around the country, and around the world.\n       Whether cracking down on public corruption or white collar \n     crime that corrodes the public trust. Or capturing criminals \n     who exploit children on the Internet, or commit violent \n     crime, hate crime, organized crime, espionage, or terrorism.\n       Such bravery can be seen in the story of Jay Tabb, a member \n     of our Hostage Rescue Team. Tabb received the FBI Star after \n     being shot and seriously wounded during the arrest of a \n     wanted fugitive.\n       Just months later, during a search of a terrorist safe-\n     house in Iraq, he was injured again, this time by a suicide \n     bomber. Despite his own injuries he rescued four wounded \n     soldiers. After each incident his first question was, how \n     soon can I get back to work with my team?\n       Bravery can be seen in the stories of our Task Force \n     Officers like Port Authority Police Detective Tom McHale, who \n     has served on our Newark Joint Terrorism Task Force since \n     1995.\n       The morning of September 11th, McHale was blocks away from \n     the World Trade Center when he heard the first plane fly \n     overhead. He raced to the scene to assist with evacuations \n     and rescues. He was caught in both building collapses, and \n     was injured.\n       And yet as a trained ironworker, McHale spent the next \n     weeks in the rubble cutting through steel recovering bodies. \n     He worked at Ground Zero for 12 hours a day, before reporting \n     for duty on the Joint Terrorism Task Force to help with \n     thousands of leads.\n       Bravery can be seen in the work of Jennifer Keenan, the \n     first female Special Agent to be stationed in Pakistan and in \n     Yemen, and who helped carry out dangerous missions in both of \n     those countries.\n       Along with Tom McHale, Keenan was part of the FBI team in \n     Pakistan who captured Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaidah.\n       Bravery can be seen in the story of Special Agent Bruce \n     Bennett and three other Agents, who, as John mentioned, were \n     seriously wounded just last March in a terrorist bombing, \n     also in Pakistan.\n       And it can be seen in the story of Walter Walsh, our oldest \n     retired Special Agent, who survived shootouts with gangsters \n     in the 1930s.\n       And it so happens that several of these individuals are \n     with us today. Would you all please stand so we can recognize \n     you?\n       And yet there is no shortage of heroes in the FBI. I am \n     certain there are also many unsung heroes with us here in the \n     audience today--heroes whose stories may never be told.\n       And we honor them as well.\n       For the men and women of the FBI, bravery is reflected not \n     only in the physical courage often necessary in the job. It \n     can be seen in the courage of conviction, in the courage to \n     act with wisdom in the face of fear, and in the courage it \n     takes to admit mistakes and to move forward.\n       This brings us to the third quality that defines the \n     Bureau, and that is integrity. It is the quality of being of \n     sound moral principle; uprightness, honesty, and sincerity.\n       For the men and women of the FBI, integrity is reflected in \n     all that we say and we do--in honesty, in keeping promises, \n     in fairness, in respect to others, and in compassion.\n       Integrity is, in some ways, the most important of the three \n     words that make up our motto. Integrity is the fire by which \n     fidelity and bravery are tested.\n       Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity set the expectations for \n     behavior; they set the standard for our work.\n       More than just a motto, for the men and women of the FBI, \n     Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity is a way of life.\n       And it has always been so. It has been said of FBI \n     employees that they stand on the shoulders of their \n     predecessors. Indeed, we do.\n       And while it is a time of change in the Bureau, our values \n     will never change.\n       It is not enough to stop the terrorist--we must stop him \n     while maintaining his civil liberties.\n       It is not enough to catch the criminal--we must catch him \n     while respecting his civil rights.\n       It is not enough to prevent foreign countries from stealing \n     our secrets--we must prevent that from happening while still \n     upholding the rule of law.\n       The rule of law, civil liberties, and civil rights--these \n     are not our burdens. They are what make us better. And they \n     are what have made us better for the past 100 years.\n       The men and women of the FBI today are part of history in \n     the making. We understand that we have been passed a legacy \n     and that it remains our responsibility to both build on and \n     to pass on that legacy to those who will succeed us.\n       John F. Kennedy once said, ``. . . when at some future date \n     the high court of history sits in judgment on each of us, . . \n     . our success or failure, in whatever office we hold, will be \n     measured by the answers to four questions: First, were we \n     truly men of courage . . . Second, were we truly men of \n     judgment . . . Third, were we truly men of integrity . . . \n     Finally, were we truly men of dedication?''\n       The men and women of the FBI, here and around the world, \n     past and present, can resoundingly answer yes to each of \n     these questions. That is because they live our motto each and \n     every day.\n       Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity remain the attributes of \n     an organization with a proud. history of distinguished \n     service to the nation. And each of us is indeed honored to be \n     part of that.\n       With Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity defining every FBI \n     employee, we stand fully ready to face the challenges of the \n     next century.\n       Thank you all again for being here with us today and God \n     bless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6931-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONQUER CHILDHOOD CANCER ACT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am very pleased by the Senate's actions \nlast night to pass bipartisan legislation that I introduced, the \nConquer Childhood Cancer Act.\n  Recently, through the leadership of Representative Pryce, the House \npassed its version of this legislation by an overwhelming vote of 416-\n0. The bill was renamed after Representative Pryce's daughter, Caroline \nPryce Walker, who died of neuroblastoma at a young age.\n  Ben Haight of Rhode Island also died of neuroblastoma. But Caroline \nand Ben shared more than this terrible disease. They inspired their \nfamilies to turn tragedy into hope. They and others also inspired many \nof us in Congress to work on this legislation.\n  The bill invests $30 million a year to expand pediatric cancer \nresearch. It also creates a national childhood cancer registry to track \npediatric cancer. Researchers would be able to contact patients within \nweeks, enroll them in research studies, and follow up with them over \ntime. In Europe, similar registries are already yielding results to \nresearch questions.\n  Again, I am pleased that our many efforts to overcome objections to \nthe bill have finally succeeded, and that the bill is on its way to the \nPresident's desk to be signed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6931-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6931-S6933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate .gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: You asked that I send a paragraph or \n     two about how I or my family are impacted by the constantly \n     rising gas prices. At first, I thought that I had nothing to \n     share, other than the usual issues you mention: no choice, I \n     have to drive that far. Then I realized that I do indeed have \n     a story to share.\n       I am an amateur radio operator, and I love helping my \n     community by volunteering my services at various events. \n     However, with the rising cost of fuel, I am being slowly \n     forced to pick and choose what events I am willing to help \n     with. That means that many local and distant events that rely \n     on amateur radio operators (hams) to provide them with \n     communications are finding it not only more and more \n     expensive to put on the events, but also finding that it is \n     not as easy to get enough communication volunteers. Without \n     enough hams there, the people putting on the events have to \n     space what resources they do have further and further apart. \n     This provides an extra risk for the event participants in \n     some cases. With hams spaced increasingly further apart, \n     there are areas of, for example, parades, fairs, bike races \n     and tours, long distance runs, and other outdoor events that \n     have no safety net in case something goes wrong.\n       Sometimes we are partially reimbursed for our fuel, other \n     times we aren't. For some hams who may be retired, this can \n     be the only way they are able to afford to volunteer. Others \n     of us, myself included, will attempt to cut something else to \n     still volunteer but even so there are so many events and only \n     so many fuel dollars that I can volunteer. For those of us \n     that function as brooms and sweeps at races and tours we \n     still drive more miles than the gas we are reimbursed for.\n\n[[Page S6932]]\n\n       As long as we can, we'll volunteer for these events, but \n     even so there comes a time when we simply cannot afford it, \n     much as we'd like to volunteer.\n           Respectfully,\n     Bill.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo: The ever-increasing fuel prices have forced \n     me and my family to make significant changes in our \n     lifestyle. My wife is a stay-at-home mother, taking care of \n     our two boys; so, consequently, we live on a fixed income \n     like most Americans. To keep our fuel costs at our budgeted \n     amount, we've been forced to purchase a motorcycle for \n     commuting to and from work. This decision comes with a \n     certain level of risk, but it is a choice we have made in \n     order for my wife to continue to stay at home and raise our \n     boys. Should fuel prices continue to increase, we may be \n     forced to have my wife return to the workforce, which, I hope \n     you would agree, is not what this country needs. With fuel \n     prices soaring, it is very aggravating to hear that China and \n     India are 50 miles off the coast of Florida, slant drilling \n     for oil in the continental shelf but yet it is illegal for us \n     to do the same. It is aggravating to hear that the last \n     refinery was built in this country over thirty years ago! I \n     understand this is because of all the regulatory legislation. \n     It is aggravating to hear politicians complaining about big \n     oil profits when their profit margins are only around 8%! It \n     is aggravating to hear politician's discussing windfall \n     profit taxes when it is profits that have built this country! \n     I hope you would agree that it is profits that drive \n     innovation and technology! If the politicians were working on \n     the country's business and not discussing the use of \n     performance enhancing drugs in baseball, cheating in \n     football, writing letters to Rush Limbaugh, etc. . . . the \n     energy crisis in this country would most likely have been \n     solved years ago!\n       Thank you for the opportunity to provide you with my \n     thoughts on energy prices and how it has impacted our family \n     as well as allowing me to vent my frustration with some of \n     the leadership of this country. I applaud you on your recent \n     fight on the ``climate change legislation.'' I believe the \n     climate change and global warming is a huge myth, and I pray \n     we never implement cap and trade; which, I believe will be \n     the beginning of the end. Keep up the good fight & God Bless!\n           Respectfully yours,\n     Scott.\n                                  ____\n\n       Like many others, I am concerned about the rise in energy \n     costs--for me it has a great deal to do with my health. I was \n     diagnosed with MS a few years ago. One of the most difficult \n     times for me is the summer. MS makes the heat pretty much \n     unbearable, so the air-conditioner runs most of the time--\n     especially through May to October. I also must use the air-\n     conditioner in my car when I drive. When the heat strikes, I \n     become fatigued so much so that I cannot move. This makes it \n     hard to be with friends and family, especially my 13 year old \n     son--who is very active. I do hope that we can find some \n     alternatives to gas and oil, and look forward to hearing how \n     you can help.\n           Thank you,\n     Kim, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       It may seem as though it will take a holy cow to get our \n     legislature to think ``oil independence,'' but as I am sure \n     you realize, we have over 100 years of oil independence at \n     our fingertips; that's right here at home in Utah, Montana, \n     and the Dakotas, this is not counting the offshore oil \n     available off both coasts, OR do we need to help China find \n     our oil. It is about time for a wake-up call. I do support \n     your logical and commonsense approach to the energy crisis we \n     have at hand and support your direction.\n       Keep up the good fight; let us stop sending our dollars \n     overseas. Oil independence--that is the ticket! Thanks for \n     listening.\n     John.\n                                  ____\n\n       Mr. Crapo: Perhaps you should read the Idaho State Journal, \n     the ``Your Letters'' in the first section of the paper dated \n     June 16, 2008. Side with big oil, as it clearly looks as you \n     did, and then expect your constituents to write in to you and \n     give heartbreaking stories seems a bit ludicrous. Opening up \n     wilderness for drilling is a 10+ year detour as that is the \n     estimate as to when we would actually see any of that oil in \n     the system.\n       If you want to help:\n       1. Find ways to help the average home owner to install \n     solar panels on rooftops or in backyards to help offset the \n     rising electrical rates. This needs to be through low \n     interest easy to obtain loans and even grants for low income \n     homeowners, not tax breaks, as the initial investment is \n     large and out of range for home owners such as myself. This \n     would result in lower electrical bills and maybe even a \n     money-generating opportunity for the homeowner as they can \n     sell excess back to Idaho Power.\n       2. Help establish more wind farms and make sure that the \n     end product stays in Idaho, not transmitted out of state. The \n     outlandish approval hearings and appeals need to be stopped.\n       3. Nuclear was never and is never the answer; the end \n     product of such is a disaster waiting to happen.\n       4. It is time to come to grips with the fact that oil \n     prices will never come down. We have created this dragon, and \n     now it has come to burn our villages. Do we really need \n     Hummers, large SUVs, NASCAR? I think not. The automobile \n     makers in this country need to be held to higher standards \n     and take the lead on producing vehicles that actually make \n     respectable gas mileage. This country put men on the moon, \n     but we cannot produce a vehicle that actually makes a \n     respectable MPG, and I am not talking 30 MPG but 50MPG+.\n       5. Yes, it is time to crack down on big oil. The profits \n     that these companies have been posting are insane. The \n     arguments that production costs have risen, etc., are a slap \n     in the face to anyone listening to these numbers. These are \n     profits, not gross income.\n           Best Wishes,\n     Matthew.\n                                  ____\n\n       My wife and I are in our mid-sixties, my wife on Social \n     Security. The spiraling fuel prices are beginning to wreak \n     havoc on our conservative budget. I am on the verge of riding \n     a bicycle to work, nine miles each way. I know that we, as a \n     country, have the ability to produce all the energy we need \n     for generations, but [no solutions are forthcoming]!\n       I hate to think I have worked my entire adult life just to \n     have prohibitive fuel prices keep us from doing many of the \n     things we have looked forward to.\n       For a change we can believe in, do something about it! Let \n     us start by tapping the massive resources we have available \n     to us here at home. Americans like myself will not be quiet \n     forever.\n     Alan, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for this opportunity to provide feedback. I have \n     many friends who are retired from the military and police. \n     [Most,] like me, are conservatives.\n       As we e-mail each other, the same theme and thoughts \n     continue to be repeated. Why [does it seem there are no \n     answers from our Congress regarding energy prices? There have \n     been plenty of hearings on issues like baseball, impeaching \n     the President and grilling oil executives, but nothing that \n     actually fixes the problem.]\n       The lesson of history [appears to be lost by many people]. \n     The oil embargo was the first shot fired in this global war. \n     The Saudis are not our friends, and the entire Middle East is \n     [a consistently unstable area], yet we have done nothing for \n     over 30 years!!!\n       Why would or should our President seek additional \n     production [from that area] when this country has known \n     reserves that could be effectively used to deflate the cost \n     of oil, gas and diesel. I am not a lawyer, but even I, as \n     well as most commonsense thinking people, have figured this \n     out.\n       The very removal of the current restrictions on drilling of \n     our currently known resources would drive the costs down \n     almost overnight. This would take courage and leadership.\n       This is not considered to be a long-term plan for energy \n     independence. However, if used as a bridge, it would allow \n     for the needed technical expertise to develop higher \n     efficiency engines and alternate transportation choices. This \n     would serve this country better than the current so-called \n     energy policies currently in place.\n       With China drilling for oil just off the coast of Florida, \n     how can you guarantee that they will not use current \n     technology to ``poach'' our oil reserves in this area?\n       Given the track record of [action so far], I do not have \n     much confidence in anything getting done.\n     Ronald, Council.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a single parent. I work hard and also go to school as \n     a full-time student. It is a 30-mile drive to my school one-\n     way, and 77 miles to work one-way. The cost of gas is not my \n     idea of fun. Thankfully my primary vehicle gets 40 miles to \n     the gallon, which helps to take the sting out of it a bit, \n     but not much. I am having to curtail a lot of the activities \n     that I do with my children that include taking them swimming \n     and such, due to the fact that I need to get to work or \n     school and cannot afford much else. I have been watching the \n     prices go up, oil companies and their executives [receiving \n     record] profits and no relief in site. Most Americans are \n     suffering while [a small group] are building bigger bank \n     accounts. I believe in capitalism completely, but not [at the \n     expense of] the common American. It does not take a rocket \n     scientist to figure out who is behind all of this, and that \n     there are most likely a few traders out there and maybe even \n     others driving the price of fuel up too to further pad their \n     pockets. I never understood why some wanted to cut off the \n     supply to the strategic reserve as that is such a small drop \n     in the bucket that it will never do any good in the long run. \n     Food costs are going up due to rising fuel costs, which means \n     now I do not get some of the things my kids used to enjoy as \n     often. We do not even go out to dinner or even a movie as \n     that small amount of fuel could make the difference in \n     getting to work or class for me. And trust me in saying, [my \n     family relationships have suffered] because I cannot afford \n     things we used to do that they want to do. When the time \n     comes that they say the cost of satellite TV needs to go up \n     due to fuel costs I will have had it. I am watching way too \n     many companies use that excuse to raise prices when fuel has \n     nothing to do with their goods and or services. This has got \n     to stop, and the oil companies get reigned in and severely \n     penalized for what they are doing. Open the Alaskan and Gulf \n     reserves and slap major government regulation on the oil \n     companies like was done to\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\n     Ma Bell in the 70's. That will teach them and smash their \n     monopolies.\n     Ed.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo: I have a serious concern about energy \n     prices. I live in Blackfoot, and work in Pocatello and Idaho \n     Falls (ISU). At this rate, I may have to find a job in \n     Blackfoot. Gas prices are affecting us more than in most \n     states due to our rural status. I think you should continue \n     to represent our concerns about high gas prices. Can we get \n     the corporate officers from Chevron, Exxon, etc., to testify \n     in Congress as to why our prices are so high? Can we convince \n     the Middle Eastern oil barons to bring their prices down? I \n     have supported you on many issues. I was especially thankful \n     for your support of the Dia del Nino program at the Sixth \n     Grade School in Blackfoot when your office donated hundreds \n     of books to the kids. Please continue to support us on our \n     concerns about the exorbitant energy prices, especially the \n     high cost of gasoline at the pump. Somebody has to be held \n     accountable for these sky-rocketing prices. Thanks for all \n     you do!\n     Amando.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator: Thanks for asking, but there is no real point \n     in more words and stories and talking. [The auto industry has \n     received special treatment for many years, including \n     avoiding] significant increases in fleet mileage standards. \n     Congressional-supported research for alternative energy \n     sources was removed from the most recent energy bill. [Oil \n     company executives are making exorbitant salaries, and many \n     other rumors and concerns have surfaced about job losses and \n     energy research]. I like Senator McCain's ideas for \n     instituting an entire new green energy industry in the U.S. \n     That would support your ideas for alternatives. Heaven--and \n     Mother Nature--knows that Idaho, with geothermal and biomass \n     and hydro and enough solar and wind, is conveniently at the \n     crossroads and on the power grid to score big time on this. \n     But that takes a federal government commitment toward schools \n     [similar to what] the Sputnik shock created. I am afraid the \n     libertarian/conservative ``get government out of our lives'' \n     mentality will end that.\n       Is not $4 gas really America's best energy policy? That \n     this is what it will take to change thinking on mass transit, \n     improved mileage vehicle design and purchases, ride-sharing, \n     central city dwelling, buy local and regional food?\n       So, our stories? Well, trip-chaining to reduce shopping \n     trips, [supporting efforts to improve community transit \n     systems which will also improve inversion and air quality \n     concerns.] Staying home rather than flying or driving on \n     vacation.\n       This exercise of providing anecdotes is a waste of time. \n     The issue and solutions have been [around for many years, but \n     not implemented. Too often, we, the people, feel ignored by \n     those who simply talk about solving the problems, but do not \n     take any substantive action. We are all working for the \n     American Dream, but there are so many issues that are \n     ignored--]roads and bridges deteriorating, borders and ports \n     unsecured, financiers unregulated, food and drug operations \n     poorly monitored, military qualities diminishing, public \n     school standards disappearing.\n       On this one issue, [everyone is affected--] getting to \n     work, emergency vehicles, cross country 18-wheelers, sales \n     trips, plane trips and freight, school buses.\n       Thanks for your attention.\n     Richard, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Being 18, maybe I do not have the full perspective on \n     issues, but the correct energy policy seems too simple to be \n     wrong. As an American, what I demand is action! Something \n     needs to be done already! Nothing has been done for 30+ \n     years, so there has been plenty of time to talk and argue. \n     Now is the time when action is needed. Congress needs to just \n     listen to the men and woman in energy-related fields for the \n     solution. Do not listen to those who do not know what they \n     are talking about. I have grown up in the `hub' city for the \n     Idaho National Lab and have full faith that if you let the \n     men and women who work there, and similar places throughout \n     the country, ``attack'' the energy problems that they can and \n     will solve the problems promptly and efficiently; they have \n     the ability, so please just give them the funding, \n     initiative, and faith to get the job done!\n       As for how energy prices affect Idahoans differently than \n     the majority of the country is that everything here is so \n     spread out. A trip to the next town can be 60 miles, and the \n     only way to travel is by vehicle. Also, in our area, many \n     people drive trucks, but, unlike other areas, the people who \n     drive those type of vehicles here do so because they have to, \n     meaning it is central to their business, which maybe hard to \n     imagine for those who are used to riding in taxis and subways \n     but is absolutely true.\n       Thank you, Senator Crapo; out of all of our politicians, I \n     feel like you are actually trying to do good for the country!\n     Bobby, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator: In all of your e-mails on this subject of energy, \n     I have yet to read about any active support for the trillion \n     or so recoverable BBIs of oil that are locked up in shale in \n     the Green River area. It was approved for some exploration, \n     and then it disappeared off of the energy screen.\n       Why are we not doing anything or very little in the way of \n     federal support for the source? I believe that one of the oil \n     companies developed a method for extraction in situ which \n     gets rid of the problem of shale exploding like popcorn when \n     it is mined and retorted. This source was explored in the \n     seventies and was found to have been economical to produce \n     until oil went back to 10-15 a barrel after the last crisis.\n     Ken, Sandpoint.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: As an answer about how the price of gas \n     affects here in Oldtown, you might say we are in the center \n     of being anywhere. Any major shopping that my wife and I want \n     to do, we must travel a minimum of 50 miles, to either \n     Spokane, Washington, or to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Using my \n     wife's car for those trips is no great hardship, but still I \n     am out at least 20 dollars for fuel. If it is something I \n     need to haul and drive my pickup, I can figure, about $50 for \n     the round trip. All well and good about getting a more fuel-\n     efficient vehicle, but being retired and living on my SS, \n     puts a crimp on any major purchases.\n     Ross, Oldtown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6933-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6933-S6934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING NELSON MANDELA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to recognize a man \nwhose work has touched so many people in Africa and beyond, and whose \nlife has demonstrated the power of transformation. Tomorrow, former \nSouth African President Nelson Mandela will celebrate his 90th birthday \nand I would like to send him my very best wishes.\n  As I have traveled across Africa, I have witnessed the respect \nMandela commands and the pride he evokes in all Africans, across \nborders and boundaries. It is nearly unmatched. He is a symbol of the \nenduring truth that even the most intractable systems of repression and \nviolence can be overcome with courage and persistence.\n  The lessons of Mandela's leadership are made that much more \nremarkable when juxtaposed with another African liberation leader, \nRobert Mugabe. Upon being released from jail after 27 years, Mandela \nchose to pursue a path of reconciliation rather than retaliation. When \nhe became President in 1994, he continued that approach and worked to \nunite the country around his vision of a ``rainbow nation.'' After one \nterm, he stepped aside as President, realizing that institutions must \ntake precedence over individuals in building a stable democracy. Though \nSouth Africa certainly had its share of problems since--including a \nskyrocketing rate of HIV, increasing political turmoil and a recent \nwave of xenophobic attacks against immigrants--Mandela continues to be \na voice for peace and stability, a voice of and for all people of South \nAfrica. The contrast with the continued bloodshed and repression in \nneighboring, Zimbabwe is stark.\n  President Mandela's vision for South Africa not only sought peace \nwithin its borders, but also beyond them. In 1993, he famously said \nthat human rights would be ``the light that guides our foreign \naffairs.'' After leaving office, Mandela continued to embody that \nvision in South Africa and across the continent as he focused on \nbuilding support for this critical principle--whether with civil \nsociety groups or government officials. He has been actively involved \nin peace processes around the world and a leading advocate for global \naction to address HIV/AIDS. His willingness to speak out against \ninjustice wherever it festers has inspired and challenged all of us.\n  I am gravely concerned that the current South African leadership is \nmoving away from this vision. Its unwillingness to publicly criticize \nrecent abuses in Zimbabwe or allow for an expanded mediation is \nundermining pressure on the Mugabe regime to accept a transitional \ngovernment. In addition, the announcement by the South African \nGovernment that it will oppose the International Criminal Court's \nindictment of Sudanese President Al-Bashir is deeply disappointing. I \nhave deep respect for the leadership South Africa demonstrates on the \ncontinent and that is precisely why I challenge its leaders to play a \nmore active and constructive role in efforts to promote peace, \nsecurity, and democracy.\n  Mandela's legacy challenges not only South Africa, but all of us who \ncare about the future of Africa. There is a tendency to look for easy \nanswers or quick fixes to the challenges facing the continent today. \nMandela's life is testament to the reality that sustainable peace and \ndemocracy require continued investment and long-term vision. They\n\n[[Page S6934]]\n\nare not static and cannot be taken for granted. As we celebrate his \n90th birthday tomorrow, I hope we will take seriously that challenge \nand commit ourselves to the hard work of standing up for freedom and \njustice. For the people of Sudan, Zimbabwe and so many other parts of \nthe world, the stakes have never been higher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6934-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF DON MITCHELL\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, you and I and all of our colleagues \nknow that the Senate could not function without the superb work of the \nSenate staff. These dedicated men and women work day in and day out, \noften logging long hours, working under pressure, and performing \nextremely sensitive jobs, not for high pay, but because of their \ndedication to their country.\n  All of these individuals deserve our praise and our thanks. But \noccasionally one of them deserves to be singled out. Today I rise to \npay tribute to one such individual, Mr. Don Mitchell, professional \nstaff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Don is retiring soon after 24 years of government service, 22 of them \nhere in the Senate. In 1984, the same year I was first elected to the \nSenate, Don began his career as a legislative assistant for national \nsecurity in the office of his home State Senator, John Glenn. In 1989, \nSenator Glenn moved Don to the staff of the Intelligence Committee. His \nassociation with Senator Glenn and the committee lasted until 1999 when \nDon left to become Director of Intelligence Programs for the National \nSecurity Council.\n  After spending 2 years at the National Security Council, the \nIntelligence Committee was lucky enough to lure Don back to the \ncommittee staff. And I have been fortunate that he has stayed \nthroughout my tenure on the committee.\n  While on the committee, Don has worked on a wide range of issues. He \nhas handled the budgets of the FBI, and the Departments of State, \nEnergy and Treasury and he has been responsible for counter \nintelligence programs. In addition to Senator Glenn he provided liaison \nsupport to Senators Richard Bryan and Dick Durbin. For the past few \nyears he has overseen all covert action activities, the most sensitive \nprograms within the intelligence community.\n  Throughout this time, Don has done his job with a professionalism \nthat has earned the respect of his colleagues and Members on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  While Don's professional accomplishments are impressive, they are far \nfrom the sum of who Don is. Don is an accomplished author, having \npublished works on one of his political heroes, Adlai Stevenson, and \nmost recent, a biography of his first boss, Senator Glenn.\n  Don's true passion though is his family. His wife Grace, his son \nLogan, and his daughter Ella know well of his devotion to them. They \nalso know of his dedication to his work here in the Senate, having \nsupported him for so many years and having endured the many late nights \nand weekends he has sacrificed for the Senate.\n  Don is the type of staffer who does not seek glory or recognition for \nhimself. He does not look for ways to insert himself into issues in \norder to be noticed. He knows what is important and he works toward \nthat goal. He shuns the limelight, but he has made deep and lasting \ncontributions to the process of intelligence oversight. His steady \npresence, his solid advice, and his devastating wit will be missed.\n  I wish him well in his coming endeavors and hope that our paths cross \nagain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6934-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BROIN FAMILY GENEROSITY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the Todd \nand Linda Broin family of Sioux Falls, SD, and applaud their \ngenerosity. Through a charitable gift to the Sanford Project, the \nBroins have made a major contribution in the global effort to cure type \n1 diabetes.\n  The Sanford Project, an initiative of one of South Dakota's health \ncare systems, seeks to focus research efforts on one critical health \ncare issue with the goal of making significant process toward curing or \notherwise eliminating the disease. Last month, Sanford Project leaders \nannounced their focus on curing type 1 diabetes, with a specific \nemphasis on beta cell regeneration.\n  Type 1 diabetes, also called juvenile diabetes, is a severe disease \nwith no known cause or cure that affects nearly 3 million Americans and \ntheir families. Linda Broin's own experience with type 1 diabetes, \nstemming from her diagnosis with the disease at age 12, makes this \ncontribution all the more personal, and inspirational. The Broins' \ngenerosity will allow for the establishment of the Todd and Linda \nBroin, chair, of the Sanford Project, and their gift will be used to \nsupport the salary and related expenses of the person who leads the \ncampaign to cure type 1 diabetes. I am extremely pleased the Sanford \nProject is dedicating health research resources to cure type 1 \ndiabetes, and, like so many others, I am grateful that the Broins' gift \nwill advance the recruitment of top researchers to lead this project.\n  Diabetes is a severe disease that can result in a range of \ndisabilities, including blindness, amputations, and kidney failure. \nGiven the cost of diabetes not only to Americans' health, but also to \nour personal finances and our economy, it is clear that funding for \ndiabetes research and prevention needs to be a priority. Biomedical \nresearch is the key to solving unanswered questions regarding this \ndisease and holds the potential to impact millions of lives. While \ngovernment funding clearly plays an important role in fueling research, \nthe Broins' private contribution provides vital flexibility and garners \neven greater interest for the project.\n  I am pleased the Sanford Project's efforts have been amplified and I \ncommend the Broin family's generosity in their gift and efforts to \nincrease awareness about this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6934-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6934-S6935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PHIL ROBBINS\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to remember the life of \nPhilip Austin Robbins III, of Kodiak, AK.\n  Phil was born on June 28, 1943, in Anacortes, WA, where he spent his \nyouth. After graduating from high school, he set out on an adventure \nthat would take him around the globe. With little money, Phil \nhitchhiked, took odd jobs, slept where he could find shelter, enjoyed \nthe hospitality of strangers, and made many new friends, as he traveled \nthrough Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.\n  Upon returning home, Phil was drafted into service during the Vietnam \nwar. As fate would have it, though, he was not sent to Vietnam but \ninstead stationed in Heidelberg, Germany, where he worked as a code-\nbreaker in the U.S. Army.\n  After serving in the Army, Phil lived for a few years in Makaha, HI. \nHe attended the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, and married Lisa \nGayle Tatsumi.\n  Not long after this, Phil would embark on another adventure, moving \nwith his wife and newborn son to Kodiak Island in Alaska. Here, the \nyoung family would live in a log cabin in the woods of Island Lake, and \nPhil would pursue a career as a commercial fisherman. It was a career \nthat would span 40 years. During this time, Phil would see firsthand \nthe boom and bust of the lucrative Kodiak king crab industry from the \n1960s to the early 1980s as well as the recordbreaking salmon prices of \nthe late 1980s. He would participate in the cleanup efforts that \nfollowed the disastrous Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 and the frantic \nderby-style halibut seasons that were phased out in the 1990s. Phil was \none of the pioneers of the potcod fishery in Kodiak. Cod fishing had \npreviously been dominated by large trawlers. Over the years, Phil saw \nfortunes made and friends perish in dangerous waters. He owned three \nfishing boats at different times during his career, all of which he \nnamed the ``Lisa Gayle'' after his wife.\n  Phil had a tireless work ethic, a great sense of humor, and a warm \nheart. He was a modest man and the last to expect his life story would \nbe told on the floor of the U.S. Senate. His bold spirit is emblematic \nof that of many Alaskans who come to our State with big dreams and a \ntaste for adventure.\n\n[[Page S6935]]\n\n  Phil lost his battle to cancer earlier this month at the age of 65. \nHe is survived by his loving wife Lisa and proud sons Philip Junior and \nMark. Philip Junior is a computer engineer and Mark, a member of my \nstaff.\n  May you find calm seas and beautiful new horizons, Phil. You will be \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6935-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6935-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6935-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:00 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 415.

A bill to provide funding for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, and to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \ndeny the deduction for income attributable to domestic production of \noil, gas, or primary products thereof for major integrated oil \ncompanies; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GREGG. I want to talk about the specific reason I have come to \nthe floor, which is to talk about the fear, quite honestly, in colder \nStates in this country about how we are going to get through the \nwinter. The price of home heating oil, which is the dominant form of \nenergy in our State, the way people keep their houses warm and \nhabitable in the winter, has tripled. People who are working for a \nliving, and low-income individuals, have no idea how they are going to \nmeet the cost of their energy bill this winter. It is going to \noverwhelm us as a region. We need to do something about it. There are a \ncouple of levels where we need to act. We do need to increase \nsignificantly the funding for low-income energy assistance. This is a \ncrisis. The simple fact is we should increase that funding.\n  At the same time, we do need to do that in a responsible way, by \npaying for that increase in funding so we do not end up putting the \ncost of buying energy to heat homes today on our children and our \nchildren's children tomorrow. That is not fair to them. So we ought to \ncome forward with a proposal. What I am going to do today is introduce \na bill which increases home heating oil assistance by $2.5 billion, \nwhich will double that program, but pays for it in a reasonable way, \nessentially by repealing the section 199 regulation that gives certain \ndeductions to energy production companies which they no longer need \nwith oil being at $130 a barrel.\n  It is a significant increase in funding. It is a level that Senator \nSanders has introduced in a bill, freestanding, that is not paid for, \nwhich I have also cosponsored, because I hope when that bill comes \nforward, I will be able to offer my pay-fors to it. But it is the \nnumber we need and we clearly have to have in order to have any chance \nthis winter of making sure that low-income people in New Hampshire and \nthroughout the Northeast and the country can survive this winter in a \nreasonable way.\n  Secondly, we need to address the issue of middle-income Americans, \npeople in New Hampshire who are working for a living and who do not \nmeet these low-income thresholds, who have an equal amount of fear \nabout how they are going to pay for the energy to heat their home, when \nthey see the cost of their energy bill double or triple or maybe even \nquadruple.\n  I hope to have next week a tax credit that will be available to those \nworking families who are of moderate income, who have an income which \nthey cannot adjust enough in order to be able to absorb the huge cost \nof this event of the runup in the cost of energy. I hope to be able to \nintroduce that in the near future. But today I am introducing this \nbill, which increases home heating assistance, the LIHEAP program, by \n$2.5 billion and pays for it, which is the responsible way to do it. In \naddition, I am strongly supporting Senate initiatives which will \nincrease our commitment to the production as a nation and conservation. \nBecause by doing that, we will draw down, we will significantly reduce \nthe price of gasoline and the price of oil in our country. Because that \nspeculation, which is legitimate, which is based off the projected \ndemands and the lack of supply, will adjust to the fact that greater \nsupply is going to come into the market. That will reduce the forces \nwhich are forcing the price demands up and as a result have a positive \nimpact on reducing the cost of a barrel of oil.\n  We need to do a lot around here. We do need to address speculation \nwhen it is there and when it is inappropriate and when it is driving up \nthe price in an arbitrary and unfair way. We also need to address the \nissue of more production and create more production. We are looking for \nenergy where we can do it safely and energy efficiently and also in an \nenvironmentally sound way, such as offshore or with oil shale.\n  We have more oil shale reserves than Saudi Arabia--three times Saudi \nArabia's reserves we have in three States: Wyoming, Idaho, and \nColorado. And we should not be sending our hard-earned money to \ncountries, which in many instances do not even like us to purchase \ntheir oil products. We should be buying it here in the United States \nwhere we can produce it. In addition, of course, we need to \naggressively pursue a course of conservation and renewables.\n  I wish to note that the title of this bill is the Home Energy \nAssistance Today Act, or HEAT. Obviously, the purpose of this bill is \nto make it possible for citizens throughout the country, but especially \nin New England, who are of low income, to be able to heat their homes \nthis winter and to afford the cost of the energy it takes to heat their \nhomes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 3280. A bill to increase refining capacity and the supply of fuel, \nto open and preserve access to oil and gas, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am introducing two pieces of legislation \ntoday, S. 3280 and S. 3281. In one bill I join with my colleagues in \nproposing legislation to open new development in ANWR, offshore, the \nRocky Mountain oil shale, and preserves access to development in the \nCanadian tar sands. It also contains my Gas PRICE Act, which \nstreamlines, implements deadlines, and offers EDA grants to communities \nto encourage development of refineries involved in coal liquification \nor coal to liquids processing, renewable fuels, and crude oil and other \npetroleum products. It also includes accelerated depreciation for \ncellulosic biofuel plant property for facilities and equipment used to \nproduce switchgrass and other dedicated energy crop seed for the \ndeveloping cellolosic biofuels industry. Finally, it includes a third \ntitle which I am also introducing as a free standing bill, the Drive \nAmerica on Natural Gas Act.\n  The Drive America on Natural Gas Act expands RFS Definitions.\n  The bill expands the definition in the Renewable Fuels Standard to \nallow the use of CNG and LNG fuels to meet the mandates.\n  The current corn based ethanol mandate is overly aggressive with \nmounting questions surrounding ethanol's effects on world food prices, \nlivestock feed prices, its economic sustainability, its transportation \nand infrastructure needs, its water usage, and numerous other \nenvironmental issues.\n  By broadening the scope of the Renewable Fuels Standard to include \nnatural gas, we encourage the use of a proven, clean, and economical \nalternative fuel and also make the current RFS mandates achievable.\n  Additionally, it sends a signal to the Nation's automakers and fuels \nindustries that natural gas is a competitive option as a mainstream \ntransportation fuel.\n  GM, Ford, and Chrysler already make natural gas powered vehicles, yet \nthey don't sell them in the States. GM alone already makes 18 different \nNGV models. But, Honda is the only current manufacturer which sells a \nnatural gas vehicle in America--the Honda Civic GX.\n  Broadening the RFS will encourage more auto manufacturers to sell \nthese vehicles domestically which will help our struggling auto \nmanufacturing industry.\n  The bill broadens the Alternative Vehicle Tax Credit to include bi-\nfuel vehicles.\n  Currently only ``dedicated'' vehicles or vehicles which solely run on \nnatural gas qualify for this credit. This narrow definition actually \ndiscourages the sale of bi-fuel vehicles--those which can run on both \nconventional fuels and natural gas fuels.\n  Americans need the flexibility to use conventional gasoline as a \nback-up if there are no natural gas refueling stations in a given area.\n  By encouraging bi-fuel natural gas vehicles, less gasoline and diesel \nwould be consumed. How?\n  Today, the largest hurdle facing the NGV industry is the lack of \nnatural gas refueling stations available to the public. However, a \ndevice is now manufactured and sold, called the Phill, which allows a \nperson to fill up their natural gas powered cars at home.\n  Installed in one's garage, the Phill is connected to a home's natural \ngas line.\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\nOnce plugged into a CNG car, it slowly compresses natural gas into the \ncar's tank.\n  Similar to the idea of plug-in hybrids, the Phill allows consumers to \nrefuel at home. Unlike plug-in hybrids, this technology is not a few \nyears away--it is here today.\n  By encouraging bi-fuel vehicles, more Americans will be comfortable \npurchasing natural gas powered cars which can also run on conventional \ngasoline for that occasional long distance trip from home.\n  Expanding the Alternative Vehicle Tax Credit to include bi-fuels will \ngreatly incentivize the use of NGV's and give consumers the flexibility \nthey require.\n  The bill establishes a Natural Gas Vehicle Research, Development, and \nDemonstration program.\n  Several years ago, the Department of Energy had a robust Natural Gas \nVehicle Research Development and Demonstration program. This bill once \nagain establishes that program to research, improve and develop the use \nof natural gas engines and vehicles.\n  The program will assist manufacturers in emissions certification, \nwill develop and improve nationally recognized safety codes and \nstandards, will examine and improve the reliability and efficiency of \nnatural gas fueling station infrastructure, and will study the use of \nnatural gas engines in hybrid vehicles.\n  Additionally, it requires the Department of Energy and the EPA to \ncoordinate with the private sector to carry out the program.\n  The bill directs the EPA to establish a State demonstration program \nto streamline the regulations and certifications currently required for \nthe conversion of vehicles to natural gas.\n  Today's regulatory burdens are daunting for those in the business of \nconverting vehicles to run on CNG or LNG. Currently, the EPA imposes \nvirtually the same certification requirements on NGV aftermarket \nconversion systems as they require on automakers.\n  Since NGV systems are inherently cleaner than gasoline systems, these \nregulations impose huge unnecessary costs on these conversion system \nmakers.\n  This bill directs EPA to establish a State demonstration program to \nstreamline the current certification process for NGV conversions. It \nalso directs EPA to waive unnecessary requirements for the continual \nrecertification of conversion kits and to waive emission certification \nfor conversion of older vehicles.\n  Most importantly, the Drive America on Natural Gas Act doesn't \ndictate that consumers, businesses, or States must use natural gas as a \ntransportation fuel.\n  To the contrary, this bill actually adds more flexibility to the \ncurrent RFS mandates.\n  It removes the disincentives for auto manufacturers to produce bi-\nfuel vehicles.\n  It streamlines and eliminates the government bureaucracy and red tape \non the conversion of vehicles to operate on natural gas.\n  The Drive America on Natural Gas Act will allow natural gas to \ncompete on its own merits. Americans can ultimately choose whether \nnatural gas powered vehicles are right for their own individual and \nbusiness needs.\n  The promise of natural gas as a mainstream transportation fuel is \nachievable today, not 15 or 20 years from now.\n  Currently, over 25 different manufacturers produce nearly 100 models \nof light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and engines for the U.S. \nmarket. However, only Honda sells a domestically available CNG car.\n  Over 10,000 transit buses in the U.S. are natural gas powered and the \nmarket is growing; nearly one-in-five new transit buses on order is \nspecified to be natural gas powered.\n  There are over 7.5 million NGVs on the road worldwide--more than \ndouble the number in 2003. The International Association of NGVs \nforecasts that, by 2020, there will be 65 million NGVs worldwide.\n  In April, the Department of Energy reported that the average \nnationwide price of a gallon of gas equivalent of CNG was just $2.04 \nper gallon.\n  In some regions of the country prices are even lower--CNG costs in \nRocky Mountain states average just a $1.26 per gallon.\n  Many state and local governments, businesses, and consumers have cut \ntheir fuel bills by more than half when utilizing natural gas as a \ntransportation fuel.\n  In my hometown of Tulsa, OK a person can refuel their CNG powered \ncars for just 90 cents per gallon. Regular gas currently costs $3.95. \nThat's more than a $3 savings per gallon.\n  Just last month I was pleased to visit Tom Sewall of Tulsa Natural \nGas Technologies, Inc. As a small business owner who installs natural \ngas refueling stations, he is one of the most knowledgeable and vocal \nleaders in this growing industry.\n  America has a huge natural gas supply base. In 13 of the last 14 \nyears, the amount of new natural gas discovered in the U.S. has \nexceeded the amount that has been extracted.\n  Raymond James Equity Research recently reported a ``bearish outlook \nfor U.S. natural gas prices.'' After examining the future supply of \ndomestic production, they released a May 19, 2008 energy report which \nconcluded ``we continue to see unprecedented growth in U.S. gas \nproduction that will eventually overwhelm the U.S. gas markets.''\n  Thanks to advancements in oil and gas exploration, drilling, and \nproduction technologies, America is producing huge amounts of natural \ngas from tight shales, coalbed methane and tight gas plays, in areas \nsuch as: The Barnett Shale in North Central Texas; the Marcellus and \nHuron Shales, which run through West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and \nNew York; the Haynesville Shale in Northwest Louisiana; the \nFayetteville Shale in central Arkansas; the Woodford Shale in southern \nOklahoma; the Pinedale Anticline and Jonah field in Wyoming; and the \nSan Juan Basin CoalBed Methane play in northern New Mexico.\n  These and numerous other emerging gas plays promise to deliver \ndecades of abundant domestic natural gas supply.\n  From compressed natural gas--CNG--powered cars, to 18-wheelers \nrunning on liquefied natural gas--LNG--no other commercially viable \nfuel burns cleaner.\n  The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy has rated the \nnatural gas powered Honda Civic GX as ``America's Greenest Car'' for \nthe past 5 consecutive years--even greener than any available hybrid.\n  On a well-to-wheels basis, NGVs produce 22 percent less greenhouse \ngas than comparable diesel vehicles and 29 percent less than gasoline \nvehicles.\n  In 2007, NGVs displaced 250 million gallons of petroleum in the U.S. \nIn the next 17 years, the industry's goal is to grow that to 10 billion \ngallons.\n  NGVs are the pathway to a hydrogen transportation system. Every NGV \nfueling station is a potential hydrogen fueling station. Every auto \ngarage or maintenance facility that has been made NGV-compatible can \nquickly and cheaply be made hydrogen-compatible.\n  The medium-germ solution to today's gas price crisis is to explore \nand produce oil from ANWR, the Outer Continental Shelf, the Rocky \nMountain oil shales, and preserve our access to the Canadian oil sands. \nThat is why my comprehensive bill includes opening all these areas for \nexploration, along with a program to increase our refining capacity.\n  But, in the mean time the best way to bring down the price at the \npump immediately is to pass this bill and run more cars on natural gas. \nOf course, the democrats have objected to increasing supplies of oil \nand gas for decades. They don't want more supply. There should be no \nobjection from the democrats, and frankly I cannot think of any \njustification for opposing my Drive America on Natural Gas Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 3285. A bill to ensure that, for each small business participating \nin the 8(a) business development program that was affected by Hurricane \nKatrina of 2005 or Hurricane Rita of 2005, the period in which it can \nparticipate is extended by 24 months; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on \nbehalf of some of our most in need gulf coast residents. Everyone \naround the country is familiar with the impact of Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita on the New Orleans area and the southwest\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\npart of our State. Images from the devastation following these storms, \nand the subsequent Federal levee breaks, were transmitted around the \ncountry and around the world. This is because Katrina was the deadliest \nnatural disaster in United States history, with 1,800 people killed--\n1,500 alone in Louisiana. Katrina was also the costliest natural \ndisaster in United States history with over $81.2 billion in damage.\n  Everyone is familiar with the images and the cost, but they may not \nbe too familiar with the impact on individual businesses. In \nparticular, I am speaking about the affects of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita on minority firms in the gulf coast. As a result of these storms, \nmany minority firms in the gulf coast were disrupted and thus lost \nvaluable time for participating in the 8(a) program. The 8(a) business \ndevelopment initiative, created under the Small Business \nAdministration, helps minority entrepreneurs access Federal contracts \nand allows companies to be certified for increments of 3 years. These \ncontracts are vital to the revival of these impacted areas. However, as \ncurrently structured the program allows businesses to participate for a \nlimited length of time, 9 years, after which they can never reapply nor \nget back into the program. It is imperative that we provide contracting \nassistance to our local minority businesses.\n  Today I am proud to sponsor legislation that will help these \nbusinesses recover from the effects of these storms. This bill, the \nDisadvantaged Business Disaster Eligibility Act would tackle this \nproblem in three important ways. First, the bill extends 8(a) \neligibility for program participants in Katrina/Rita-impacted areas in \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama by 24 months. Next, the bill would \napply to any areas in the state of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama \nthat have been designated by the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration as a disaster area as a result of Hurricanes Katrina or \nRita. Lastly, the bill would require the Administrator of the Small \nBusiness Administration to ensure that every small business \nparticipating in the 8(a) program before the date of enactment of the \nact is reviewed and brought into compliance with this Act. This \nrequirement would ensure that any eligible previous 8(a) participants \nwill be allowed back into the program. As such, these key provisions \nwould ensure that these businesses continue to play a vital role in \nrebuilding their communities. I note that a similar bill has already \npassed the House of Representatives, with the strong support of the \nLouisiana House delegation. I would note though that my legislation \ndiffers from the House-passed bill in that my bill also covers \nbusinesses impacted by Hurricane Rita. While I support the House-passed \nbill, I feel that we must also cover businesses impacted by Hurricane \nRita--particularly those in southwest Louisiana. For this and other \nreasons, I look forward to championing this bill here in the Senate.\n  Although recovery has been slow, it is my belief that great progress \nbrings great change. The Small Business Administration has come a long \nway in correcting its failed practices. Congress recently stepped up \nand enacted wide-ranging SBA disaster reforms as part of the Farm Bill. \nI note that many of these reforms, such as the increases in loan limits \nand collateral requirements, were immediately helpful to disaster \nvictims in the Midwest. It is my sincere hope that we can keep up this \nmomentum by also passing the Disadvantaged Business Disaster \nEligibility Act. To these ends, I will work with my colleagues on the \nSenate Small Business Committee, including Senators Kerry and Snowe, \nrespectively chair and ranking member of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3285\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EXTENSION OF PARTICIPATION TERM FOR VICTIMS OF \n                   HURRICANE KATRINA OR HURRICANE RITA.\n\n       (a) Retroactivity.--If a small business concern (within the \n     meaning given that term in section 3 of the Small Business \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 632)), while participating in any program or \n     activity under the authority of paragraph (10) of section \n     7(j) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(j)), was \n     located in a parish or county described in subsection (b) of \n     this section and was affected by Hurricane Katrina of 2005 or \n     Hurricane Rita of 2005, the period during which that small \n     business concern is permitted continuing participation and \n     eligibility in that program or activity shall be extended for \n     24 months after the date such participation and eligibility \n     would otherwise terminate.\n       (b) Parishes and Counties Covered.--Subsection (a) applies \n     to any parish in the State of Louisiana, or any county in the \n     State of Mississippi or in the State of Alabama, that has \n     been designated by the Administrator of the Small Business \n     Administration as a disaster area by reason of Hurricane \n     Katrina of 2005 or Hurricane Rita of 2005 under disaster \n     declaration 10176, 10177, 10178, 10179, 10180, 10181, 10205, \n     or 10206.\n       (c) Review and Compliance.--The Administrator of the Small \n     Business Administration shall ensure that the case of every \n     small business concern participating before the date of \n     enactment of this Act in a program or activity covered by \n     subsection (a) is reviewed and brought into compliance with \n     this section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 3287. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to establish a \nnational usury rate for consumer credit transactions; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Protecting \nConsumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act. The bill establishes a \nFederal usury cap of 36 percent on all consumer credit transactions, in \nan effort to eliminate the unconscionable interest rates that some \nconsumers have been charged for payday loans, car title loans, and \nother forms of credit.\n  The bill protects all borrowers by establishing the same annual \npercentage rate cap already in place for military personnel and their \nfamilies. That rate is similar to the usury caps already enacted in \nmany states.\n  Specifically, the bill establishes a maximum interest rate of 36 \npercent on all consumer credit transactions, taking into account all \ninterest, fees, defaults, and other finance charges.\n  The bill clarifies that this cap does not preempt any stricter State \nlaws.\n  It applies civil penalties for violations, including nullification of \nthe transaction, fines, and prison.\n  It empowers attorneys general to take action for up to three years \nafter a violation.\n  Previous attempts to curb payday lending have often been evaded due \nto the challenges of defining what constitutes a predatory loan. This \nbill overcomes this challenge by setting a relatively high interest \nrate as the cap, and then applying that cap to all credit transactions \nof any kind.\n  With the economy in decline and consumer debt skyrocketing, it is \nvitally important that strong protections against predatory lending be \nenacted to protect consumers against unscrupulous lenders. The \nfinancial security of many working families depends on it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3287\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Consumers from \n     Unreasonable Credit Rates Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 44. A joint resolution providing for congressional \ndisapproval under chapter 8 of ``title 5, United States Code, of the \nrule set forth as requirements contained in the August 17, 2007, letter \nto State Health Officials from the Director of the Center for Medicaid \nand State Operations in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \nand the State Health Official Letter 08-003, dated May 7, 2008, from \nsuch Center; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I rise in solidarity with the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus, as well as Senator Snowe, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Menendez, and many others, to wit, 41 other people \nwho are cosponsores, and to introduce a resolution of disapproval, that \nis the name on it, of the August 17 CHIP directive.\n  The directive jeopardizes health care coverage for hundreds of \nthousands of children, which is reason enough to nullify the August 17 \ndirective. But it also undermines the authority and the prerogatives of \nthe legislative branch of Government.\n  I would caution those who would otherwise vote against this to think \nabout the precedence for the future and the next administration. We \nhave not been treated well. It is not necessary that we will be treated \nwell or with proper respect in the next administration. We need to \nexert our privileges where they are legitimate. It is further evidence \nof this administration's, in my regard, this Senator's regard, blatant \ndisregard for the rule of law.\n  As many of my colleagues may remember, on August 17, 2007, I referred \nto it as a domestic health care day of infamy, the Center for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services, otherwise known as CMS, issued a ``guidance \nletter'' to the States, ostensibly to clarify existing policies and \nrequirements for States seeking to expand the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, otherwise known as CHIP, coverage to more children, \nwhich is what we are meant to be doing here.\n  However, the practical effect of the letter will be to drastically \nincrease the number of uninsured children, children who should \nrightfully be covered by CHIP and who otherwise could benefit from the \nprogram. The directive has already taken a substantial toll on State \ncoverage initiatives for uninsured children. Since it was issued, the \ndirective has caused a diverse array of States, including Indiana, \nLouisiana, Ohio, and Oklahoma, that had planned to provide affordable \ncoverage options for uninsured children through CHIP or Medicaid, in \nfact, to delay or scale back, or State fund their initiatives, if they \ncan afford to so do.\n  As a result, tens of thousands of children have already missed out on \ncoverage. By August, the directive will affect at least 22 States, \nincluding my own State of West Virginia. Hundreds of thousands of \nchildren, in red and blue States alike, will lose coverage immediately, \nif this directive goes into effect.\n  The directive goes directly against the will of the Congress. It was \nan act by a Cabinet officer or one of his minions, and it is not legal.\n  In addition to harming innocent children, the August 17 directive \nalso undermines congressional authority. I am very sensitive about that \nafter these last 7\\1/2\\ years. In 1996, Congress passed what is called \nthe Congressional Review Act, to protect the integrity of the \nlegislative branch from the whims of Federal agencies or midlevel \nbureaucrats or upper level bureaucrats. The Congressional Review Act \nrequires Federal agencies--requires Federal agencies--to submit any \nrules covered by the act to Congress and the Comptroller General of the \nUnited States before that rule can take affect. Both the Congressional \nResearch Service and the Government Accountability Office have \ndetermined that the August 17 CHIP directive constitutes a rule--a \nrule--as defined in the Congressional Review Act.\n  Therefore, CMS has to submit the August 17 rule to each House of \nCongress and the Comptroller General before it can take effect. We are \nexactly 1 month from implementation of this harmful policy, and CMS has \nrepeatedly failed to comply with the statutory requirements of the \nCongressional Review Act.\n  It is an outrage. It is embarrassing. It is pathetic policy, damaging \npolicy to innocent children who do not start wars and only need to \nstart off in life healthy. If CMS is so convinced that the policy is \njustifiable, then they should take the required steps suggested by the \nGAO and the CRS in their review and abide by the law.\n  Not all my colleagues may agree with me on the substance of this \nissue. Some may believe that the August 17 policy CMS put forth in this \nguidance letter is perfectly acceptable. That is fine. That is up to \nthem. On that we disagree.\n  But we should all be able to agree--in fact, we have no choice but to \nagree, all of us--that CMS violated the proper process required by law. \nThey did not submit to the proper agencies or to the Congress what they \nintended to do surreptitiously and devastatingly.\n  If you respect Congress, as an institution, which I know all my \ncolleagues do, then I urge you to support this formal resolution of \ndisapproval. The health care coverage of millions of children depends \non what we do on this.\n  This is not a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. This is a motion of \ndisapproval and it will cause things to happen or to be ignored and it \nwill have consequences. But we can reverse the August 17 decision and \nallow children to get health insurance as the Congress intended if we \nsimply vote for this at the proper time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank you, and I commend the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, for his leadership in this matter.\n  I rise in strong support of the resolution that was introduced by \nmyself, Senators Rockefeller, Baucus, Menendez, Snowe, and others. Our \nresolution has a simple message: We have\n\n[[Page S6943]]\n\nto ensure that children across this country continue to get the health \ncare they presently carry.\n  The Bush administration is conducting an assault on their health \ninsurance. It is pitiful. Last year, the President and his supporters \nwent around Congress and issued a set of rules that would take this \ncritical health care coverage away from thousands of children across \nthis country.\n  In my State of New Jersey alone, 10,000 children are at risk of \nlosing their health insurance under this new Bush plan. Across this \ncountry, 250,000 children will be stripped of their health care, have \nit taken away from them.\n  In August, with nearly 50 million Americans without health insurance, \nthis administration has made a further decision to add tens of \nthousands more children to the ranks of the uninsured. It is almost \nimpossible to conceive.\n  Well, this resolution would put a stop to the dangerous plan. The \nBush administration's plan is not just morally bankrupt, it is, as we \nheard from Senator Rockefeller, according to the Government's watchdog \nagency, the GAO, the Government Accountability Office, a violation of \nFederal law. They are committing a violation of Federal law.\n  But, nevertheless, unless Congress acts, the President's plan is \ngoing to remove health insurance from these children in the next month. \nI have twice offered amendments in the Senate Appropriations Committee \non this issue. Both times in the full committee, both Democrats and \nRepublicans have gone on record to oppose President Bush's attempt to \ntake away children's health care.\n  It does not matter whether it is Republican or Democratic, it is the \nwrong thing to do at the wrong time in our society, when things are so \nuncertain for people, home ownership, jobs, living costs, gasoline \ncosts. This is not a very wise decision at any time, but during these \ntough economic times, the last thing we should do is take away health \ninsurance from our children.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up to this sustained and shameless \neffort to prevent children from seeing a doctor, getting medicine, \novercoming sickness, and to support this resolution.\n  Once again, I express my gratitude to the Senator from West Virginia, \nMr. Rockefeller, and his leadership and those who have joined in to \nsay: No, Mr. President, do not do this. It is unkind. It is unfair. It \nis illegal, according to the rules. Please, do not do it.\n  I ask my colleagues to stand and support our resolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I note a number of my colleagues are \non the floor to speak in favor of the resolution. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of the resolution be printed in the Record \nimmediately following all these statements on the resolution.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint-resolution was \nordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 44\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     disapproves the rule submitted by the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services relating to requirements set forth in the \n     State Health Official Letter 07-001, dated August 17, 2007, \n     issued by the Director of the Center for Medicaid and State \n     Operations in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n     and the State Health Official Letter 08-003, dated May 7, \n     2008, from such Center, requiring States that expand the \n     income eligibility level for children under the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) above 250 percent \n     of the Federal poverty level to adopt the 5 crowd-out \n     strategies described in the August 17, 2007, letter with the \n     components identified therein, and to provide certain \n     assurances described in such letter, and such rule shall have \n     no force or effect.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I wish to join my distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller, who has been a champion on this issue \nfrom its creation and continues to be a champion to preserve the health \ncare for some of the most vulnerable children in our society.\n  I appreciate his leadership, and I am privileged to join with him in \nthis effort along with Senator Baucus, the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee; my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, \nwho has tried time and time again through the appropriations process; \nSenator Snowe, who has been a champion on this issue as well. We \nunderstand the consequences.\n  Eleven months ago today, the Bush administration decided to \njeopardize health coverage for hundreds of thousands of children across \nthe country. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sent a \nletter to all State health officials announcing that 1 month from \ntoday, States will be pressured to cover a much narrower range of \nfamilies. They based their directive on an unfair financial standard \nthat would exclude hundreds of thousands of children in the most \ndifficult economic circumstances of our time. The result of that \ndirective would be unconscionable. It would mean hundreds of thousands \nof terrible stories--a child with diabetes that goes undiagnosed, a \nchild with a cleft palate she has to live with for the rest of her \nlife, missed tetanus shots, untreated allergies, asthma, and hundreds \nof thousands of small, painful situations that would add up to a wave \nof tragedy too immense to imagine.\n  Many of us in this Chamber decided we were not going to sit back and \nwatch this happen. We sent letters. We introduced legislation. We \nshouted as loudly as we could. But the President did his best to ignore \nus and keep his back turned on these children.\n  In 1 month, this unbelievably harmful rule is set to come into \neffect. In 1 month, States will have to overcome seemingly \ninsurmountable hurdles if they want to cover children above 250 percent \nof the poverty level. In 1 month, the strength of our values will be \nseriously called into question.\n  If it weren't for this program, these children would fall between the \ncracks. They are not in dire enough poverty to qualify for Medicaid, \nbut their working parents still don't have enough to afford private \ncoverage. The families we seek to cover work hard every day, in some of \nthe toughest jobs, but they work at jobs that offer no health care. \nThese families certainly don't make enough money to afford private \ncoverage. The State Children's Health Insurance Program is their last \nresort. That is why I am still shocked at the nerve of this \nadministration when they unilaterally issued this harmful, coldhearted \ndirective on children's health. Where are those values I have heard the \nadministration talk about? This really boils down to a different set of \npriorities. It is yet another example of placing some of the wealthiest \nabove our working families.\n  If the President's directive takes effect, he is effectively saying \ntough luck to these families; go ahead and roll the dice with your \ndaughter's health care. Let's think about what that says about our \nvalues. That kind of sentiment is completely out of line.\n  But that is not the only reason this directive should be overturned. \nThe directive is not just a violation of our values, it is a violation \nof the law. The administration bypassed Congress and violated the \nCongressional Review Act when issuing this directive. The Government \nAccountability Office and the Congressional Research Service have \nissued legal opinions stating as much. The opinions conclude that the \ndirective is not merely a clarification of existing SCHIP rules, as CMS \nhas maintained, but, rather, a marked departure from well-settled \npolicy that first should have been reviewed by Congress. That is why we \nare introducing this resolution of disapproval regarding the August 17 \nCHIP directive.\n  The President cannot be allowed to get away with this destructive \nbackdoor policy. If we can't convince him on moral grounds, if we can't \nmake him see the benefits of providing health care to children--and by \nthe way, in New Jersey we have letters from the administration that not \nonly gave us the authority to do this in the first place, to cover \nthese children, but then also lauded our program and said it should be \na model for the country; if it is a model for the country and you gave \nus the legal authority, how can you just take all those children off \nthe rolls--then we call him out on procedural grounds. And the \nadministration's procedure was, quite simply, illegal.\n  When this resolution passes into law, the August 17 directive will be \nnullified. That is my ultimate goal, to protect the health of our \nNation's children and, certainly, the many children in New Jersey \naffected by this directive. The goal we strive for should be to\n\n[[Page S6944]]\n\ncover more, not fewer, children. I believe we have a responsibility, a \nmoral, financial, and professional responsibility to ensure that in the \ngreatest country in the world, no child goes to bed at night without \nproper health care and treatment. That means we must provide them with \nhealth coverage. If we don't, what are these families supposed to do? \nIn these tough economic times, now more than ever, we need to support \nStates that offer options for affordable coverage to hard-working \nparents and their children.\n  It is not just the health of our Nation's children but the health of \nour values that is at stake. I hope our colleagues, when this \nresolution comes up for a vote, will give it an overwhelming level of \nsupport, and we will send the right set of messages as to our values as \nwell as how much we appreciate our children as the future of our \ncountry and the health that is associated with them that will be \nnecessary for them to achieve their God-given potential.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, Senator Rockefeller and I, along \nwith many of our colleagues, are introducing a joint resolution \ndisapproving of an administrative rule related to the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, known as CHIP. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the joint resolution.\n  I spent a lot of time talking about CHIP last year. We tried to \nexpand and improve the program, so that it could help millions more \nkids across America. I remain disappointed that the President vetoed \nboth of the reauthorization packages that Congress sent him. But I also \nremain committed to fighting for CHIP and the families whom it serves.\n  That is why I am here today. Last summer, while House and Senate \nDemocrats and Republicans were crafting reauthorization legislation, \nthe administration issued what is known as the August 17th CHIP \ndirective. The directive imposes significant new requirements on States \nwishing to expand eligibility for CHIP to kids from families with \nincomes above 250 percent of the Federal poverty line.\n  The directive was viewed as overly restrictive and severe. It imposes \nunrealistic hurdles on States wishing to cover more kids under CHIP. \nThe timing of the directive's release was seen as unfair, given that \nwork on reauthorization was well underway. The process surrounding \nissuance of the directive also caused concern. Congressional reaction \nto the directive was so negative that we included in the CHIP \nreauthorization legislation a more reasonable alternative policy that \nwould have supplanted the directive.\n  The administration issued the directive in the form of a letter to \nState health officials. While the administration has the authority to \nuse sub-regulatory letters for some things, it exceeded its authority \non August 17, 2007. The CHIP directive letter was actually a rule. And \nthe administration should have promulgated it as a rule. Both the \nGovernment Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service \ndetermined that the directive is a rule.\n  That the directive is a rule is significant, because of the \nCongressional Review Act. Congress passed the Congressional Review Act \nto protect and empower Congress. Congress meant for the law to keep \nCongress informed of the administrative rulemaking process. Congress \nmeant for the law to provide an opportunity for Congress to review \nrules before they take effect.\n  The Congressional Review Act requires an agency, prior to publishing \na rule, to submit a copy of the rule to both Houses of Congress and to \nthe Comptroller General. In this instance, the agency did not submit \nits rule to either House of Congress or to the Comptroller General. So \nCongress was deprived of its opportunity for review.\n  This was a violation of fair process. We should not tolerate it. \nMembers of Congress should stand up for themselves and the institution \nby supporting this joint resolution. The Congressional Review Act \nimposes specific obligations on agencies and vests Congress with \ncertain powers.\n  On August 17, 2007, one agency attempted to ignore its obligations \nand Congress. The agency attempted to circumvent the process \nestablished by the Congressional Review Act. And the agency should not \nbe rewarded.\n  Congress should disapprove of this rule because the substance is so \nover-reaching and detrimental to America's kids. And Congress should \nalso disapprove of this rule because it was issued in a way that was \ninconsistent with the law.\n  This resolution is a way to tell low-income American families that \nthey matter. This resolution is a way to say that Congress is willing \nto fight for them.\n  I know that my home State of Montana is trying to expand its \neligibility for CHIP. I support that effort. For me, this joint \nresolution is another way to show how important CHIP is to Montana's \nkids.\n  The resolution is also a way for Congress to send the message that it \nexpects agencies to comply with the law. Congress should stand up for \nitself and disapprove of this rule, because it was, not promulgated \nproperly.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of a joint \nresolution of which I am a cosponsor, the joint resolution disapproving \nthe rule requirements in the CMS letter that was sent in August of \n2007, sent on a Friday during recess. It earned the nickname ``the \nmidnight massacre'' because of the nature of the way that was sent. But \nI think a better way to describe this, in terms of the impact it has on \nchildren, is a ``thief in the night.''\n  What we are talking about is an effort by a Federal agency to deny \nhealth coverage for children under the guise of some bureaucratic \ninside-the-beltway rationale. What this directive does is set unfairly \nhigh bars for States, which the Federal Government knows they cannot \nreach, and is purposefully, I think, denying children health care. It \nalso sets a waiting period for children and their families in States. \nAt the same time, when the Federal Government makes all kinds of \naccommodations for the powerful, they let children and their families \nwait for health care coverage.\n  This directive bypassed Congress and violated the law. It excluded \nStates, and it is not any kind of clarification, as the administration \nhas asserted. Hundreds of thousands of children will lose their health \ninsurance coverage. Several States have already been affected. In my \nhome State of Pennsylvania at least--if not more--2,000 children will \nlose their health insurance coverage. It also undercuts an agreement in \nCongress to do something about this and to keep this Children's Health \nInsurance Program in place until March of 2009.\n  This is very simple. We are talking about children who are poor, who \ncome from poor families or middle-income families. Children's health \ninsurance is a program that works. We have had a decade of \nexperimentation. It works very well. It is efficient. It is effective. \nIt delivers health insurance for children, and there are a lot of \nfamilies out there, a lot of mothers out there, who can do everything \nfor their children; they can provide nurture and care and safety. One \nthing a mother cannot provide for her child is health care, unless she \ngets some help, just a little bit of help from the Federal Government, \nwith all the power.\n  So I would say to the administration, turn back against this \nbureaucratic, inside baseball, ``thief in the night'' and make sure \nthese children get the coverage they deserve, just like the rest of us \nin Congress. We get pretty good health care coverage. It is about time \nmore people in the Senate, in the House, and down the street in the \nadministration stood up for children and did away with this directive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/17/senate-section/article/S6944-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6944-S6945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 615--URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY TO RESPECT THE \n  RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS OF THE ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE OF THE \n                       ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN CHURCH\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Cardin) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 615\n\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey has sought membership in \n     the European Union and maintains strong bilateral relations \n     with the United States Government;\n       Whereas the accession of Turkey to the European Union will \n     depend on its adherence\n\n[[Page S6945]]\n\n     to the Copenhagen criteria that require candidate countries \n     to have achieved stability of governmental institutions that \n     guarantee human rights and that respect and protect \n     minorities, including religious minorities such as Orthodox \n     Christians;\n       Whereas, on August 2, 2007, European Union Enlargement \n     Commissioner Olli Rehn indicated that Turkey must achieve \n     ``concrete results in areas of fundamental freedoms such as . \n     . . religious freedom'';\n       Whereas the Ecumenical Patriarchate and its Sacred See is \n     the spiritual head for tens of millions, a valuable place of \n     great historic significance to hundreds of millions where \n     much of the New Testament and sacred creeds, including the \n     Nicene Creed, were codified, and as the head of the largest \n     Christian Church headquartered in a majority Muslim country, \n     a critical link between Christians and Muslims;\n       Whereas the United States was founded on the concept of \n     religious freedom and has maintained its support for such \n     freedom throughout its history;\n       Whereas the practice of religious freedom of millions of \n     Orthodox Christians in the United States is dependent on the \n     religious freedom of the spiritual head of their faith;\n       Whereas the United States Government has expressed its \n     emphatic support for full religious freedom for the \n     Ecumenical Patriarchate through numerous statements by both \n     Democratic and Republican Presidents, in letters signed by \n     the extraordinary number of 73 of 100 United States Senators \n     and 42 of 50 members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the \n     House of Representatives, and in reports of the Department of \n     State, the Helsinki Commission, and other government \n     agencies;\n       Whereas Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew gathered \n     international religious leaders soon after the September 11, \n     2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, and produced \n     the first condemnation of the attacks as ``anti-religious'';\n       Whereas the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was awarded \n     the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award \n     bestowed by Congress;\n       Whereas the international community places particular \n     importance on safeguarding and promoting religious freedom as \n     is expressed in the creation of a Special Rapporteur on \n     Freedom of Religion or Belief in the Office of the High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights of the United Nations, in the \n     ``Declaration of Principles Guiding Relations between \n     Participating States'' principle VII, paragraph I of the \n     Helsinki Commission, and in most highly regarded \n     international organizations;\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey does not recognize the \n     Ecumenical Patriarch as ecumenical, interferes with the \n     process of selecting the Ecumenical Patriarch by requiring \n     that the Patriarch be a citizen of Turkey, thereby \n     restricting candidates due to the gradual disappearance of \n     eligible Orthodox Christians who are citizens of Turkey;
