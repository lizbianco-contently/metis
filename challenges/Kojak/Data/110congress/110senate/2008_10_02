Mr. President, I want to spend just a few minutes today \ntalking about Chuck Hagel, the Senator from the State of Nebraska.\n  I was raised in an environment where things were physical--football, \nbaseball, boxing, fighting, and being tough. That was important. And as \nI have looked through the Senate over these years, there is no one that \nfits that bill more than Chuck Hagel. The senior Senator from the State \nof Nebraska is both physically and mentally very tough.\n  Senator Hagel is a person who suffered multiple broken noses playing \nhigh school and college football and, as we read in his book, an \noccasional scuffle off the field. Senator Hagel is a man who won a \nfootball scholarship to go to college because of his athletic prowess \nbut had to change his plans when injury left him with an uncorrectable \npinched nerve in his neck.\n  Senator Hagel is a man who risked his own life on many occasions, but \non one occasion risked his own life and suffered terribly to save his \nbrother's life in the jungle of Cambodia during the Vietnam conflict. \nSenator Hagel is a man who still carries shrapnel from his heroic \nuniformed service to our Nation.\n  Senator Hagel tells the story in his book about his childhood, that \nwhen he and his brother Tom were growing up, the Hagel family moved \naround Nebraska to seven different houses in small Nebraska towns. The \nseven places he lived formed a loop around the State. So when Chuck \nfirst ran for the Senate in 1996, he could go almost anyplace in \nNebraska and tell local crowds, ``it's good to be home.''\n  When Chuck Hagel's draft number was called in 1967, he was given an \norder to ship out to Germany after being inducted. But he said: I don't \nwant to go to Germany. The war is in Vietnam. So he asked to change his \norders to go to Vietnam where the action was. What this young man from \nNebraska believed was that fighting a war meant going to the front \nlines, not someplace thousands of miles away. So that is where he wound \nup.\n  Since the Sullivan brothers' deaths in World War II, it was not very \noften that siblings found themselves in the same combat zone fighting, \nbut that isn't what happened in this situation with the Hagel brothers. \nNo one really knows how--they think it was a stroke of luck, but it \nremains a bit of a mystery--Chuck Hagel and Tom Hagel wound up in the \nsame infantry, same\n\n[[Page S10400]]\n\nfighting unit, fighting shoulder to shoulder in the jungles of \nCambodia.\n  Mr. President, in the span of less than a month, these two brothers \neach had the chance to save the other's life. Not only did they have \nthe chance, but they took that chance and they were successful. Here is \none account:\n\n       One of the soldiers . . . hit a trip wire, setting off a \n     mine that had been placed in a tree so that it would detonate \n     at face level. Bodies, body parts and shrapnel were blasted \n     back into the ranks as the squad was crossing a stream. Tom \n     picked himself up and looked for his brother. What he saw was \n     a `geyser' of blood gushing from Chuck's chest. Tom, then \n     only 19, stanched the bleeding and bandaged the wound, only \n     then noticing that he'd been hit himself in the arm. Twenty-\n     five days later, it was Chuck's turn to rescue Tom when their \n     troop carrier hit a hand-detonated mine as it emerged from a \n     village in the delta. Tom had been in the turret behind a \n     .50-caliber machine gun. He was unconscious, not obviously \n     alive, when his brother got to him. The blast had blown out \n     Chuck's eardrums and severely burned his left side, but \n     knowing the carrier might soon explode, he worked feverishly \n     to pull Tom from the wreckage, then threw his body on top of \n     Tom's as Vietcong fighters in ambush sprayed the area with \n     gunfire.\n  For this remarkably courageous service, SGT Chuck Hagel was decorated \nwith the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, the Army Commendation Medal, \nthe Combat Infantryman Badge, and two Purple Hearts.\n  After the war, Chuck Hagel came to Washington and worked on Capitol \nHill. By the age of 26, he was chief of staff to Congressman John \nMcCollister of Nebraska. Within 10 years, he was appointed by President \nReagan to be the second highest ranking official in the Veterans \nAdministration. But very typical of Chuck Hagel, after just a few \nmonths during his term of service, he spoke out against a cut in \nbenefits to Vietnam veterans and quit the Department in protest. This \nwas not the stepping stone to an impressive career in Washington, as \nsome had thought, because Chuck Hagel spoke out against something he \nthought was wrong.\n  When Senator Hagel left Capitol Hill, he scraped together whatever \nmoney he could find by selling a car and cashing in life insurance \npolicies to invest in an upstart business that built networks for \nwireless phones. Within a few years, Chuck Hagel's company was one of \nthe most successful cellular telephone providers in America. He entered \nthe American system of free enterprise and was extremely successful. \nBut after succeeding in business, Chuck returned his attention to \npolitics and won a seat in the Senate in 1996.\n\n  I have served with Chuck Hagel in the Senate for 12 years. One would \nbe hard-pressed to find a more conservative Member than the senior \nSenator from Nebraska. Although our political philosophies differ, I \nknow Chuck Hagel to be one of the bravest and most fiercely independent \nMembers of this legislative body. He has been a deficit hawk when \nothers in his party abandoned fiscal restraint.\n  He crossed the aisle and worked with my predecessor, Senator Daschle, \nas well as Senator Kennedy and Senator Martinez on the Republican side, \nto seek a comprehensive immigration plan that would be both tough and \ncompassionate but, above all, fair.\n  He served the people of Nebraska well as a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, the Banking Committee, the Housing and Urban \nAffairs Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Rules Committee.\n  I will be forever grateful for the courage Senator Hagel has shown on \nthe Iraq war. He spoke out early against the war, he spoke out often, \nand he was right. As all Senators know, speaking up against a hallmark \npolicy of one's own party is no easy task. With Senator Hagel's help, \nwe were able to move the debate forward and to finally provide some \noversight on the incompetent management of the war. Although Senator \nHagel will not see the end of the war as a Member of this body, there \nis no doubt that his courage has brought us closer to that day.\n  One of the most remarkable days in my political career was the time \nwhen we were working on how to do something to change the course on the \nwar in Iraq. I went and visited Senator Hagel in his office. As you \nwalk in, you see a picture of Tom and Chuck Hagel in a mechanized \nvehicle in the jungles of Cambodia--or Vietnam. I don't know exactly \nwhere it was, but Southeast Asia. He is very proud of his military \ncareer. But we visited, and I probably wouldn't be a very good \nsalesman, selling automobiles or a house because it was hard for me to \nclose the deal, saying: Chuck, will you vote with me? At home that \nnight, he called me and said words to the effect: I listened to you; \nI'm going to vote with you.\n  His vote made the difference. It allowed us to carry the day and send \na bill to the President that the President vetoed. Senator Hagel didn't \nwait for me to close the deal, he closed the deal. I have great \nadmiration and respect for him and what he did that night. I think he \nchanged the direction of the country and how it felt about the war in \nIraq, and it allowed the people in America to know that we could do \nsomething, that we are not powerless.\n  It is well known that Senator Hagel has been considered on more than \none occasion as a candidate for President or Vice President. Here is \nwhat he said, though.\n\n       I don't have to be President. I don't have to be a senator. \n     I just have to live with myself.\n\n  So whatever path Chuck Hagel follows next, he, his wife Lilibet, and \ntheir daughter Allyn and son Ziller, should have the deepest pride in \nthe lasting impact of Senator Chuck Hagel's patriotism and service for \nthe betterment of the Nation we love through both the military and the \nSenate, where he has served so gallantly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10400-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to recognize and pay \ntribute to several colleagues who are concluding distinguished careers \nin the Senate. These gentlemen have distinguished themselves. They have \ndedicated themselves to representing their States and representing the \nbest interests of the Nation.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Senator Pete Domenici is an individual who has worked many years to \nstrengthen our country in so many different ways. He has been a key \nmember of the Committee on Energy and Water, and he has been a key \nmember of the Appropriations Committee and the Budget Committee.\n  He was first elected to the Senate in 1972--36 years of outstanding \nservice to the Nation and to his State of New Mexico.\n  He will be remembered for many things but particularly for his \nunswerving commitment to mental health parity in the health care \nsystem. It is fitting that legislation we passed will bear his name, \nalong with that of Senator Paul Wellstone. Senator Domenici's advocacy \nfor those with mental illness, his understanding of these issues in a \nprofoundly personal way, accounted for the momentum and ultimately the \nsuccess of the legislation. I commend him and thank him for his \nservice.\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  Senator Larry Craig, with whom I had the privilege to serve on the \nCommittee on Appropriations, is someone who has vigorously defended his \npositions in the Senate. We have disagreed more often than agreed, but \nour debates have been both vigorous and civil. I can recall managing \nthe legislation, Senator Craig on the opposing\n\n[[Page S10401]]\n\nside, with respect to issues of guns and firearms. I recall a debate \nthat was vigorous, robust but principled. I appreciate that effort and \nhis service.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  There are three Senators with whom I have had the opportunity to \nserve closely. They are people I respect immensely and wish the best to \nas they go forward. Wayne Allard and I came to the Senate together. We \nwere in the House of Representatives together. We have served on both \nthe Armed Services Committee and the Banking Committee together. It \nseems, indeed, that on the Banking Committee, we were either the \nsubcommittee chair or ranking member, depending on who has the \nmajority, throughout our career in the Senate. In that effort, we \nworked closely with Senator Allard and his distinguished staff on \nissues with respect to homelessness, housing programs, many areas of \nendeavor. He has been a distinguished individual who has done a great \ndeal, not only for the State of Colorado but for national housing \npolicy and for many other areas of endeavor.\n  On the Armed Services Committee, I had the privilege of working with \nhim. He applied his energy and efforts to clean up the Rocky Flats \nplant, a nuclear facility in Colorado. He has made a lasting and \nextraordinary contribution to his State through those efforts. I \ncommend him for all those. I wish him well as he goes forward.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Senator John Warner was my chairman on the Armed Services Committee. \nFrankly, he represents the model of a Senator. His integrity, judgment, \nand decency resonate throughout this Chamber and will make a lasting \nimpression on this body. He has served Virginia with distinction. He \nhas particularly served the men and women of our Armed Forces with \ndistinction and unfailing dedication. Part of that comes from his own \nexperience. As a young man he joined the Navy and then later was in the \nMarine Corps. His own experience, later amplified by his service as \nSecretary of the Navy, left an indelible impression upon him. That \nimpression is the fact that all the great decisions made in Washington \nultimately must be borne by young men and women who serve in uniform. \nHe has never forgotten that. He has never forgotten that decisions we \nmake play out in the lives of soldiers and sailors, marines, airmen, \nand their families. That unfailing sense of obligation to these young \nAmericans is a profound contribution he has made.\n  He is also someone who on many occasions has defied the current tides \nof popular opinion. I recall that when the deplorable incident \nsurrounding Abu Ghraib broke, there was a sense in some quarters that \nwe should try to avoid mention of that, that we should minimize the \nissue. Senator Warner recognized we couldn't do that, that we owed it \nto the men and women in the Armed Forces to look at the issue carefully \nso it would not be repeated, to ensure that it was, as it truly was, an \naberration in the otherwise extraordinary dedication of our forces, not \njust to the military profession but to the ideals of decency that have \nbeen the hallmark of the American fighting man and woman throughout our \nhistory. His efforts there will be ruled as a remarkable display of \nplacing the needs of country and respect for the institution of the \nmilitary above any partisan political concerns. He is someone who has \nmade a huge contribution. Again, that contribution will resonate \nthroughout the history of this country, particularly the history of the \nSenate.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Finally, let me pay tribute to a dear friend and colleague. We \nentered the Senate together 12 years ago. Senator Chuck Hagel has \nrepresented Nebraska with rare insight and extraordinarily good humor \nfor 12 years. He is one of those individuals who is respected and liked \nby everyone because he is an extraordinarily decent person, someone who \ntakes his job seriously but himself not so seriously. He is someone I \nhave had the privilege to travel with across the globe--Russia, \nAfghanistan, Singapore, the Philippines, northern Africa, and back \nagain to Afghanistan and Iraq. He, too, has a rare dedication to the \nmen and women of the armed services, born of his own personal \nexperiences. As a young man he chose not only to join the U.S. Army but \nto serve in Vietnam. He had the opportunity to be posted to Germany. He \nwould have served out his time and left. But he decided he had to march \nto the sound of the guns. His brother was already there. Together in \nthe same unit, he and his brother served the U.S. Army. He was wounded \nin action, received the Purple Heart. He came back as a veteran and \ncontinued his education and then built a very successful business \ncareer. But he never lost sight of those men and women who serve in \nuniform. He is very active in the USO. He is someone who was active in \nveterans affairs. Then, finally, when he was elected to the Senate, he \ntook his learning, his experience and appreciation and played a major \nrole on the Foreign Relations Committee. His commitment to a broad \nmultinational policy of using our alliances, of building our power not \njust through our military power but through diplomatic and reputational \npower has made a significant contribution to the country, not just for \nthe moment but for many years. He is leaving the Senate to pursue other \nendeavors. I wish him well. He has been a remarkable friend. He, \nLilibet, and their children, Allyn and Ziller, are a remarkable family. \nI will miss him particularly. I salute him, thank him. He, to me, is \nthe very model of a Senator who has served his country in different \nways and now has chosen to continue to serve in other ways. I am sure \nhe will continue to contribute to the country.\n  To these Members, I wish them well. I thank them personally for their \nkindness to me and their thoughtfulness on so many other occasions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10401-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10401-S10402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXTENSION OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise also to speak about a very important \ntopic, and that is the need to enact legislation to help unemployed \nAmericans amid the current economic downturn. Yesterday, we passed an \nunprecedented package of support for the financial markets. There are \nmany Americans who are suffering as grievously as our financial markets \nand those who work in the financial markets. There are an estimated \n800,000 unemployed workers who will begin to run out of emergency \nunemployment compensation because jobs are too scarce in the current \neconomic climate. We cannot turn our back on these 800,000 Americans. \nWe need to help them. In June, I was pleased by the inclusion of 13 \nweeks of emergency unemployment compensation to all States in the war \nsupplemental spending bill. This help was critical and something I had \nadvocated for a very long time.\n  Too many individuals in our States who have been unemployed are still \nlooking for work, but they can't find it and they are running out of \nbenefits. The labor market continues to deteriorate. This impact is \nbecoming magnified as a result of the continued unravelling of the \nfinancial marketplace. We are seeing--in fact, one of the reasons we \nacted last evening--credit markets seize up. We are seeing auto sales \nlots not able to finance the acquisition of cars and buyers not able to \nbuy automobiles. We are seeing a host of problems that manifest \nthemselves in GDP statistics, unemployment statistics, and in the lives \nof ordinary Americans it is manifested in the stark reality of no work \nand a family to support. We have experienced the eighth straight month \nof job declines. Unemployment has soared to a 5-year high of 6.1 \npercent; 16 States now have an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent or \ngreater. New national unemployment numbers for September will be \nreleased tomorrow morning. It is expected that these numbers will \ncontinue the downward trend, given the sustained notices of plant \nclosings, mass layoffs, and cutbacks for small businesses trying to \nsurvive in this environment. In my State of Rhode Island, the situation \nis more bleak: 8.5 percent are jobless right now. It is the second \nhighest level in the Nation, a jump of over 3.4 percent in the course \nof the last year alone. We are hemorrhaging jobs in Rhode Island. It is \nthe highest unemployment rate in Rhode Island since November 1992.\n  In addition to this evaporation of jobs is the acceleration of \nprices. Gasoline, food, and health care costs are all accelerating. \nFamilies are caught in a tremendous squeeze. That is why I am pleased \nto have introduced bipartisan legislation, which has been cosponsored\n\n[[Page S10402]]\n\nby more than 20 of my colleagues, including the chairman of the Senate \nHELP Committee and the Finance Committee, Senators Kennedy and Baucus, \nto extend unemployment insurance benefits so people can pay their bills \nwhile they look for work. This measure provides 7 weeks of federally \nfunded unemployment insurance for individuals who have exhausted their \nbenefits, and it provides 13 additional weeks of benefits to unemployed \nworkers in States that have been hit particularly hard by this economic \ndownturn, States that have unemployment rates above 6 percent. Right \nnow 17 States would qualify for this high unemployment figure.\n  The bill also includes a provision to help qualifying States, such as \nRhode Island, replenish their unemployment insurance trust funds which \nhelp cover a portion of unemployment insurance benefits. The Senate \nstimulus package that failed last week included these same provisions \nto extend unemployment insurance. We need to take aggressive steps to \nhelp these families who are struggling to make ends meet. I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in supporting this legislation.\n  I was prepared to ask consent to pass this legislation, S. 3507, \ntoday, but I understand there is an objection by the minority. Passage \nof this legislation is vital. Since it appears there will be a lameduck \nsession after the election, I will work with my colleagues to bring \nthis legislation, if possible, to that lameduck session to get it \npassed. We have to help these Americans.\n  In summary, if we could afford to authorize $700 billion last evening \nto assist financial forces to unclog credit markets, to begin to \nprovide support for the economy, then we certainly can afford to help \nindividuals who are looking for work and can't find it and are \ndesperate. It is only right. I hope we can do that when we return.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

Mr. President, I wish to make a comment about the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island before he leaves the floor. I have had the distinct \nprivilege of serving with my colleague on a number of committees during \nmy tenure in the Senate. I want the people of Rhode Island to know what \na class act he is in representing their State in the Senate. It has \nbeen a thrill to be able to work with him on issues. We were on a \ncouple subcommittees together and actually shared the chairmanship and \nranking position depending on who was in control of the Congress at \nthat time, whether it was Republicans or Democrats: the Personnel \nSubcommittee and the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, both very important \nsubcommittees in the Armed Services Committee. Then we found ourselves \non the Banking Committee. We found ourselves again working as the top \nRepublican and top Democrat on housing and mass transit issues. We \nworked together on transit security issues. And now we are together on \nthe Securities, Insurance and Investment subcommittee.\n  Senator Jack Reed from Rhode Island comes from a different part of \nthe country. He has different issues that are important to him. I come \nfrom the West. I have different issues that are important to me. But we \nwere able to find a lot of commonality and work together in a \nprofessional way. I attribute a lot of that to the high moral \nstandards, dedication, and ability to work with others of my good \nfriend from Rhode Island, Jack Reed.\n  I want him to know what a pleasure it has been for me to be able to \nserve on the various committees with him through my tenure in the \nSenate.\n  I am getting ready to retire with the close of this session. So I \nwished to make a few comments and to recognize a few people whom I have \nappreciated working with, and particularly I wish to recognize Senator \nJack Reed from Rhode Island because he is a topnotch Senator and \nsomebody I have enjoyed working with.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I say to him, \nthank you very much. Let me express my appreciation for your \nextraordinary assistance and help and collegiality. I wish you well. \nYou represent the very highest traditions of integrity, dedication and \ndecency and I wish you well. Thank you.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator very much. The Senator from Rhode \nIsland is one individual I am going to miss being able to work with.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make some remarks about leaving the Senate, \nbut I do see the top Republican is here.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was wondering: I came to speak on behalf of my good \nfriend, our senior Senator from Colorado. I wonder if he would object \nto my going ahead and making my comments about him prior to his speech? \nOr would that create a scheduling problem for the Senator from \nColorado?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, that does not create a problem for me and, \nI say to the Senator, I appreciate your willingness to come down and \nsay a few words. When you are finished, I also would like to say how \nmuch I have appreciated your leadership on the Republican side. I think \nyou have been a superb leader. I think we have been fortunate to have \nyour leadership in the Senate during some very tough times. A lot of \nleaders have come and gone. I have always felt comfortable in \nsupporting you all along. Sometimes I can be frustrating because of my \ncommitments to my constituents and maybe my commitment to my issues, \nbut you have been very tolerant of me, and I appreciate that very much.\n  I yield the floor to the top Republican.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Colorado. I \nam here to talk about his distinguished career.\n\n\n                              WAYNE ALLARD\n\n  Mr. President, as the 110th Congress draws to a close, we must \nreluctantly say goodbye to some friends who will be leaving us. That \nincludes, as we have been discussing, my good friend, the senior \nSenator from Colorado.\n  As the Republican leader, I get to work closely with each and every \none of our colleagues on this side of the aisle. The thing that has \nalways impressed me the most about Senator Allard is the fact that he \nis a true citizen legislator in the model our Founding Fathers \nenvisioned.\n  The Founders favored ordinary citizens of extraordinary wisdom. Those \nwho step forward from among the people they represent and return to \nthem when their time here is done.\n  So it is with Wayne Allard. He is retiring from the Senate because he \nis following a two-term pledge he set for himself when he was first \nelected in 1996. In the spirit of George Washington, he voluntarily \nretires ``from the great theatre of Action'' to return to the people \nand the place he has so ably represented.\n  Anyone who knows Senator Allard knows he is a big believer in keeping \nclose contact with the people he represents. As a member of the \nColorado State senate, he passed legislation limiting the length of \nlegislative sessions to 120 days to better ensure that State lawmakers \nstayed in touch with their constituents.\n  After election to the Senate, he made a promise to Coloradans that he \nwould visit every one of the State's counties every year--a promise he \nkept, keeping him in sync with Colorado sympathies and values.\n  Even more impressive are the 700 town meetings across Colorado that \nSenator Allard has held since his election to the Senate.\n  As a Senator, he has hosted the Allard Capital Conference, which \nbrings Colorado community leaders to Washington to see the workings of \nthe Federal Government up close--and to keep the Federal Government \naccountable to the people who elected them.\n  If I may add, I have had the pleasure of speaking to the Allard \nCapital Conference attendees on more than one occasion, and I have \nalways admired how Senator Allard has stayed tied to communities across \nColorado. He is always seeking to bring them closer to their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  For 12 years, Senator Allard has been a strong voice for returning \npower from Washington back to the people and to the States. He has been \na strong voice for lower taxes and lower Federal spending. Hailing from \nthe Rockies, he has been a strong defender and protector of our \nenvironment.\n\n[[Page S10403]]\n\n  Senator Allard has a different background than most of his \ncolleagues. Born and raised in Colorado, the son of a cattle rancher, \nhe had a successful career as a veterinarian. He and his wife Joan \nstarted their own animal hospital. He maintained his successful \npractice while serving as a State senator, and was elected to the House \nof Representatives for three terms starting in 1990.\n  I have had the pleasure of working alongside Wayne on many issues \nover the years. We have been allies in pushing the Department of \nDefense to safely and efficiently dispose of deadly chemical weapons \nstored in the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky and the Pueblo Depot in \nColorado.\n  I have watched with admiration as he fought to establish the Rocky \nFlats National Wildlife Refuge, which is crucial to preserving the \nnatural habitats of so many diverse species in Colorado.\n  That success came after he successfully pushed, as a Member of the \nHouse, legislation to make the Rocky Mountain Arsenal site a wildlife \nrefuge, turning a site that was once a manufacturing center for nerve \ngas and other chemical weapons into what is now one of the largest \nurban wildlife refuges in the Nation.\n  Wayne has fought to get aid for workers in Colorado who were exposed \nto unhealthy amounts of radiation at nuclear weapons facilities. He has \nalso taken the lead on passing legislation to preserve the Great Sand \nDunes National Park and Colorado's Spanish Peaks mountain area. With \nhis retirement, Colorado is losing a longtime champion of conservation \nand environmental protection.\n  Senator Allard has been a consistent and strong supporter of our \nmilitary and our national security interests. He led the debate on \nestablishing a system to protect America from ballistic missile \nattacks, and he has supported funding and rigorous testing for such \nprograms.\n  He has passed legislation multiple times to improve the system of \nvoting for our men and women in uniform serving overseas, making sure \nthe brave warriors who protect America are heard when it is time to \nelect America's leaders.\n  With all these accomplishments, and many more, the senior Senator \nfrom Colorado is going to leave some very big shoes--maybe it is better \nto say boots--to fill come next January.\n  He is also going to leave behind many friends. I am proud to call \nmyself one of them. Elaine and I have enjoyed getting to know Wayne and \nJoan and their family over the years. We have had a chance to have \ndinner together from time to time, just the four of us. We will miss \nthe common sense and grace they have brought to our Nation's Capital.\n  We are sorry to lose such a fine Senator. But as Wayne has said \nhimself about his pledge on term limits: A promise made should be a \npromise kept.\n  The people of Colorado should be proud that their Senator ends his \ntenure with integrity, with honor, with humility--the same integrity, \nhonor, and humility he brought when he came to the Capitol.\n  Wayne, we all wish you the best of luck for whatever the future \nholds. You will always have friends in the Capitol. We look forward to \nseeing you and Joan in the coming years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                            Mitch Mc Connell\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his \nmore than generous remarks. Joan and I have been thrilled to have been \nable to work with you and your lovely wife on many issues. The people \nof Colorado need to know I got things done in this body because of your \nhelp and your assistance. Many times we shared common issues that we \nwanted to see move forward. But lots of times you were more than \ngenerous in giving me an opportunity to put forth my bills and my \narguments on various bills, and I will forever be thankful for that.\n  I think the country needs to know that in your wife and you we have \ntwo great leaders in this country. I brag about both of you when I get \nback to Colorado and talk about those people who I think have made a \nhuge influence on this country and have set a great example for \nAmericans.\n  So I thank you. I thank you for your continued leadership. I look \nforward to your continuing to serve in this body. America needs you, \nand the people of Kentucky ought to be thankful they have such a fine \nSenator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Republican leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10403-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10403-S10405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to now wrap up with a few \ncomments. I have now spent 12 years in the Senate, 18 years in the \nCongress all together, when you consider the 6 years I served in the \nHouse of Representatives. I can say it has been a great experience. In \nmy view, I have represented the best State in the Union. We refer to it \nas the ``Centennial State'' because it joined the Union exactly 100 \nyears after we became the United States.\n  It has always been enjoyable to talk to my colleagues and talk to \nvisitors to the Capitol about my State of Colorado because they have \nusually had great experiences when they have visited my State. It is a \ntourist attraction. We have a lot of things that bring people to \nColorado. It is a beautiful State. People have great vacations when \nthey go there, and they are more than anxious to share their wonderful \nexperiences with me, share the wonderful and welcoming attitude they \nexperienced from the people of Colorado, and share with me how much \nthey have enjoyed visiting the great State of Colorado.\n  And, when people get tired of talking about the great State of \nColorado, we have always been able to talk about their favorite cat or \ntheir favorite dog because, as a veterinarian, it has always been a \ncommon interest among many of my colleagues in the Senate, as well as \nvisitors to our office, to talk to me about their favorite pet. So it \nhas been a wonderful experience.\n  This is the greatest legislative body in the world. It is an honor to \nserve here. There are a lot of dedicated employees who have helped me \nget things done in this body. They put their own political preferences \naside and thought of the well-being of the institution. They have \nalways been very polite and most supportive and helpful. I wish to \nthank them.\n  I have had great employees in my office. I wish to mention that you \nget things done because of the people with whom you surround yourself. \nI have two members who are currently on my staff who have served with \nme since I was first elected to the Congress. I was elected to the \nHouse of Representatives in 1990. They came in with me and worked with \nme on the House side for 6 years and then they came over here and \ncontinued to work in my office for the last 12 years. I appreciate \ntheir dedication. Those kinds of people don't come along everyday. They \nspent 18 years with me, bless their souls. The two I speak of are Sean \nConway and Doris Morgan. Both of them have been dedicated staff people \nwho have helped to make my service to the people of Colorado \nsuccessful.\n\n  There are also some staffers who joined me after I became a Senator \nin 1997, in addition to the two I mentioned, including Andy Merritt, \nwho is now my State director; Dick Poole, who is one of my top staff \npeople; Tewana Wilkerson, who has helped me on the Banking Committee; \nand Kris Hanisch, who has helped us balance our books as well as \nhelping us to move through the maze here in the Senate. We do have our \nown little bureaucracy in the Senate. She knows it and understands it \nand has helped us move through it. She has been my office manager and \nhas kept us on the straight and narrow. I appreciate the dedication of \nall of the employees who have worked with me.\n  I have a great group of employees currently serving me in my office. \nWe have had a number of people who have come and gone, but I never felt \nit was because they were disappointed in having to work in our office. \nWhen I talked to people who came to work as employees in my office, I \nwould say: If your ultimate goal is to work in a Senate office, I want \nyou to rethink your goals. I want you to get an experience here that \nwill help you grow once you leave the Senate, so you can be a better \ncitizen, so you can contribute more fully to whatever path you decide \nto assume once you leave this great body and leave our office. So I \nhave always tried to encourage them to think about\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\nwhere they want to go. We have had employees who have worked in my \noffice, continued their education, and have become very outstanding. I \nhave a number of former staff people who are actually serving in \nelected office; I think some five or six people right now who are \nserving. They decided to go back to Colorado and pursue elected office. \nI congratulate them, as they are very active citizens in their \ncommunities.\n  I wish to mention some of the committee chairmen I have had an \nopportunity to work with. One of the committees I was successful in \ngetting on was the Budget Committee, with Pete Domenici as chairman, \nand then Judd Gregg following him, and now we have Senator Kent Conrad. \nAll of these chairmen have been very gracious and helpful in working \nwith me on issues.\n  Then I have had the chance to serve on the Armed Services Committee. \nSenator John Warner, a great friend, and somebody who is retiring and \nwho has been very helpful, served as the chairman of that committee \nwhile I was on the Armed Services Committee.\n  I also served on the Banking Committee. The first chairman I served \nunder was Phil Gramm and then Richard Shelby and now Chris Dodd. I have \nto say I have been blessed with great leadership on all of those \ncommittees.\n  I also served on the Intelligence Committee. I served with Senator \nShelby, who was chairman, and Senator Kerrey who was ranking member at \nthe time I served on the Intelligence Committee.\n  Now I serve on a different committee this Congress, the HELP \nCommittee. It deals with health, education, pension and labor issues. \nMy well-known colleague here in the Senate, Senator Kennedy of \nMassachusetts, is chairman of that committee. He is a wonderful person \nand someone whom I greatly appreciate and who has spent a lot of time \nin Colorado, I might say.\n  I also serve with my very good friend who was chairman of that \ncommittee for a while, Senator Enzi. I couldn't ask for a better \nfriend. He is from Wyoming, a neighbor of Colorado. So we had many \nissues in common, and both Joan and I consider Diana and Mike Enzi as \nour very good friends.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  I wish to say a few things about those people who are retiring, \nstarting with Senator Pete Domenici, who I mentioned was my chairman on \nthe Budget Committee. I have worked with him also on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I worked with him on energy issues and issues that are \ncommon to New Mexico and the State of Colorado. His service here in the \nSenate has been remarkable and dedicated. The West has been blessed \nthat we have had such a good spokesman as Senator Domenici out there, \ncarrying many of the issues that are important to his neighboring \nStates, as well as New Mexico. The institution will miss him. I am sure \nNew Mexico will miss him. I consider it an honor and a pleasure to have \nserved with him.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Senator Warner I mentioned earlier. We couldn't ask for a greater \nstatesman. He has made a number of trips to Colorado. I worked with him \non the Defense Authorization bill. He has been more than considerate \nand helpful to those issues that are important to Colorado. He has been \nsupportive on matters that we worked on for Fort Carson and for \nPeterson Air Force Base and the Air Force Academy and the many other \nissues involving the military and military installations we have in \nColorado. He has been tough at times, but his leadership has been \ngreatly appreciated by me. I think the Senate and the country have been \nblessed because Senator Warner has been willing to dedicate so much of \nhis time and effort to making this a better country, a stronger \ncountry. He is somebody I am very proud to have been able to serve \nwith.\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  Also retiring is Senator Larry Craig from Idaho, another westerner \nwith whom I found a lot in common. He and I both have strong \nagricultural roots. He has been a very strong advocate of those issues \nimportant to the West and his State of Idaho. Again, I have appreciated \nworking with him on national park issues and public lands issues. He is \na superb individual.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Another individual I wish to recognize who is retiring is Senator \nChuck Hagel from Nebraska; again, one of the neighboring States of \nColorado. The State of Nebraska is downstream from Colorado. So we have \nribbed each other a little bit about water issues. Basically, though, \nwe have been partners on water issues. We have been able to work \ntogether on many issues that have improved the management of water in \nthe Platte River drainage system, which is one of the many rivers that \noriginates in Colorado and flows downstream. I also worked with Senator \nHagel on the Banking Committee. He was one who pushed early on for the \nreform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He brought to this institution a \ngreat deal of experience. Again, he has decided to retire the same year \nas I have. I will always remember Senator Chuck Hagel and our \nrelationship and how we have been able to work together, I think for \nthe betterment of both of our States.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't brag about my partner and my wife, Joan \nAllard. Joan has spent much of her time being with me, whether I have \nbeen in Colorado or here in the Senate. Senator Mitch McConnell talked \nabout the town meetings she attended. She attended about as many of \nthose town meetings as I. It has been kind of embarrassing at times \nbecause sometimes the number of people who came just to see her in the \nback of the room was large and they were having more fun back there \nthan I was, up front trying to conduct the meeting. People loved Joan \nas they got to know her throughout the State of Colorado. Her \ndedication to me and to her family and the people of Colorado is \nremarkable and unique. We are known as partners here in the Senate. \nWherever I go, Joan is very close by, and people are used to seeing us \nboth at receptions. Many times I was invited to events where they \nwanted me to come alone. I said: No, I want my wife with me, and if you \ncan't accept my wife, maybe we won't make the reception, because she is \nsomebody who I didn't want to be divorced from this process. She has \nbeen willing to make a personal commitment in time and in supporting me \nin my work. So I wanted to make sure that the responsibilities of \nserving in the Senate didn't drive a wedge between what a wonderful \nrelationship we have had. She worked side by side with me at the \nveterinary hospital. We worked and met the challenges of raising two \nwonderful daughters whom we are very proud of, and now we are seeing \ngrandsons coming up. So I couldn't have asked for a more dedicated \nwife. We still have a lot ahead of us. I am very pleased that she was \nwilling to take an interest in my job of representing the people of \nColorado.\n\n  The first vote I took in the House and in the Congress was on whether \nto authorize the first Gulf War in 1991. That was a tough vote. I have \nnow possibly cast my last vote on the economic bailout or the \nstabilization act we voted on yesterday. So my congressional career has \nbeen bookended by hugely significant votes that have humbled me in \nterms of the trust the people of Colorado have granted. I wish to thank \nthe people of Colorado who have been supportive and who have expressed \ntheir views to me in my town meetings, letters, e-mails, faxes, and \nphone calls. My office has sent out roughly 2.1 million constituent \nletters since I was sworn in. I say honestly that I relish every \nopportunity to hear from and explain myself to the people of Colorado. \nEven those who weren't supportive and who expressed those views in town \nmeetings, letters, e-mails, faxes and phone calls, I thank them for \nthat.\n  I have no regrets and leave this institution with a clear conscience. \nI feel as though I have been true to my campaign promises and have \nworked to hold down taxes, hold down spending, hold down the growth of \ngovernment here in Washington, and I have fought to balance the budget. \nI feel as though I have worked to defend local control and keep America \nstrong. I have kept in mind private property rights and the power of \nthe State in managing its own water resources.\n  It is time to say goodbye and wish my colleagues the very best, and \nto wish my successor, whoever that might be, the very best. It is time \nfor Joan and me to move on, hopefully returning to a future in the \nprivate sector. I\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\ncame to Washington with small business experience, and I hope to \ncontinue working in the business sector. The challenge, as I see it, is \nfor future Congresses to protect the freedom that continues to create \nopportunity for us and future generations and to ensure that we have a \nsecure America.\n  May God bless America, and may God bless Congress's future endeavors.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tragically, a month and a half ago, we \nlost a wonderful colleague of all of ours, Stephanie Tubbs Jones--\nStephanie Tubbs Jones was a member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, a wonderful Congresswoman who, whenever you met her, \nhad a big, broad smile on her face. She obviously loved her work on \nbehalf of her country. All of us miss her.\n  There is legislation called the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Organ \nTransplant Authorization Act of 2008. I have worked on it in the \nSenate. I provided a companion bill in the Senate. Yesterday, I worked \nwith Dr. Coburn on the other side to resolve any differences. I \nunderstand it is still being reviewed. My hope is that this legislation \nwill be enacted today. Let me describe the importance of this \nlegislation.\n  We have more than 99,000 Americans right now awaiting organ \ntransplantation. They are on a waiting list to find an organ. In fact, \ntwo-thirds of those on the waiting list are waiting because they suffer \nfrom end-stage renal disease, and they are waiting for a kidney \ntransplant. About 6,000 who are on that waiting list will die this \nyear. We know how to save them, but they will die because they did not \nget a transplant--a kidney, heart, lung. They will die.\n  I have worked on this issue for many years. I recall some long while \nago I worked on legislation that required every tax refund that went \nout to the American people in that year to be accompanied by a little \nsheet that told you how you could become an organ donor, how you could \nsign up. Seventy million Americans got a little piece of information on \nhow to sign up to become an organ donor. On my driver's license in my \nwallet, it says ``donor.'' It is pretty easy to do for most Americans.\n\n  As I indicated, two-thirds of those on the waiting list are waiting \nfor a kidney. Many will die before they get one. On the day the \nlegislation that informed 70 million people how to become an organ \ndonor passed, I held a press conference with a group of my colleagues. \nSenator Strom Thurmond came to the press conference. I believe Strom \nThurmond was 90 years old then. He came to the press conference to sign \na big plaque we had, to sign up as an organ donor at age 90.\n  You had to know Strom Thurmond to understand the irony. He was a \nremarkable American, a remarkable Member of the Senate. At age 90, he \nsigned an organ donor card, and here is what he said: When I am gone, I \ndon't know if I have anything anybody wants, but they are welcome to \nit. That was his notion of an organ donor card, and he signed up.\n  The fact is, not just in memory of our wonderful colleague, Stephanie \nTubbs Jones, but in pursuit of doing the right thing. We can save a lot \nof lives by passing this legislation. This legislation will authorize \nan increase in the Federal contribution that has been the same since \n1984. The Federal contribution to the Organ Procurement and \nTransplantation Network.\n  The Federal contribution to that network was $2 million in 1984, and \nthat is what it is today. This legislation proposes an increase in that \nauthorization--not a major increase but an increase that will allow us \nto do greater work to try to match those available organs with those \nwho desperately need a donation.\n  The good news is that patients no longer have to wait for someone to \ndie, for example, to get a kidney. Living donations and paired \ndonations have dramatically increased the number of kidney donations \nevery year. That is saving lives and, by the way, saving taxpayers \nmoney. The cost of renal dialysis is very high.\n  I come to the Senate floor today only to say this is a very important \npiece of legislation for tens and tens of thousands of people in this \ncountry who even now are waiting for an organ transplant, some of whom \nwill die before they get it. We can save many lives with this \nlegislation.\n  My hope is that at the end of today we will have cleared the bill on \nboth\n\n[[Page S10406]]\n\nsides and then send it back to the House. They will then clear it \ntomorrow because it has had a very small change that we negotiated \nyesterday but not a material change. When we do that, we will have done \nsomething very important in terms of organ transplants and the ability \nto save lives in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10406-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10406-S10407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last night we passed an economic \nstabilization plan that is intended to protect business, pensions, and \njobs. I know from my State of Ohio, all too often I get plant shutdown \nnotifications and applications for shutdown assistance, for worker \nretraining, for all kinds of responses to economic problems. What we \ndid last night was particularly important because of potential lost \njobs. With that bill we are trying to prevent an economic crisis.\n  Last week, Republican Members of this body, unfortunately, set the \nstage for another economic crisis. They set the stage for a crisis when \nthey blocked a bill to extend unemployment insurance for millions of \nAmericans and their families. Congress must extend this insurance for \nAmericans. We have a bill to do that. I urge my colleagues to support \nS. 3507.\n  My friend from Rhode Island, Senator Jack Reed, has introduced this \nbill that will provide an extension of insurance for all States for 7 \nweeks, an additional 13 weeks for high unemployment States, which means \nthose States that have an unemployment rate of at least 6 percent.\n  Think about the conditions, everywhere from Lima to Zanesville, \nAshtabula to Middletown in my State, and States across the country--\nfood prices exploding, energy prices exploding, unemployment benefits \nrunning out. If that is not an economic crisis, an American crisis--not \njust in Chillicothe and Ravenna, it is a crisis all over this State--\nthen I guess I don't know what the word ``crisis'' means.\n  Last month's jobs report from the Labor Department showed that for \nthe eighth straight month the country has lost jobs. Eight months in a \nrow we have lost jobs in this country.\n  Tomorrow we will get the latest report. I am not looking forward to \nit. Just last week there were 493,000--almost a half million--new \nunemployment claims filed, the largest number since September 2001. We \nknow what happened that month.\n  Before that, you have to go back to July 1992 when the Nation's \nunemployment rate was 7.7 percent. The unemployment statistics, as we \nknow, only count individuals actively looking for work. It may be \nconvenient to characterize the unemployed as lazy, then you don't have \nto help them. Apparently, that is what my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle are doing who blocked this extension of unemployment \nbenefits. These are working people who cannot find work. These are \nplant shutdowns in Dayton. These are major layoffs in Mansfield. These \nare people who simply cannot find jobs in Columbus and Akron and \nYoungstown and Toledo and Bowling Green and Findlay. These are people \nall over my State. These are men and women who want to support their \nfamilies and save for the future. These are people who want to work; \nthey simply can't find jobs in this economy.\n  These are people such as Terry, in Holmes County, OH, one of the \nleast populous counties. A veteran, after 20 years of service he wanted \nto return to Ohio, which he did, and get his life and family settled. \nHis company laid off workers this past summer. He has been looking for \na job, but employers are simply not hiring. His unemployment insurance \nended in February.\n  These are people such as Patricia from Troy, OH, a small community \njust north of Dayton in Miami County. In Troy, that part of Ohio--\nClinton County, Clark County, Montgomery County, Miami County--that \npart of Ohio is one of the hardest hit parts of the State and of the \nNation. Patricia from Troy put it better than I could. She said:\n\n       My husband is just another one of the 334,000 unemployed \n     Ohioans. . . . I would like to know what we are supposed to \n     do without. Are we supposed to go without a roof over our \n     head? Are we supposed to go without food? Am I supposed to go \n     without medication or the medical care I need to survive?\n\n  Unemployment compensation is an insurance program, it is not a \nwelfare program. These are people, they and their employers, who paid \ninto this unemployment insurance fund. That is why it is called \nunemployment insurance. It has been with us for 75 years, since around \nthe time of the beginning of the Great Depression. It matters for \npeople. It helps not just those individuals, it helps to bring money \ninto our community, money that will be spent on the necessities of \nlife, will create economic activity, and will help us in our economic \nrecovery. People all over my State have asked me the kinds of questions \nthat Patricia asked. What am I supposed to do about medical care? How \nam I supposed to go without food?\n  These people, Patricia and Terry, are not paid spokespeople. They are \nnot lobbyists. They are watching the news. They are seeing how Wall \nStreet's greed and mistakes have us in this crisis today. They \nunderstand intuitively that people on Wall Street betrayed them. They \nunderstand intuitively that people such as one of John McCain's chief \neconomic advisers, Carly Fiorina, was let go as CEO of a major company \nand was paid tens of millions of dollars as a bonus, as a golden \nparachute, even though she was fired from this company.\n  They understand that they have worked hard and played by the rules. \nWhat is really amazing about this economic crisis is that the elite in \nthis country tell us over and over: If you work hard, if you play by \nthe rules, then you are going to do all right. You are going to be \nrewarded.\n  People in the middle class in this country have worked hard. They \nhave played by the rules. But when they look to Wall Street and the \nBush regulators, the Treasury Department, the SEC, the people who were \nin charge, they have gotten rid of the rules for Wall Street so the \ncowboy capitalists on Wall Street who don't play by the rules get \nrewarded handsomely while the middle class in Tiffin, in Cambridge, in \nSt. Clairsville, the middle class in Circleville and Portsmouth, they \nplay by the rules. They don't get rewarded even though that was the \npromise made by so many people in this country. These are people with \nreal concerns and real families, from Gallipolis to Toledo, Cleveland \nto Akron, Mansfield to Xenia. They are people who are at the end of the \nline, and they are not alone.\n  Across the country, 9.4 million workers are unemployed and looking \nfor work, 2.2 million more than a year ago, the highest figure \nrecorded, as I said, since December 1992, more than 15 years ago. Even \nSeptember 11 didn't cause this kind of unemployment; 9.4 million \nunemployed compared to 6 million unemployed in January 2001.\n  If Congress doesn't act this week, more than 800,000 unemployed \npeople will stop getting their much need checks, including 22,000 \npeople in Ohio.\n  Last night, this Senate, by a vote of 74 to 25, more than half the \nmembers of each party, voted because we had to. We voted. If we did not \ndo this financial stabilization package, we knew that pensions would be \nthreatened, we knew that student loans would disappear or interest \nrates would go so high they might as well disappear, and middle-class \ncollege students would lose the opportunity to go to school. We knew \nthat some small businesses would close and others would have to lay \noff, costing States such as mine, which are so hard hit already, more \nlost jobs. We knew that was what was happening last night. That is why \nwe passed that legislation.\n  The same people in the Treasury Department and the Bush \nadministration who relaxed the rules and betrayed our country, betrayed \nthe middle class, hurt families all over my State--those same people \nhave blocked the extension of unemployment benefits. That is why we are \nnot voting on it today because every time we try, Republican leaders \nsay we can't do unemployment.\n\n[[Page S10407]]\n\n  I don't know if they think unemployed people are lazy. I don't know \nif they think because we provide them a few dollars to get by until \nthey can find a job and keep their families going, keep their kids in \nschool, keep food on their tables, keep a roof over their heads--I \ndon't know what they think. They are not going to try to get a job if \nthey get a few dollars unemployment? It is not like unemployment is \nlike a congressional pension. It is not like unemployment compensation \nis like a Carly Fiorina bailout or Carly Fiorina's bonus for failing at \nher company. It is not like this is a lot of money that is going to \nkeep people so fat and happy that they do not need to work. I do not \nget why they would do that.\n\n  Congress needs to extend unemployment benefits for unemployed \nworkers. We need to do it for those workers, for those workers' \nfamilies, for those communities in which they live. It is in no one's \nbest interests for Congress to twiddle its thumbs while more American \nfamilies sink into poverty. An extension of unemployment insurance--not \nwelfare, insurance--was in the economic stimulus package last week. The \nHouse may very well take up unemployment insurance extension before we \nadjourn. Here is why.\n  If we are going to talk about stimulating the economy, there is no \nbetter way to do it. Every dollar invested in unemployment benefits \nleads to $1.64 in growth. This is not money that people use to go out \nand buy a flat-screen TV made in China. This money, unemployment \nextension, is used for food; it is used for books for their children \nand clothes for their children. It is used to pay the rent. It is used \nto pay utility bills. These are dollars that stay in the community, \ndollars which help the local hardware store, help the local grocery \nstore, dollars which provide other jobs in the community. There is no \nbetter stimulus than that.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says extending unemployment benefits \nis cost effective and fast acting. We already have the mechanism. We \nput money in the pipeline. The money gets into the community. It \ndoesn't take 3 months to send out a check. It is money that can be put \ninto the pipeline right away.\n  Unemployment benefits are spent to sustain families so they do not \nneed other forms of public assistance. It gives workers the resources \nthey need to put gas in their cars to go out and look for work. I get \nletters all the time from people who literally cannot afford to buy gas \nso they can go out and look for a job, particularly in rural Ohio, \nparticularly in places such as Waverly and places such as Jackson and \nplaces such as Ottawa and places such as Tiffin. It is just too \nexpensive to have to go looking for jobs in rural Ohio too often.\n  There is another reason to extend unemployment benefits: patriotism \ndemands it. Our Nation is not defined by its borders, it is defined by \nits people. Millions of people are running out of unemployment \nbenefits. They need our help, and they need it now. We cannot claim to \nbe American patriots and ignore the American people. It is not just a \nstrong military. It is not just pride of country or wearing an American \nflag pin. It is that, too, for sure. But patriotism is helping our \npeople. Patriotism is a covenant we have between our Government and our \npeople.\n  That means if you work hard and play by the rules--if you work hard \nand you play by the rules--you are able to get ahead. That means if \nyour company closed, if your company laid off workers and you happened \nto be one of the unlucky souls who got laid off, it may be that the \nGovernment, your neighborhood, your country, your community, can help \nyou until you can find your new job. Workers, their families, their \ncommunities--we cannot continue to ignore them.\n  When my Republican friends talk about patriotism, they talk about \nwhatever it is we need to do--tax cuts for corporations, to provide \njobs, all that. They ought to start talking about workers because we \nknow the wealth in this country is created by productive workers. \nWorkers in this country are more productive than they have ever been. \nThey produce more wealth for their employers. It is time that they \nshared--that employers, as their profits go up, even in not-as-good \neconomic times, as their profits go up, it is time more of that wealth \nwas shared with workers. It is time those workers who are working their \nhearts out get a little reward, playing by the rules, get some \nadvantage, get some opportunity, have the opportunity to get ahead.\n  We have a responsibility to listen to Americans who are not employed \nand probably believe they have nowhere to turn. They can turn to us. \nThey should turn to us. We should not turn our backs on them. That is \nwhat too many people in this institution, too many people at the White \nHouse, too many people in this whole Bush-Cheney-McCain idea of how to \nrun an economy--clearly, they have not done that good a job on Wall \nStreet or on Main Street. It is the way they may look at things. I got \nelected to the Senate in 2006 because people thought their country \nbetrayed them. They saw the drug companies writing the Medicare laws; \nthey saw the insurance industry writing health care legislation; they \nsaw the oil industry dictate energy policies; they saw Wall Street jam \ndown the American peoples' throats these job-killing trade agreements. \nThis Government, this administration, has betrayed the middle class.\n  We want a government where the public can turn to us, they should \nturn to us, and we will not turn our backs. No, we will actually \nembrace them and work with them. We can start by extending unemployment \ninsurance. Senator Reed has a bill to do that. We should pass it. We \nshould move on and begin to change this country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night I reluctantly voted in favor of \nthe Economic Stabilization Act. I want to emphasize the word \n``reluctantly.'' I did so because the Nation's financial system faces \nserious challenges, and it was important for us to act. However, I am \nunder no illusion. While this rescue plan will likely calm and \nstabilize the financial system, at least in the short term, it is not \nas strong as it should be in terms of protecting taxpayers' money, and \nit does not get at the underlying problem of what got us here in the \nfirst place.\n  Over the last week, I worked with a number of other Senators to \nimprove this measure that was in the House, that the House turned down. \nFor example, I joined with a group of Senators in developing and \ncreating a special inspector general to oversee the emergency efforts \nof the Treasury Department and to investigate the inevitable waste, \nfraud, and abuse as the bailout goes forward. I say ``inevitable'' \nbecause when you have $700 billion sloshing around out there and you \nhave one person sort of deciding where it goes, that just invites a lot \nof mischief. So we have this special inspector general to oversee that. \nThat was a good addition. I am pleased that recommendation was included \nin the final bill.\n  I am disappointed that the limits on executive compensation in the \nbill are not as strong as I would have liked and others would have \nliked. The final decisions on executive compensation are left to the \nSecretary, who, by his background, training, and everything, is \ncertainly no champion of limits on executive compensation. Look at his \nown background, for example. I felt and still feel we should have \ndefinitive, hard limits on executive compensation. If they are going to \ncome in here and ask the taxpayers to bail them out, they are, in fact, \nbecoming, effectively, like Government employees, and they should not \nmake anything more, I have often said, than the highest paid Government \nemployee, who is the President of the United States. If they do not \nlike it, they do not have to come to us for the taxpayers to bail them \nout. So that is something we are going to have to fix.\n  Likewise, the final decision on acquiring stock in participating \nbanks--that is, getting equity positions--is crucial to protecting \ntaxpayers' money. The decision on what we do on equity is left up to \nthe Secretary\n\n[[Page S10408]]\n\nagain--either this Secretary or whoever follows this Secretary--and \nthis Secretary has indicated he does not favor the Government taking an \nequity stake. Well, I beg to differ. Again, if our taxpayers are being \nasked to put up their money and to put this debt on their children and \ntheir grandchildren, well, they and their children and grandchildren \nought to have an equity stake, and nothing less will suffice. Again, \nthat is something else that has to be fixed.\n  In addition, I am disappointed that banks are still not required by \nlaw to open their books so we can determine how they valued the assets \nthe Government will be purchasing. We need full disclosure and \ntransparency from participating institutions. If we are going to invest \ntaxpayers' money in these banks and acquire their debt portfolios, then \nwe need to know the details of their methods and their proprietary \nmodels for placing values on those portfolios. It is not enough for \nthem to give us the balance sheet. That is not enough. What we need to \nknow is how they got there in the first place, what models they used \ninternally to decide how they would place the value on a certain asset, \nhow they decided how much to pay for a certain asset and how much to \nsell that asset to someone else.\n  Therein lies perhaps some of the answers to the questions of how we \ngot here in the first place. Again, there is nothing in this bill that \nwould require them to do it, but they have to be forced to do that. You \nwill hear: There is transparency; we put transparency in the bill. The \ntransparency is in terms of the Secretary buying the assets and how \nthat is done and it is all open and aboveboard. There is nothing in \nthis bill that requires transparency to look at their books to see how \nthey got there in the first place.\n  Ask yourself this question: You have a company. For a number of \nreasons, you are going underwater, you are going bankrupt. You go to a \nbank to get a loan to get back on your feet, hopefully to get up and \noperating again. Is the bank going to be satisfied with looking at your \nbalance sheet, your assets and debits? No. The bank is going to want to \nknow what got you in trouble. Why are you here seeking our help? What \nwere you doing there that got you into this trouble? Let's look at all \nyour books. No bank is going to loan you money based upon your balance \nsheet, if you are underwater, declaring bankruptcy or about to.\n  We are the bank now, the taxpayers. The Federal Government is now the \nbank. When they come to us and they have assets and they put in this \nreverse auction, we ought to say: OK, let's take a look at your books; \nnot just your balance sheet, but how did you get to the valuation of \nthose assets? How did you come by those assets? What did you pay for \nthose assets? Why didn't you pay that much for those assets? What was \nthe model you used when you went to the computers and all these \n``brainiac'' people decided how much they would pay for these assets? \nThat is a very important point to know. And, if we are to protect the \ntaxpayers, we need to fully understand all of the details about these \nfinancial paper we may be buying which may prevent our overpaying.\n  I brought that up with Secretary Paulson in a meeting. I couldn't \nbelieve his response. His response was: We can't do that because a lot \nof times they don't even know how they got there.\n  That is true. You can ask a lot of Senators who were in that meeting \nwhen I asked the question. That was his response. They don't even know \nhow they got there.\n  I am sorry. They do know how they got there. If they flipped a coin, \nthey ought to tell us that is what they did. But I don't think that \nhappened. It happened because they had internal accounting structures \nand computer models that they used to decide how much to pay for an \nasset, to buy it or not, how much to put it on their books as, maybe \nsometimes how much to sell it at. That is what we need to know. Don't \ntell me they don't have that information. They do. I know it is \nproprietary but, nonetheless, if they are coming to us asking us to buy \nthese assets, we have to know how they got there. If we know that, then \nthat helps us next year when we come back to change the fundamentals, \nto put in more regulation, more oversight of financial markets, which \nwe have to do. But if we don't know how they got there, how are we \ngoing to know, as makers of public policy and protecting the taxpayers \nin the future, what we need to do in the regulatory scheme? I am \ndisappointed that we don't have that.\n  There is one other aspect of this bill that troubles me. That is the \nfact that we put all the $700 billion basically out there on the table. \nAgain, Secretary Paulson was asked by Senator Schumer of New York, was \nhe going to spend all that $700 billion in the first couple weeks. He \nsaid, no, it will take about $50 billion a month. This raised a lot of \nquestions in my mind and the minds of others. If it is $50 billion per \nmonth, why do we to have give you 700? Why don't we give you $50 \nbillion for the next 4 or 5 months, and then we will sunset it and take \na look at it, see how it works. If it works, come back. Congress, I am \nsure, would be more than happy then to debate it and extend this. I \nthought that was a good proposal. In other words, put out 5 months' \nworth, put out $250 or $300 billion, sunset it, come back in February. \nLet's see how it is working. Is this working? Is it not working? Then \nmake the decision whether we want to put another $350 billion of \ntaxpayer money out there.\n  What happened, finally, in the bill is a scheme that they put out, I \nthink, $250 billion right now. The Secretary can get another $100 \nbillion by the President snapping his fingers, saying: I want it. He \ngets $100 billion. Then, to get access to the other $350 billion, there \nhas to be a request from the President. Then Congress has 15 days in \nwhich to deny it. They get it, but we have 15 days in which to deny it.\n  You might say: Well, that is some protection. It is. Except if we \ndeny it, the President can override it. He can veto that. Then we have \nto have a two-thirds vote to override the veto in both Houses. So this \nis heavily skewed toward letting the executive branch decide on the \nfull $700 billion. This is something we ought to come back and fix when \nwe return in January. Again, there were some questions raised about \nthat $700 billion.\n  I was interested to read in Forbes, September 23, it says:\n\n       In fact, some of the most basic details, including the $700 \n     billion figure Treasury would use to buy up bad debt, are \n     fuzzy. ``It's not based on any particular data point,'' a \n     Treasury spokeswoman told Forbes.com Tuesday. ``We just \n     wanted to choose a really large number.''\n\n  So the $700 billion, where did it come from? They wanted a large \nnumber. Tell that to the taxpayers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from forbes.com entitled \n``Bad News for the Bailout,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Forbes.com, Sept. 23, 2008]\n\n                        Bad News for the Bailout\n\n                 (By Brian Wingfield and Josh Zumbrun)\n\n       Lawmakers on Capitol Hill seem determined to work together \n     to pass a bill that will get the credit markets churning \n     again. But will they do it this week, as some had hoped just \n     a few days ago? Don't count on it.\n       ``Do I expect to pass something this week?'' Senate \n     Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., mused to reporters \n     Tuesday. ``I expect to pass something as soon as we can. I \n     think its important that we get it done right, not get it \n     done fast.''\n       Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, says his office has gotten \n     ``close to zero'' calls in support of the $700 billion plan \n     proposed by the administration. He doubts it'll happen \n     immediately either. ``I don't think it has to be a week'' he \n     says. ``If we do it right, then we need to take as long as it \n     needs.''\n       The more Congress examines the Bush administration's \n     bailout plan, the hazier its outcome gets. At a Senate \n     Banking Committee hearing Tuesday, lawmakers on both sides of \n     the aisle complained of being rushed to pass legislation or \n     else risk financial meltdown.\n       ``The secretary and the administration need to know that \n     what they have sent to us is not acceptable,'' says Committee \n     Chairman Chris Dodd, D-Conn. The committee's top Republican, \n     Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, says he's concerned about its \n     cost and whether it will even work.\n       In fact, some of the most basic details, including the $700 \n     billion figure Treasury would use to buy up bad debt, are \n     fuzzy.\n       ``It's not based on any particular data point,'' a Treasury \n     spokeswoman told Forbes.com Tuesday. ``We just wanted to \n     choose a really large number.''\n       Wow. If it wants to see a bailout bill passed soon, the \n     administration's going to have to\n\n[[Page S10409]]\n\n     come up with some hard answers to hard questions. Public \n     support for it already seems to be waning. According to a \n     Rasmussen Reports poll released Tuesday, 44 percent of those \n     surveyed oppose the administration's plan, up from 37 percent \n     Monday.\n       Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve \n     Chairman Ben Bernanke, who testified before the Senate \n     committee Tuesday, will get a chance to fine tune their \n     answers Wednesday afternoon, when they appear before the \n     House Financial Services Committee.\n       A spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says \n     she is optimistic that the House will pass a bill this week. \n     But that doesn't mean the Senate, which is by nature more \n     sluggish than its larger counterpart on the other side of \n     Capitol Hill, will be so quick to act.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. With all my concerns, why did I vote for the bill? For \nthe following reasons: We did get a change in the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation insurance on banks. It was raised from $100,000 \nto $250,000. That is even too low. That is an inflationary increase. \nThat is where FDIC would be today in their insurance on deposits in \nbanks if, in fact, it had kept pace with inflation. Quite frankly, it \nwould be more than that. I think it ought to be at least $1 million. \nSome people are advocating that it ought to be removed completely. \nIreland did that. They raised their deposit insurance completely off \nall the banks. I don't know if I would go that far, but it ought to be \nat least a million or so because I think depositors would be more \ncomfortable choosing smaller retail banks and community banks. Smaller \nindependent banks have more conservative investment standards. They are \nbetter regulated. They are more likely to lend to small businesses and \nmanufacturers which are the backbone of our American economy. Again, \nmany of the independent banks in Iowa and around the United States do a \ndarn good job of investing depositors' money. They invest it in local \nbusinesses, manufacturers, startup companies or expansions, the \nbackbone of the American economy, sort of where the rubber meets the \nroad, where people get jobs. Yet they are limited to $100,000 right \nnow. At least this raises it to $250,000, and it should be a lot more. \nDepositors would feel more comfortable putting money in those banks.\n  Right now big depositors feel very comfortable putting $20 million in \nCitibank. Why? Their deposits are not guaranteed, but they know \nCitibank is too big to fail. We now know some of these banks are now \ngoing to be--JPMorgan Chase--too big to fail. Let's put all our money \nthere. The Government is not going to let them fail.\n  Quite frankly, I believe very strongly that a lot of our smaller, \nindependent banks do a much better job of investing our money than some \nof the New York banks that used to be investment banks but now want to \nbecome depository banks. I was happy to at least raise the FDIC to \n$250,000. I think it should be higher, but at least that is better than \nnothing.\n  The fact is, the choice was either to vote for the bill, despite its \nflaws, or do nothing, and doing nothing was not an acceptable option. I \nam hopeful that in the short term this rescue package will work to calm \nmarkets and restore confidence in the financial system and loosen up on \nwhat is called the liquidity crisis. We are hearing of instances where \nsmall businesses in Iowa cannot get the funds that they need. We are \nhearing about construction projects that are being cancelled. That is \ncosting jobs in my state. I hope it will have an effect worldwide of \ncalming things. But I also hope and insist that we come back early next \nyear to strengthen and improve the rescue framework. I will be working \nwith others to do that. As I said, we need to strengthen the equity \nposition of taxpayers. We have to redo that $700 billion and how that \nis parceled out. We have to be stronger on executive compensation and \nequity.\n  We need to look, at that point in time, at whether we want to also \nuse this money, rather than going in at the top, maybe to go in at the \nbottom, to help homeowners with their mortgages. I have often said \nthere were two ways of approaching this bailout. You put it in at the \ntop, and it trickles down or you put it in at the bottom and it \npercolates up. I would prefer putting it in at the bottom and letting \nit percolate up. We know that trickle-down economics has failed this \ncountry time and time again. As one worker told me once, he said: You \nknow, I have heard all about this trickle down. I have been waiting. I \nhaven't felt a drop. I would settle for a heavy dew. I haven't even \nseen that.\n  We know what works. We know that when you put money in at the bottom, \nit does percolate up. Our whole economy is strengthened because of it. \nWhen we come back, that is what we have to do in January and February, \nchange this thing around.\n  I might mention one other thing. When we come back, we have to do \nsomething about credit card debt. I keep hearing everyone talking about \na credit crunch. When I talk to my constituents about a credit crunch, \nthey think I am talking about credit cards. I was told there is \nsomething floating around this country, nine credit cards for every \nindividual. I don't know if that is true, but that is what they say. I \nread that. We know there are too many credit cards. We know credit \ncards are too easy to get. One of the reasons they are so easy to get \nis because the interest rates are out of sight, and people don't know \nwhat they are being charged for interest on their credit cards. These \nyoung people get credit cards sent to them as soon as they graduate. \nThey get one after another. Credit cards are easy to use. Then you get \nthe bill, but you can roll it over and pay it next month. OK, maybe I \ncan do that. But they don't realize that 12 percent or 15 percent this \nmonth can rise up to 28 percent; and not just for the next month, it \ncan impact purchases made before that point. Now you are paying 28 \npercent on items you buy. So many people have been hooked on this, \nusing their credit cards. So we have to do something about the credit \ncard debt.\n  There is a bill called the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility \nand Disclosure Act, the CARD Act, of which I am a cosponsor. As we come \nback in January and February, that is something else we are going to \nhave to incorporate into this so-called bailout.\n  There is one other thing we will have to do. I was sorry to see it \nlost in the Senate earlier this week. That is the stimulus package. We \nhad a package to put money in at the bottom, let it percolate up, by \nhelping people with extending their unemployment benefits which has the \nbiggest bang for the buck in terms of economic stimulus. People on food \nstamps, investing in rebuilding our schools, our roads, bridges, our \nsewer and water systems, that goes directly to people, and it helps \nstimulate the economy and puts people to work. That bill had a pricetag \nof about $56 billion. That is not chump change. That is lot of money: \n$56 billion. But do you know, in what we just voted on last night with \n$700 billion, $54 billion is, what, not quite 8 percent of what we \nvoted on last night, which we turned down earlier this week to \nstimulate the economy by putting people to work. Well, I think we have \nto come back and do that again next year. That is to stimulate our \neconomy.\n\n  But there are some other provisions in the rescue bill that are \nextremely important and valuable. The bill includes a number of tax \nprovisions important to Iowans in particular, including energy \nproduction tax credits for producers of wind energy and biomass energy. \nThat will create a lot of new jobs in Iowa and continue the jobs we \nhave.\n  They are important tax provisions, added by my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, on the Finance Committee that I have been a strong supporter \nof, to help the victims of the floods we had in Iowa, to help them get \nback on their feet, to help the small businesses get back on their \nfeet. It is vitally important to get our economy going back in the \nState of Iowa. That was in the bill last night.\n  There is also a provision in there to improve the prospects for the \nconstruction of ethanol pipelines--something vitally important to the \nfledgling biofuels industry that I have led on. It is important to get \nethanol back to the east coast, where a lot of people live, from the \nMidwest where we produce it. That was also in the bill last night.\n  In addition, there was another thing in that bill last night that we \nhave been trying to do for many years around here, and that is to get \nmental health parity. In other words, if you have health insurance, \nthey would treat mental health, an addiction, just the same as they \nwould any other\n\n[[Page S10410]]\n\nhealth problem. We have been trying to get that for years, and we \nfinally got it in the bill last night. That will make sure families \nstruggling with mental illness do not have that challenge compounded by \nhaving to pay for it out of their pockets. It will be covered by their \ninsurance. It is named after Senator Paul Wellstone and Senator Pete \nDomenici, both of whom worked very hard to get it passed.\n  Well, Mr. President, it was an overwhelming, bipartisan vote last \nnight. There are a lot of reasons we need to come back, as I said, next \nyear and make some changes, and we will do that. Hopefully, as I said, \nthis will calm the markets.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to ask consent for a number of articles to \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  One is an article by Jonathan Koppell and William Goetzmann entitled \n``The Trickle-Up Bailout.'' I will quote from one part of it. It says:\n\n       The financial crisis is a liquidity crisis, yes, but it is \n     ultimately a product of homeowner failures to pay. Unless \n     this fundamental problem is fixed, we will continue to see--\n     and need to treat--the symptoms. The proposed bailout ignores \n     this. Yet the sum being demanded from taxpayers is almost \n     certainly more than sufficient to pay off all currently \n     delinquent mortgages.\n\n  They call this the ``trickle down,'' what we passed, rather than the \n``trickle up'' bailout.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will also ask consent that an article by \nHarold Meyerson entitled ``Slow Rise for a New Era'' be included in the \nRecord. Again, I will quote from that article. Mr. Meyerson talked \nabout this bill being passed. He said:\n\n       If that happens--\n\n  If we pass this bill--\n\n     the next move would be for Democrats to craft a solution more \n     in the spirit of FDR:\n\n  Franklin Roosevelt.\n\n       Save American capitalism by fundamentally reshaping it. \n     They could direct the government to raise the amount of \n     depositors' money it insures--\n\n  We did in the bill last night a little bit--\n\n     to compel the banks to write down their losses, to \n     recapitalize the banks by taking a significant equity \n     interest in them, and to refinance beleaguered homeowners \n     directly.\n\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that article be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will also ask consent that a list of \neconomists who signed a letter saying there are better ways to approach \nthe problems we have in our financial institutions rather than what we \ndid last night be printed in the Record. It is a letter that was sent \nto the Speaker and the President. They said:\n\n       As economists, we want to express to Congress our great \n     concern for the plan proposed by Treasury Secretary Paulson \n     to deal with the financial crisis. . . .We see three fatal \n     pitfalls in the currently proposed plan:\n       (1) Its fairness. . . .\n       (2) Its ambiguity. . . .\n       (3) Its long-term effects. . . .\n\n  So, Mr. President, I ask consent that this list also be printed in \nthe Record to show that--again, the one thing that bothered me in the \nhearings we had on this plan is, we only heard from the administration. \nWe only heard from people who were for the plan. Why didn't we hear \nfrom other people, 200 other economists, Nobel prize-winning \neconomists, who say there is a better way of doing this, folks?\n  I think when we come back in January, and perhaps even between now \nand January, we ought to be hearing from these people to see what \nchanges we ought to make in this proposal when we come back in January.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter and list printed in the \nRecord at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Lastly, Mr. President, I have an article by William \nIsaac, former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It is \na Washington Post article dated September 27, entitled ``A Better Way \nto Aid Banks.'' I also ask unanimous consent that article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, to sum it up, as I said when I started, I \nreluctantly supported this bill. I hope it will calm the markets. But I \nam under no illusions that what we did last night solves the problem of \nwhy we got here in the first place. To that end, we have to come back. \nWe have to have hearings. We have to bring in other people. We have to \nget a better handle on what was going on, and next year, with a new \nadministration and a new Congress, I think one of the first things we \nhave to do is to fix this, make it more equitable, make it more fair to \nthe taxpayers of this country, and to get at the underlying \nfundamentals of why we are here and not just to be satisfied with \nstopping the bleeding, which is what we did last night.\n  So, Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         The Trickle-Up Bailout\n\n          (By Jonathan G.S. Koppell and William N. Goetzmann)\n\n       The theory underlying the bailout plan stalled in Congress \n     is that rescuing the finance industry will restore market \n     stability and that the benefits will eventually trickle down \n     to average Americans. Thus, solving the sub-prime mortgage \n     crisis has morphed into a much larger challenge: reassembling \n     the architecture of the financial markets, which seemingly \n     requires giving the Treasury secretary nearly a trillion \n     dollars and extraordinary latitude to pick winners and \n     losers.\n       There is an easier and more politically palatable fix: Pay \n     off all the delinquent mortgages.\n       The financial crisis is a liquidity crisis, yes, but it is \n     ultimately a product of homeowner failures to pay. Unless \n     this fundamental problem is fixed, we will continue to see--\n     and need to treat--the symptoms. The proposed bailout ignores \n     this. Yet the sum being demanded from taxpayers is almost \n     certainly more than sufficient to pay off all currently \n     delinquent mortgages.\n       If the government did this, all the complex derivatives \n     based on these mortgages would be as good as U.S. Treasuries. \n     Their fair value would jump to 100 cents on the dollar, \n     rescuing teetering financial institutions. The credit markets \n     would be resuscitated overnight. Foreclosures would stop.\n       Some will argue that it is grossly unfair to pay off the \n     mortgages of borrowers who took risks and lost. In other \n     words, why should my profligate neighbor be rewarded for \n     over-leveraging himself?\n       Because such unfairness is a small price to pay to avoid a \n     rapid transition to a socialist economy, the collapse of our \n     financial system (and its related global implications) and a \n     frightening shift of economic power toward the executive \n     branch. Why shell out $700 billion to Wall Street dealmakers \n     and the companies they managed into this mess? Wouldn't it be \n     preferable for individual homeowners to benefit directly?\n       Implementation could follow the example of the Home Owners' \n     Loan Corp., which in the 1930s issued new mortgages to a \n     quarter of American homeowners. The government could offer to \n     refinance all mortgages issued in the past five years with a \n     fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage at 6 percent. No credit scores, \n     no questions asked; just pay off the principal of the \n     existing mortgage with a government check. If monthly \n     payments are still too high, homeowners could reduce their \n     indebtedness in exchange for a share of the future price \n     appreciation of the house. That is, the government would take \n     an ownership interest in the house just as it would take an \n     ownership interest in the financial institutions that would \n     be bailed out under the Treasury's plan.\n       All this could be done through the Federal Housing \n     Administration, with the help of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \n     which have the infrastructure to implement this plan rapidly. \n     An equity participation structure would prevent thousands of \n     foreclosed homes from being dumped on a strained housing \n     market and would allow prices to reach a new equilibrium that \n     is based on realistic demand for houses rather than on easy \n     money or impending foreclosures.\n       Like the administration's proposal, this plan would result \n     in the government owning assets. But these assets would be \n     real estate, not complex derivatives whose true value would \n     take weeks to discern. Homeowners would become partners with \n     the government in resolving the crisis.\n       When Congress returns, lawmakers are likely to modify and \n     then pass the administration's bailout proposal. They should \n     consider ways to implement this bottom-up solution. Combining \n     this approach with the government's proposal could greatly \n     benefit taxpayers. Yes, the government's swift purchase of \n     illiquid securities would stabilize compromised financial \n     institutions and the credit markets. But the notion that \n     taxpayers would benefit in the long run is pure speculation, \n     particularly if the government\n\n[[Page S10411]]\n\n     overpaid for the securities. On the other hand, once a \n     government-sponsored refinancing wave kicked in, the full \n     value of the securities in the government's portfolio would \n     be restored, and they could be sold off in an orderly manner, \n     with Uncle Sam taking profits that would cover the cost of \n     the bailout.\n       The public is rightly concerned that the administration's \n     bailout would benefit only powerful financial institutions. \n     No matter how it's done, rescuing the financial system is a \n     large, complex gamble.\n       This solution would start by helping ordinary Americans and \n     would quickly spill over to revive the financial markets. \n     Directly addressing the underlying cause of the crisis would \n     help ensure that we would not be facing the same crisis again \n     down the road. While Wall Street has only recently felt the \n     bite of foreclosures delinquencies, communities across the \n     nation will face greater financial and social fallout if the \n     foreclosure crisis continues.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                        Slow Rise for a New Era\n\n                          (By Harold Meyerson)\n\n       We are, just now, stuck between eras. The old order--the \n     Reagan-age institutions built on the premise that the market \n     can do no wrong and the government no right--is dying. A new \n     order, in which Wall Street plays a diminished role and \n     Washington a larger one, is aborning, but the process is \n     painful and protracted.\n       It shuddered to a halt on Monday, when House Republicans, \n     by 2 to 1, declined to support the administration's bailout \n     plan. To lay the blame on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's speech (in \n     which she even noted the work of House GOP leaders in \n     crafting the compromise) is to miss the larger picture: The \n     proposal asked Republicans to acknowledge the failure of the \n     market and the capacity of government to set things right. It \n     asked them to repudiate their worldview, to go against the \n     beliefs that impelled many of them to enter politics in the \n     first place.\n       So as America experienced a financial crisis, House \n     Republicans experienced a crisis of faith. And on Monday, \n     most of them opted to stick to their faith, whatever the \n     financial consequences for the nation.\n       Many of the Republicans' counterproposals to the bailout \n     bill were so wide of the mark that they can be understood \n     only as faith-based solutions to empirical problems. Banks \n     and investment houses are toppling like so many dominos, and, \n     to solve this crisis of capital evaporation, House \n     Republicans suggested reducing capital gains tax. Are we to \n     believe that more investors didn't rush to rescue \n     LehmanBearAIG-WaMuWachoviaEtc because they calculated that \n     the tax on the capital gains they'd realize was too high?\n       Then again, the bill that the Republicans opposed was \n     itself a transitional document--to some extent ushering in a \n     new order, though designed chiefly to prop up the old. The \n     bailout plan's political travails can be traced to its \n     conception--a three-page proposal for the Treasury secretary, \n     who is the immediate past CEO of Wall Street's most \n     successful investment bank, to buy up financial institutions' \n     bad loans at prices he would set, with no oversight and no \n     aid to anybody else. End of story. The bill that went to the \n     House floor Monday had been significantly improved: It \n     created the possibility that the public would gain a limited \n     equity interest in some banks in return for the public's \n     largess; it restricted Wall Street CEO pay; it allowed for a \n     stock-transaction tax to cover any public losses if such \n     still existed after five years. But it had been stamped at \n     birth as a bailout for Wall Street, by a Treasury Department \n     that didn't see the glaringly obvious political problems that \n     created.\n       It's possible that with a few cosmetic changes, the bill \n     can be passed by the House tomorrow. Or it may be that the \n     prospect of bailing out Wall Street with public funds offends \n     so many House members at both ends of the political spectrum \n     that it goes down to defeat again.\n       If that happens, the next move would be for Democrats to \n     craft a solution more in the spirit of FDR: Save American \n     capitalism by fundamentally reshaping it. They could direct \n     the government to raise the amount of depositors' money it \n     insures, to compel the banks to write down their losses, to \n     recapitalize the banks by taking a significant equity \n     interest in them, and to refinance beleaguered homeowners \n     directly.\n       Already, it's clear that we will emerge from this crisis \n     with fewer but bigger banks. As a result of the recent \n     government-arranged consolidations and fire sales, three \n     banks--JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup--will \n     control roughly one-third of all deposits. They will be too \n     big to fail. They will also be so big that they'll be able to \n     set the price for money when Americans come borrowing.\n       As such, they will require tighter regulation than we've \n     imposed on banks before. And that's hardly the only arena in \n     which government will have to do more. With financial \n     institutions de-leveraging and lending less, it will fall \n     upon the government to invest more in the American economy--\n     to diminish the effects of the recession that is coming down \n     the tracks and to build the kind of infrastructure that will \n     enhance American competitiveness in a global economy.\n       It's not just investment banks that have fallen by the \n     wayside in the recent carnage; it's the ideology of \n     unregulated capitalism--of Reaganism. And if Republicans \n     cannot find a way to disenthrall themselves from their faith \n     in their old gods, they may ensure that the GOP itself \n     becomes one more casualty in the collapse of laissez faire.\n                                  ____\n\n       (This letter was sent to Congress on Wed., Sept. 24, 2008, \n     regarding the Treasury plan as outlined on that date. It does \n     not reflect all signatories' views on subsequent plans or \n     modifications of the bill.)\n       To the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the \n     President pro tempore of the Senate: As economists, we want \n     to express to Congress our great concern for the plan \n     proposed by Treasury Secretary Paulson to deal with the \n     financial crisis. We are well aware of the difficulty of the \n     current financial situation and we agree with the need for \n     bold action to ensure that the financial system continues to \n     function. We see three fatal pitfalls in the currently \n     proposed plan:\n       (1) Its fairness. The plan is a subsidy to investors at \n     taxpayers' expense. Investors who took risks to earn profits \n     must also bear the losses. Not every business failure carries \n     systemic risk. The government can ensure a well-functioning \n     financial industry, able to make new loans to creditworthy \n     borrowers, without bailing out particular investors and \n     institutions whose choices proved unwise.\n       (2) Its ambiguity. Neither the mission of the new agency \n     nor its oversight are clear. If taxpayers are to buy illiquid \n     and opaque assets from troubled sellers, the terms, \n     occasions, and methods of such purchases must be crystal \n     clear ahead of time and carefully monitored afterwards.\n       (3) Its long-term effects. If the plan is enacted, its \n     effects will be with us for a generation. For all their \n     recent troubles, America's dynamic and innovative private \n     capital markets have brought the nation unparalleled \n     prosperity. Fundamentally weakening those markets in order to \n     calm short-run disruptions is desperately short-sighted.\n       For these reasons we ask Congress not to rush, to hold \n     appropriate hearings, and to carefully consider the right \n     course of action, and to wisely determine the future of the \n     financial industry and the U.S. economy for years to come.\n       Signed\n       Acemoglu Daron (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); \n     Ackerberg Daniel (UCLA); Adler Michael (Columbia University); \n     Admati Anat R.

Isaac)\n\n       Congressional leaders are badly divided on the Treasury \n     plan to purchase $700 billion in troubled loans. Their angst \n     is understandable: It is far from clear that the plan is \n     necessary or will accomplish its objectives.\n       It's worth recalling that our country dealt with far more \n     credit problems in the 1980s in a far harsher economic \n     environment than it faces today. About 3,000 bank and thrift \n     failures were handled without producing depositor panics and \n     massive instability in the financial system.\n       The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has just handled \n     Washington Mutual, now the largest bank failure in history, \n     in an orderly manner, with no cost to the FDIC fund or \n     taxpayers. This is proof that our time-tested system for \n     resolving banking problems works.\n       One argument for the urgency of the Treasury proposal is \n     that money market funds were under a great deal of pressure \n     last week as investors lost confidence and began withdrawing \n     their money. But putting the government's guarantee behind \n     money market funds--as Treasury did last week--should have \n     resolved this concern.\n       Another rationale for acting immediately on the bailout is \n     that bank depositors are getting panicky--mostly in reaction \n     to the July failure of IndyMac, in which uninsured depositors \n     were exposed to loss.\n       Does this mean that we need to enact an emergency program \n     to purchase $700 billion worth of real estate loans? If the \n     problem is depositor confidence, perhaps we need to be \n     clearer about the fact that the FDIC fund is backed by the \n     full faith and credit of the government.\n       If stronger action is needed, the FDIC could announce that \n     it will handle all bank failures, except those involving \n     significant fraudulent activities, as assisted mergers that \n     would protect all depositors and other general creditors. \n     This is how the FDIC handled Washington Mutual. It would be \n     easy to announce this as a temporary program if needed to \n     calm depositors.\n       An additional benefit of this approach is that community \n     banks would be put on a par with the largest banks, \n     reassuring depositors who are unconvinced that the government \n     will protect uninsured depositors in small banks.\n       I have doubts that the $700 billion bailout, if enacted, \n     would work. Would banks really be willing to part with the \n     loans, and would the government be able to sell them in the \n     marketplace on terms that the taxpayers would find \n     acceptable?\n       To get banks to sell the loans, the government would need \n     to buy them at a price greater than what the private sector \n     would pay today. Many investors are open to purchasing the \n     loans now, but the financial institutions and investors \n     cannot agree on price. Thus private money is sitting on the \n     sidelines until there is clear evidence that we are at the \n     floor in real estate.\n       Having financial institutions sell the loans to the \n     government at inflated prices so the government can turn \n     around and sell the loans to well-heeled investors at lower \n     prices strikes me as a very good deal for everyone but U.S. \n     taxpayers. Surely we can do better.\n       One alternative is a ``net worth certificate'' program \n     along the lines of what Congress enacted in the 1980s for the \n     savings and loan industry. It was a big success and could \n     work in the current climate. The FDIC resolved a $100 billion \n     insolvency in the savings banks for a total cost of less than \n     $2 billion.\n       The net worth certificate program was designed to shore up \n     the capital of weak banks to give them more time to resolve \n     their problems. The program involved no subsidy and no cash \n     outlay.\n       The FDIC purchased net worth certificates (subordinated \n     debentures, a commonly used form of capital in banks) in \n     troubled banks that the agency determined could be viable if \n     they were given more time. Banks entering the program had to \n     agree to strict supervision from the FDIC, including \n     oversight of compensation of top executives and removal of \n     poor management.\n       The FDIC paid for the net worth certificates by issuing \n     FDIC senior notes to the banks; there was no cash outlay. The \n     interest rate on the net worth certificates and the FDIC \n     notes was identical, so there was no subsidy.\n       If such a program were enacted today, the capital position \n     of banks with real estate\n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\n     holdings would be bolstered, giving those banks the ability \n     to sell and restructure assets and get on with their \n     rehabilitation. No taxpayer money would be spent, and the \n     asset sale transactions would remain in the private sector \n     where they belong.\n       If we were to (1) implement a program to ease the fears of \n     depositors and other general creditors of banks; (2) keep \n     tight restrictions on short sellers of financial stocks; (3) \n     suspend fair-value accounting (which has contributed mightily \n     to our problems by marking assets to unrealistic fire-sale \n     prices); and (4) authorize a net worth certificate program, \n     we could settle the financial markets without significant \n     expense to taxpayers.\n       Say Congress spends $700 billion of taxpayer money on the \n     loan purchase proposal. What do we do next? If, however, we \n     implement the program suggested above, we will have $700 \n     billion of dry powder we can put to work in targeted tax \n     incentives if needed to get the economy moving again.\n       The banks do not need taxpayers to carry their loans. They \n     need proper accounting and regulatory policies that will give \n     them time to work through their problems.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I know this is kind of a hectic time in \nCongress. We are trying to get bills passed. People want to get home to \ncampaign and for the election. But I want to highlight a very important \nbill I am working on with my colleague, Congressman Bruce Braley from \nthe State of Iowa.\n  I would like to urge my colleagues to take the time to look at this \nimportant measure. It is H.R. 5167, the Justice for Victims of Torture \nand Terrorism Act. I am hopeful when we are back in November--and we \nwill be back on the 17th doing business--we will be able to pass this \nbill and send it to the President for his signature.\n  Let me highlight some of the bill's most important aspects. H.R. 5167 \nwill finally provide justice for American prisoners of war and \ncivilians who were taken hostage and tortured by Saddam Hussein's \nregime.\n  These victims include 17 American prisoners of war who were tortured \nunder Saddam Hussein's regime and who sought compensation through the \ncourts. These victims also include CBS reporter Bob Simon and his \ncameraman, Roberto Alvarez, who were captured and tortured along with \nthe POWs.\n  These brave POWs were beaten and starved by Saddam Hussein's regime, \nand they were awarded compensation from a U.S. judge until the Bush \nadministration lawyers intervened in the case and said it should be \nthrown out.\n  These victims were, again, denied justice by the Bush administration \nwhen President Bush vetoed H.R. 1585, the fiscal year 2008 National \nDefense Authorization Act, which would have allowed Americans tortured \nby Saddam Hussein's regime to pursue justice in U.S. courts.\n  This bill, H.R. 5167, is the result of a bipartisan compromise that \npassed the House unanimously--unanimously--on September 15. The bill \ngives the Government of Iraq 90 days to resolve the claims of American \nvictims of Iraqi torture and terrorism for minimal amounts before the \nwaiver that was put into last year's DOD bill would be terminated. As a \nresult of the bipartisan compromise made in the House, the waiver would \nremain in place as long as the President certifies that Iraq has not \nsettled commercial claims or that the administration is engaged in \ngood-faith negotiations with Iraq to settle the claims of the victims. \nLet me point out, the compensation due these victims would not be U.S. \ntaxpayer money but coming from the Iraqi treasury. It is time these \nvictims are compensated. This bill will allow that to happen.\n  Right now, the Iraqi Government is depositing billions--billions--of \ndollars in U.S. banks in the U.S. and billions in other places around \nthe world. Surely--surely--they can help compensate the 17 American \nprisoners of war and others who were tortured and beaten under Saddam \nHussein.\n  So, again, as I pointed out, it passed the House unanimously. I urge \nmy colleagues to take a look at this bill. I am hopeful when we come \nback in November we can take it up and pass it unanimously just like \nthey did in the House.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10413-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10413-S10415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend \nand colleague, Wayne Allard, the senior Senator from Colorado. As all \nof us in the Senate know, Senator Allard will retire from the Senate at \nthe end of this legislative session.\n  Senator Allard is a Coloradan through and through. Raised on a ranch \nin Walden, CO, a very small town in the northwest corner of our State, \nhe found his calling in animal medicine. He followed this passion to \nColorado State University at Fort Collins, where he received his \ndoctorate of veterinary medicine. Even today, he proudly wears his tie \nas a Colorado State University Ram. At CSU, Wayne met his future wife \nJoan who was studying microbiology at the time.\n  After graduating, Wayne and Joan built the Allard Animal Hospital in \nLoveland together. They made their home there. They had two wonderful \ndaughters, Christi and Cheryl. Living and working in Loveland, Wayne \ndeveloped a passion for public service. He developed a passion for the \ngood that could come from serving in politics.\n  He began his political career in the Colorado State Senate. There, he \nserved the people of Weld and Larimer Counties in the State legislature \nfor 7 years. A strong believer in preserving the idea of citizen \nlegislators, Senator Allard championed a Colorado law that limits \nlegislative sessions to 120 days, a law that is still in our \nConstitution today. It works to ensure that Colorado representatives \nare able to spend the bulk of their time in their communities as \nopposed to the corridors of the State Capitol.\n  In 1991, the people of the fourth congressional district elected \nSenator Allard to the U.S. House of Representatives. Five years later, \nColoradans elected him to serve as Colorado's United States Senator.\n  Throughout his career on the Federal level, Senator Allard has been a \nstrong voice for fiscal responsibility and ensuring the security of \nAmerica at home and abroad. He has used his position on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee to champion priorities important to Colorado. \nHe has played an active role on the Senate Budget Committee to restore \nintegrity to the government's use of taxpayer dollars.\n  Yet, even as Senator Allard served in Washington, he has never \nforgotten where he came from and who he works for. He was always \ntraveling throughout Colorado, engaging his constituents, hearing their \nhopes and concerns. It is there, in those communities of Colorado, that \nSenator Allard feels most at home.\n  I have been privileged to work with Wayne Allard in the Senate for \nthe past 4 years. We fought together for clean and safe drinking water \nfor the communities in the Lower Arkansas Valley and through the \nconstruction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit which we hope will happen \nin the next several years. We worked to ensure the Animas La-Plata \nWater Project in southwest Colorado and making sure that project is \nfully funded to implement the historic settlement between Colorado and \nits Indian tribes. Over the past few months, we came together to move \njudicial nominees for the Federal Court in Colorado through the often \ncontentious Senate confirmation process. It has been a productive and \nfulfilling partnership.\n  Now, to be sure, Senator Allard and I have not always seen eye to eye \non a number of issues. But in spite of our differences, I have always \nrespected him. He works hard. He is humble. He loves the people of \nColorado.\n\n[[Page S10414]]\n\n  But more than his love for Colorado and his country, Senator Allard \nis devoted to Joan, Christi, Cheryl, and his five grandsons. You will \nnever see him have a smile wider or laugh harder than when he is in \ntheir company. I am happy that his return to Colorado will afford him \nthe opportunity to spend more time with them. He deserves it.\n  I know Senator Allard is a great admirer of a Democrat from Colorado \nby the name of Wayne Aspinall, who served in this Congress for a very \nlong time. Wayne Aspinall was a strong protector of Colorado's water \nand the champion of the people of the Western Slope during his 24-year \ntenure in Congress. Congressman Aspinall once said:\n\n       We all have moments when we feel that ``the system'' is \n     wrong, but that does not entitle us to assume that only we \n     could be right and therefore permit us to secede from our \n     society. We have to learn to live with it--to improve on it \n     if we can, to change it through established procedures, if we \n     must, but we must always remember that individually we are \n     only one person and that the views and ideas of others might \n     be equally valid as our own.\n\n  For the past 25 years, Senator Allard has committed himself and his \ntalents to the people of Colorado in this spirit--a spirit of reform \nand a spirit of humility. He has served with honor and distinction and \nwith an unyielding focus on what he thinks is best for our State. I \nthank him for his service and his friendship, and I congratulate him on \nhis retirement.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor and I \nnote the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SALAZAR). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, as the 110th Congress comes to a close this \nfall, a chapter in Idaho politics also comes to a close. After serving \nin public office, first in the Idaho State Legislature from 1975 to \n1981, then in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1981 to 1990, and \nfinally in the U.S. Senate from 1991 to 2009, my colleague Senator \nLarry Craig is retiring from elective office. Over the years, he has \ndoggedly pursued initiatives important to Idahoans and staunchly \ndefended Western values.\n  Our colleagues in the Senate know about Senator Craig's work over the \nyears ensuring that the U.S. agricultural community has the support \nneeded to thrive and continue ensuring our food security and playing a \nmajor role in the global economy.\n  Our colleagues know about Senator Craig's consistent stand on public \nlands, his unflinching defense of private property rights and reliably \nsupporting those who are caretakers of this invaluable national \nresource.\n  Our colleagues know Senator Craig's stalwart defense of our second \namendment rights and his tireless call for a balanced budget and lower \ntaxes.\n  Our colleagues in the Senate know that Senator Craig has, on a number \nof occasions, reached across the aisle to promote bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Our colleagues in the Senate know and have depended on the leadership \nexhibited over the years by a man with humble beginnings, born in a \nsmall Idaho town, on a family farm where he returned after college \nuntil the people of Payette and Washington Counties elected him to \nrepresent them in the Idaho State Legislature.\n  What may not be so well known about the senior Senator from Idaho is \nhis commitment to adoption, to our youth, to community service, to our \nveterans, and to our seniors.\n  Senator Craig's three children are adopted. Over the years, he became \na congressional leader in promoting adoption and working on policy \ninitiatives that help adoptive parents and young children needing to \nfind loving homes. He also helped found the Congressional Coalition on \nAdoption.\n  Senator Craig did not only champion adoption in Congress, he took a \nstrong leadership role in the Congressional Awards Foundation. This is \nan outstanding program that encourages young people to set high goals, \nto work toward them, and then when they have achieved these goals, it \ngives this body the opportunity to recognize their extraordinary \naccomplishments. The sense of community service this program grows in \nyoung people imparts a lifelong sense of civic duty and responsibility. \nIn short, it grows great Americans.\n  Speaking of great Americans, Senator Craig has been a champion of \nveterans as well, prioritizing their changing needs over the years and \nhelping remind all of us that when a man or a woman defends the United \nStates of America, that individual deserves to have this Nation care \nfor them in their return and in their time of need.\n  A believer in bringing Washington to Idaho, Senator Craig has hosted \nover 300 townhall meetings since his election to the Senate. He has \nalso made national priorities that involve Idaho and his priorities; \nnamely, Department of Energy and defense operations and research at the \nIdaho National Laboratory, the Mountain Home Air Force Base, and Gowan \nField for the home of the Idaho National Guard.\n  Senator Craig has not only supported children, young people, the \nmilitary, and our veterans, he has also worked to champion the cause of \nthe aging, serving on the Special Committee on Aging and keeping \nimportant senior issues at the forefront of our legislative policy.\n  Senator Craig's public service demonstrates a rich history of strong, \nconservative leadership, characterized by an unapologetic defense of \ndemocratic ideals of private property and personal liberty, woven \ntogether with an abiding and proactive concern for those without a \nvoice in Washington. Idahoans across the State have come to know they \ncan depend on Senator Craig to defend their economic well-being and \ntheir values.\n  It has been a privilege for me to serve with Senator Craig during my \ntime in the Congress. I wish him and his wife Susan well as they enter \nthis new chapter in their lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my partner and colleague from \nIdaho, soon to become Idaho's senior Senator, Mike Crapo. Mike and I \nhave had a working relationship and a friendship for literally decades, \nand it is one I have greatly appreciated over the years because of his \nconsistent and wise counsel.\n  While I came to the Congress before Mike, Senator Crapo was in the \nlegislature during a period of time after I was there, and so he \nbrought with him, first to the House and then to the Senate, the very \nsimilar experiences I had as a State legislator. I highly recommend \nthat to anyone who wants to serve in the Senate, that they have that \nexperience on the ground in their home State in a way that brings the \nreality of State governments and the Federal Government together. \nCertainly, over the years Senator Crapo has had that experience and has \nshared it with me. Together, I think we have made a very valuable team \nfor our State.\n  There is another aspect of Senator Crapo I have so highly regarded \nover the years, and certainly the Presiding Officer from Colorado would \nappreciate it. there is probably one single most valuable commodity in \nthe high deserts of the West--such as many parts of the Colorado and \nthe State of Idaho--and that is water. There is an old phrase that many \nhave heard over the years, which is that whiskey is for drinking and \nwater is for fighting over. And there is a lot of truth to that. Our \nStates historically have that in their background as we sorted out our \nwater problems and began to recognize these phenomenally valuable \ncommodities.\n\n  Mike Crapo, in his other life, spent a lot of time with water law. I \nalways said that when it came to water issues here in Washington, while \nthey best be fought out in the State Capitol in Boise, I wanted Mike \nCrapo by my side\n\n[[Page S10415]]\n\nas we worked through water issues that were for our State and certainly \nfor the Nation. Not only does he know the law, coming out of a high \ndesert environment of the kind that is in southern, southeastern, and \nsouthwestern Idaho, he knows the reality. He knows the importance. He \nknows that water is life and death. It is economy or no economy based \non its value. That is the kind of partnership we have had over the \nyears.\n  I will be replaced by Idaho's lieutenant governor, Jim Risch. I am \nconfident he will be elected, for a lot of reasons. First, he is a \nhighly competent person. Idaho knows him well and respects him. He has \nserved Idaho well and he will serve us very well here. He will become \nthe junior partner of the soon-to-be senior Senator, Mike Crapo. That \nteamship, that organizational effort, that combining of forces on by \nfar a majority of issues will be held for Idaho's interests.\n  Mike and I rarely split our votes. When we do, we talk about them, we \nknow our differences and we understand them. But we have realized over \nthe years that the team approach for Idaho and the Idaho delegation is \nvery important for a small State--small by population, at least, \ncertainly not small by geography. So the friendship and the \nrelationship I have had with Senator Crapo over the years has been \npersonally very valuable to me, but I trust it has been very valuable \nto the State of Idaho. But that kind of working, teaming partnership is \ngoing to continue as I step down and Jim Risch is elected in November \nto continue to work with Mike Crapo.\n  So I say to my colleague, Senator Crapo: Thank you. Thank you for the \nkind remarks and the working relationship and friendship we have had \nover the years.\n  And to the presiding officer, while he has not served here as long as \neither of us, I would say to him that he fits in immediately, because \nhe is a westerner who understands our issues, because they are his \nissues, and we have already begun to work those kinds of partnerships \nand relationships that are very valuable to the West, to the public \nlands, and to the interests of our States' people.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I came down here to pay a tribute to our \nsenior Senator from Idaho, Senator Larry Craig, and you can see the \ncaliber of man he is--he came down and paid tribute to me. That is the \nway he is.\n  I want to add to my remarks by thanking Senator Craig personally for \nhis tremendous assistance to me. From the very first day that I stepped \nfoot on the floor of the Senate--in fact, before that, when I was \ntrying to get elected to the Senate--Senator Craig was there to help. \nAnd once I was elected, Senator Craig set about making sure I could be \nsuccessful.\n  As he has indicated by his gracious remarks, that is the kind of man \nhe is. He is a tremendous friend and he is a tremendous advocate and he \nhas the kind of principles and values that have helped him to represent \nthe people of Idaho so well over the years. He has committed his life \nto public service and has shown the people of Idaho and the people of \nthis Nation the kind of leadership we should have in this country, \nfighting for those kinds of principles that I have mentioned--whether \nit be private property rights, a balanced budget, lower, smaller \ngovernment, protecting those without a voice, working for the veterans, \nworking for senior citizens, and his commitment to working for our \nnewest citizens of our world, those who need adoption. The list goes on \nand on and on.\n  I want to personally thank you, Larry, for the opportunity to serve \nwith you here in the Senate, and to tell you that I and all of us in \nIdaho will miss you and look forward to continuing to work with you as \nyou enter this new chapter of your life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10415-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10415-S10417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ECONOMIC CRISIS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the next few minutes I wish to connect \nthe dots. What am I saying? Well, I wish to take us from where this \nSenate was last night, when on a 74-to-25 vote it voted out one of the \nlargest financial assistance packages in the history of the Nation--\n700-plus billion dollars--to try to stabilize the credit markets of our \ncountry and make sure that Main Street--whether it be in small-town \nColorado or small-town Idaho--still have credit in its banks for its \ncitizens and its small business people to conduct business and make \npayroll.\n  We have, by a series of actions over the last decade, placed the \nAmerican economy and the American consumer--the taxpayer--in peril. \nLast night was an effort to recognize that and to do something about \nit. Because of its size, and because of its early billing--that it was \na ``Wall Street bailout''--I suspect your constituents and mine backed \noff and said: ``Whoa, wait a minute, government; wait a minute, \npolitician, don't put the taxpayer at peril with this kind of effort.''\n  At the same time, you and I, and many of us here, were looking at all \nof the issues at hand, recognizing this was not a bailout for Wall \nStreet. In fact, from its original concept to its evolution to the bill \nthat was passed last night, it was a much different document--\nsafeguarding and protecting the taxpayer and trying to recognize the \nneed of a growing credit crisis on Main Street USA. I think, and I \nhope, we have accomplished that.\n  But how did this come to be? Well, there are a lot of fingers that \ncan be pointed. We can point at the liberal lending policy and advocacy \nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and subprimes, and too much credit in \nthe market, and the explosion of the housing industry--or at least the \nexplosion of the bubble in the housing industry. But something else \ncame along about the time all of those elements in our economy were \ncoming together that I think was probably the tripwire that helped \ncreate the current situation.\n  Let me connect the dot, the dot of too much credit, of subprime, of \nan economy that was maxed out, of a consumer who was maxed out. Let me \nconnect the dot of the average consumer having to pay anywhere from \n$100 to $150 more a month on his energy bill at the gas pump. What \nhappened in our economy as energy prices went through the roof and that \nspread out across our economy in food costs, in transportation costs, \nin the costs of everything we do because our economy is so intricately \nlinked with energy and the availability of energy? You didn't hear \nanybody on the floor last night talk about energy. You did not hear \nanybody on the floor last night talk about the $4 gas or the $140-a-\nbarrel oil that was true a few months ago, but it was there and it was \nlurking in the background. It had already hit our economy along the \nside of the head with a fatal blow. We have over the last several years \ntried to recognize that.\n  When we left here in July for the August recess, Democrats and \nRepublicans were at odds over energy. I was saying let's drill, let's \nproduce, and the American consumer was awakening to this energy shock \nthat our economy was having and they were saying the same thing; 65 to \n70 percent of the American consumers were saying, What's wrong, \npolitician? Why are you locking away the great resources of this \ncountry? In the name of the environment? In the name of no growth? In \nthe name of good feelings? The bad feelings were at the pump. The bad \nfeelings were in the pocketbook.\n  Stay with me for a moment and think about this. Think about that \nconsumer. He and she, working hard, maybe bringing home $45,000 or \n$50,000 a year amongst the two--mom and dad--they have their credit \ncards maxed out. They have maybe $5,000 on their credit cards and they \nare paying a couple of hundred dollars a month each month on that \ncredit card and making their house payment and barely getting by and, \nall of a sudden, in the last year and a half or two, their energy bill \ngoes through the roof and they are paying $150 to $200 a month, and \nthey don't have it.\n  Then the value they had in their house that they might have taken a \nsecond mortgage out on to bail them\n\n[[Page S10416]]\n\nout, all of a sudden begins to disappear. That is an American family in \ncrisis. That is an American family in crisis without question. That is \nthe crisis we began to deal with last night. That, of course, was that \n$5,000 they had on their credit card that they were paying $200 a month \non, the credit card company called them up and said we are going to \npump it up to $400 a month, we are going to drop your credit line, and \nwe are going to charge you more interest. That is what was happening, \nand it was brought on by practices in the economy over the last good \nnumber of years, and the energy crisis coming down on top.\n  In the midst of all of this great debate about the economy, something \nhappened at the end of September. Politicians who couldn't face the \nvote to deal with the issue of taking off the offshore oil moratorium \nlet it expire. There were a few stories about ``offshore drilling \nmoratoria expired.'' Even some of the cable news stations had charts up \nshowing graphs--graphs I had used here on the floor--of areas that were \nnow available offshore. Somehow there was a little story out there that \npossibly we were going to get back into the business of drilling and \nproduction and therefore bring down our risk as a nation and stop the \nhuge flow of money going offshore and the consumer would be better off.\n  I am here today to connect another dot and to suggest to the American \nconsumer that is an illusion. The reason it is an illusion is because \nthere are a few politicians around here saying when we get back next \nyear, we can slip that moratorium back on. There are others saying \ngood, it is off, it will stay off, and we can begin to work the process \nof getting the Department of the Interior, USGS, and others to do the \nsurveys and environmental impact statements that will allow us to \ndrill.\n  Therein lies the question: To drill--when? Let me tell you how it \nworks, because the day the moratoria came off, and they came off the \nlast of September, if everything were to work right, it would be 7 to 8 \nyears before any rig could go out there into the deep waters and begin \nto drill. That is normal process and time. If you look at the example \nof Alaska where there are offshore leases and the environmental impact \nstatements have been done, guess what else happened. Along came the \ninterest groups and they filed suits and they have extended that \ndrilling time out another 3 or 4 years while the oil companies go \nthrough the courts and fight the battles of the environmental groups \nthat do not want you there to begin with.\n  America, please awaken. Do not think the energy crisis is over \nbecause we have turned the economy down, we have turned consumption \ndown around the world and all of a sudden oil is now down to $92, $93, \n$94 a barrel. Because the very thing we hope for, and that is for the \neconomy to come back and people to come back to work and homes to be \nbuilt here and around the world, means that energy consumption will go \nback up against a relatively static supply market.\n  The good news is we hopefully did the right things to bring the \neconomy back. The bad news is we haven't done a darned thing to \nincrease the supply of hydrocarbons in our market--except to run a few \ntickertapes or billboards that we let the moratorium expire on offshore \noil. But we have not indemnified the companies, we have not done the \nright things it would take to bring drilling to the areas where the oil \nis. And there is oil out there--billions of barrels of oil.\n  Every time the gulf, where there is a lot of deepwater drilling, gets \nhit by hurricane--whether it was Katrina or Ike recently, that knocked \nhundreds of platforms off their foundations out in the deepwater \nproduction area--there was no environmental problem because we are so \ngood at doing what we do today. We insist that the best talent come, \nthe best equipment come, and we have those kinds of environmental \nprotections that deny us the ghosts of Santa Barbara of three decades \nago. Yet there is still a large number of Americans wanting to deny us \nthat. There is a great number of politicians who would love to run from \nthe reality of getting this country back into the business of producing \nenergy.\n  We talk about it. We play the game. But I am here today to say we do \nnot connect all of the dots and it is not going to be 2, 3, 4 years \nafter the moratoria goes off. After you work all the systems and all \nthe lawsuits through all the courts, you would be very lucky to get any \nfield into production in the next 12 years. That is the way it is. That \nis the problem we have to deal with. That is the problem the new \nCongress will have to deal with and deal with it in a very real way.\n  What are we talking about? The estimation of the domestic recoverable \noil and gas resources in the Outer Continental Shelf. In old geology, \nin old surveys that do not keep up with the modern techniques that we \nhave today, where we are finding the truly deep oil out in the gulf, we \nknow there are at least 30 billion barrels of oil. We believe in the \nundiscovered resource areas there could be as much as 85 or 100 billion \nbarrels of oil. There are literally trillions of cubic feet of gas--\n200, 250, 350, 400, we are not sure, but we know this. When you take \nthe old technology and you go out there with the new technologies and \nyou apply it to the old geologies, you usually get two to three times \nmore than you thought you were going to get. That is a fact and we know \nthat today.\n  Therefore, it is critically important that we get the rigs into the \nwater, get the rigs out there, and begin to explore and develop; that \nis, if you do not want another runup in energy values and an energy \ncrisis of the kind we have put our people through when this economy \ncomes back--and it will come back, hopefully soon, but within the next \ncouple of years. Congress's failure to act, Congress's willingness to \nmarch down the old path of no exploration, no drilling, no production, \nbuy it from our enemies, the ``send our money offshore'' syndrome will \nplunge us back into another energy crisis.\n  I say to those who might be listening today, connect the dots. One of \nthose dots you will connect is with your politicians, with your \npolicymakers. Insist that they do the right thing, and the right thing \nis to free this country up and get us back into the business of \nproduction.\n  While the OCS moratorium has lifted, here is another little problem. \nA couple of years ago, with a political compromise here on the floor of \nthe Senate, we took a little piece off the Florida coast, down off the \nAlabama coast, called lease sale 181. The reason we opened that was \nbecause it was very close to the infrastructure--meaning the pipes and \nthe refinery areas. We know there is a lot of gas and oil there. We \ncreated special conditions. We even indemnified, or protected from \nlawsuits, some of the companies going in there. Those sales are let and \nthose companies are headed there. We believe there could be several \nbillion barrels of oil there.\n  But, very quietly, in the language it also prohibits us from going on \neast toward the Florida coast where there are billions more barrels of \noil that were once under the OCS moratorium but have special language \nand special protection and still have that special language and still \nhave that special protection, even with the moratoria expiration being \nlifted this past week.\n  That is another dirty little secret that nobody wants to talk about--\nthe Floridians most assuredly don't want to talk about--even though in \nFlorida today they are saying drill it, go after it, get it, help us \nout; drop our energy bills, help our pocketbooks, help our family \nbudget. Congress, do the right thing.\n  Those are some of the challenges the new Congress will face. We have \na staggering economy, we are in a major credit crunch, we have \nconsumers who are maxed out in a lot of ways, but the one thing they \ngrew so very angry about the last 6 months was that somebody was \nrobbing them blind--or at least they thought they were--at the fuel \npump. The reason we had an energy crisis was because we began to have a \npolitical crisis on the floor of this Senate years ago when we \ncontinually locked up our resources, all in the name of some worthy \ncause, denying the riches of our country and our land to the American \npeople.\n  As some know who have been listening or have been watching the floor \nfor the last hour, I am not going to be here. I am retiring. I spent a \nlot of my years dealing with the very issue I am talking about now, all \nin the name of increased production, fighting unbelievable odds because \nof the beliefs\n\n[[Page S10417]]\n\nmany of our Members of Congress have about locking it up in the name of \nsomething.\n  I would hope Congress got real and recognized the reality of the \nworld we live in. Just as we live in a worldwide economic market, we \nalso live in a worldwide energy market. The great tragedy of today has \ncreated, in part, the economic crisis we are in. While it was at the \ngas pump for the average citizen every day, at least when oil was $140 \na barrel, we were sending upwards of $1.2 billion offshore to buy oil.\n  America cannot continue to do that and remain a wealthy and \nprosperous nation. We simply are draining our Treasury dry. Yet we have \noil all around us. Consumers are now seeing ads on television talking \nabout the great shale pools of natural gas the new technology is \nbringing. Yet very quietly we are trying to keep a lot of that out of \nreach, all in the name of the environment.\n  We have all other kinds of energy resources we ought to be going \nafter and developing. I believe the next decade in front of us is the \ndecade of energy. I think as a Congress we are awakening. I know the \nconsumers have awakened and they are going to demand that Congress do \nwhat is right, all in the name of new production, new technologies, \ndiverse kinds of energy portfolios for our country.\n  We will not be a wealthy nation 20 years from now. We will not be a \nnation that allows our citizens and our young people to pursue the \nAmerican dream as we and our parents before us and our grandparents \nbefore them.\n  We need to recognize the next 20 years ought to be and must be \ndedicated to the production of energy; all forms, clean, diverse. That \nis our challenge. So let's connect the dots.\n  Last night we talked about a credit crunch and a credit crisis. I \nbelieve it was worsened by an energy crunch and an energy crisis we \nhave lived through and are currently continuing to live through.\n  If the Congress does not bring that together, then we will fail, or \nat least we will not allow the greatest hope and the greatest \nexpectation of our country, this great country, to see its natural \nlevel. Those are our challenges.\n  Bold votes last night, bold and necessary steps were taken. Can this \nSenate as a policymaking body be as bold in energy as we were with the \neconomy? That is the challenge we face. I will not face it anymore. But \neverybody who serves here will. I hope they can meet that challenge. \nBecause if they fail, then our great Nation is weakened and the \nopportunities many of us have worked for, for our children and our \ngrandchildren over the years, simply cannot be realized.\n  So Senate, Congress, connect the dots. Work at getting the economy \nright, work at getting energy production back online, work at giving \nthis great enterprising country of ours the opportunity to create and \nto be what it can be. That is a necessary and important challenge. I am \nconfident, if the citizens of our country demand it, the Congress will \nrise to that occasion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10417-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THANKING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, while the Senator from Idaho is on the \nfloor, I made some comments earlier about the pleasure of being able to \nwork with him in the Senate. I wish to also recognize the fine work he \nhas done on energy. We certainly appreciate his work on that.\n  Colorado is an energy-rich State. We have all forms of energy, not \nonly fossil fuels but also wind and solar and geothermal. I think \nSenator Craig has been very sensitive to those.\n  When working with the Senator from Idaho I felt like he truly had the \nNation's interest in mind. It has been a pleasure for me to serve with \nSenator Craig, particularly on the Appropriations Committee. The \nSenator brought in a very competent staff and was himself extremely \nknowledgeable.\n  As we leave this institution, I wish to thank the Senator from Idaho \nfor all the work he did to help me along with legislation. What a \nprivilege it has been to be able to know Senator Craig and work with \nhim in the Senate. Also, I wish to recognize the Senator's hard work in \nthe Senate.\n  Senator Salazar was making some comments earlier on, talking about my \nretirement. I happened to have gone downstairs and grabbed a lunch and \nthere he was. I also want the people of Colorado to know I have enjoyed \nworking with Senator Salazar. We have not agreed on some of the \nnational issues, but I think generally one thing we have agreed on is \nwe need to work for Colorado.\n  I think we have truly been partners in that effort. I appreciated the \nopportunity to get to know you. I'm reminded that when Colorado came \ninto the Union, in 1876--we are known as the Centennial State--the \nRepublicans were pretty much in control of everything. You see, \nColorado is a State that is recognized as a swing State, it swings back \nand forth between the Republican and Democratic Parties.\n  But at that particular time, there was a big effort to have a Senator \nfrom the north and a Senator from the south of our State. Similarly, \ntoday, I grew up about as far north as you can get in Colorado, Senator \nSalazar grew up about as far south as you can get in the State of \nColorado. I think, at least in the spirit, and certainly in geographic \nlocation, we have been able to represent all of the State of Colorado \nand deal with those issues in a civil and responsible way.\n  I wish to thank Senator Salazar publicly for his service to the State \nof Colorado and also want the people of Colorado to know I highly \nrespect Senator Ken Salazar, who is sitting in the chair right now, for \nhis dedication and the rich heritage he has in the State of Colorado. I \nhave appreciated the opportunity to serve with Senator Salazar in the \nState of Colorado and I wish the Senator well in future years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before the senior retiring Senator from the \nState of Colorado leaves, let me thank him for his gracious comments. \nWe have been a very good team and have partnered on a lot of issues \nover the years because we have such common interests in mind. Our \nStates are very similar in so many ways.\n  The State of Colorado happens to have the hydrocarbons we do not \nhave, when it comes to gas and oil. But at the same time, agriculture, \nwater and timber, tourism, and all the great things many people \nattribute to the West are embodied in the State of Colorado and \ncertainly in the State of Idaho.\n  But a very special thanks to Senator Allard for your fine comments. \nThe work the Senator has done on behalf of his State is precedent \nsetting. I hope--I know--the Senator will be continually recognized for \nthat.\n  But let me also say the Senator and his wife Joan have become good \nfriends of both my wife Suzanne and I. Those are the kinds of \nfriendships that build partnerships in the Senate. I hope other \nSenators recognize the Senate works well when Senators are friends and \npartners.\n  Now, we may have our disagreements along the way, and there may be \nsome disagreements between Democrats and Republicans, but when the \ncollegiality of the Senate leaves, the Senate no longer works or works \nas well as it should on behalf of our citizens. Certainly, the \ncollegiality between the Craigs and the Allards has been longstanding \nand greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10417-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10417-S10418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3150\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I would like to begin my remarks this \nafternoon acknowledging four of our colleagues who will be leaving the \nSenate along with me at the end of this Congress, the 110th Congress, \nand then make some additional comments.\n\n\n                     Pete Domenici and John Warner\n\n  Mr. President, this body will lose two of the most respected, highly \nregarded consensus builders in the history of this body. I speak of the \nsenior Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia, Mr. Warner. Between the two of these distinguished \nnational leaders, they have given the Senate and this country 70 years \nof service.\n  Most Americans are aware of Senators Domenici and Warner and the \ncontributions they have made. Those of us who have had the privilege of \nserving with these two individuals know what they have meant to our \ncountry. They have been role models, leaders, men of conscience, of \nvision, of integrity, of courage. And all of those most-valued human \ncharacteristics have been evident when America has needed them most.\n  For their voice and their courage and their vision, we thank them. \nFor the kind of men they are, and the Senators they have been, we thank \nthem. We are all much enriched by our association with Senators Warner \nand Domenici, and this country will miss them greatly.\n  But they leave strong legacies. They leave men and women who have \nbeen touched by their leadership and their values who will carry on \nbehind them, emulating their leadership and their vision.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  Mr. President, I wish also to recognize one of my classmates with \nwhom I came to the Senate 12 years ago. He is our neighbor from the \nWest, the senior Senator from Colorado, Wayne Allard. Aside from \nSenator Allard and Colorado usually taking Nebraska's water, we find \nlittle to quarrel with in the kind of work that Senator Allard has done \nfor his State and our country.\n  I have had an opportunity to serve 12 years with Senator Allard on \nthe Banking Committee. His very steady performance and leadership will \nbe missed on that committee, as well as on the other committees he has \nserved and has been very active, as my colleague in the chair knows, \nwho served with him as well on the Armed Services Committee. His \nleadership on the Budget Committee in particular will be missed. I wish \nto acknowledge that friendship and that leadership of Senator Allard.\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  Mr. President, the fourth Member of the Senate who will be leaving \nalong with me will be the senior Senator from Idaho, Larry Craig. I \nhave had an opportunity to work with Senator Craig over the years on \nenvironmental issues, energy issues, trade issues, agricultural issues. \nThere have been few who have been as forceful and important a voice on \nbehalf of those critical challenges to our country.\n  Senator Craig, Senator Allard, Senator Warner, and Senator Domenici \nall leave the Senate a better institution for their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10418-6", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10418-S10420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. On January 7, 1997, I took an oath of office in the \nSenate, an oath to the Constitution, and I became the 1,841st person \nwho has ever served in the Senate. That number struck me\n\n[[Page S10419]]\n\nthat day because I recognized, once again--and soon to come to truly \nappreciate over a 12-year period in this body--how few people have had \nthe opportunity, the privilege, the honor to serve in the Senate.\n  Less than 2,000 Americans in the history of our country have served \nin the Senate. That does not make us better. That does not mean we are \nsmarter or in any way more privileged. But it does reflect upon the \nkind of responsibility that we have in this body and the expectations \nthat are placed on each of us, as should be the case, for our service.\n  I first thank the people of Nebraska for the privilege I have been \ngiven to serve in this body for 12 years. I thank my staff not for \ntheir service to me but for their service to this country. I thank my \ncolleagues, Republicans and Democrats, from whom I have learned so much \nover these 12 years--in particular, Senators Lugar and Biden, from whom \nI have learned much in serving with them on the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee for the last 12 years, who have been patient with \nme, have helped me, as well as their staffs.\n  The two leaders of this body--Senators Reid and McConnell--I wish to \nthank. I have had privileged relationships with each. Senator McConnell \nand I have grown to have a very close relationship, friendship, and I \nvery much value that relationship. I thank Senator McConnell for his \nmany courtesies over the years, as I do Senator Reid. These two men are \ncharged with great responsibilities, and especially over the last 2 \nyears during as difficult a Congress certainly that I have served in, \nand I suspect most of my colleagues have served in. They have done a \nremarkably good and effective job.\n  Certainly, I thank my family for this privilege and their support and \ntheir guidance. They, too, have been privileged and enriched and \nenhanced by being part of this experience over the last 12 years.\n  These last 12 years have been years of global reorientation and \nhistoric events. As I have represented Nebraskans during these \nturbulent times, I have formed judgments and drawn conclusions about \nAmerica's future.\n  The strength of any country is its people. Constitutions, \ngovernments, public and private institutions are important, for they \nform the structure of a society, the boundaries of social behavior. But \nit is the people, the individuals, who make the difference in life and \nin the world.\n  Americans possess a generous spirit and uncommon decency predicated \non faith and family, hard work, fair play, and belief in a better \ntomorrow. The challenges that face America today and in the future are \nnot just American challenges but global challenges. Everything we do or \ndon't do has global implications, just as everything that happens \naround the world has implications for us here in our country.\n\n  The Senate is a unique institution. It is unique among all governing \nbodies of the world. It is imperfect. It is slow. It is tedious. \nSometimes it is maddening, certainly frustrating. But the brilliance of \nour forefathers understood completely and carefully--how, I don't \nknow--that the world would at some point come together with a great \nconfluence of complications. The need to have a body whose main \nresponsibility would be to take the longer view--the longer view of \nlegislation, the longer view of actions, the longer view of alliances, \nof relationships, of all our policies--was its primary focus. Tough \nquestions--questions about consequences of actions, consequences of \ninaction--that is the essence of the Senate.\n  The many lessons I have learned in the 12 years I have been here \nreinforced my belief in our country but also reinforced my belief in \nthese institutions and, in particular, the Congress of the United \nStates, for the essence of public confidence is transparency and \naccountability. That is our institutional responsibility. It is our \nindividual responsibility. And a free people know the facts. If free \npeople are living in a world where there is transparency, where there \nis accountability, that society will prosper. It will fix its problems, \nand it will deal with its injustices. Oversight--which we hear much \nabout these days, especially in light of the financial crisis we are in \ntoday--oversight and accountability are critical components of our \nresponsibilities.\n  Article I of the Constitution is about the Congress. We are a coequal \nbranch of Government. If there is anything I have learned in the 12 \nyears I have been here, it is the importance of sharing, participating \nin the governance of our country, being part of that governance, \nhelping to make decisions with the President and the executive. If one \nof those articles of the Constitution--and there are three that set up \nthe coequal branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and \nthe judicial--but anytime there becomes an imbalance in governance in a \nrepublic and one of those three becomes too powerful and the other too \nweak or one too weak, there will be a consequence, there will be a \nreaction, and it will not tilt in favor of an accountable, transparent, \nopen, effective government. So it is like all things in life: We strive \nfor balance. We strive for balance of governance. And the Founders of \nthe Constitution of this great Republic have that as much the central \nfocus as any one part of our Government.\n  I believe this institution of Congress will be tested more over the \nnext few years. We need a strong President. We need a strong executive. \nFor it is the President and the executive that we charge to carry out \nthe policies that are made and shaped on behalf of the American people \nin the Congress of the United States. They must have the flexibility, \nthey must have the authority to carry those out but not without the \nactive participation and partnership of the Congress of the United \nStates. In my opinion, over the last few years, we have allowed that to \ndrift, and I believe it has cost our country dearly.\n  I have also learned this lesson: Bipartisan consensus is the only way \na democracy will work. No party has a corner on all the virtues, nor \nall the answers. A country of 300 million free people, who have every \nright to express themselves, question their leaders, question their \nGovernment, at the end of the day must somehow find some accommodation, \nsome consensus to govern and thereby address the issues and challenges \nand problems that face our country. Without that bipartisan consensus, \nwe end up in the underbrush of political paralysis. Much of what we \nhave seen in the last 2 years has been, unfortunately, political \nparalysis. We all have to take some responsibility for that. Bipartisan \nconsensus--that has to be the focus of leadership in any institution.\n  I have learned also that a free press is indispensable to a free \npeople. As frustrating as we all know, in this business, the press can \nbe--sometimes we believe we are treated unfairly, and maybe sometimes \nwe are--there is no substitute in a democracy for a free press. A free \npress is the indispensable element for a free people.\n  I have learned too that power corrupts. Lord Acton had it right: \nPower corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. That doesn't mean \nwe are a nation or a body or an institution of corrupt people or bad \npeople, but the more authority that is concentrated in too small a \nspace is going to end up with not an effect that is in the best \ninterests of a free people. Concentrations of power in the hands of a \nfew is dangerous to a democracy. We all who exercise some power as \nnational leaders must be mindful of this reality and stay vigilant to \nthis reality.\n  The next President, who will assume as big an inventory of challenges \nand problems as any President, in my opinion, since Franklin Roosevelt \non March 4, 1933, must immediately reach to the Congress to make the \nCongress a partner, and regardless of who the new President is, he must \nalso reach to the American people and begin building a consensus of \ngovernance in this country. There will be differences. There will be \nstrong debates. There must be and should be. But in the end, we must \nreach some objective, some end point, and that is to fix a problem.\n  We did that last night on the floor of the Senate--not that what we \npassed in this Economic Stabilization Act will fix all the problems; it \nwon't. But it is important that America, our markets, the world bring \nback some confidence in our governance, in our systems, thereby \nbringing all that does flow from that confidence in a market system, \nthe elements of commerce and trade and the possibilities to build a \nbetter life.\n\n[[Page S10420]]\n\n  This next President will be faced with those challenges. So will this \nnext Congress. I believe that will occur, not just because the American \npeople expect it and demand it, but they deserve it. I don't think the \nnext President or the next Congress will fail. There is no perfect \nsolution, no easy answer, but that is why we have leaders. That is why \nwe have governments.\n  I wish to go back to accountability for a moment because that is such \nan elemental part of anyone's life. We are all accountable in life. In \nour personal lives, private lives, public lives, we are all accountable \nto someone.\n  I would like to read a very short statement. As a matter of fact, I \nhad this hanging in my reception room in my office. This was a \nhandwritten statement that was found in the coat pocket of General \nDwight D. Eisenhower. It was found at the cleaners. This was a note he \nwrote in his hand on June 6, 1944, the beginning of the Normandy \ninvasion, the invasion of Europe. We all recall that was D-day. This is \nwhat then-General Eisenhower, who was the commanding general, wrote in \nthe event that D-day was a failure:\n\n       Our landings have failed and I have withdrawn the troops. \n     My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon \n     the best information available. The troops, the air, and the \n     Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If \n     any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.\n\n  Now, that is accountability. That is accountability. This one simple, \nhonest, handwritten statement should be as much a guiding point for all \nof us in public office as any one thing.\n  I have also learned over the last 12 years that democracy actually \ndoes work. As raw as it is, it works. We in politics, we in government, \ngovernment itself, the institution of government only reflects society. \nPolitics reflects society. We respond. We react in a democracy. But the \ncountervailing pressures, the countervailing dynamics, the \ncountervailing debates and philosophies and opinions and positions \nbalance the wheel in a remarkable way. I am not near wise enough to \nunderstand it all. I have observed it. I have participated in it up \nclose for 12 years. It works. It works. That is why transparency is so \nimportant, so the American people can see it and feel it and understand \nit and be part of it.\n  We live in an imperfect world. There are no perfect solutions. We are \nall imperfect people. But institutions are important because within the \nimperfect world and in the process of trying to make a better world--\nmaybe someday a perfect world--the process is important because it gets \nus to where we want to be. It is a highway. It is a process. We do that \nwell here, as well as anywhere in the world. We are always striving to \nmake it better.\n  I occasionally think about this great Republic, how it was formed, \nwhen it was formed. A couple of fairly recent things come to mind. When \nwe think of less than 100 years ago, women in America could not vote. \nLess than 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote. But we \naddressed that. We fixed that. We fixed it through amendment XIX in our \nConstitution.\n  Up until the mid-1960s, did anyone really believe that an African \nAmerican had any hope or possibility to be a nominee for President of \nthe United States, maybe even be President some day? The Voting Rights \nAct and the Civil Rights Act of the midsixties changed that. We know \nthe system can work.\n\n  These are defining times. We are living through a global \nreorientation. One of the great responsibilities this body will have, \nthe next President will have, we all will have, is to reintroduce \nAmerica to the world. The world does not know who we are. Part of that \nis our fault. Part of that is not our fault. There are 6.5 billion \npeople, and 40 percent of those 6.5 billion are under the age of 19 \nyears old. Most people alive today were not alive at the end of World \nWar II. This can be done. It must be done. America is a great country \nbecause we are a good people.\n  I wish to take my last minute in my comments today to read from a \npoem I have distributed to friends and staff for 30 years. I do not \nknow the author of this poem, and I never have. I never found out who \nthe author of this poem is. I have put it on a piece of glass and have \ndistributed hundreds and hundreds of copies to people I have worked \nwith over the years in different things I have done.\n  I end my remarks, Mr. President, this way this afternoon, by reciting \nthis poem entitled ``The Man in the Glass'' because it reflects on each \nof us but, most poignantly, it reflects on each of us who has \nresponsibility to serve the public and be accountable and honest:\n\n     When you get what you want in your struggle for self\n     And the world makes you king for a day,\n     Just go to the mirror and look at yourself\n     And see what that man has to say.\n\n     For it isn't your father or mother or wife\n     Whose judgment upon you must pass.\n     The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life\n     Is the one staring back from the glass.\n\n     You may be like Jack Horner and chisel a plum\n     And think you're a wonderful guy.\n     But the man in the glass says you're only a bum\n     If you can't look him straight in the eye.\n\n     He's the fellow to please--never mind all the rest,\n     For he's with you clear to the end.\n     And you've passed your most dangerous, difficult test\n     If the man in the glass is your friend.\n\n     You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years\n     And get pats on the back as you pass.\n     But your final reward will be heartache and tears\n     If you've cheated the man in the glass.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 704 \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 704) Congratulating the members of \n     the United States Olympic and Paralympic Teams on their \n     success in the 2008 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games and \n     supporting the selection of Chicago, Illinois, as the site of \n     the 2016 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding \nOlympic and Paralympic athletes from Maryland who proudly represented \nour country in the 2008 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in Beijing, \nChina.\n  Michael Phelps II, a swimmer from Baltimore; Katie Hoff, a swimmer \nfrom Towson; David Banks, a rower from Potomac; Jun Gao, a table tennis \nplayer from Gaithersburg; Scott Parsons, a canoe and kayak racer from \nBethesda; Freddie Adu, a soccer player from Rockville; Gary Russell, \nJr., a boxer from Capital Heights; Tatyana McFadden, a wheelchair racer \nfrom Clarksville; and Jessica Long, a swimmer from Baltimore, made all \nMarylanders proud as exemplary members of Team USA.\n  In particular, I especially would like to recognize the three \nathletes from Maryland whose exceptional performances were rewarded \nwith Paralympic and Olympic medals.\n  Jessica Long won four gold medals, one silver medal, and one bronze \nmedal in the 2008 Paralympics. Jessica not only won six medals; she set \nthe world record in the Women's 100-Meter Freestyle event.\n  Perhaps more extraordinary than her performance in this year's games \nare the challenges she had to overcome just to get to Beijing. Jessica \nwas born with an abnormality in her lower legs and spent her infancy at \nan orphanage in eastern Russia before an American couple adopted her \nwhen she was 13 months old. Five months later, she had her legs \namputated in the U.S. While these obstacles may have broken the spirit \nof most others, they only strengthened Jessica's resolve and she is now \na 15-time world record holder.\n  Katie Hoff also excelled in Beijing, winning one silver and two \nbronze medals at the XXIX Olympiad. In addition to winning the silver \nmedal in the Women's 400-Meter Freestyle event, Katie set American \nrecords in winning the silver medal in the Women's 400-Meter Freestyle \nRelay event, in winning the bronze medal in the Women's 800-Meter \nFreestyle Relay event and in finishing fourth in the Women's 200-Meter \nFreestyle event.\n  Last, but certainly not least, is the performance of Michael Phelps--\nthe greatest accomplishment in Olympic history, and one of the greatest \nathletic accomplishments of all time.\n  This summer, Michael Phelps set seven world records and one Olympic \nrecord while winning eight gold medals, the most ever by an individual \nathlete in a single Olympics. He now has won 14 gold medals over the \ncourse of his Olympic career, also an Olympic record, and a total of 16 \nmedals. To put this astonishing feat into perspective, Michael won more \ngold medals in Beijing than all but eight countries! And he won more \nmedals in total than all but 24 countries!\n  Who will ever forget the incredible come-from-behind victory Michael \nand his teammates Garrett Weber-Gale, Cullen Jones, and Jason Lezak \nachieved in Men's 400-Meter Freestyle Relay event as they edged the \nfavored French team by 8/100ths of a second? That was one of the most \nexciting and inspirational finishes in Olympic history. Just as \nexciting was Michael's finish in the Men's 200-Meter Butterfly event \nwhen a stutter stroke and lunge at the end enabled him to beat Laszlo \nCseh by the width of a fingernail!\n  Despite the epic greatness of his achievement, Michael spoke modestly \nafter winning his eighth gold, saying, ``Records are always made to be \nbroken no matter what they are . . . Anybody can do anything that they \nset their mind to.'' Michael proved not only to be a model of what one \ncan achieve with hard work and determination, but also a model of the \ncourtesy and sportsmanship upon which the Olympics were founded. He is \na self-effacing young man whose enthusiasm, modesty, cheerfulness, and \ncharm have endeared him to people around the world.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't mention his extraordinary mother, \nDebbie, and his coach, Bob Bowman. The obvious affection and respect he \nhas for these two people indicate just how important they have been in \nhis life.\n  Michael is not content to rest on his laurels. He wants to attract \nmore kids to swimming and to teach them about pursuing their dreams, \nusing his own life as an example. He will donate the $1 million Olympic \nbonus he received from Speedo to a foundation he has created to promote \nwater safety and youth swimming. ``This is a way for me to really help \ngrow the sport,'' he said in explaining why he gave the prize to the \nnewly-created Michael Phelps Foundation.\n  Michael knew he wanted to spread interest in swimming but also wanted \nto convey a message that could apply to other activities, so he is \ncreating a program called ``Dream, Plan, Reach.'' It's designed to help \nchildren set goals and take daily responsibility for pursuing them. He \nis also helping to raise money for charity by autographing photos, USA \nswim caps, Sports Illustrated covers, and other collectibles in a deal \nwith Grandstand Sports & Memorabilia, offering fans the chance to own \nkeepsakes from the Beijing Games.\n  The people of Maryland are privileged to have had such an outstanding \ngroup represent us at the Olympic Games. All of these athletes \nsacrificed tremendously in order to reach this pinnacle of athletic \nsuccess, spending countless hours in grueling and arduous training in \norder to wear the red,\n\n[[Page S10425]]\n\nwhite, and blue in Beijing. I commend them all for their dedication and \nvalor, and the exemplary way in which they represented the United \nStates of America. They have made Marylanders and all Americans proud.\n  I am pleased the Senate passed S. Res. 700 yesterday a resolution \nSenator Mikulski and I introduced along with 12 other cosponsors \nhonoring the achievements of Michael Phelps, Katie Hoff, and the rest \nof the United States Olympic Swimming Team for their record-breaking \nperformances at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, where they won 31 \nmedals, including 12 gold medals, 9 silver medals, and 10 bronze \nmedals. While records may indeed be made to be broken, the \naccomplishments of this team will not be forgotten. It is fitting for \nthe Senate to pay tribute and pass along its congratulations for a job \nsuperbly well done.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate all of our \nnational Olympic champions. The 2008 Summer Olympic games held in \nBeijing brought the world together, and showcased the best athletes \nfrom around the globe.\n  I would like to recognize the Olympians with ties to my home State of \nHawaii.

I would also like to recognize the \nefforts of Maui resident and Paralympian Beth Arnoult, who represented \nthe U.S. in women's wheelchair tennis.\n  I would now like to highlight a few of the medal winners.\n  Bryan Clay, from Kaneohe, Oahu, recovered from injury last year to \nwin his first gold medal in decathlon with an impressive performance. \nClay is one of two Olympians now featured on the post-Beijing Olympics \nWheaties cereal box, along with gymnast Nastia Liukin.\n  Honolulu native Clay Stanley helped the United States men's \nvolleyball team defeat the favored team from Brazil to win the gold \nmedal.\n  Natasha Kai, a Kahuku High School graduate, was the first player in \nhistory to be named Western Athletic Conference Player of the Year \nthree times while playing for the University of Hawaii soccer team. As \na forward on the U.S. Women's team, she scored a game-winning goal in \novertime to beat Canada in the quarterfinal round. The U.S. team went \non to win gold.\n  Punahou High School graduate Brandon Brooks helped capture silver for \nthe United States in Men's Water polo.\n  Punahou graduate Lindsey Berg, and former U.H. stars Robyn Ah Mow-\nSantos, Heather Bown, and Kim Willoughby, all shared a hand in claiming \nthe silver medal for an exciting U.S. Women's Volleyball team.\n  The University of Hawaii has a lot to be proud of, with all 10 \nrepresenting athletes--including past alumni and current students--\nreturning home with medals.\n  I congratulate these remarkable athletes, and all of those who \ncompeted in Beijing, and wish them success in all future endeavors. You \nmade Hawaii and our Nation proud.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate all of the athletes who participated in the 2008 Summer \nOlympic Games in Beijing, China. The Olympic Games represents the \nculmination of years of dedication, discipline, intense training, and \ndetermination. These Olympians have worked tirelessly and sacrificed \nmuch for many years for the honor to represent the United States, and \nit was a joy and a privilege to watch them compete. The sportsmanship \nand athleticism exhibited was inspiring, and a sleep-deprived nation \nwas transfixed by the many triumphant and thrilling moments that \ndefined the Summer Games in Beijing. Our athletes competed admirably \nand embodied the Olympic spirit.\n  The 2008 Summer Olympics provided an opportunity for athletes and \nviewers from around the globe to witness China's culture and \nhospitality. As China opened its doors to the world during this 16-day \nspan, they treated us to a visually stunning opening and closing \nceremony, which bookended an equally impressive parade of athletic \nexcellence in spectacular venues built specifically for these games.\n  Michigan was well represented in Beijing, upholding our State's long \ntradition of producing world class athletes. It gives me great pride to \nrecognize the 27 athletes with Michigan roots who represented the \nUnited States in the 2008 Summer Games: Mike Hessman in baseball; \nTayshaun Prince and Katie Smith in basketball; Courtney King-Dye in \nequestrian; Sheila Taormina in the modern pentathlon; Ellen Tomek and \nMatt Hughes in rowing; Carrie Howe in sailing; Daryl Szarenski in \nshooting; Kate Markgraf and Lindsey Tarpley in soccer; Kara Lynn Joyce, \nMichael Phelps, Allison Schmitt, Peter Vanderkaay, and Eric Vendt in \nswimming; Serena Williams in tennis; Ebonie Floyd, Dathan Ritzenhein, \nBrian Sell, and Anna Willard in track and field; Betsey Armstrong and \nAlison Gregorka in water polo; and Randi Miller, Adam Wheeler, Andy \nHrovat, and Spenser Mango in wrestling. These Michigan athletes proudly \nrepresented our State and our Nation and brought home 22 medals: 15 \ngold, 4 silver, and 3 bronze.\n  It also comes as no surprise that the State of Michigan, which boasts \nsome of the richest collegiate athletics programs available, has ties \nto another dozen athletes who competed for their countries in Beijing: \nAndrew Hurd for Canada in swimming; Alon Mandel for Israel in swimming; \nNatasha Moodie for Jamaica in swimming; Valeria Silva for Peru in \nswimming; Nate Brannen, Kevin Sullivan, and Nicole Forrester for Canada \nin track and field; Adam Harris for Guyana in track and field; Stann \nWaithe for Trinidad and Tobago in track and field; Nick Willis for New \nZealand in track and field; and Janine Hanson and Heather Mandoli for \nCanada in rowing.\n  Athletes rely heavily on the guidance of trainers, coaches, and \nothers to succeed. It is impossible to overlook the important role \nthese individuals play, as they provide the direction, advice, and \nsupport central to transforming gifted athletes into Olympians. The \ncoaches and trainers with ties to Michigan include: Bob Bowman, coach \nfor the U.S. Swim Team; Mike Bottom, coach for the Croatian Swim Team; \nSteve Fraser, coach for the U.S. Greco Roman Wrestling Team; Lisa Hass, \ntrainer for the U.S. Rowing Team; Scott MacDonald, coach for the \nCanadian Track and Field Team; Jon Urbancheck, coach for the U.S. Swim \nTeam; and Kevin Jackson, coach for the U.S. Freestyle Wrestling Team.\n  The Olympic Games are charged with emotion. Competing in the Olympics \nis an honor and an athlete's fleeting opportunity to demonstrate to the \nworld his or her ability. The opportunity to bring home an Olympic \nmedal is an honor that many athletes dream about and only a few ever \nrealize. These athletes shoulder a tremendous amount of pressure, yet \nthey are still able to perform with the eyes of the world upon them. \nThey create history, and moments many will remember for a lifetime. The \n2008 Beijing Olympics had its share of moments that have been etched \ninto our minds and hearts and stories that will be told for years to \ncome.\n  Swimming provided some of the most intense moments in the history of \nthe Olympics, and I am proud to join Senator Cardin and others in the \nSenate in sponsoring S. Res. 700. This resolution, which was passed by \nthe Senate earlier this week, salutes the historic achievements of the \nU.S. Olympic Swim Team. It also salutes the unprecedented achievements \nof Michael Phelps, who became the first Olympian to win eight gold \nmedals in a single Olympics.\n  These Olympic Games were full of wonder and joy, and I know I speak \nfor all Michiganders when I express my pride and gratitude to all of \nthe athletes and coaches who participated in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. \nThese individuals sacrificed countless hours in practice and pushed \nthemselves and their teammates to perform at their best. To the \nathletes and coaches from Michigan, I extend to you my heartiest \ncongratulations and thanks for representing our State and our Nation \nwith dignity. I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in honoring \nevery\n\n[[Page S10426]]\n\nathlete who represented Michigan and the United States in Beijing. I \nwish each athlete future success as they continue to strive for \nexcellence.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am honored today to recognize the achievements of the \nAmerican athletes who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympic and \nParalympic Games in Beijing, China.\n  The Beijing Games were remarkable. More than 11,000 athletes \nrepresenting over 200 countries competed in this year's Olympic Games. \nThe United States won 110 medals total at the Beijing Olympics, more \nthan any other country represented.\n  The Paralympic Games, the competition for elite athletes with \nphysical disabilities, immediately followed the Olympic in Beijing. \nMore than 4,200 athletes from 148 countries competed, the largest \nnumber of nations ever represented at a Paralympic Games. American \nParalympic athletes won 99 medals overall, 36 of them gold. The \nInternational Paralympic Committee has declared these the best \nParalympic Games in history.\n  Americans from coast to coast were electrified by swimmer Michael \nPhelps, who broke the record for most gold medals in one Olympics and \nfor most gold medals for an Olympian. I had the opportunity to admire \nthe two gold and two bronze medals of American swimmer Ryan Lochte this \nweek. Ryan dedicated his performance and a portion of his winnings to \neradicating Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and he was on Capitol Hill \nthis week to raise awareness of this cruel and fatal disorder.\n  Joining U.S. medalists in swimming was a Lake Forest, IL son--Matt \nGrevers who won a silver medal in the men's 100m backstroke.\n  In addition to Matt, I would like to commend the outstanding athletes \nfrom my home State of Illinois who represented the United States in the \nOlympic and Paralympic Games. NBA star Dwyane Wade, a native of \nChicago, helped lead the U.S. Men's Basketball Team, often called ``The \nRedeem Team,'' to their first gold medal since 2000. Sean Rooney of \nWheaton, IL, also took home a gold medal as part of the U.S. Men's \nVolleyball team, and Ogonna Nnamani of Bloomington, IL, won a silver \nmedal along with the U.S. Women's Volleyball team.\n  Illinois athletes were on the medal stand during the Paralympic \nGames, too. Jaclyn Barnes of Wadsworth, IL, won a gold in Women's \nGoalball. Emily Hoskins of Mascoutah and Jennifer Ruddell of Champaign \nalso brought home gold as part of the Women's Wheelchair Basketball \nteam. Nichole Millage of Champaign and Hope Lewellen of Palos Park \nhelped earn the silver for the Women's Sitting Volleyball Team. At \nleast thirty athletes and coaches who competed at the Paralympics have \ndirect ties to Illinois.\n  Last but far from least, I would like to congratulate Dawn Harper, a \nnative of my hometown of East St. Louis, IL, for her captivating \nperformance at the Beijing Olympics. Ms. Harper, a graduate of East St. \nLouis High School and UCLA, was a part of the U.S. Women's Track Team. \nDawn took the gold medal in the 100 meter hurdles, and I couldn't be \nmore proud.\n  The Olympics and Paralympics are inspiring. They allow us to watch \nathletic performance at its very best. They also remind us of the \nenduring human spirit that drives these athletes to sacrifice, train \nand prepare for these moments of camaraderie and competition with peers \nfrom countries around the world. The State of Illinois would be proud \nto host these games in 2016. We are preparing in the hope that, 8 years \nfrom now, the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games will take place in \nthe heartland of the United States--in beautiful Chicago, IL.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table en bloc, that any statements be printed in the Record, \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 704) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 704\n\n       Whereas the 2008 Summer Olympic Games were conducted in \n     Beijing, China, from August 8 to August 24, 2008;\n       Whereas 10,500 athletes from 204 countries participated in \n     302 events in 28 sports and inspired people around the world \n     with their dedication, discipline, athletic achievement, and \n     spirit of fair play, representing the best traditions of \n     Olympic competition;\n       Whereas 596 men and women represented the United States in \n     the 2008 Summer Olympic Games as members of the United States \n     Olympic Team;\n       Whereas those United States Olympians competed in 27 sports \n     and continued the great legacy of athleticism and \n     sportsmanship that has characterized the history of United \n     States Olympic competition;\n       Whereas, in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, the United \n     States sustained and increased its clear dominance as the \n     most successful country in the history of the Olympic Games;\n       Whereas athletes from the United States won more medals in \n     the 2008 Summer Olympic Games than athletes from any other \n     country;\n       Whereas swimmer Michael Phelps of Maryland earned \n     recognition as one of the greatest athletes of all time by \n     winning an extraordinary 8 gold medals in the 2008 Summer \n     Olympic Games to surpass the previous single-year record of 7 \n     Olympic gold medals by Mark Spitz, also a swimmer from the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Michael Phelps now also holds the record for the \n     most Olympic gold medals ever won by a single athlete, with a \n     remarkable 14 gold medals;\n       Whereas, in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, the United \n     States demonstrated its continued preeminence in team sports, \n     with the men's and women's basketball teams, the men's \n     volleyball team, the women's soccer team, and the men's and \n     women's 4x400-meter relay teams winning gold medals;\n       Whereas more than 200 athletes from the United States \n     competed in 18 sports on behalf of the United States in the \n     2008 Summer Paralympic Games in Beijing, China, from \n     September 6 to September 17, 2008;\n       Whereas the United States Paralympic Team earned 99 medals, \n     including 36 gold medals, reminding the world that physical \n     challenges are no limit to human achievement;\n       Whereas United States Army First Lieutenant Melissa \n     Stockwell, who lost her left leg to a roadside bomb in \n     Baghdad in 2004, became the first veteran of the war in Iraq \n     to compete in the Paralympic Games when she swam in the \n     women's 100-meter butterfly, 100-meter freestyle, and 400-\n     meter freestyle;\n       Whereas the people of the United States stand united in \n     respect and admiration for the members of the United States \n     Olympic and Paralympic Teams, and the Teams' athletic \n     accomplishments, sportsmanship, and dedication to excellence;\n       Whereas the many accomplishments of the United States \n     Olympic and Paralympic Teams would not have been possible \n     without the hard work and dedication of many others, \n     including the United States Olympic Committee and the many \n     administrators, coaches, and family members who provided \n     critical support for the athletes:\n       Whereas the Olympic movement celebrates competition, fair \n     play, and the pursuit of dreams;\n       Whereas the United States and, in particular, the city of \n     Chicago, Illinois, celebrate those same ideals; and\n       Whereas Chicago has never hosted the Olympic and Paralympic \n     Games: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) extends congratulations for a job well done to all \n     members of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Teams and \n     to everyone who supported the Teams' efforts at the 2008 \n     Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games; and\n       (2) encourages the International Olympic Committee to \n     choose Chicago, Illinois, as the site of the 2016 Summer \n     Olympic and Paralympic Games and offers support and \n     cooperation in ensuring successful Olympic and Paralympic \n     Games in Chicago in 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10426-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10426-S10427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL METHAMPHETAMINE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

Mr. President, I understand that there is not a real \npossibility that the House of Representatives is going to take up an \nunemployment insurance extension bill tomorrow. I hope it does. I hope \nit passes. I would also fervently hope that this body will take up this \nbill immediately upon our return in mid-November when I understand we \nwill be in session for 2 or 3 days. Passing an unemployment insurance \nextension is essential. The unemployment insurance extension which was \nsigned into law on June 30 as part of our supplemental war \nappropriations bill included a 13-week extension of unemployment \nbenefits for all States. This is less of an extension than we provided \nduring economic downturns in the last 25 years because it does not \ninclude additional benefits for high-unemployment States.\n  Currently, workers who started receiving the 13-week extension in \nmid-July, under the current program, will have their benefits cut off \nin October, and 775,000 workers across the Nation are going to be cut \noff, including 42,000 in Michigan alone. By the end of this year, the \nnumber of individuals who will have exhausted their unemployment \nbenefits will rise to 1.1 million nationally and 58,000 in Michigan. We \nmust ensure that those individuals who have lost their jobs, who are \nlooking for work during a time when our companies are reducing the \nnumber of jobs and during a time when the price of food and energy is \ngoing up, that these people are not also struggling to put food on the \ntable, to pay their utility bills, and to cover their mortgage \npayments.\n  We have a bill in the Senate, which I cosponsored, which will provide \nthis much needed unemployment insurance extension. The extension would \nensure that out-of-work Americans have an additional 7 weeks as they \ncontinue to look for jobs. In high-unemployment States such as \nMichigan, the States will receive an additional 13 weeks. In August, \nMichigan's unemployment rate rose from 8.5 percent to 8.9 percent. The \nNation's unemployment rate increased by almost half a percentage point \nto 6.1 percent. That is the highest since 2003.\n  These are very hard economic times. Unemployment rates are rising. \nSince January of 2001, we have lost over 3.6 million manufacturing jobs \nnationally and over a quarter million manufacturing jobs in Michigan. \nThe numbers of unemployed are rising all over the country. We must act \nto protect American workers and their families.\n  The Congress needs to act before we adjourn. That means during that \nwindow, that 2- or 3-day window in mid-November. We must seize that \nopportunity to do what we have done in prior downturns; that is, to \ngive greater protection to workers who are unemployed and desperately \nlooking for work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a chart comparing the unemployment \nbenefits in this downturn to previous downturns be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    CONGRESS HAS EXTENDED BENEFITS FOR HARD-HIT STATES IN EVERY OTHER\n                     RECESSION OF THE LAST 25 YEARS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          Additional\n                                       Temporary       benefits granted\n              Date                   unemployment           to high\n                                   benefits granted      unemployment\n                                     to all States          States\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1982............................   8 weeks..........

He has been a great servant to this institution and to \nthe Nation.\n  From the time that he enlisted in the Navy and rose to the rank of \npetty officer third class during World War II, his service as first \nlieutenant in the Marines in Korea, to his continued service in the \nMarine Corps Reserve where he rose to be a captain, to his leadership \nas Under Secretary and then Secretary of the Navy, John Warner has \nreliably strengthened our national defense for a remarkable six \ndecades.\n  For the last three decades as a Senator, he has continued the \nunwavering dedication that he has shown throughout his military career \nto the men and women in uniform. He is a profile in courage and \nstatesmanship.\n  John Warner and I were elected to the Senate on the same day, \nNovember 6, 1978. We have been on the Senate Armed Services Committee \nour entire careers, and we have worked together on 30 consecutive \nDefense authorization bills, authorizing funds for the armed services \nof the United States. We have served with some of the true giants of \nthe Senate together, leaders such as John Stennis, Barry Goldwater, and \nSam Nunn. They all understood the critical importance of bipartisanship \non national security and defense issues.\n  Over the past few years, as John and I have passed the chairman's \ngavel back and forth, we have worked together to maintain the spirit \nand practice of bipartisanship in our leadership of the Armed Services \nCommittee. That spirit has lasted until the final days of this Congress \nand will last until this Congress is done, just as we have concluded \nwork on the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, with the \nlion's share of the credit belonging to John Warner's energy, his \npassion, and his commitment to supporting our Armed Forces.\n  The bill this year could not have passed without John Warner's \nsupport and some very courageous actions on his part. If trust is the \ncurrency of Senate dealings, John Warner is a rich man. In our many \ntravels together--to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Somalia, and elsewhere \naround the world--we have had plenty of time to discuss issues. We \nfocus on areas of agreement, and we have trusted each other completely, \neven when we stand on opposite sides of an issue.\n  The Senate is an institution whose individual seats are occupied only \nbriefly, compared to our long history. But this institution is placed \nin the stewardship of each Senator, and I can name no Senator who feels \nand recognizes and honors that responsibility and that stewardship more \nthan John Warner. Time and time again, John has answered the call of \nduty on behalf of our Nation's defense, on behalf of the welfare of the \nmen and women and families of our Armed Forces whom he loves and \nrespects so deeply and whose cause he so ably and passionately \nchampions.\n  One of the very first Senators from Virginia, James Monroe, said:\n\n       National honor is the national property of highest value.\n\n  Speaking to John's honor, one of John's staff members used to comment \nthat John Warner is a Senator who happened to be from Virginia. What he \nmeant is that John always looks for the course of action that is in the \nNation's interest and in the interest of our national security, as well \nas in the interest of his beloved Virginia.\n  John Warner has embodied the qualities that are our Nation's national \ngreatest honor--integrity, independence, fairness, civility, and \nstrength. Throughout his lifetime of service, he has been an unyielding \nadvocate for causes and policies that embody those qualities. In all of \nhis work, he has upheld the tradition of the distinguished and valuable \nleaders and patriots from Virginia who have shaped our country over the \nlast three centuries. That is what our country needs in the Senate, and \nthat is what our country expects from the Armed Services Committee. On \nso many occasions, when important issues arose on a variety of matters \nwhich required bipartisan solutions, the search for a partner began and \nended with John Warner.\n  I cherish the time that we have worked together. I cherish the deep \nfriendship that has evolved. Barb and I will forever appreciate John \nand Jeanne's friendship. We expect to enjoy it for a long time.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize and express \nmy appreciation for my friend and colleague Senator Chuck Hagel. I have \nserved in the Senate with Chuck Hagel for the past 12 years. During \nthat time, he has established himself as one who is able to rise above \npartisanship, and he is respected on both sides of the aisle for his \nhonest appraisals.\n  For the past 2 years, I have had the opportunity to work with Chuck \non our bipartisan efforts to change our course in Iraq. We have served \ntogether on the Intelligence Committee. When we have agreed on policy, \nhe has been a thoughtful and effective partner; and when we have not, \nthose same qualities served the Senate well nonetheless.\n  Chuck Hagel has brought to the U.S. Senate a deeply held commitment \nto our nation's troops and veterans and an equally deep understanding \nof their needs. With that perspective, he has served as an honest \nbroker between parties and positions, and he has been an effective \nadvocate for our brave men and women in uniform as well as for the \npeople of Nebraska.\n  He understands the power of this nation's values, not just of our \nmilitary, and he has eloquently represented those values. He has \ndefended his extraordinary independent streak with great courage.\n  I extend my thanks to Chuck and wish him and Lilibet all the best in \ntheir future endeavors.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Mr. President, after six distinguished terms in the U.S. Senate, Pete \nDomenici is retiring. I am certain that this change of pace is a \nchallenge in itself for a man who has over the years impressed all of \nus with his energy and drive and decency.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with Pete Domenici on the \nHomeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, and working with \nhim on that committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. I \nhave seen and long respected Senator Domenici's expertise on energy \npolicy; his depth of knowledge in that area has made him a steady voice \nthrough many challenges and will be very much missed by his colleagues. \nThe Senate is also losing his great depth of experience on the budget \nprocess.\n  Pete Domenici has also earned bipartisan admiration for his extensive \nwork on mental health issues, including his leadership to pass the \nbipartisan Mental Health Parity Act. I know that mental health issues \nare very personal to Senator Domenici and his family; his first-hand \ninsights have contributed significantly to congressional efforts to \nimprove mental health care in America.\n  I wish Pete Domenici and his wife Nancy all the best as they enjoy \nlife after the Senate.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Senator Wayne Allard, who \nwill retire from the U.S. Senate at the end of this Congress after more \nthan 25 years of serving and representing Colorado in the state senate, \nthe U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.\n  Wayne Allard's work throughout his career reflects his intense \ncommitment to the people of Colorado. While we frequently disagree on \nissues, he has earned the respect of his colleagues for his integrity, \nhard work and the strength and steadfastness of his support for the \nprinciples he believes in.\n  I have worked with Wayne Allard as he helped lead our effort to move \nthe National Trails System Willing Seller Act through Congress. Without \nthis bill, a landowner who wants to sell to the Federal Government was \ndenied the right to do so. The legislation provides the Federal \nGovernment with the authority to acquire land and easements from \nwilling sellers to complete nine national scenic and historic trails \nauthorized across the Nation. One of those is the North Country Trail, \nwhich runs through Michigan. I particularly appreciate Wayne Allard's \nhard work on this important measure. On the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee he brought his important background and experience as a \nveteran to our work on the anthrax threat.\n\n[[Page S10429]]\n\n  I offer my thanks and best wishes to Wayne Allard and his wife Joan \nas they turn to the next chapter of their productive lives.\n\n\n                              larry craig\n\n  I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague from Idaho, Senator Larry \nCraig. As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I can \nparticularly appreciate the vital role played by the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. Larry served as the chairman of that important committee \nfrom 2005 to 2007, and the ranking member since then. During his \ntenure, Veterans' Affairs has been challenged by two ongoing wars and, \nmore recently, by public revelations of serious deficiencies in our \nsystem for caring for our wounded warriors.\n  Helping our Nation's wounded warriors is a cause to which Larry Craig \nis profoundly committed. He has fought for our deserving and brave \nveterans, introducing bills to improve educational opportunities and to \nexpand benefits for traumatic injuries. He helped make possible a rare \njoint hearing between the Veterans' Affairs Committee and the Armed \nServices Committee to look into the situation at Walter Reed and help \nformulate the wounded warrior legislation which passed through the \nSenate with overwhelming bipartisan support as part of the Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2008.\n  While Larry Craig and I often been on opposite sides of policy \ndebates, I admire his commitment to his views and to the people of \nIdaho. In addition to the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Craig \nserves as the ranking member on the Subcommittees on Interior and \nRelated Agencies, and Superfund and Environmental Health, legislative \nareas of great concern to the citizens of Boise, the ranchers of \nMidvale and the skiers of Sun Valley. And today, I join my colleagues \nin thanking Larry Craig for his service to his State and his country, \nand I wish him and Suzanne the very best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10429-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10429-S10434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I know that many of my fellow Members are \nconcerned about the scale of this package. And while I agree that more \nprivate sector involvement would be preferable to placing hundreds of \nbillions of taxpayer dollars at risk, I think that the enormity of the \ncurrent financial crisis requires the government to act. I believe that \nthe legislation before us will establish the appropriate conditions for \nfinancial markets to begin repricing mortgage related investments like \nmortgage backed securities, MBS, collateralized debt obligations, CDOs, \nand whole loans in order to provide liquidity to solvent financial \ninstitutions. Then, these institutions can begin trading again so that \nwe can avoid a complete collapse of our nation's credit markets and \nreturn to normal.\n  Impaired loans are now being held on the balance sheets of banks and \nother financial institutions as mortgage backed securities, MBS. \nUncertainty surrounding the value of the underlying mortgages has made \nit virtually impossible to find an efficiently functioning market for \nthese securities or rationally value them.\n  The uncertainty surrounding the value of these assets has caused \nbanks and other financial institutions to gradually withdraw from the \nmarket and refrain from making new loans to firms or individuals in \norder to preserve their capital. Unfortunately, the underlying value of \nmany of these securities is high but firms lack confidence to reengage \nin the market.\n  The Treasury's plan intends to make a market for these securities, \nallow them to be priced so that trading can continue and reinitialize \nfinancial intermediation.\n  Treasury's ``troubled asset relief program'' will purchase illiquid \nmortgage assets directly using a reverse auction to purchase the \nimpaired assets in order to create a market and establish a price for \nthe assets. In a reverse auction the role of buyer and seller are \nreversed. In a standard auction, buyers compete by make bids for a \nsecurity and the best offer is taken, thereby establishing a price. \nThis price discovery process is important because it reveals \ninformation about what the buyers and sellers think a security is \nworth. A reverse auction would also be better than Treasury trying to \nassign a price without the input of the seller. It would also hopefully \nprevent Treasury from paying too high a price.\n  The Secretary of Treasury, Chairman Bernanke, large national \nfinancial institutions, small Arizona community banks and credit unions \nhave all warned me of the serious implications of not passing this \nlegislation and the impact it will have on the lives of everyday \nAmericans.\n  Sound financial institutions, manufacturers and small businesses are \nall struggling to find investors willing to provide them with cash to \nfund their operations. Instead, investors are irrationally selling \ntheir stocks and bonds regardless of whether or not the companies are \nmaking money and are instead hording cash, investing their money in \ngovernment bonds and even gold.\n  If Congress fails to act, the consequences for Main Street will be \nsevere. If banks are even willing to lend, mortgage loan interest rates \nwill continue to rise making the purchase of a home less affordable. \nMajor manufacturers won't be able to obtain affordable credit to \npurchase the raw materials and working capital that they need to stay \nin business. America's farmers won't be able to finance the large \nupfront costs associated with purchasing fertilizer and seed to plant \ntheir crops. Small businesses will not be able to get funding to extend \ncredit to their own customers who wish to make every day purchases. \nLoans for college could dry up.\n  The stock market lost over a trillion dollars on Tuesday, reducing \nAmerican wealth and individuals' retirement accounts. For the tens of \nthousands of dollars in reduced account balances, those in retirement \nor approaching retirement will be forced to contemplate accepting a \nlower standard of living in retirement or consider working longer.\n  One must remember that even though the plan contemplates the purchase \nof up to $700 billion in assets that the program is not likely to cost \nthe taxpayer that much or even a significant portion of that amount.\n  According to CBO, ``enacting the bill would likely entail some \nbudgetary cost which would, however, be substantially smaller than $700 \nbillion.''\n  Why? Treasury will be borrowing money to buy assets, many of which do \nhave value and are generating income. Most of the whole mortgages which \nunderpin the MBS and CDOs Treasury will purchase have value because \nmost Americans are current on their mortgage payments. In fact, 92 \npercent of mortgages are performing.\n  Any potential cost associated with the program is likely to be offset \nbecause Treasury can take advantage of our government's low financing \ncosts and purchase MBS by borrowing at around 3.5 percent. The \ndifference between the rate Treasury borrows funds at and the return on \nMBS will be profit which can be used to help finance the overall \nprogram.\n  Furthermore, like any good investor, the government will be buying \nsecurities at a relatively low price, likely below the securities' fair \nmarket value and holding the assets until their price rises.\n  The bill also includes a provision intended to protect against \npotential losses by requiring that firms selling troubled assets to the \ngovernment provide warrants or senior debt instruments. The warrants \nwould give the Treasury the right to buy stock in the future at a fixed \nprice.\n  In fact, warrants were issued to the federal government as part of \nprevious deals to provide lending to both Chrysler and America West \nAirlines, AWA. According to CBO, ``AWA partially compensated the \ngovernment for the loan guarantee by giving it warrants to buy as many \nas 18.8 million shares of the company's Class B common stock at an \nexercise price of $3 per share--the strike price--for a term of 10 \nyears. Those warrants increase in value with the market price of AWA \nstock and thus provide the government with additional compensation if \nits guarantee allows the company to return to profitability. Similarly, \nChrysler issued warrants to the government to purchase up to 14.4 \nmillion shares of Chrysler's common stock, also with a term of 10 \nyears.''\n  The Federal Government lost $85 million and $256 million on America \nWest and Chrysler's actual loan guarantees,\n\n[[Page S10430]]\n\nrespectively. However, the warrants gained in value making the Federal \nGovernment $80 million and $119 million, respectively ultimately \nreducing the overall cost of both loans to the taxpayer.\n  One final element of the plan protecting taxpayers requires that in 5 \nyears, the President submit a proposal to Congress to recoup any \nprojected taxpayer losses from those in the financial services industry \nthat benefit from the program.\n  So as a result of these protections every dime we get back from asset \nsales, warrants or future recoupment will go to debt reduction.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, to protect and defend the economic health \nof our Nation and the security of the systems on which our prosperity \ndepends, I am pleased that the Senate passed the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act last night. I call upon my colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives to pass this legislation as soon as possible because I \nbelieve it will help restore confidence in our capital markets and our \nfinancial institutions. It will help our Nation avert serious economic \ndislocation that could have been the cost of inaction\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank Majority Leader Reid, Senate \nBanking Committee Chairman Dodd and Senate Finance Committee Chairman \nBaucus for their efforts to include critical modifications to the \nproposed plan by Treasury Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve \nChairman Bernanke. This legislation we are considering today includes \nprovisions that will protect the taxpayer, limit executive \ncompensation, provide critically needed assistance to homeowners, and \nprovide strong congressional and judicial review procedures. Without \ntheir efforts, I do not believe we would have been able to pass this \ncritically needed legislation.\n  Our Nation is facing its greatest economic crisis since the Great \nDepression. A series of financial institution failures and frozen \ncredit markets have imperiled our economy. We need to take immediate \naction to restore confidence and help stop this threat and stabilize \nour financial system.\n  Every American family is concerned about the economic situation we \nface. They are already facing rising gas prices, food prices, health \ncare costs and college tuition. Many are wondering: How will bailing \nout Wall Street firms help me? The answer is we have to bail out Wall \nStreet to protect Main Street.\n  This will not be done without great expense to the taxpayers. \nHowever, I strongly believe that taking quick and decisive action is \nnot only our best option it may be our only option. As we consider this \nextraordinary commitment on the part of the American taxpayer, we have \nto ask ourselves: What is the price of inaction?\n  The ripple effect of the collapse of Wall Street's major financial \ninstitutions could develop into an economic disaster sweeping across \nthe country. The stark reality is that without massive Federal \nassistance, our financial system could collapse. Small businesses would \nbe unable to obtain financing and jobs would vanish. Families would be \nunable to borrow for new homes or to send their children to college. \nRetirement funds could plummet. Those are the stakes.\n  The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act will provide up to $700 \nbillion to the Secretary of the Treasury to buy mortgages and other \nassets from financial institutions. Instead of giving all the funds at \nonce, as requested by Secretary Paulson, the legislation gives the \nTreasury only $250 billon immediately. The bill requires the President \nto certify that the additional $450 billion are required subject to \ncongressional disapproval. It requires the Treasury to modify mortgage \nloans whenever possible to help keep families in their homes. It \nrequires companies that sell bad assets to the Government to give \ntaxpayers the opportunity to share in their future growth. This will \nhelp offset the costs of this program. Finally, it includes meaningful \nlimits on both executive compensation and ``golden parachutes''. This \nwill help insure that not one dime of taxpayer funds will be used to \npay the salary of CEOs who have abused the public trust and played a \nrole in developing the economic crisis we face.\n  American families must have confidence that the deposits they have in \nour banks are safe. Thanks to measures put in place during the Great \nDepression, deposits of up to $100,000 are guaranteed by the Federal \nGovernment. I am pleased this legislation temporarily raises the FDIC \nlimit to $250,000. I think it will help small businesses, make our \nbanking system more secure, and help restore public confidence in our \nfinancial system.\n  The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 also contains an \nimportant provision that will help hundreds of community banks \nthroughout the country. Prior to the Federal Housing Finance Agency \nplacing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, many banks had \ninvested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock. Unfortunately, \nthe value of these shares was essentially eliminated due to the \nGovernment's action. These investments--standard means for the banking \nindustry and the Government-Sponsored enterprises to provide and raise \ncapital--have always been viewed as a conservative investment by \nfinancial institutions.\n  These investments provided capital to Fannie and Freddie, and thus \nindirectly benefited the economy by helping Fannie and Freddie provide \nliquidity to the secondary mortgage market. Unfortunately, losses on \nthese shares will have significant tax consequences for these banks, \nwhich will translate into fewer loans being made across the Nation.\n  Section 301 of the legislation provides targeted tax relief for all \nbanks holding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock by allowing \ninstitutions to treat the losses on these securities as ordinary losses \nfor tax purposes. This temporary change will provide a vital tax \nreduction against ordinary income and preserve a portion of the capital \nlost due to the Government's actions with regards to the Government-\nsponsored enterprises.\n  The bill is designed to give all banks--especially community banks--\nregardless of size or organizational structure, ordinary tax relief for \nthese holdings. I encourage the Secretary of the Treasury to work with \nCongress and the banking industry to ensure that all institutions have \naccess to this relief.\n  We have no guarantee that this program will fix this acute crisis. \nWhat we do know is that if Government does not step in to provide \nfunding, we could hasten an economic meltdown.\n  After this plan is enacted into law, we must take bold action to \nrevamp our regulatory practices, fix the derivatives market, offer an \nadditional economic stimulus for businesses, provide liquidity for \nsmall businesses and provide real assistance to families bearing the \nweight of the crisis. This will be a long process.\n  I believe the moment has come to rethink the trend over the past \ngeneration toward deregulation of our financial institutions and \ncapital markets. You can see it in the excessive use of derivatives to \nmanage risk. You can see it in the reckless use of leverage by some \nfinancial institutions to finance ever riskier and more lucrative \nfinancial products. You can see it in our housing markets, where the \nconcept of risk became our greatest undervalued asset. You can see it \nin the failure to require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to set aside the \nappropriate capital reserves. You can see it in the outrageous salaries \nthat so many CEOs of troubled companies have earned in recent years \nwhich can be tied directly to the strategies they adopted that showed \nno respect for the risks they were taking with other people's money or \nto our Nation's economic future.\n  This was a perfect storm: irresponsible lending, irresponsible \nborrowing and a lack of basic oversight and effective regulation put \nmillions of families in homes they could not afford. Too many Americans \ntook unreasonable risks to buy a home when markets were booming. Too \nmany financial institutions lowered their lending standards but didn't \nplan appropriately for increased risk. At the same time, some borrowers \ninflated their incomes and misrepresented themselves in order to buy \nexpensive homes that they could not afford.\n  In 1994, I supported the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act \nwhich gave the Federal Reserve the authority\n\n[[Page S10431]]\n\nto prohibit unfair and deceptive lending practices. It took the Federal \nReserve 14 years to implement regulations to stop abusive and deceptive \npractices which helped cause the housing crisis.\n  Since 2000, I have been concerned about predatory lending and have \nsupported legislation to stop the excesses that these lenders have too \noften hoodwinked homeowners into accepting. It stopped companies from \nimposing high-cost mortgages, included critical consumer disclosures, \nrequired creditors to assess the consumer's ability to pay, prohibited \nprepayment fees and penalties. This could have stopped many of the \nexcesses we are paying for today from occurring in the first place. \nUnfortunately, this legislation did not receive any support from the \nother side.\n  The damage has been staggering. Five million homeowners are either in \ndefault or in foreclosure and 10,000 more join them in foreclosure \nevery day. Some economists warn that the spike in foreclosures could \nlower home values by 30 percent--when even a 10 percent decline takes \n$2 trillion in wealth from American homeowners. The loans financing \nthese homes are now frozen on the balance sheets of banks and other \nfinancial institutions, preventing them from providing new loans. Today \nwe are living the consequences: an economy teetering on the edge.\n  It is obvious to every American that we need greater regulation of \nour mortgage markets and our lending practices. We must eliminate the \nunfair and deceptive practices that helped cause our current economic \ndifficulties immediately.\n  Another crucial ingredient in today's crisis is the use of complex \nfinancial derivatives. These complex financial maneuvers--hidden from \nthe view of most Americans--have quietly become a crucial part of \nmanaging risk in our economy. In May, the Bank for International \nSettlements estimated that the total value of derivative contracts was \napproximately $600 trillion. To put this speculation in context: that \nis 200 times larger than the Federal budget.\n  Derivatives are essentially bets on future economic behavior: \nfinancial contracts which can gain or lose value as the price of some \nunderlying commodity, financial indicator or other variable changes. \nUnfortunately their rise to prominence in our economy was not matched \nwith an increase in regulation or transparency. Warren Buffett has \npreviously called derivatives ``. . . financial weapons of mass \ndestruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially \nlethal.''\n  The continuing uncertainty over derivatives has helped to bring about \nthe recent freeze in our credit markets. For example, Bear Stearns was \ndeeply involved in the financial derivatives markets. The Federal \nReserve eventually provided up to $30 billion and convinced JP Morgan \nto purchase Bear Stearns because they feared its sudden collapse would \nproduce a tidal wave of defaults around the globe. Also, since Lehman \nBrothers filed for bankruptcy, financial institutions and corporations \nhave been unsure how to process and cover its derivatives and credit \ndefault swaps.\n  Congress must consider and pass legislation to reform and manage \nderivatives. We must learn from the current crisis and develop \nsafeguards that ensure that the failure of a financial institution \nwhich holds derivatives does not cause a freeze in our credit markets.\n  The housing crisis also triggered a reassessment of other financial \nrisks, including leveraged loans taken out by financial institutions to \nincrease profits. This approach allows institutions to take much larger \nmarket positions which increases their profits but also increases their \nrisk. In 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission relaxed capital \nrules for investment banks which allowed these firms to increase their \nrisks during good economic times. Unfortunately, some financial \ninstitutions were reckless in their use of leverage.\n  Published reports say Merrill Lynch borrowed an astounding 44 times \nthe size of its capital to increase profits. If you borrow 44 times \nyour capital and your investments increase only 1 percent you have \nactually made a 44 percent profit. Unfortunately, the reverse is also \ntrue. Think about it: If you have $1 and you use it to borrow and \ninvest $44, common sense tells you that if things go wrong, you will be \nin a world of trouble. Well, that is exactly what happened. These risky \ninvestments caught up to Merrill Lynch. They were bought out by Bank of \nAmerica after facing bankruptcy earlier this month.\n  We need to dramatically increase our oversight of all financial \ninstitutions and increase capital standards to insure companies like \nMerrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers can never again impact the U.S. \nfinancial system due to their risky business plans.\n  The government sponsored entities, GSEs, particularly Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac and the FHA have played a critical role in expanding \nhomeownership. However, like too many financial institutions, these \norganizations included subprime mortgage debt in their portfolios but \ndidn't plan appropriately for the increased risk they had incurred. The \nCongress and the Bush administration also failed to require Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac to increase their capital requirements to adjust to the \nincreased risks. As a result, the Bush administration was forced to put \nboth Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship earlier this month \nat a cost of approximately $200 billion to the taxpayers.\n  Back in 2004, I said that I expressed concern about governance and \naccounting problems at Freddie Mac and that I would support legislation \nthat provides for strong, effective supervision and regulation of \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises within a framework that assures their \nsafety and soundness. During the 109th Congress, the Bush \nadministration blocked the enactment of bipartisan legislation to \nreform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  Going forward, in order to stop the increasing numbers of \nforeclosures, we need the GSEs to continue their mission, within \nappropriate capital constraints, to help stabilize the mortgage \nmarkets.\n  Executive compensation is another area that we need to address. We \nhave all read about the outrageous salaries that many of the CEOs of \ntroubled companies have earned over the past few years. Some have \nincreased their pay by increasing the risks their companies take. I am \npleased that Chairman Baucus of the Senate Finance Committee is pushing \nfor changes in the Treasury proposal to prevent excessive compensation \nand golden parachutes for executives who sell troubled assets under the \nTreasury program. CEOs, who abused the public trust and played a role \nin developing the current economic crisis and are now asking to be \nbailed out, will not be able to receive severance packages or excessive \nsalaries. Taxpayers will not subsidize their excessive salaries.\n  When you add it all up, the financial crisis is a result of failures \nover the past generation to provide appropriate regulation and \nsupervision of the financial services industry. Over the past 8 years, \nhowever, what was effectively a trend toward deregulation turned into a \nstampede. The Bush administration and others in Congress have \nconsistently railed against oversight and accountability during the \nlast 8 years; now taxpayers are forced to clean up this \nadministration's mess.\n  So I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to come \ntogether to support the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act that will \nhelp protect our vital national interest in the continued health of our \neconomy. Next, we need to come together as a nation to help those who \nhave been hurt by the economic crisis and to finally respond to the \nstructural problems that have brought us to this point.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, middle-class families are being squeezed \nfinancially. They feel that the economy and the Government are just not \nworking for them.\n  The vast majority of Americans are unhappy with the direction \nPresident Bush has led us over the last 8 years.\n  For most of the last decade there has been far too little oversight \nof the financial marketplace and too little help for the middle class.\n  I share that frustration. I have voted time and again for common \nsense tax cuts for the middle class, developing alternative sources of \nenergy, like solar and wind power, greater investment in our roads and \nbridges, improving our schools, and expanding health coverage for \nchildren, new regulations to protect consumers, a responsible end\n\n[[Page S10432]]\n\nto the war in Iraq and a host of other important initiatives, but the \nsad reality is that time and again those efforts have been dashed by \nfilibusters and vetoes by the President and his allies.\n  But as real as that frustration is, the economic situation requires \nus to act swiftly and responsibly.\n  The choice now is to act on this bill or watch as this economic \ncrisis makes the already difficult economy even worse. If we fail to \nact, there will be more impacts on the lives of an already struggling \nmiddle class--job losses, pension losses, and an ever harder time \npaying for college.\n  That is why we must act, and that is why we must pass this \nlegislation.\n  When this proposal was first unveiled, it was little more than a \nblank check, and I know the people of Rhode Island were outraged just \nlike me.\n  But this proposal is vastly different.\n  Gone is the blank check.\n  In its place there are strong protections for the taxpayers, a \ngreater likelihood of success, better oversight, and, most importantly, \na chance for a return on this investment in stabilizing the economy.\n  When the President sent us his blank check, it was clear that we \nneeded to make sure we followed the same principle anyone follows when \nthey lend money which is that you get paid back. That is why I fought \nand got bipartisan support for a provision that ensures taxpayers do \nnot remain exposed to all of the risks of this program by requiring if \nyou participate in this taxpayer-funded program, that taxpayers get a \npiece of your future profits through a share in the profit of the \nassisted company.\n  This device, known as a warrant, is nothing new, and it can be very \neffective. In fact, in the Chrysler loan guarantee, warrants were used \nand resulted in a profit to the Government and in turn the American \npeople. Warrants were also a part of the successful effort to revive \nthe airline industry after 9/11. Most recently, Warren Buffett included \nthem in his deal with Goldman Sachs last week, as did the FDIC in its \nrecent brokering of the purchase of Wachovia by Citibank.\n  Warrants allow the taxpayers to get their money back and more if a \nparticipating company rights itself. In other words, as the company's \nstock goes up--as it should over time--taxpayers get to participate in \nthat appreciation and even enjoy a reasonable premium.\n  No one will be shocked to learn that the President and Wall Street \nopposed my idea for warrants. But when faced with the simple fact that \nany Wall Street business transaction would exact no less of a price, \nprotecting the taxpayer won and the special interests lost.\n  There are no guarantees that the assets purchased under this program \nwill eventually appreciate, though that is certainly our hope, but at \nthe very least warrants help safeguard the taxpayer against losses on \nthose assets that underperform.\n  It is only right to ensure that the taxpayer not foot the bill for \nthis rescue plan because the point of this economic rescue plan is to \nprovide liquidity throughout our credit markets, not to line the \npockets of those looking to make a buck on the backs of the taxpayer.\n  We also said ``no'' when it came to the President's proposal to spend \nall these funds with zero oversight and transparency. Now, there is a \nclear requirement that all of these arrangements are transparent and \nabove board. Moreover, there will be a panel of outside experts who \nmust report to the Congress and the American people on the Treasury \nSecretary's use of these funds and submit a regulatory reform plan in \nJanuary 2009 so we can work on new laws to prevent a similar case of \nmarket failure. And, we included provisions to ensure that no-bid \ncontracts are not awarded, contracting rules are followed, conflicts of \ninterest are prevented, and courts have the authority to review any \nquestions about this law.\n  And, we took a strong first step when it comes to the excessive pay \nof too many executives on Wall Street who got us into this mess. \nIndeed, under this bill, there will be no golden parachutes for those \nexecutives who helped create this financial crisis. Instead, they will \nsee those sweetheart deals go away, and, indeed, the Securities and \nExchange Commission and the FBI have launched investigations into many \nof these questionable financial transactions.\n  Lastly, we should not overlook that this bill also extends a number \nof tax cuts that will generate investments in alternative sources of \nenergy and green job creation as well as a tax cut for approximately \n92,000 middle class Rhode Islanders who would otherwise face the \nAlternative Minimum Tax.\n  This bill is necessary, but not perfect. It should be stronger when \nit comes to impacting those who got us into this mess, and it should \ncontain some of the consumer and investor protections and accounting \nreforms I have called for over the years. There should be more \nresources to prevent foreclosures, not to aid people who took out a \nmortgage they should not have, but to protect the property values and \nstability of those neighborhoods facing a growing number of \nforeclosures.\n  If we don't follow up this vote with increased transparency and \nbetter regulations of the financial marketplace, we could very well \nfind ourselves debating another economic rescue package in the not too \ndistant future.\n  Indeed, I have held eleven hearings over the last year and a half in \nan effort to bring these regulation and accounting issues to the \nattention of my colleagues and the administration. These may have \nseemed like arcane hearings to many, but the reality is those who were \nsupposed to enforce the rules of the marketplace and protect the \neconomy were asleep at the wheel, or worse, blinded by a misguided \nideology that over-relies on deregulation. Time and time again, \nwitnesses at these hearings said everything was okay or was at least \nmanageable. They said we should not have hearings and that less \noversight and regulation would cure any problems. Now, two of the \ncompanies that testified don't even exist. The status quo is \nunacceptable, and I am hard at work on legislation to reform oversight \nof Wall Street because the current system failed.\n  The bill is prompted by a systematic failure by all the financial \nregulators who turned a blind eye to the problems that had been \nidentified well before this crisis erupted.\n  Reckless and irresponsible business decisions brought us here, but \nlax oversight and poor risk management by regulators also played a \nstarring role.\n  No one is happy that we have to act, but we need to act to avoid \nfurther damage to our economy. The task before us now is to protect \npeople's jobs and retirement savings, and do our best to craft a \nsolution to the credit crisis that prevents our economy from grinding \nto a halt.\n  The question must also be asked: How can we prevent this from \nhappening again?\n  The administration found that it could no longer control events. \nInstead, events controlled the administration as credit markets have \nstubbornly remained frozen and banks still refuse to lend to each \nother. Small businesses are finding it harder to get credit, as are \nconsumers.\n  No one takes lightly voting for a $700 billion package, even with \ntaxpayer protections I and my colleagues built into it. These \nsophisticated institutions and complex instruments impact very \nconcrete, everyday assets, from homes to retirement savings. We must \nact now to protect these important assets.\n  Fundamentally, this is about protecting the savings and well-being of \nall Americans and providing access to capital and credit for businesses \nand governments to make investments in our future.\n  The Senate has taken the first step and I urge the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today, at this difficult \nmoment in the history of our Nation, as a proud Senator from West \nVirginia--a State whose people know a thing or two about working hard, \nplaying by the rules, and protecting and defending the American dream \nin the face of adversity. They believe in looking out for one another, \nand they deserve just that in return from their Government.\n  For some time now, many West Virginia families have been besieged by \nrising gas prices and increased food and utility bills. Already \nstrained paychecks are being stretched to the limit, and families are \nincreasingly finding\n\n[[Page S10433]]\n\nthemselves on shaky ground. They know they are one illness, one lost \njob, one accident away from falling into a deep hole. People are \nworried that they are going to lose their homes, they are watching \ntheir property values decrease as neighbors face foreclosure, and they \nare fearful that this will be the week their job gets cut or their \nretirement plan goes under. This anxiety is not just being felt by \nthose who make the minimum wage, it is being felt by everyone in every \ncorner of my State. People are angry, and I share that anger.\n  I have spent my entire career fighting for West Virginians to have a \nvoice and to make sure they don't get the short end of the stick. The \nPutnam County factory worker who relies on their job at the plant, the \nSt. Marys High School student who is dreaming of attending college to \nbe a teacher, and the thousands of homeowners across the state who are \nentitled to real peace of mind knowing that the house they have been \npaying for every month like clockwork for 20 years will not be taken \nfrom them.\n  As our financial markets have deteriorated, banks have collapsed and \ncredit has begun drying up. Small businesses have had a tougher time \naccessing capital to operate and keep workers employed. Even prominent \nAmerican companies such as GE, GM, and Caterpillar are beginning to \nfeel this credit crunch. That means less investing in the future, fewer \nplants opening, and--what I fear most--massive layoffs, long \nunemployment lines, and a real run on the banks.\n  Just yesterday I was contacted by the president of a midsized West \nVirginia manufacturing company that is feeling the pain of this \nfinancial crisis. Because of the credit crunch, his customers can't get \nthe capital to purchase his products, cutting in to his company's \nsales. Monday's huge drop in the stock market, after the House failed \nto pass a rescue bill, caused his employees' 401(k) plans to lose a \nfull year's worth of value in one day. That means his employees would \nhave to work one additional year in order to recover the value in their \nretirement plan.\n  We all knew the economy was weakening but the magnitude of this \ncrisis--watching our financial system crumble--has been shocking. The \nfull impact of this disaster is not yet known, but it is safe to say \nthis is the most troubling series of financial events I have seen in my \nlifetime.\n  In response to this crisis, the President sent the Congress a request \nfor a $700 billion blank check--with no details on how the money would \nbe spent, no oversight, no regulations for greedy Wall Street bankers, \nand most importantly no protections for taxpayers.\n  With my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have been working to \ndetermine the best way forward. I have considered the situation and the \noptions very carefully. I have consulted experts in West Virginia and \nelsewhere, and I have concluded that what we face is extremely serious; \nand if we do not take action now, the impact on West Virginia families \nwill be devastating.\n  We should not be in this situation. The lack of regulation or warning \nby the Bush administration is reprehensible, but the challenge is very \nserious and we must face it together head on. There is no guarantee \nthat a rescue plan will stop the bleeding, but we must try.\n  From the beginning, I made it very clear that I would only support a \nrescue plan that looked out for the needs of people on Main Street and \nfor the taxpayers who work to keep this country strong. The rescue plan \nwe have agreed to is designed to help West Virginians get some of the \nfinancial help and tax relief they need and will need in the difficult \nmonths ahead. The plan is not perfect and we must do more--but it is an \nimportant step.\n  Six key pieces of the legislation were critical for my support:\n  First, the bill mandates that taxpayers share in any future profits \nin order to recoup their funding if at all possible.\n  The legislation gives the Treasury Department the authority to take \nwarrants or equity in companies that participate, effectively acquiring \nstock in the company. The warrants help reduce the risk to the \ntaxpayers. If the price the government pays for the assets is low and \nthe banks end up benefiting, the government would own a share of that \nbenefit. If the government is unable to recover the money spent by \nTreasury after five years, the President must submit a plan to recover \nthe shortfall from the financial services industry.\n  Second, the bill establishes an oversight board and an independent \nInspector General who will watch over the day-to-day operations of the \nTreasury from the inside out.\n  I joined some of my Senate colleagues led by the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Max Baucus, in calling for \nthis IG. The American people deserve the advocacy of a tough, \nindependent IG who wakes up every morning with one mission in mind: to \ntrack the work of the Treasury--in the greatest detail possible--in \norder to hold the officials executing this plan accountable and protect \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  Third, the bill limits executive pay for failed CEOs who abused the \npublic trust, and for continuing or future CEOs whose companies \nparticipate in the Government rescue.\n  It was recently reported that Wall Street's five biggest firms paid \nmore than $3 billion in the last 5 years to their top executives while \nthey presided over the sale of the subprime loans and securities that \nbrought down our financial markets. This is offensive and immoral. \nThese are taxpayer dollars--the American people's money--and we cannot \nallow this to continue.\n  The legislation limits CEOs and corporate executives from leaving \ncompanies they drove into bankruptcy with ``golden parachutes''--\nespecially with taxpayer dollars. The bill cuts the current tax \ndeduction on executive pay in half and then charges a 20 percent excise \ntax on any company that gives excessive compensation packages. These \nrestrictions were hard fought, and in my view not enough, but if some \ncompanies or executives find a loophole and try to take advantage of \ntaxpayer dollars here, I assure you we will clamp down even further.\n  Fourth, the bill provides relief to homeowners who have been caught \nup in the current mortgage crisis and are trying to save their homes.\n  The bill starts to address the root of this financial crisis--\nforeclosures--not by giving a pass to individuals who took out loans \nthey could not afford, but by allowing the Government to renegotiate \nmortgage terms. Two million more foreclosures are projected in the next \nyear and it is in everyone's interest to bring that number down, \nkeeping more families in their homes and paying off their debts.\n  Fifth, the bill raises the FDIC insurance limit temporarily to \n$250,000, providing more liquidity to banks and addressing the current \ncrisis of confidence, which is causing people to pull their money out \nof their banks and contributing to the credit crunch.\n  This is especially important to small businesses which employ over 50 \npercent of our private work force in West Virginia and which rely on \nbanks to loan them the necessary capital to make payroll, stock their \nshelves, and invest in new projects and jobs.\n  Sixth and lastly, the bill includes very substantial tax relief, so \nthat working Americans also get the financial help they need in this \ntime of crisis.\n  Now 24 million families who can't afford a higher tax bill--including \n86 thousand in West Virginia--will be protected from the Alternative \nMinimum Tax. The parents of almost 80,000 West Virginia children will \nnow qualify for an even better child tax credit, and families will get \nhelp with college costs. Teachers who put out money from their own \npocket to buy school supplies will get a deduction to help pay them \nback, and companies will get a boost to do more research and \ndevelopment and create new jobs.\n  And very importantly--for a secure future on all fronts--the bill \nputs into law a whole host of energy and clean coal provisions: $5 \nbillion for renewable energy, $1.5 billion for clean coal facilities, \n$1.2 billion for the Black Lung Trust Fund, and an incentive for the \nsteel industry fuel, a $20 credit for carbon sequestration, and more \nprotection for our coal miners with increased investment in mine rescue \nteams and state-of-the-art mine safety equipment.\n  As a Governor of West Virginia during the early 1980s, I saw the \ncrippling\n\n[[Page S10434]]\n\nand damaging effects that the recession had on the people of my state. \nI don't want to see our industries fail, thousands of people lose their \njobs, or the kind of fear, uncertainty, and hopelessness that defined \nthose times.\n  Nothing matters more to me than helping West Virginia families hold \non to their life savings, their jobs, their homes, their retirement, \nand their hopes for the future.\n  Failure to act will severely hurt West Virginia families and that is \na risk I am not willing to take.\n  I also want to be clear that there are likely more tough times ahead. \nThis plan is intended to prevent an economic catastrophe, but it alone \nwill not put us on the path to prosperity.\n  We still must turn our attention to broader economic recovery, from \nhealthcare, to increased wages, to expanded job opportunities, to major \npublic infrastructure investments, to restoring fairness to our tax \nsystem so that the middle class can once again prosper.\n  The people of West Virginia deserve lasting solutions and I will \nfight every day to make sure this happens.\n\n\n                         timber tax provisions\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am concerned that this stabilization \npackage, which includes0package of business tax incentives, does not \nextend the timber tax provisions that were enacted in sections 15311 \nand 15312 of the farm bill and which are scheduled to expire in May \n2009. I and others have long advocated the enactment of provisions that \nwould permanently reform the tax rules for timber income. Given budget \nconstraints, as part of the farm bill, we established the new rules for \n1 year as a first step. It is important that the provisions not be \nallowed to lapse. Otherwise, our good work could be undone because we \nwill revert to the same situation as before in which companies that \nharvest timber are subject to higher tax rates simply because of their \nform of business organization.\n  As we consider tax extenders legislation, my specific concern is \nthat, by extending a variety of expiring tax provisions until the end \nof 2009 but not extending the timber tax provisions, we may create the \nimpression that the timber tax provisions are not likely to be \nextended. Because of this concern, I am interested in learning, from \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, about their \nplans for considering an extension of the timber tax provisions.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Lincoln. We made good \nprogress in enacting the timber tax provisions in the farm bill, but we \nmust take the important next step of making the provisions permanent \nor, at the very least, extending them.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to agree with the points \nmade by my colleagues. The timber tax provisions are critically \nimportant to Washington and other States that rely on timber jobs, and \nthe provisions must be extended promptly. I have discussed this matter \nwith the chairman of the Finance Committee, and he has assured me that \nhe will work to extend the provisions early next year.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am happy to respond to the Senators from Arkansas, \nOregon, and Washington, whom I have worked with for several years on \nthis issue. They and others have persuaded me that the timber tax \nprovisions are fair and are important. That is why I strongly supported \nincluding the provisions in the farm bill.\n  That said, I believe that the timber tax provisions are in a \ndifferent category than the extenders that are included in the current \nbill. The extenders in this bill are provisions that have been in the \nTax Code for some time, and most already have expired. The timber tax \nprovisions, in contrast, are new--enacted earlier this year--and, as \nthe Senator said, they do not expire until May 2009. In light of that, \nalthough I strongly support the timber tax provisions, I believe that \nit is better to address them early next year rather than as part of \nthis bill. I anticipate that we will be considering tax legislation \nearly in the next Congress. I will work with Senator Lincoln, Senator \nMurray, and other interested Senators to see that the timber tax \nprovisions are extended.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with the chairman of the Finance Committee. I \nsupport the timber tax provisions and believe they should be made \npermanent or at least extended. I also agree with Senator Baucus that \nwe have time to consider the matter early next year, and I will work \nwith him to pass a timely extension.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the intent in section \n105(c) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, \n``Regulatory Modernization Report,'' of the important requirements for \nanalysis of regulation of the over-the-counter swaps market and for \nrecommendations regarding the enhancement of the clearing and \nsettlement of over-the-counter swaps.\n  The OTC swaps market is enormous, estimated to be $600 trillion. This \nmarket is primarily made up of interest rate swaps and Credit default \nswaps. Corporations, banks, insurance companies, GSEs, pension funds, \nState and local governments and endowments all participate in the OTC \nswaps market.\n  The OTC swaps market is a ``bilateral contract'' market which does \nnot involve an exchange or a clearinghouse. It is directly between two \nparties, which results in each party bearing ``counter party credit \nrisk.'' In other words, if one of the two parties goes bankrupt or \nfails to pay, the other party can suffer a complete loss on the \ntransaction.\n  Since the OTC swaps market has impacts on the financial system, it is \nappropriate and timely to look at it carefully. Some of the largest OTC \nswaps market dealers and market participants have been merged in \nfederally arranged transactions into stronger market participants, \ntaken into Government conservatorships or receiverships or provided a \nline of credit directly by the Federal Government. These actions were \ntaken, in part, because of concerns by Federal authorities about either \nthe losses in their OTC swaps books and or the potential cascading \neffect on OTC swaps market if such an entity failed.\n  The Treasury Report should look at the OTC swaps market generally and \nthe current and potential options for improvements in clearing \ncontracts, such as through a Federally licensed clearinghouse, with a \nview to whether it would materially lower credit risk. The Report \nshould consider issues such as the processing of confirmations, \nmargining, collateral management, market access, transparency in \npricing, and safety and soundness concerns.\n  Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the efforts of the many staff \nmembers who have labored almost around the clock over the past several \nweeks to help craft this legislation.\n\n\n                       From the Banking Committee\n\n       Amy Friend, Dean Shahinian, Jonathan Miller, Aaron Klein, \n     Julie Chon, Jenn Fogel-Bublick, Lynsey Graham, Brian \n     Filipowich, Drew Colbert.\n\n\n           From Senator Gregg's Committee and personal staff\n\n       Denzel McGuire, Jim Hearn, Allison Parent, Christopher \n     Gahan.\n\n\n                       From the Finance Committee\n\n       Russ Sullivan, Cathy Koch, Mark Prater.\n\n\n       From Senator Conrad's Budget Committee and Personal Staff\n\n       Mary Naylor, Tom Mahr, Lisa Konwinski, Matt Salomon, John \n     Righter.\n\n\n                      From the Judiciary Committee\n\n       Bruce Cohen, Kristine Lucius.\n\n\n                   From the Majority Leader's office\n\n       Bruce King, Mark Wetjen, Gary Myrick, Randy Devalk.\n\n\n                  From the Republican Leader's office\n\n       Rohit Kumar, Derek Kan.\n\n\n                 From the Office of Legislative Counsel\n\n       Laura Ayoud, Rob Grant, Didem Nisanci with Senator Reid, \n     David Stoopler with Senator Schumer.\n       Last but not least, our extraordinary Floor Staff, led by \n     Lula Davis and Dave Chiappa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10434-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10434-S10439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                              chuck hagel\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with the end of a session fast \napproaching, it is time once again to say farewell to some of our \nfavorite colleagues in the Senate. And today that includes our friend, \nthe senior Senator from Nebraska.\n  Chuck Hagel's long record of service is well known to many. What some \nmay not know is that that record of service long predates his time in \nWashington.\n  Responsibility was thrust upon Chuck at an early age. A fourth \ngeneration Nebraskan, Chuck became the man of the house at the young \nage of 16 after the death of his father.\n\n[[Page S10435]]\n\n  And he accepted the responsibility head on, working hard to support \nhis mom and younger brothers.\n  But even then working hard was nothing new to Chuck Hagel, who had \ntaken his first job delivering papers at the age of 7.\n  As a young man, Chuck answered the call and volunteered to serve in \nVietnam, and Chuck's fellow soldiers turned to him for leadership.\n  One of the soldiers who served right alongside Chuck was his younger \nbrother Tom. By coincidence, the Hagel brothers ended up in the same \nunit and rode together in the same armored personnel carrier.\n  In a defining act of heroism, Chuck once dragged his brother out of \nthat carrier after it had struck a landmine and burst into flames. The \nblast left Chuck badly burned and ruptured both his eardrums. Yet \ndespite serious injuries to himself, he brought his brother through \nenemy fire to safety.\n  After returning home from Vietnam, Chuck worked his way through \ncollege and got his first taste of Washington working for Omaha \nCongressman John McCollister.\n  Later, Chuck would show his drive and his leadership in the business \nworld. Taking a risk, he sank his entire savings into a business \nventure that eventually paid off.\n  And then, 12 years ago, he took another gamble. And we are glad he \ndid.\n  A political newcomer, Chuck defeated Nebraska's sitting State \nattorney general in a primary, and then a popular incumbent governor in \nthe general election for a seat in the U.S. Senate.\n  I will note, Mr. President, that the governor he beat is now the \njunior Senator from Nebraska. And in a sign of Chuck's character and \ncommitment to the people of Nebraska, the two former rivals have worked \nin tandem on many issues for the good of the people of their State.\n  I know Senator Nelson would agree that Senator Hagel's departure is a \ngreat loss for this Chamber and for the people of the Cornhusker State.\n  Chuck's advocacy for the people of Nebraska was reaffirmed 6 years \nago when the voters sent him back to Washington for a second term.\n  In a sign of his effectiveness and his popularity, he won reelection \nto the Senate by the biggest margin Nebraska has ever seen.\n  The one-time political newcomer trounced his opponent, winning 83 \npercent of the vote--and all 93 counties in the State.\n  In two terms in the Senate, Chuck has earned the respect of his \ncolleagues and risen to national prominence as a clear voice on foreign \npolicy and national security. He has consistently fought to expand free \ntrade, particularly with Vietnam.\n  Chuck's stature as a leading voice in foreign affairs has earned him \na reputation, in just 12 years in the Senate, as one of Nebraska's \ngreat statesmen. This is a tribute to his intelligence, hard work, and \ndevotion to a country that he has served his entire adult life.\n  Elaine and I have enjoyed getting to know Chuck, Lilibet, and their \nfamily over the years. I know Chuck's a proud dad. And his kids should \nbe proud of their dad.\n  Chuck, it has been an honor, and a pleasure, to serve with you. We \nall wish you well in whatever future endeavors you choose to take on.\n  I am confident that, even though Nebraska is known as a flat State, \nwhoever succeeds Charles Timothy Hagel in the U.S. Senate is going to \nhave a very steep hill to climb.\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  Mr. President, one of the great sticking points for the framers of \nthe U.S. Constitution was how small States would be represented in the \nnew Government.\n  In the end, the compromise that gave small and big States equal \nrepresentation in the U.S. Senate broke the logjam, paved the way for \nratification, and became one of the most distinctive--and best--\nfeatures of our democracy.\n  It has ensured that the interests of all Americans, including those \nwho live in remote or secluded corners of the country, are felt in the \nhalls of power. And, throughout the life our country, it has meant that \nmen and women who understood those interests and who could communicate \nthem with clarity and purpose would always have a central place in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  For nearly two decades, Larry Craig has been that person for the \npeople of Idaho--a fierce advocate and an effective legislator who \nunderstands the needs of his State, and always delivered.\n  The grandson of a homesteader, Senator Craig was born on a ranch \nnorth of Boise and attended public schools. He graduated from the \nUniversity of Idaho in 1969 and may have been its most prominent \nalumnus before the world got to know the current Governor of Alaska a \nfew weeks ago.\n  After college, Senator Craig served in the National Guard, worked as \na farmer-rancher, and was elected to the Idaho senate in 1974. Seven \nyears later, Idaho voters sent him to Washington.\n  After a decade in the House, they sent him to the Upper Chamber. And \nhe has been fighting their battles here in the Senate ever since.\n  One of his favorite targets over the years are the Western lands \npolicies favored by big city environmentalists but opposed by the \nnative Idahoans who cherish and live off the land.\n  He fought revisions of the Mining Act of 1872, and a Clinton-era \nproposal to introduce grizzlies into Idaho's Bitterroot Range.\n  Over the years, he's fought anyone who tried to impose rules and \nrestrictions on land use that natives oppose. Those battles heated up \nin the wake of the Supreme Court's 2005 Kelo ruling. And over the last \n3 years, he's fought hard to protect the private property rights of \nfarmers and ranchers, who have been left especially vulnerable by the \nCourt's Kelo decision.\n  Senator Craig took a lead role in the Farm Bill debate over the last \n2 years, making sure it included funds to support specialty crop \nproducers in Idaho, one of the Nation's top producers of specialty \ncrops, and about one-third of the Nation's potatoes. And he played a \nvital role in smoothing the way for the bill's final passage earlier \nthis summer.\n  As chairman of the Public Lands and Forests Subcommittee, Senator \nCraig fought to reform the Nation's Forest Service, which drastically \nreduced the timber harvest on public lands during the Clinton \nAdministration, cutting into the livelihoods of Idahoans in small towns \nacross the State.\n  For municipalities that couldn't recoup the losses from lost timber \nrevenue, Senator Craig reached across the aisle and worked with Senator \nWyden to find compensation that helped them cope. It was a \ncharacteristic gesture of bipartisan work, and one he's employed \nrepeatedly over the years.\n  He's been a strong defender of free trade.\n  As chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, he sponsored a bill \nthat would enable seniors to buy State-approved long-term care \npolicies.\n  And he has been a good friend to our Nation's veterans, serving as \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  A new tower at Boise's airport would not have been built without \nSenator Craig's help. Neither would the new VA clinic that opened in \nCaldwell just last year. In a long Senate career, Senator Craig has \nfought with clarity and conviction for Idahoans. Along the way, he has \nbeen a friend of veterans, children seeking a home through adoption, \nand thousands of American farmers and ranchers, particularly those in \nthe Pacific Northwest.\n  And, along with three other Senate colleagues who've moved on, he \nentertained us as a member of the Singing Senators.\n  With Senator Craig's retirement, the last of the Singing Senators \nwill have left the building.\n  And the people of Idaho will have lost one of their greatest \nchampions.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, considering the long and distinguished \nhistory of the State of Virginia, it is quite an accomplishment to be \nthe state's second-longest serving Senator. But, that is just one of \nSenator John Warner's many accomplishments.\n  Senator Warner has been serving his country since 1945 when he \nenlisted in the Navy. Later, he joined the Marine Corps and served in \nKorea. During the Vietnam war, he served in the Department of the Navy, \nultimately attaining the position of Secretary.\n  Senator Warner's service and knowledge of the military have guided \nhis work in the Senate. He has served as chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee and has guided many bills\n\n[[Page S10436]]\n\nthrough the Senate. His commitment to the men and women in uniform has \nnever wavered, and he has used his position to make sure that they have \nthe resources they need to complete their mission. Debating a Defense \nauthorization bill without the leadership of Senator Warner will be a \nnew experience for most of us.\n  On a daily basis, Senator Warner provided a fine example for other \nSenators. For the Senate to function properly, there must be comity in \nthe body. Senator Warner was courteous and always willing to settle \ndisagreements in a way that befits Senators. The Senate cannot work on \nbehalf of Americans if Senators are unwilling to work in a courteous \nand bipartisan manner. Senator Warner understood that fact well.\n  Senator Warner has served in the Senate for 30 years, winning five \nelections. Many Americans have never seen a Senate without John Warner, \nand many Virginians have always had John Warner as their Senator.\n  When John leaves the Senate, the body will lose not only a \ndistinguished legislator but also a consummate gentleman.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Mr. President, when the 111th Congress convenes next year, the Senate \nwill be without Senator Chuck Hagel. Senator Hagel has decided to \nretire from the Senate after two terms. His career in public service, \nhowever, long predates his service in Congress.\n  Like many public servants, Senator Hagel entered politics after first \nserving the Nation in the armed forces. He saw combat in Vietnam and \nserved with valor, receiving two Purple Hearts among other decorations. \nHe would later serve as a congressional staff member, and in 1981, \nPresident Reagan tapped him as Deputy Administrator of the Veterans \nAdministration.\n  When Senator Hagel came to the Senate, his actions often reflected \nhis experience as a combat veteran. He did what he believed was best \nfor the men and women in uniform, and he defended his positions \nforcefully.\n  Senator Hagel has continued to protect and defend the country, \nnotably through his work on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence \nCommittees. He had strong opinions, and he was never shy about letting \nthem be known.\n  I wish Senator Hagel all the best in his pursuits after the Senate. I \nexpect that he will devote much of his time to his wife Lilibet and \ntheir family, but I imagine he will save some time to follow his \nNebraska Cornhuskers.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate will be a different place when Senator \nDomenici departs at the end of this session. I say that as a colleague \nand as a neighbor in the great Southwest.\n  Senator Domenici has served in this body for six terms, longer than \nany Senator in the history of New Mexico. Judging from the energy that \nhe has displayed during the past months, he could serve another; but he \nhas decided to retire, and it is well deserved.\n  During his time in the Senate, Senator Domenici has been involved in \nsome of the most difficult issues to confront the body. Recently, he \nhas spoken eloquently about the financial stabilization plan the Senate \njust passed; and earlier in the summer, he was one of the more vocal \nadvocates of securing this nation's energy future. Of course, he has \nlong supported reducing the country's dependence on foreign sources of \nenergy, but this summer he addressed the issue with renewed vigor.\n  Senator Domenici has been of great help to his neighbors in Arizona. \nWithout his assistance, we would not have an Arizona Water Settlements \nAct, one of the landmark settlements in the history of the country. He \nhas also been working hard on a water settlement for New Mexico. It \nwon't be completed before he leaves the Senate, but Senator Domenici \nhas been instrumental in getting the settlement as far as it has.\n  Senator Domenici should also be proud that legislation he has worked \non for some time now is poised for passage. Mental health parity has \nlong been a priority for Senator Domenici, and it appears he will be \nable to add it to his long list of accomplishments in the Senate.\n  When a Senator has served as long as Senator Domenici, it is \ndifficult to imagine the Senate without him. My Senate colleagues and I \nwill miss Pete and Nancy, and we will remember his legacy of leadership \nand years of distinguished service to the nation.\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  Mr. President, five colleagues on my side of the aisle are retiring \nfrom the Senate at the end of this session. They have served for many \nyears, and I have come to know each of them very well.\n  Senator Larry Craig and I served in the House together until 1990 \nwhen Senator Craig moved to the Senate. I joined him four years later. \nWe represent Western States, so we have had occasion to work together \non issues that are important to the American West.\n  In his position on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, he has \ndefended property rights and stood for the prudent use of our natural \nresources. He has also been a strong advocate of Americans' second \namendment rights. And, as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee--\nfor a time the ranking member--he has worked to ensure that veterans \nreceive the benefits they were promised.\n  Senator Craig has held a number of positions among Senate \nRepublicans. He served as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, \nand he participated in the musical effort of Senators Trent Lott, John \nAshcroft, Jim Jeffords, and himself--the Singing Senators.\n  After almost three decades in the U.S. Congress, Senator Craig is now \nleaving public service. Idaho has lost a great Senator who always \nlooked out for the interests of the State and its citizens. He has a \ngreat record of accomplishment on which to reflect--numerous \nlegislative victories and, of course, one CD.\n  We will miss Senator Craig in the Senate, especially the spirited \nremarks he so often delivered on the Senate floor.\n  I wish Larry and Suzanne all the best and hope they have many happy \nmoments with their wonderful family.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  Mr. President, as this session draws to a close and as we look \nforward to the 111th Congress, I would be remiss if I didn't pay \ntribute to my colleagues who are retiring after years of service to \ntheir country.\n  I have known Senator Wayne Allard since we served in the House \ntogether.\n  Senator Allard served with distinction on the Armed Services \nCommittee, and we have worked together to make sure that this country \nis prepared to meet national security challenges. Both of us believe \nstrongly in President Reagan's famous axiom, ``peace through \nstrength.''\n  Recently, we worked together to secure funding to study the \npossibility of basing missile defenses in space. As a result, \npolicymakers will finally begin to have the information necessary to \ndebate the overall feasibility of a space-based missile defense layer. \nThe space threat will only grow in the years ahead, and I am pleased \nthat I was able to work with Senator Allard to make small, but \nmeasurable progress towards better defending the nation.\n  Senator Allard is the model legislator. He's not a professional \npolitician, but a veteranarian by trade. He understands that the money \nwe spend in Washington is not the government's money, but the \ntaxpayers'. And he proves it, returning over $4 million of his office's \nfunds to the government's coffers. His votes are based on principle, \nnot politics.\n  I wish Senator Allard all the best. Colorado has lost a great \nlegislator, but I am sure that his wife Joan, his children, and his \nfive grandsons will be glad to have him at home more often.\n\n\n                              JOHN WARNER\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I rise in tribute to the senior \nSenator from Virginia, the honorable John Warner. Senator Warner is \nwithout a doubt one of the finest Senators this chamber has ever had, \nand the Senate will be a lesser place without him.\n  Senator Warner is truly a great American--a patriot who has devoted \n45 years of his life in service to his country. One of America's \nGreatest Generation, he served his country honorably during World War \nTwo, enlisting before he was 18 years old. When war in Korea broke out, \nhe again answered his country's call to arms. After earning his law \ndegree, he served as the Under Secretary and later the Secretary of the \nNavy, again serving with great distinction and integrity.\n  In 1979, Senator Warner came to the Senate to begin his 30 year \nSenate career. As in every one of his endeavors\n\n[[Page S10437]]\n\nbefore, he immediately made an impact, eventually serving with \ndistinction as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It is \nin this capacity that I have had the great privilege of working with \nhim and getting to know him over the last 4 years.\n  Senator Warner's leadership on the Armed Services Committee has been \ninvaluable. There is no doubt that when he speaks, all are wise to \nlisten. He provides unwavering, courageous leadership that all lean \nupon. There is never any doubt to his motives. His only motive is to \nlook out for our men and women in uniform and ensure our Nation's \ndefense. His first priority is his country.\n  Senator Warner has never failed to lead courageously. At times, some \nof the positions he has taken have been politically unpopular, but his \nlatest reelection--with over 82 percent of the vote--attests that his \nconstituents know he is only dedicated to doing one thing--the right \nthing. In times of crisis, there is no doubt that Senator Warner \nbecomes a rock that we all lean upon when we face the most challenging \nissues of our time. He was one of the leaders that worked on the \nMilitary Commissions Act and the incredibly difficult and contentious \nissue of detainees. Once again, just this year, he led again, this time \nby becoming one of the Gang of 20, trying to provide bipartisan \nsolutions to American's energy issues. And, of course, it took his \nleadership to bring about passage of the Defense authorization bill \nthis year, a bill that by tradition is passed each year, but which was \nlooking extremely doubtful of passage for the first time in decades.\n  I have only one regret regarding my service with Senator Warner, and \nthat is I did not have the opportunity to serve with him longer. One of \nthe finest statesmen of his time, I am proud to call him my friend. I \naspire to his example and his name belongs in the pantheon of the \nSenate's greatest figures.\n  Last, I would like to tell him thank you. Thank you for your great \nservice to our great Republic. Thank you for the untold sacrifices you \nand your family have made along the way in your 45 years of public \nservice. Thank you for your integrity, patriotism, leadership, and \nhonor.\n  As I noted before, the Senate will be a lesser place when he leaves, \nbut I wish Senator Warner a fond farewell and Godspeed.\n\n\n                              JOHN WARNER\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, as the Senate completes its work for the \nyear, we have also reached the end of the distinguished career of the \nsenior Senator from Virginia, John William Warner, Jr.\n  In their wisdom, our Founders created the Senate to be a body like no \nother on Earth to harness the special wisdom that experience can bring. \nI think they had people like John Warner in mind as the kind of person \nwho would best serve the Nation in the Senate.\n  Senator Warner has lived a life of faithful, skillful service to his \ncountry. He served in World War II, enlisting as a 17-year-old. He \ninterrupted his law school studies to also serve in Korea. He served as \nan assistant U.S. attorney. And for 5 years he served in the \nSecretariat of the Navy, leading the department from 1972 to 1974. That \nseems like a full career in itself, but it was just a prologue to five \nterms in the Senate.\n  Over three decades, John Warner has worked with great energy, skill, \nand wisdom to protect the national security of the United States. The \nDepartment of Defense is a massive organization with a budget that \nstaggers the imagination. But Senator Warner has devoted himself to \nmastering the details of the DOD and been a relentless advocate for its \nmodernization and continuous improvement in effectiveness. Throughout \nhis career, he has demonstrated tremendous caring for the millions of \nmen and women who have worn the country's uniform and been their best \nfriend on Capitol Hill.\n  Senator Warner has been a counselor and mentor to me in my first 6 \nyears here, and on behalf of the people I represent in Minnesota I \nthank him for his counsel to me on how to do this job right. He taught \nme that just as the human body has its bones and vital organs under the \nskin and out of sight, the most important work of the Senate takes \nplace away from the TV lights and the press conferences.\n  The day-to-day work of achieving compromise on hundreds and hundreds \nof issues that come before us is where the real difference can be made, \nand John Warner excelled at that work.\n  Another Virginian, George Washington, said during the darkest days of \nthe American Revolution that, ``spirit and perseverance have done \nwonders in all ages.'' Today I honor the spirit of patriotism that has \nalways motivated John Warner and his perseverance through more than \nfive decades that has made this a stronger and freer nation. May his \nsterling example of service inspire all of us to serve as nobly and as \nskillfully as he has done.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Mr. President, one of the lessons of our history is that America is \nnot great because our leaders were somehow superhuman, but because \nregular people enjoy extraordinary freedom and use it to pursue ideals \nbeyond their individual concerns. Senator Pete Domenici is a wonderful \nexample of this unique brand of American greatness, and as he completes \nhis service to the Senate, I wanted to take a few minutes of the \nSenate's time to honor him and thank him.\n  Pete Domenici was born to Italian immigrants during the Great \nDepression in Albuquerque, NM, which was a long cultural distance from \nWashington, DC. He worked in his family grocery businesses and played \nfor a farm team of the Brooklyn Dodgers, which is enough to endear him \nto me right there. He became a junior high math teacher and then earned \na law degree.\n  He served in local government for 6 years before his first election \nto the Senate in 1972. And he has served six full terms in the Senate, \nwhich is amazing in and of itself. But what is perhaps most amazing is \nhe has remained the regular person he was brought up to be in \nAlbuquerque and has always applied his commonsense values to the most \ncomplex national problems.\n  Senator Domenici has been a stalwart in the difficult job of trying \nto curb Washington's seemingly endless appetite for more spending. \nPolitics tends to be a business in which all the rewards flow to those \nwho say ``yes.'' But for the sake of the taxpayers and children and \ngrandchildren of ours who cannot yet speak, Pete Domenici has been \nwilling to say ``no'' to more spending in order to say ``yes'' to their \neconomic future.\n  Senator Domenici has made a tremendous contribution to the \nadvancement of science by focusing resources and efforts to understand \nthe human brain. For decades from now, a wide spectrum of discoveries \nand therapies to improve human life will come out of his insistence on \nprogress of the basic science of brain research. It has been a great \nprivilege to work with him closely on his signature issue for the last \nseveral years: mental health parity. His tireless commitment to ending \ninsurance discrimination, and willingness to share his own family's \nstruggles, has broken down barriers to treatment and brought hope to \nmillions of Americans living with mental illness.\n  The legislative process has regrettably become more divisive and \npartisan over the last decade, but through it all Senator Domenici has \nbeen a role model of civility, diligence, and goodwill. The Senate was \nbuilt to achieve consensus on the great issues of the day, and Pete \nDomenici was always focused on what we could get done, rather than on \nwho got the credit.\n  His ability and willingness to find consensus and produce legislation \nthe American people need has been showcased by his 30 years of service \non the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It is a testament \nto his abilities that as either chairman or ranking member, Pete \nDomenici has guided three energy bills into law in the last 3 years: \nthe Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act \nof 2006, and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Pete \nfound a way to cut through a tough, partisan climate in the Senate to \naddress our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Personally he has been a connecting point for me with the great \ncompromisers and policy experts of the Senate's recent past. And he has \nalways reminded me that we are not Senators who happen to be people; we \nare people who happened to be Senators for a\n\n[[Page S10438]]\n\ntime, and we need to nurture the roots of faith, family, and friendship \nthat give us life.\n  Pete Domenici is a great American success story, and it has been an \nhonor and privilege to serve with him in Washington. His influence on \nme will continue long after he has left this body.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Mr. President, one of the first experiences of a new Senator is to \nopen their drawer in their desk here on the floor and learn a special \nlesson in Senate history. Traditionally, Senators do what we prevent \nsixth grade boys from doing: we write our names into our desks. When I \nfirst opened my drawer here, I saw decades of people who had occupied \nthis particular desk, and it told me that for however long I am here, I \nam a temporary occupant. Many came before me and many will come after \nme. So at each 2-year interval, we say goodbye to many of our \ncolleagues and await the new.\n  I will be particularly sad to say farewell to the Senior Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Hagel. He came to this body with an extraordinary career \nin communications, finance, and international business. He was like a \nSenator of a bygone era, when Members of this body often were the \nnational experts in their fields.\n  He made a tremendous contribution to the world of the Senate because \nhe had first-hand knowledge of the dynamism and transformational nature \nof the global economy all around us. He is the kind of decisionmaker \nthat is shaping the new economy and it has been so valuable to have him \namong us.\n  Chuck Hagel's whole life expresses his conviction that the world can \nand should be a better place, and it will not get that way by itself. \nHe is fully engaged in life-long effort to make the world a better \nplace, and he applies every waking hour to the quest. I know that \n``retirement'' is not the word for his departure from this place--in a \nway he is released from this responsibility to pursue his passion of \npublic service in multiple other ways. He is the embodiment of the \nideal of a life of self-sacrifice for the betterment of others.\n  Senator Hagel brought his analytical, probing mind to the Foreign \nRelations Committee, where I served with him these last 6 years. His \ncontributions to the committee's work were always thoughtful and \nchallenging--and that was just his Halloween costumes.\n  Chuck Hagel is one of the most energetic people I have ever met. When \nyou look at the list of organizations he supports with this ideas and \nhis leadership, it looks like the combined resume of five people. He \nworks with veterans organizations, antipoverty organizations, \ninternational cooperation organizations and the list goes on and on. He \nhas been honored by dozens of organizations for excellence in public \nservice.\n  For some reason, Nebraska has a habit of sending independent-minded \nmembers to this body, and they play a key role in our deliberation. \nPerhaps because Nebraska is kind of plains State, kind of a Midwestern \nState, kind of a Western State, and in that way unique, Nebraskans have \ncontributed a great deal of independence to our deliberations, which is \nso valuable in the Senate's search for consensus.\n  We in Minnesota are glad to be a part of Chuck Hagel's life. Since \nsome of his education occurred at the Brown Institute in Minneapolis, \nwe too claim a piece of him.\n  We thank the people of Nebraska for sharing him with the Nation as a \nMember of the Senate. We will certainly miss his razor sharp analytical \nmind and his wonderfully engaging personality. I am personally grateful \nto him for the way he introduced me to the habits and ways of the \nSenate and for helping me understand how to do my best for the people \nof my State.\n  In the history of this Nation, different kinds of men and women have \ngiven some of their talents and vision to this place for the benefit of \nthe whole Nation. We thank Senator Hagel for his willingness to serve \nand for the way he made the most of every moment of his time here in \nthe Senate.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  Mr. President, with the conclusion of our business for the year comes \nthe moment when we must say farewell to Members who have chosen to \nleave the Senate, and I want to take this opportunity to honor my \nfriend and colleague from Colorado, Senator Wayne Allard. He is leaving \nas a matter of principle, believing in the value of ``citizen \nlegislators,'' which he is fulfilling by ending his service here after \ntwo terms. I greatly respect him for that choice.\n  One of the wonderful things about the Senate is the distinctive \nexperiences that bring people to this place. Senator Allard's \nprofessional training is as a veterinarian, a skill that is of great \nimportance to a State with as much livestock agriculture as Colorado. \nHe began a successful veterinary practice from nothing in Loveland, in \nthe eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains. That experience has given \nhim unique insight into the needs and concerns of America's millions of \nsmall businesses, where the job growth and creative energy of our \neconomy comes from.\n  Wayne Allard brought many values with him to the Senate, but perhaps \nthe most important is the need to use more care in the way we spend the \npeople's money. He personally practiced that value by returning $42.2 \nmillion of his office allotment to the U.S. Treasury. As a member of \nthe committees which handle appropriations, the Federal budget and \nbanking policy, he has been a constant advocate for lower spending, \nimproved efficiency in government programs, and steady progress toward \na balanced budget.\n  Our former colleague, Howard Baker, once said that you could trace \nthe decline of the legislative branch of Government to the installation \nof air-conditioning in the Capitol. What he meant by that was that \nprevious generations of Senators were driven from Washington by the \ntropical summers, and that gave them an opportunity to reconnect with \ntheir roots so they could return refreshed and reoriented toward the \npeople's wishes. Senator Allard needed no such climatic encouragement: \nhe couldn't wait to get back to Colorado where he would spend countless \nhours listening to and learning from the folks who sent him here.\n  I will truly miss his example and his friendship here in the Senate. \nThe Senate is a distinctive and valuable institution generation after \ngeneration because the senior Members pass on their lessons to the \njunior Members. Senator Allard taught me a lot about how to be a good \nSenator by working hard, sticking to your principles, and listening \nmore than talking.\n  Former Senator Harry S. Truman said that if you want a friend in \nWashington, buy a dog. But Senator Allard has been my good friend, \nencouraging me when I was discouraged and keeping me humble when I was \nflying too high for my own good.\n  I think the ideas of fiscal conservatism and frugality that he based \nhis life and service on are returning to the forefront here in \nWashington as he departs. As we move toward a balanced budget, I think \nhe can take pride in fighting for it for 12 years in Washington and \npointing us in the right direction.\n  Wayne Allard is a good man who chose to serve in the Senate for a \nspecific amount of time and he has done that. I honor him today as a \nperson of character and wisdom, and I thank him for making me a better \nSenator and for making the Senate a place that better reflects the \nvalues of regular people.\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the State of Idaho occupies a very special \nplace in my life's career. In the summer of 1943, during the height of \nWorld War II, I had the great fortune to find a job with the U.S. \nForest Service. I was sent to Idaho, along with many other young men, \nto work in the forests. We performed a wide range of duties, from \nclearing trails to fighting forest fires.\n  After brief service in the Navy in the final year of World War II, I \nattended college and at my first opportunity, in the summer of 1947, I \nreturned to Idaho to once again work with the Forest Service, helping \npreserve one of nature's greatest gifts--the mighty trees of the West.\n  Those two summers of hard work trained and prepared me to always \nrespect those who labor with their hands.\n  Throughout my career in the Senate, I have enjoyed working with \nsenators from Idaho, and sharing common interests, such as forestry and \npreserving the great outdoors, with those who represent that State. \nSenator Larry Craig is one of those.\n\n[[Page S10439]]\n\n  Through the years, I have found his perspective on controversial \nissues, such as forests, mining and agriculture especially the potato \nand sugar-beet issues to be very valuable and informative.\n  Larry Craig and I also share an interest in the fine arts. My hobby \nis painting in oil; his is drawing with meticulous design. His \ncreations are extraordinary in their detail. I hope, as he leaves the \nSenate, he will have opportunities to further utilize these exceptional \ntalents to create pieces of art to be enjoyed by others.\n  I wish him and his family well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10439-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10439-S10444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        VETERANS' MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER CARE IMPROVEMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to urge swift Senate passage \nof S. 2162, the proposed Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care \nImprovements Act of 2008, as amended. This is an omnibus health care \nmeasure, which responds to the burgeoning mental health concerns of \nveterans and their families. The bill, as it comes before the Senate, \nis a compromise agreement developed with our counterparts on the House \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs. I thank Chairman Filner and Ranking \nMember Buyer of the House committee for their cooperation in this \nendeavor. I also thank my good friend, the committee's ranking member, \nSenator Burr, for his great energy and cooperation as we have developed \nthis bill.\n  This compromise agreement is also focused on addressing homelessness \namong veterans, increasing VA's efforts on pain management, promoting \nexcellence in VA's efforts relating to epilepsy, and improving access \nto care in rural areas. It also includes a series of necessary \nprogrammatic authorization extensions as well as major medical facility \nconstruction authorizations.\n  The framework for this bill is my legislation, S. 2162 as originally \nintroduced. This bill represents a bipartisan approach and was \ncosponsored early on by the ranking member, Senator Burr, along with \nSenators Mikulski, Ensign, Rockefeller, Smith, Bingaman, Dole, Clinton, \nCollins, Sessions, and Stevens.\n  Mr. President, I want to share how we began this process. The \nlegislation did not stem from a lobbyist or an interest group. It came \nabout because of one letter--a letter to me from the parents of Justin \nBailey--Mary Kaye and Tony Bailey.\n  Justin Bailey was a war veteran who survived Iraq only to die while \nreceiving care from VA for PTSD and substance use disorder. A week \nafter his death last year, Justin's parents were naturally heartbroken \nby the death of their only son, but even more than that, they were \nconcerned that other veterans might share his fate if VA mental health \ncare did not improve.\n  In their own words, they asked, ``Everyone talks about the costs of \nsending troops to Iraq--what about the cost of caring for their \ninjuries, both physical and psychological, when they return?''\n  From this first letter, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held \nvarious hearings on the mental health needs of veterans. The media \ncarried so many stories of veterans who were suffering, and various \nstudies showed how prevalent mental health difficulties are in those \nwho return from duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We worked with experts in the mental health field and others who were \nadvocating for veterans, including those at the Disabled American \nVeterans, to craft a bill that responded to the problem. This \nlegislation responds to the concerns of the Baileys and many others who \nhave come to the committee to tell their stories, and does so with the \nclear understanding that veterans care is a cost of war. If we neglect \nto pay these costs when the service members first return from \ndeployment, we as a nation will suffer incalculable human costs that \ncan never be repaid.\n  Provisions included in this compromise agreement are drawn from \nvarious bills which have all been reported favorably by the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, including S. 1233 as ordered reported \non August 29, 2007; S. 2004, S. 2142, S. 2160, S. 2162, as ordered \nreported on November 14, 2007; and S. 2969, as ordered reported on June \n26, 2008.\n  I will briefly outline some of the key provisions in the compromise \nagreement.\n  This legislation would make comprehensive changes to VA mental health \ntreatment and research. Most notably, it would ensure a minimum level \nof substance use disorder care for veterans who need such care. It \nwould also require VA to improve treatment of veterans with PTSD co-\noccurring with substance use disorders. Additionally, in order to \ndetermine if VA's residential mental health facilities are \nappropriately staffed, this bill would mandate a review of such \nfacilities. It would also create a vital research program on PTSD and \nsubstance use disorders, in cooperation with, and building on the work \nof, the National Center for PTSD.\n  It is not uncommon for veterans with physical and mental wounds to \nturn to drugs and alcohol to ease their pain. Many experts believe that \nstress is the primary cause of drug abuse and of relapse to drug abuse. \nSixty to eighty percent of Vietnam veterans who have sought PTSD \ntreatment have alcohol use disorders. VA has long dealt with substance \nabuse issues, but there is much more that can be done. This legislation \nwould provide a number of solutions to enhance substance use disorder \ntreatment, including an innovative approach to substance use treatment \nvia Internet-based programs.\n  Furthermore, the inclusion of families in mental health and substance \nuse disorder treatment is critical. To that end, the compromise \nagreement would fully authorize VA to provide mental health services to \nfamilies of veterans and would set up a program to proactively help \nveterans and their families to transition from deployment to civilian \nlife.\n  Beneficiary travel reimbursements are essential to improving access \nto VA health care for veterans in rural areas. This legislation would \nincrease the beneficiary travel mileage reimbursement rate from 11 \ncents per mile to 28.5 cents per mile and permanently set the \ndeductible to the 2007 amount of $3 each way. Senator Tester has been a \nleader on this issue, and I thank him for that.\n  Too often, veterans suffer from lack of care not only because they \nreside in rural areas but also because they are unaware of the services \navailable to them. This legislation would enhance outreach and \naccessibility by creating a pilot program on the use of peers to help \nreach out to veterans. It would also encourage improved accessibility \nfor mental health care in rural areas through coordination with \ncommunity-based resources. Mental Health America and Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America brought to the committee the concept of \nusing peers to help veterans, and I think it is a good one.\n  It is crucial that all veterans have access to emergency care. This \nbill would make corrections to the procedure used by VA to reimburse \ncommunity hospitals for emergency care provided to eligible veterans to \nensure that both veterans and community hospitals are not unduly \nburdened by emergency care costs. This provision is based on \nlegislation introduced by Senator Brown in response to a situation in \nhis own State of Ohio, where community hospitals were not being \nreimbursed timely from VA.\n  The compromise agreement also addresses homelessness among veterans, \na far too prevalent problem. The bill would create targeted programs to \nprovide assistance for low-income veteran families. It would also \nincrease the total amount that VA is authorized to spend on its \nsuccessful Grant and Per Diem Program, which assists community-based \nentities that serve homeless veterans. Finally, the bill would expand a \nprogram to help formerly incarcerated veterans reintegrate into life \nand ensure facilities are up to par for women veterans who are \nhomeless.\n  Epilepsy is often associated with traumatic brain injury. This \nlegislation would establish six VA epilepsy centers of excellence, \nfocused on research, education, and clinical care activities in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. These centers would restore VA to \nthe position of leadership it once held in epilepsy research and \ntreatment. Senators Murray and Craig worked together to bring this \ncritical legislation to the forefront. I also add that the Epilepsy \nFoundation of America and the American Academy of Neurology were very \nhelpful to the committee on this issue.\n\n[[Page S10440]]\n\n  The medical community has made impressive advances in pain care and \nmanagement, but VA has lagged behind in implementing a standardized \npolicy. S. 2162 would establish a pain care program at all VA inpatient \nfacilities, to prevent long-term chronic pain disability. It also \nprovides for education for VA's health care workers on pain assessment \nand treatment and would require VA to expand research on pain care. We \nrelied on the Pain Care Forum and their many organizations devoted to \nthe relief of pain, and I thank them for their efforts on behalf of \nveterans.\n  Finally, S. 2162 contains extensions of authorities for VA to provide \nsome essential services to veterans, such as both institutional and \nnon-institutional long-term care and caregiver assistance. It would \nalso authorize a series of major medical facility construction projects \nand clinic leases in California, Texas, Puerto Rico, Florida, \nLouisiana, Colorado, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, South Carolina, \nOhio, Arizona, Georgia, and Illinois.\n  Mr. President, before I close, I recognize and thank the individuals \ninvolved in putting together this comprehensive measure. Specifically, \nI thank Cathy Wiblemo and Dolores Dunn from the House committee and Jon \nTowers from the minority on the Senate committee. I also thank my own \nstaff who assisted me in forging this bill. Kim Lipsky and Alex \nSardegna heard the needs of veterans, sought creative solutions to some \nvery complex problems, and worked tirelessly to make this bill a \nreality.\n  In closing, I thank Mary Kaye and Tony Bailey, who set aside their \nown grief about Justin and fought for better mental health care for all \nveterans. We all owe the Baileys a debt of gratitude for so many \nreasons.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support swift passage of S. 2162, as \namended. It would bring relief, support, and needed services to so many \nveterans and their families across the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Joint Explanatory Statement \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Joint Explanatory Statement for S. 2162, Veterans' Mental Health and \n                  Other Care Improvements Act of 2008\n\n       The ``Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements \n     Act of 2008'' reflects a compromise agreement that the Senate \n     and House of Representatives' Committees on Veterans' Affairs \n     reached on certain provisions of a number of bills considered \n     by the House and Senate during the 110th Congress, including: \n     S. 2162, to improve the treatment and services provided by \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs to veterans with post-\n     traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders, and \n     for other purposes, passed by the Senate on June 3, 2008 \n     [hereinafter, ``Senate Bill'']; H.R. 5554, to expand and \n     improve health care services available to veterans from the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs for substance use disorders, \n     and for other purposes, passed by the House on May 20, 2008 \n     [hereinafter, ``House Bill'']; S. 1233, to provide and \n     enhance intervention, rehabilitative treatment, and services \n     to veterans with traumatic brain injury, and for other \n     purposes, placed on the Senate calendar on August 29, 2007.\n       H.R. 1527, to conduct a pilot program to permit certain \n     highly rural veterans enrolled in the health system of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs to receive covered health \n     services through providers other than those of the \n     Department, passed by the House on September 10, 2008; H.R. \n     2623, to prohibit the collection of copayments for all \n     hospice care furnished by the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     passed by the House on July 30, 2007; H.R. 2818, to provide \n     for the establishment of epilepsy centers of excellence in \n     the Veterans Health Administration of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs, passed by the House on June 24, 2008; H.R. \n     2874, to make certain improvements in the provision of health \n     care to veterans, and for other purposes, passed by the House \n     on July 30, 2007; S. 2969, to enhance the capacity of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs to recruit and retain nurses \n     and other critical health care professionals, and for other \n     purposes, placed on the Senate calendar on September 18, \n     2008.\n       H.R. 3819, to reimburse veterans receiving emergency \n     treatment in non-Department of Veterans Affairs facilities \n     for such treatment until such veterans are transferred to \n     Department facilities, and for other purposes, passed by the \n     House on May 21, 2008; H.R. 4264, to name the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs spinal cord injury center in Tampa, Florida, \n     as the ``Michael Bilirakis Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Spinal Cord Injury Center,'' passed by the House on June 26, \n     2008; H.R. 5729, to provide comprehensive health care to \n     children of Vietnam veterans born with Spina Bifida, and for \n     other purposes, passed by the House on May 20, 2008; H.R. \n     6445, to prohibit the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from \n     collecting certain copayments from veterans who are \n     catastrophically disabled, and for other purposes, passed by \n     the House on July 30, 2008; H.R. 6832, to authorize major \n     medical facility projects and major medical facility leases \n     for the Department of Veterans Affairs for fiscal year 2009, \n     to extend certain authorities of the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs, and for other purposes, passed by the House on \n     September 11, 2008; S. 2969, to enhance the capacity of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs to recruit and retain nurses \n     and other critical health care professionals and for other \n     purposes, which was placed on the Senate legislative calendar \n     on September 18, 2008.\n       The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have \n     prepared the following explanation of the compromise bill, S. \n     2162 (hereinafter referred to as the ``Compromise \n     Agreement''). Differences between the provisions contained in \n     the Compromise Agreement and the related provisions in the \n     bills listed above are noted in this document, except for \n     clerical corrections and conforming changes made necessary by \n     the Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting, technical, and \n     clarifying changes.\n\n\n        Title I--Substance Use Disorders and Mental Health Care\n\n     Tribute to Justin Bailey (sec. 101)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 306) to specify \n     that this title is enacted in tribute to Justin Bailey, who, \n     after returning to the United States from service as member \n     of the Armed Forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom, died in a \n     domiciliary facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     while receiving care for post-traumatic stress disorder and a \n     substance use disorder.\n       Section 6 of the House bill contained the identical \n     provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains this provision.\n     Findings on substance use disorders and mental health (sec. \n         102)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 301) that would \n     express the sense of the Congress that:\n       (1) More than 1,500,000 members of the Armed Forces have \n     been deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \n     Enduring Freedom. The 2005 Department of Defense Survey of \n     Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Personnel reports \n     that 23 percent of members of the Armed Forces on active duty \n     acknowledge a significant problem with alcohol use, with \n     similar rates of acknowledged problems with alcohol use among \n     members of the National Guard.\n       (2) The effects of substance abuse are wide ranging, \n     including significantly increased risk of suicide, \n     exacerbation of mental and physical health disorders, \n     breakdown of family support, and increased risk of \n     unemployment and homelessness.\n       (3) While veterans suffering from mental health conditions, \n     chronic physical illness, and polytrauma may be at increased \n     risk for development of a substance use disorder, treatment \n     for these veterans is complicated by the need to address \n     adequately the physical and mental symptoms associated with \n     these conditions through appropriate medical intervention.\n       (4) While the Veterans Health Administration has \n     dramatically increased health services for veterans from 1996 \n     through 2006, the number of veterans receiving specialized \n     substance abuse treatment services decreased 18 percent \n     during that time. No comparable decrease in the national rate \n     of substance abuse has been observed during that time.\n       (5) While some facilities of the Veterans Health \n     Administration provide exemplary substance use disorder \n     treatment services, the availability of such treatment \n     services throughout the health care system of the Veterans \n     Health Administration is inconsistent.\n       (6) According to the Government Accountability Office, the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs significantly reduced its \n     substance use disorder treatment and rehabilitation services \n     between 1996 and 2006, and has made little progress since in \n     restoring these services to their pre-1996 levels.\n       The House bill contained no similar provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision but \n     modifies finding (6) to include the year of the Government \n     Accountability report and cites the National Mental Health \n     Program Monitoring System report.\n     Expansion of substance use disorder treatment services \n         provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (sec. 103)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 302) that would \n     require that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs ensure the \n     provision of services and treatment to each veteran enrolled \n     in the health care system of the Department who is in need of \n     services and treatments for a substance use disorder, and the \n     bill included a specific list of services. The Senate bill \n     would also authorize that the services and treatments may be \n     provided to a veteran: (1) at Department of Veterans Affairs \n     medical centers or clinics; (2) by referral to other \n     facilities of the Department that are accessible to such \n     veteran; or (3) by contract or fee-for-service payments with \n     community-based organizations for the provision of such \n     services and treatments.\n       The House bill contained a similar provision (sec. 2) that \n     would require the Secretary to provide a full continuum of \n     care for substance use disorders to veterans in need of such \n     care and included a specific list of services, including \n     three services not included in\n\n[[Page S10441]]\n\n     the Senate bill: marital and family counseling, screening for \n     substance use disorders, and coordination with groups \n     providing peer to peer counseling. The House bill (sec. 3) \n     would also require the Secretary to ensure that the amounts \n     made available for care, treatment, and services are \n     allocated evenly throughout the system, including an annual \n     reporting requirement.\n       The Compromise Agreement includes the listing of substance \n     use disorder services included in both the Senate and House \n     bills, and follows the Senate bill with respect to the \n     locations of where services would be provided. The Compromise \n     Agreement follows the House bill with respect to ensuring the \n     equitable distribution of resources for substance abuse \n     services but does not include the annual reporting \n     requirement.\n     Care for veterans with mental health and substance use \n         disorders (sec. 104)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 303) that would \n     ensure that if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs provides a \n     veteran inpatient or outpatient care for a substance use \n     disorder and a comorbid mental health disorder, that the \n     treatment for such disorders be provided concurrently: (1) \n     through a service provided by a clinician or health \n     professional who has training and expertise in treatment of \n     substance use disorders and mental health disorders; (2) by \n     separate substance use disorder and mental health disorder \n     treatment services when there is appropriate coordination, \n     collaboration, and care management between such treatment \n     services; or (3) by a team of clinicians with appropriate \n     expertise.\n       The House bill contained no similar provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Pilot program for Internet-based substance use disorder \n         treatment for veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and \n         Operation Enduring Freedom (sec. 105)\n       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 4) that would \n     express the sense of the Congress that:\n       (1) Stigma associated with seeking treatment for mental \n     health disorders has been demonstrated to prevent some \n     veterans from seeking such treatment at a medical facility \n     operated by the Department of Defense or the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs.\n       (2) There is a significant incidence among veterans of \n     post-deployment mental health problems, especially among \n     members of a reserve component who return as veterans to \n     civilian life.\n       (3) Computer-based self-guided training has been \n     demonstrated to be an effective strategy for supplementing \n     the care of psychological conditions.\n       (4) Younger veterans, especially those who served in \n     Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom, are \n     comfortable with and proficient at computer-based technology.\n       (5) Veterans living in rural areas find access to treatment \n     for substance use disorder limited.\n       (6) Self-assessment and treatment options for substance use \n     disorders through an Internet website may reduce stigma and \n     provides additional access for individuals seeking care and \n     treatment for such disorders.\n       This provision would also require the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs to carry out a pilot program to test the feasibility \n     and advisability of providing veterans who seek treatment for \n     substance use disorders access to a computer-based self-\n     assessment, education, and specified treatment program \n     through a secure Internet website operated by the Secretary.\n       The Senate bill contained no similar provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision.\n     Report on residential mental health care facilities of the \n         Veterans Health Administration (sec. 106)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 305) that would \n     require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, acting through the \n     Office of Mental Health Services of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs, not later than six months after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, conduct a review of all \n     residential mental health care facilities, including \n     domiciliary facilities, of the Veterans Health \n     Administration; and not later than two years after the date \n     of the completion of the first review conduct a follow-up \n     review of such facilities to evaluate any improvements made \n     or problems remaining since the first review was completed. \n     Not later than 90 days after the completion of the first \n     review, the Secretary would be required to submit to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives a report on such review.\n       The House bill (sec. 5) contained a similar provision, \n     except there was no provision for a two-year follow-up \n     review, and the six month review would be carried out by the \n     Office of the Medical Inspector.\n       The Compromise Agreement includes the Senate provision \n     which specifies the two-year follow-up review, but would have \n     the Inspector General carry out the reviews.\n     Pilot program on peer outreach and support for veterans and \n         use of community mental health centers and Indian Health \n         Service facilities (sec. 107)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 401) that would \n     require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a \n     pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of \n     providing the following to veterans of OIF/OEF in at least \n     two Veterans Integrated Service Networks: (1) peer outreach \n     services; (2) peer support services provided by licensed \n     providers of peer support services or veterans who have \n     personal experience with mental illness; (3) readjustment \n     counseling services; and other mental health services. \n     Services would be provided through community mental health \n     centers or other entities under contracts or other agreements \n     and through the Indian Health Service pursuant to a \n     memorandum of understanding entered into by the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services.\n       Section 6 of H.R. 2874 required the Secretary to carry out \n     a program to provide peer outreach services, peer support \n     services, and readjustment and mental health services to \n     covered veterans. This provision was not a pilot program and \n     did not provide for the means to collaborate with the Indian \n     Health Service.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision with \n     an amendment that would authorize at least three pilot sites.\n\n\n                    Title II--Mental Health Research\n\n     Research program on comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder \n         and substance use disorders (sec. 201)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 501) that would \n     require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a \n     program of research into comorbid post-traumatic stress \n     disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder. This research \n     program shall be carried out by the National Center for \n     Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. In carrying out the program, \n     the Center shall: (1) develop protocols and goals with \n     respect to research under the program; and (2) coordinate \n     research, data collection, and data dissemination under the \n     program.\n       The House bill contained no similar provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Extension of authorization for Special Committee on Post-\n         Traumatic Stress Disorder (sec. 202)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 502) that would \n     modify section 110(e)(2) of the Veterans' Health Care Act of \n     1984, P.L. 98-528, to extend the reporting requirement for \n     the Special Committee on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. \n     Currently, the reporting requirement is set to expire in \n     2008; this provision would extend it through 2012.\n       Section 209 of H.R. 6832 contained an identical provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the provision.\n\n\n             Title III--Assistance for Families of Veterans\n\n     Clarification of authority of Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n         to provide mental health services to families of veterans \n         (sec. 301)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 601) that would \n     amend section 1701(5)(B) of title 38, United States Code, to \n     clarify the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \n     provide mental health services to families of veterans.\n       Section 3 of H.R. 6445 contained a provision that would \n     modify section 1782(b) of title 38 so as to eliminate the \n     requirement that family support services be initiated during \n     the veteran's hospitalization and deemed essential to permit \n     the veteran's discharge.\n       The Compromise Agreement follows the House bill with \n     respect to the provision eliminating the need for services to \n     be initiated during a veteran's hospitalization and essential \n     to the veteran's discharge, but follows the Senate bill with \n     respect to the provision to clarify the authority of the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide mental health \n     services to families.\n     Pilot program on provision of readjustment and transition \n         assistance to veterans and their families in cooperation \n         with Vet Centers (sec. 302)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 402) that would \n     establish a pilot program to assess the feasibility and \n     advisability of providing additional readjustment and \n     transition assistance to veterans and their families in \n     cooperation with Readjustment Counseling Centers. The pilot \n     would be similar to family assistance programs previously \n     conducted at ten Army facilities around the country.\n       The House bill contained no similar provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision with \n     an amendment to begin the pilot program no later than 180 \n     days after the enactment of the Act.\n\n\n                     Title IV--Health Care Matters\n\n     Veterans beneficiary travel program (sec. 401)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 101) that would \n     direct the Secretary to reimburse qualifying veterans at the \n     rate authorized for Government employees under section \n     5707(b) of title 5. The Senate provision would also strike a \n     provision that allows the Secretary to raise or lower the \n     deductible for reimbursements in proportion to a change in \n     the mileage rate. Finally, the Senate provision would \n     reinstate the amount of the deductible for the beneficiary \n     travel reimbursement program to the amount in effect prior to \n     the Secretary's February 1, 2008, decision on beneficiary \n     travel.\n       The House bill contained no similar provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n\n[[Page S10442]]\n\n     Mandatory reimbursement of veterans receiving emergency \n         treatment in non-department of veterans affairs \n         facilities until transfer to department facilities (sec. \n         402)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision that would amend \n     section 1725 of title 38 in subsections (a)(1) and (f)(1). \n     Subsection (a)(1) would be amended by replacing ``may \n     reimburse'' with ``shall reimburse.'' This change would make \n     reimbursement for emergency care received at non-VA \n     facilities mandatory for eligible veterans, rather than at \n     the discretion of the Secretary. Subsection (f)(1) would be \n     amended to provide greater specificity regarding the \n     termination of VA's obligation to reimburse. The Senate bill \n     would also amend section 1728 of title 38 so as to make that \n     section, which relates to reimbursement for the emergency \n     treatment of service-connected conditions, consistent with \n     section 1725, as amended. Thus, reimbursement would also be \n     made mandatory under Section 1728. The existing criteria, \n     defining veteran eligibility for reimbursement for emergency \n     care services, would be carried over in the revised statutory \n     language. In addition, the Senate bill would further amend \n     section 1728 so as to strike the phrase ``care and services'' \n     in current subsection (b) of section 1728, and replace that \n     phrase with ``emergency treatment.'' This proposed change is \n     designed to promote consistency between sections 1725 and \n     1728.\n       H.R. 3819 contained similar provisions.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains these provisions.\n     Pilot program of enhanced contract care authority for health \n         care needs of veterans in highly rural areas (sec. 403)\n       H.R. 1527 (sec. 2) would require the Secretary to conduct a \n     pilot program which permits highly rural veterans who are \n     enrolled in the system of patient enrollment established \n     under section 1705(a) of title 38, and who reside in Veterans \n     Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) 1, 15, 18, and 19, to \n     elect to receive covered health services for which such \n     veterans are eligible, through a non-Department health care \n     provider.\n       The Senate bill contained no similar provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement follows the House bill, with an \n     amendment that specifies that the pilot program will be \n     carried out in 5 VISNs, four of which shall include at least \n     three highly rural counties (as determined by the Secretary \n     based upon the most recent census data), and one of which \n     shall include one highly rural county. All VISNs selected \n     must include an area within the borders of at least four \n     states, and not be already participating in Project HERO. \n     Eligibility for participation in the pilot program would be \n     limited to those veterans already enrolled in the VA health \n     care system at the time of commencement of the program, as \n     well as OIF/OEF veterans who are eligible for VA health care \n     under section 1710(e)(3)(C) of title 38.\n     Epilepsy centers of excellence (sec. 404)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 103) that would \n     require that the Secretary, upon the recommendation of the \n     Under Secretary for Health, to designate not less than six \n     Department health care facilities as locations for epilepsy \n     centers of excellence.\n       H.R. 2818 (sec. 2) would require the Secretary to designate \n     an epilepsy center of excellence at each of the 5 centers \n     designated under section 7327 of title 38 (Centers for \n     research, education, and clinical activities on complex \n     multi-trauma associated with combat injuries).\n       The Compromise Agreement specifies that Secretary shall \n     designate at least four but not more than six Department \n     health care facilities as locations for epilepsy centers of \n     excellence. Not less than two of these centers shall be \n     collocated with centers designated under 7327 of title 38.\n     Establishment of qualifications for peer specialist \n         appointees (sec. 405)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 104) that would \n     amend section 7402(b) of title 38 so as to define \n     qualifications for peer specialist positions employed by the \n     Veterans Health Administration. Specifically, in order to be \n     eligible to be appointed to a peer specialist position, a \n     person must be a veteran who has recovered or is recovering \n     from a mental health condition; and be certified by a not-\n     for-profit entity engaged in peer specialist training by \n     having met such criteria as the Secretary shall establish for \n     a peer specialist position; or a State by having satisfied \n     relevant State requirements for a peer specialist position. \n     The Senate bill would also amend section 7402 of title 38 so \n     as to add a new subsection providing authority for the \n     Secretary to enter into contracts with not-for-profit \n     entities to provide peer specialist training to veterans and \n     certification for veterans.\n       The House bill contained no similar provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n     Establishment of consolidated patient accounting centers \n         (sec. 406)\n       Section 5 of H.R. 6445 contained a provision that would \n     amend chapter 17 of title 38 to insert a new section \n     mandating that not later than 5 years after the date of \n     enactment of this bill, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall establish not more than seven consolidated patient \n     accounting centers for conducting industry-modeled \n     regionalized billing and collection activities of the \n     Department.\n       The Senate bill contained no comparable provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision.\n     Repeal of limitation on authority to conduct widespread HIV \n         testing program (sec. 407)\n       Section 217 of S. 2969 would repeal section 124 of Public \n     Law 100-322, which permits VA to test a patient for HIV \n     infection only if the veteran receives pre-test counseling \n     and provides written informed consent for such testing. \n     Eliminating this section from the law would bring VA's \n     statutory HIV testing requirements in line with current \n     guidelines issued by the Centers of Disease Control and \n     Prevention.\n       Section 6 of H.R. 6445 contained an identical provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the provision.\n     Provision of comprehensive health care by Secretary of \n         Veterans Affairs to children of Vietnam veterans born \n         with spina bifida (sec. 408)\n       H.R. 5729 would amend section 1803(a) of title 38 so as to \n     expand the existing VA Spina Bifida Health Care Program and \n     provide a comprehensive health benefit to beneficiaries.\n       The Senate bill contained no comparable provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision.\n     Exemption from copayment requirement for veterans receiving \n         hospice care (sec. 409)\n       Section 309 of S. 1233 would amend section 1710 of title 38 \n     so as to exempt hospice care provided in all settings from \n     the copayment requirement for VA long-term care. \n     Under current law, only hospice care provided in a VA \n     nursing home is exempted from copayment.\n       H.R. 2623 contained a similar provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the provision.\n\n\n                           Title V--Pain Care\n\n     Comprehensive policy on pain management (sec. 501)\n       The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 201) that would \n     require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop and \n     implement a comprehensive policy on the management of pain \n     experienced by veterans enrolled for VA health care services \n     no later than October 1, 2008.\n       The policy would be required to cover the following: the \n     Department-wide management of acute and chronic pain \n     experienced by veterans;

Under the \n     provisions of the proposed new section 2044, grants would be \n     provided for a wide range of services, so as to give families \n     a broad set of tools to maintain a permanent residence. To \n     this end, providers could receive grants to furnish outreach, \n     case management, assistance in obtaining and coordinating VA \n     benefits, and assistance in obtaining and coordinating other \n     public benefits provided by federal, state, or local agencies \n     or organizations.\n       Section 9 of H.R. 2874 contained similar provisions but \n     provided a more expansive list of supportive services, and \n     authorized for appropriations a different funding level.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the Senate provision.\n\n\nTitle VII--Authorization of Medical Facility Projects and Major Medical \n                            Facility Leases\n\n     Authorization for fiscal year 2009 major medical facility \n         projects (sec. 701)\n       Section 701 of S. 2969 would authorize: $54,000,000 to \n     construct a facility to replace a seismically unsafe acute \n     psychiatric inpatient building in Palo Alto, California; \n     $131,800,000 for an outpatient clinic in Lee County, Florida; \n     $225,900,000 to make seismic corrections at a VA Medical \n     Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico; and $66,000,000 to construct \n     a state-of-the-art polytrauma health care and rehabilitation \n     center in San Antonio, Texas.\n       Section 101 of H.R. 6832 contained the same provisions, \n     except for Lee County, Florida.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is acting on \nS. 3023, as amended, the proposed Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of \n2008, as passed by the House of Representatives earlier this week. The \nbill, as it comes before the Senate, is a compromise agreement \ndeveloped with our counterparts on the House Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs. I thank Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer of the House \ncommittee for their cooperation on this legislation. I also thank my \ngood friend, the committee's ranking member, Senator Burr, for his \ncooperation as we have developed this bill.\n  This omnibus veterans' benefits bill will provide much needed support \nto our Nation's veterans. It contains provisions that are designed to \nenhance compensation, claims processing, housing, labor and education \nand insurance benefits for veterans. A full explanation of the Senate \nand House negotiated agreement can be found in the Joint Explanatory \nStatement, which I will ask appear in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  I will highlight a few of the provisions that I have sponsored in the \nlegislation that is before us today.\n  This legislation would result in improved notices being sent to \nveterans concerning their claims for VA benefits. Following a number of \ndecisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, VA's notification letters to \nveterans about the status of their claims have become increasingly \nlong, complex, and difficult to understand. These notification letters \nmust be simplified, as veterans, VA, veterans' advocates, and outside \nreview bodies have all recommended. The notices should focus on the \nspecific type of claim presented. They should use plain and ordinary \nlanguage rather than bureaucratic jargon. Veterans should not be \nsubjected to confusing information as they seek benefits.\n  To further improve the VA compensation system, this legislation would \nend the prohibition on judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Federal Circuit of matters concerning the VA rating schedule. VA \nissues regulations which are used to assign ratings to veterans for \nparticular disabilities. Under current law, actions concerning the \nrating schedule are not subject to judicial review unless a \nconstitutional challenge is presented. This legislation would amend the \nlaw to treat actions concerning the rating schedule in the same manner \nas all other actions concerning VA regulations.\n  I expect VA to comply with all laws passed by Congress in developing \nand revising the rating schedule. However, justice to our Nation's \nveterans requires that actions concerning the rating schedule be \nsubject to the same judicial scrutiny as is available for the review of \nactions involving other regulations.\n  VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program may exempt homeowners from having to \nmake a downpayment or secure private mortgage insurance, depending on \nthe size of the loan and the amount of the VA guaranty.\n  Public Law 108-454 increased VA's maximum guaranty amount to 25 \npercent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit determined under \nsection 305(a)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act for \na single-family residence, as adjusted for the year involved.\n  The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, Public Law 110-185, temporarily \nreset the maximum limits on home loans that the Federal Housing \nAdministration may insure and that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may \npurchase on the secondary market to 125 percent of metropolitan-area \nmedian home prices but did so without reference to the VA home loan \nprogram. This had the effect of raising the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, \nand FHA limits to nearly $730,000, in the highest cost areas, while \nleaving the then-VA limit of $417,000 in place. On July 30, 2008, the \nHousing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 was signed into law as Public \nLaw 110-289. That law provided a temporary increase in the maximum \nguaranty amount for VA loans originated from July 30, 2008 through \nDecember 31, 2008, to the same level as provided in the stimulus act.\n  The compromise agreement would extend the temporary increase in the \nmaximum guaranty amount until December 31, 2011. This would enable more \nveterans to utilize their VA benefit to purchase more costly homes.\n  The compromise agreement would also increase the maximum guaranty \nlimit for refinance loans and increase the percentage of an existing \nloan that VA will refinance under the VA home loan program.\n  Under current law, the maximum VA home loan guaranty limit for most \nloans in excess of $144,000 is equal to 25 percent of the Freddie Mac \nconforming loan limit for a single-family home. Public Law 110-289 set \nthis value at approximately $182,437 through the end of 2008. This \nmeans lenders offering loans of up to $729,750 will receive up to a 25-\npercent guaranty, which is typically required to place the loan on the \nsecondary market. Under current law, this does not include regular \nrefinance loans.\n  Current law limits to $36,000 the guaranty that can be used for a \nregular refinance loan. This restriction means VA will not guarantee a \nregular refinance loan over $144,000, essentially precluding a veteran \nfrom using the VA program to refinance his or her existing FHA or \nconventional loan in excess of that amount.\n  VA is also currently precluded from refinancing a loan if the \nhomeowner does not have at least 10 percent equity in his or her home.\n  The compromise agreement would remove the equity requirement for \nrefinancing from an FHA loan or conventional loan to a VA-guaranteed \nloan. This would allow more veterans to use their VA benefit to \nrefinance their mortgages. Many veterans do not have 10 percent equity \nand thus are precluded from refinancing with a VA-guaranteed home loan.\n  Given the anticipated number of non-VA-guaranteed adjustable rate \nmortgages that are approaching the reset time when payments are likely \nto increase, the committee believes that it\n\n[[Page S10445]]\n\nis prudent to facilitate veterans refinancing to VA-guaranteed loans. \nIn light of today's housing and home loan crises, additional \nrefinancing options will help some veterans bridge financial gaps and \nallow them to stay in their homes and escape possible foreclosures. \nThese provisions would allow more qualified veterans to refinance their \nhome loans under the VA program.\n  This omnibus benefits bill would also make crucial updates to the \nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, which \nprotects service members' rights to return to their prior jobs with the \nsame wages and benefits. The provisions in the committee bill are \nderived from S. 2471, the proposed USERRA Enforcement Improvement Act \nof 2007, which Senator Kennedy and I introduced on December 13, 2007. \nThis legislation would ensure that Federal agencies assist service \nmembers in a more effective manner by requiring the Department of Labor \nto investigate and refer cases in a more timely manner and by requiring \nreports from the Department of Labor on their compliance with the \ndeadlines.\n  The omnibus benefits bill includes a provision derived from S. 3000, \nthe proposed Native American Veterans Access Act of 2008, which I \nintroduced on May 8, 2008. This provision is intended improve VA's \nability to understand and respond to the needs of Native American \nveterans. While Native Americans are more likely to serve in uniform \nthan the general population, many of them find cultural and \ngeographical barriers between themselves and the benefits they earned \nthrough service. In addition, those returning to traditional homelands, \nespecially reservation communities, frequently come home to dismal job \nopportunities and starved economies. The proposed bill would require a \nstudy to help us understand the employment needs of Native American \nveterans and how best to address them.\n  The compromise agreement also includes provisions derived from \nlegislation I introduced on April 25, 2007, S. 1215, which would update \nthe Special Unemployment Study required to be submitted by the \nSecretary of Labor to the Congress by mandating that it cover veterans \nof Post 9/11 global operations. It would also require the report to be \nsubmitted on an annual, rather than a biennial, basis. By updating this \nreport, Congress will have more data available on more recent groups of \nveterans--those who served and are serving in the Post-9/11 global \noperations. This will help with assessments of the needs of current \nveterans entering the work force and develop appropriate responses.\n  Before I close, I recognize and thank the individuals involved in \nputting together this comprehensive measure. Specifically, I thank \nKimberly Ross, Brian Lawrence, Juan Lara, and Mike Brinck from the \nHouse committee and Amanda Meredith, Mindi Walker, and Kevin Tewes from \nthe minority staff on the Senate Committee. I also thank the majority \nstaff who assisted me in developing the compromise agreement and all \nthe legislation that led up to it. Patrick McGreevy, Mary Ellen \nMcCarthy, Ted Pusey, Babette Polzer, and Dahlia Melendrez have worked \nthroughout the 110th Congress on many of the provisions included in \nthis legislation, and I am pleased that our collective efforts have led \nto this compromise agreement becoming a reality.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this important legislation that \nwould benefit many of this Nation's nearly 24 million veterans and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the Joint Explanatory \nStatement, which was developed with our colleagues in the House, \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Joint Explanatory Statement on Amendment to Senate Bill, S. \n         3023, as Amended\n       S. 3023, as amended, the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act \n     of 2008, reflects a Compromise Agreement reached by the House \n     and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs (the Committees) \n     on the following bills reported during the 110th Congress: \n     H.R. 674; H.R. 3681, as amended; H.R. 3889, as amended; H.R. \n     4255, as amended; H.R. 5664, as amended; H.R. 5892, as \n     amended; H.R. 6221, as amended; H.R. 6225, as amended, and \n     H.R. 6832 (House Bills); S. 1315, as amended; and S. 3023, as \n     amended (Senate Bills).\n       H.R. 674 passed the House on July 31, 2008; H.R. 3681, as \n     amended, passed the House on May 20, 2008; H.R. 3889, as \n     amended, passed the House on May 20, 2008; H.R. 4255, as \n     amended, passed the House on July 31, 2008; H.R. 5664, as \n     amended, passed the House on May 20, 2008; H.R. 5892, as \n     amended, passed the House on July 30, 2008; H.R. 6221, as \n     amended, passed the House on July 31, 2008; H.R. 6225, as \n     amended, passed the House on July 31, 2008; H.R. 6832 passed \n     the House on September 11, 2008; S. 1315, as amended, passed \n     the Senate on April 24, 2008, and passed the House, as \n     amended, on September 22, 2008; and S. 3023, as amended, \n     passed the Senate on September 16, 2008.\n       The Committees have prepared the following explanation of \n     S. 3023, as further amended, to reflect a Compromise \n     Agreement between the Committees. Differences between the \n     provisions contained in the Compromise Agreement and the \n     related provisions of the House Bills and the Senate Bills \n     are noted in this document, except for clerical corrections, \n     conforming changes made necessary by the Compromise \n     Agreement, and minor drafting, technical, and clarifying \n     changes.\n     Title I--Compensation and Pension Matters\n\n\n   REGULATIONS ON CONTENTS OF NOTICE TO BE PROVIDED CLAIMANTS BY THE \n DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS REGARDING THE SUBSTANTIATION OF CLAIMS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, the Secretary has general authority to \n     issue regulations.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 101 of S. 3023, as amended, would amend subsection \n     (a) of section 5103 of title 38, United States Code, to add a \n     new paragraph that would require the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) to promulgate regulations specifying the content \n     of notices required by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act \n     (VCAA). The regulations required by S. 3023 would provide \n     that the notice specify for each type of claim for benefits \n     the general information and evidence required to substantiate \n     the claim. The regulations would specify different content of \n     the notices depending on the type of claim concerned, whether \n     it be an original claim, a claim for reopening, or a claim \n     for increase in benefits. The Senate bill would provide \n     authority for additional or alternative content for notice if \n     appropriate to the particular benefit or services sought \n     under the claim. The regulations would also be required to \n     include in the notice the time period within which such \n     information and evidence must be submitted. The provision \n     would be applicable only to notices which would be sent on or \n     after the date the regulations are effective.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 101 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate language.\n       The Committees note that the notice required by section \n     5103 applies to all types of applications for benefits and \n     services. While the Committees recognize that veterans \n     seeking service-connected compensation are most likely to \n     receive VCAA notices, the Compromise Agreement specifically \n     provides that the notice shall provide that the content of \n     notices be appropriate to the type of benefits or services \n     sought. The Committees intend that the Compromise Agreement \n     would require a notice involving a pension claim to have \n     different content than a notice concerning a clothing \n     allowance or a claim for specially adapted housing.\n       The Committees emphasize that VCAA notices are required \n     only in cases in which additional information or evidence is \n     needed to substantiate the claim. If the information and \n     evidence needed to substantiate the claim is submitted with \n     the application or contained in the claims file, no VCAA \n     notice is required. For example, claims for education, health \n     care, housing, vocational rehabilitation, and burial benefits \n     might contain sufficient information and evidence to \n     substantiate the claim without the necessity of a VCAA \n     notice.\n       In other respects, the Committees agree that Senate Report \n     110-148 contains a full explanation of the provision \n     contained in the Compromise Agreement.\n\n\n JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADOPTION AND REVISION BY THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS \n    AFFAIRS OF THE SCHEDULE OF RATINGS FOR DISABILITIES OF VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, section 502 of title 38, judicial review \n     of actions involving VA's rating schedule for disabilities is \n     prohibited.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 102 of S. 3023, as amended, would authorize the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to \n     review VA actions relating to the adoption or revision of the \n     VA disability rating schedule in the same manner as other \n     comparable actions of the Secretary are reviewed.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 102 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n[[Page S10446]]\n\n   CONFORMING AMENDMENT RELATING TO NON-DEDUCTIBILITY FROM VETERANS' \n DISABILITY COMPENSATION OF DISABILITY SEVERANCE PAY FOR DISABILITIES \n        INCURRED BY MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES IN COMBAT ZONES\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1212 of title 10 stipulates the amount of severance \n     pay available to members of the Armed Forces who separate due \n     to a disability incurred in the line of duty. Section 1646 of \n     the Wounded Warrior Act, title XVI of Public Law 110-181, \n     amended section 1212 to adjust the computation of the amount \n     of such severance pay and to eliminate the requirement that \n     severance pay received by servicemembers for a disability \n     incurred in a combat zone be deducted from VA compensation.\n       Section 1161 of title 38 stipulates that the deduction of \n     disability severance pay from disability compensation shall \n     be made at a monthly rate not in excess of the rate of \n     compensation to which the individual would be entitled based \n     on the individual's disability rating. Section 1161 makes \n     reference to subsection 1212(c) of title 10. However, Public \n     Law 110-181 did not include a conforming amendment to keep \n     section 1161 consistent with the changes made to section \n     1212.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 104 of S. 3023, as amended, would make a conforming \n     amendment, so that section 1161 of title 38 will be \n     consistent with section 1212 of title 10. The amendment would \n     take effect on January 28, 2008, as if it had been included \n     in the Wounded Warrior Act. As a result, the amended section \n     1161 of title 38 would reflect the change to section 1212 of \n     title 10 eliminating the requirement that severance pay for a \n     disability incurred in a combat zone be deducted from \n     disability compensation from VA.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 103 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n REPORT ON PROGRESS OF THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS IN ADDRESSING \nCAUSES FOR VARIANCES IN COMPENSATION PAYMENTS FOR VETERANS FOR SERVICE-\n                         CONNECTED DISABILITIES\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable provision in current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 105 of S. 3023, as amended, would require VA to \n     submit a report to Congress describing the Department's \n     progress in addressing the causes for any unacceptable \n     variances in compensation payments to veterans.\n       Section 105 would require VA to submit a report to the \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives describing the Department's progress in \n     addressing the causes of unacceptable variances in \n     compensation payments to veterans for service-connected \n     disabilities. The report would be due to the Committees not \n     later than one year after the date of enactment of this \n     section.\n       Section 105 would require the report to include three \n     specific elements: (1) a description of the Veterans Benefits \n     Administration's efforts to coordinate with the Veterans \n     Health Administration (VHA) to improve the quality of \n     disability examinations performed by VHA and contract \n     clinicians, including the use of standardized templates; (2) \n     an assessment of the current personnel requirements at each \n     regional office for each type of claims adjudication \n     position; and (3) a description of the differences, if any, \n     in current patterns of submittal rates for claims from \n     various segments of the veterans population, including \n     veterans from rural and highly rural areas, minority \n     veterans, veterans who served in the National Guard or \n     Reserve, and military retirees.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 104 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate language. The Committees acknowledge that it is \n     unreasonable to expect states to have exactly the same \n     average compensation or percentage of veterans receiving \n     compensation. In determining whether differences are \n     unacceptable, the Committees expect that the Secretary would \n     identify those that do not result from such basis demographic \n     discrepancies.\n\n\n    EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY AUTHORITY FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF MEDICAL \n             DISABILITY EXAMINATIONS BY CONTRACT PHYSICIANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Public Law 104-275, the Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act \n     of 1996, authorized VA to carry out a pilot program of \n     contract disability examinations at ten VA regional offices \n     using amounts available for payment of compensation and \n     pensions. Public Law 108-183, the Veterans Benefits Act of \n     2003, provided additional authority to VA, on a time-limited \n     basis, to contract for disability examinations using \n     appropriated funds. This additional authority expires on \n     December 31, 2009.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 604 of S. 3023, as amended, would amend section \n     704(c) of the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-\n     183) by striking ``December 31, 2009'' and inserting \n     ``December 31, 2012.'' This would extend VA's authority, \n     through December 31, 2012, to use appropriated funds for the \n     purpose of contracting with non-VA providers to conduct \n     disability examinations.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 105 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language except that the authority extends only until \n     December 31, 2010.\n\n\n    ADDITION OF OSTEOPOROSIS TO DISABILITIES PRESUMED TO BE SERVICE-\n    CONNECTED IN FORMER PRISONERS OF WAR WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS \n                                DISORDER\n\n     Current Law\n       Subsection 1112(b) of title 38 contains two lists of \n     diseases that are presumed to be related to an individual's \n     experience as a prisoner of war. The first presumptive list, \n     in paragraph (2) of section 1112(b), requires no minimum \n     internment period and includes diseases associated with \n     mental trauma or acute physical trauma which could plausibly \n     be caused by even a single day of captivity. The second \n     presumptive list, found under paragraph (3) of section \n     1112(b), has a 30-day minimum internment requirement.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 601 of S. 1315, as amended, would add osteoporosis \n     in veterans whom the Secretary has previously determined have \n     post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to the list of \n     disabilities presumed to be service-connected in former \n     prisoners of war found under paragraph (3) of section 1112(b) \n     of title 38.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 106 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n Title II--Modernization of Department of Veterans Affairs Disability \n                          Compensation System\n\n                      Subtitle A--Benefits Matters\n\n\n               AUTHORITY FOR TEMPORARY DISABILITY RATINGS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, the Secretary has, under the Secretary's \n     general authority, issued regulations providing temporary \n     ratings for veterans with unstabilized medical conditions who \n     are recently discharged from active duty, hospitalized \n     veterans, veterans undergoing convalescent care, and veterans \n     who are discharged from active duty with a mental disorder \n     that develops as the result of a highly stressful event.\n     House Bill\n       Section 109 of H.R. 5892, as amended, would have provided \n     VA with authority to issue partial ratings and to act in a \n     more expeditious manner for claims presenting undisputed \n     severe and very severe injuries and in turn provide \n     compensation more quickly where the service-connection link \n     is indisputable. VA currently possesses the ability to issue \n     partial ratings, although this authority is not expressly \n     stated in statute. H.R. 5892, as amended, would expressly \n     grant VA that authority and require VA to issue a partial \n     rating in the instances where a veteran has sustained severe \n     injuries (50 percent or above) and very severe injuries (100 \n     percent) that can be promptly rated, while deferring other \n     conditions that may not be ready to rate. VA and the \n     Department of Defense (DOD) have defined these conditions, \n     and they include limb amputations, paralysis, traumatic brain \n     injury (TBI), severe burns, blindness, deafness, along with \n     other radical injuries.\n       The House bill also further clarified the language so that \n     VA could rate the indisputable injuries based solely on the \n     Department of Defense medical records, which would be \n     extensive for these categories of injuries.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 211 of the Compromise Agreement would codify the \n     various provisions for temporary ratings contained in current \n     regulations. Specifically, the Committees intend to provide a \n     specific statutory basis for the regulations currently found \n     at sections 4.28, 4.29, 4.30 and 4.129 of title 38, Code of \n     Federal Regulations.\n       In addition to the authority currently contained in \n     regulations, the Compromise Agreement provides that veterans \n     discharged or released from active duty within 365 days of \n     application who have stabilized medical conditions would be \n     eligible to receive a temporary rating under certain \n     circumstances. In general, veterans with stabilized \n     disabilities would be eligible to receive a temporary rating \n     under conditions which are similar to those applied to \n     veterans with unstabilized conditions when a total rating is \n     not immediately assignable.\n       The Committees intend that, under this new authority, a \n     veteran who has a stabilized condition, such as a healed \n     amputation, but has one or more severe disabilities for which \n     a total rating is not immediately assignable under the \n     regular provisions of\n\n[[Page S10447]]\n\n     the rating schedule or on the basis of Individual \n     Unemployability, could qualify for a temporary rating when \n     employment was adversely impacted by such disabilities. The \n     Compromise Agreement would permit such a veteran to be \n     eligible to receive a temporary rating when such veteran has \n     severe disabilities that result in substantially gainful \n     employment not being feasible or advisable or the veteran has \n     unhealed or incompletely healed wounds or injuries that make \n     material impairment of employability likely. The Committees \n     intend that, in considering eligibility for a temporary \n     rating under this section, both stabilized and unstabilized \n     conditions could be considered in determining the impact of \n     such disabilities upon employment.\n       The rating assigned under these conditions would be as \n     prescribed by the Secretary in regulations. The Committees \n     note that, where current regulations are adequate to address \n     the conditions for temporary ratings, as set forth in this \n     section, the Secretary would not be required to issue new \n     regulations.\n\n\n                  SUBSTITUTION UPON DEATH OF CLAIMANT\n\n     Current Law\n       Currently, upon the death of a claimant with a claim or \n     appeal pending adjudication at the time of death, the \n     surviving spouse or other beneficiary is unable to take up \n     the claim where it is in the process and must refile the \n     claim separately as if submitting a new claim. Section 5121 \n     of title 38 allows for survivors, in order of priority, to \n     refile this new claim for accrued benefits.\n     House Bill\n       Section 111 of H.R. 5892, as amended, would provide that, \n     in the event of the death of a veteran with a pending \n     disability claim, an eligible dependent as identified under \n     section 5121(a)(2) of title 38 would be authorized to \n     substitute for the deceased claimant rather than being forced \n     to re-file and restart the claim or appeal. This provision \n     would also allow an eligible survivor to submit additional \n     evidence for up to one year after the death of a veteran. \n     This provision further stipulates that only one person may be \n     treated as the claimant under this section. Additionally, if \n     the person who would be eligible to be a claimant under this \n     section certifies to the Secretary that he or she does not \n     want to be treated as the claimant for such purposes, he or \n     she may designate the person who could then be entitled to \n     receive the benefits under this section. The effective date \n     of this section would apply only to claims of veterans who \n     die on or after the date of enactment.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provisions.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 212 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House language. However, the Compromise Agreement \n     stipulates that, not later than one year after the date of \n     the death of the claimant, the individual who would be \n     eligible to receive accrued benefits under section 5121(a) of \n     title 38 must file a request to be substituted as the \n     claimant for the purpose of processing the claim to \n     completion. This is the same time period within which \n     claimants for accrued benefits are required to file an \n     application for accrued benefits must file such a claim under \n     current law. Under the Compromise Agreement, any person \n     seeking substitution shall present evidence of the right to \n     claim such status within the time period prescribed by the \n     Secretary in regulations.\n\n\n  REPORT ON COMPENSATION OF VETERANS FOR LOSS OF EARNING CAPACITY AND \n   QUALITY OF LIFE AND ON LONG-TERM TRANSITION PAYMENTS TO VETERANS \n      UNDERGOING REHABILITATION FOR SERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITIES\n\n     Current Law\n       Under chapter 11 of title 38, VA pays compensation to \n     veterans who suffer disabilities as a result of an injury or \n     disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during \n     active duty. Section 1155 of title 38 requires VA to adopt \n     and apply a schedule of disability ratings, which is used to \n     determine the amount of compensation that will be provided. \n     That schedule is based on the average impairment of earning \n     capacity caused by a service-connected disability.\n       In July 2007, the President's Commission on Care for \n     America's Returning Wounded Warriors recommended that \n     Congress restructure VA disability payments to include \n     transition payments and that VA update the rating schedule to \n     reflect current injuries and the impact of disability on \n     quality of life. In 2008, the Secretary entered into a \n     contract to conduct studies on those issues. The studies \n     examined the appropriate level of disability compensation to \n     be paid to veterans to compensate for loss of earning \n     capacity and loss of quality of life as a result of service-\n     connected disabilities. The studies also examined the \n     feasibility and appropriate level of long-term transition \n     payments to veterans who are separated from the Armed Forces \n     due to a disability while those veterans are undergoing a \n     program of rehabilitation.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 106 of S. 3023, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to provide Congress with a report regarding the \n     results of studies examining the appropriate compensation to \n     be provided to veterans for loss of earning capacity and loss \n     of quality of life caused by service-connected disabilities \n     and examining long-term transition payments to veterans \n     undergoing rehabilitation for service-connected disabilities.\n       Section 106 also would require the Secretary to submit to \n     Congress a report including a comprehensive description of \n     the findings and recommendations of those studies; a \n     description of the actions proposed to be taken by the \n     Secretary in light of those findings and recommendations, \n     including a description of any proposed modifications to the \n     VA disability rating schedule or to other regulations or \n     policies; a schedule for the commencement and completion of \n     any actions proposed to be taken; and a description of any \n     legislative action required in order to authorize, \n     facilitate, or enhance any of the proposed actions. That \n     report would be due no later than 210 days after the date of \n     enactment.\n     House Bill\n       Section 102(a) of H.R. 5892, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to conduct a study on adjusting the schedule for \n     rating disabilities adopted and applied under section 1155 of \n     title 38. It would require VA to complete the study within \n     180 days after the date of enactment and would require VA, \n     within 60 days after completing the study, to submit to \n     Congress a report on the study. Not later than 120 days after \n     the Secretary submits the report, the Secretary would be \n     required to submit a plan for readjusting the rating \n     schedule.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 213 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate language.\n\n\n             ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON DISABILITY COMPENSATION\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable provision in current law.\n     House Bill\n       Section 102(d) of H.R. 5892, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to establish an 18-member Advisory Committee on \n     Disability Compensation. The Committee would consist of \n     individuals who have demonstrated civic or professional \n     achievement and who have experience in the provision of \n     disability compensation or have other relevant scientific or \n     medical expertise. The Secretary would determine the terms of \n     pay and service of such members, but their terms of service \n     would not exceed two years. The Secretary would be authorized \n     to reappoint members for subsequent terms.\n       Section 102 would require the Committee to be responsible \n     for providing advice to the Secretary with respect to the \n     maintenance and periodic adjustment of the rating schedule.\n       It would also require the Committee to submit annual \n     reports to the Secretary and require the Secretary to submit \n     reports and recommendations to the Committees on Veterans' \n     Affairs of the House and Senate.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 214 of the Compromise Agreement contains the House \n     provision with modifications. The Committees intend that this \n     Committee provide medical and scientific advice to the \n     Secretary concerning the maintenance and readjustment of the \n     rating schedule. Therefore, the Compromise Agreement provides \n     that membership be limited to individuals with experience \n     with the provision of disability compensation by the \n     Department or individuals who are leading medical or \n     scientific experts in relevant fields. The Compromise \n     Agreement extends the term of service of such members to four \n     years and provides that the terms are to be staggered so as \n     to provide for continuity of membership on the Committee. The \n     Compromise Agreement provides that the Secretary shall \n     appoint a Chair of the Committee.\n       The Compromise Agreement specifically provides that the \n     Secretary shall ensure that appropriate personnel, funding, \n     and other resources are provided to the Committee to carry \n     out its responsibilities. The Compromise Agreement requires \n     the Committee to submit biennial reports to the Secretary. \n     The Compromise Agreement requires the Secretary to submit \n     such biennial reports to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs \n     of the Senate and House together with the recommendations of \n     the Committee and the Secretary.\n\n             Subtitle B--Assistance and Processing Matters\n\n\n  PILOT PROGRAMS ON EXPEDITED TREATMENT OF FULLY DEVELOPED CLAIMS AND \n        PROVISION OF CHECKLISTS TO INDIVIDUALS SUBMITTING CLAIMS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 5103 of title 38 requires the Secretary to notify a \n     claimant of the information and medical or lay evidence \n     needed to substantiate the claimant's claim. Under section \n     5103A of title 38, the Secretary is required to assist the \n     claimant by making reasonable efforts to obtain evidence \n     necessary to substantiate the claimant's claim. In claims for \n     service-connection, this duty includes obtaining records held \n     by any Federal department or agency and by providing a \n     medical examination or opinion necessary to\n\n[[Page S10448]]\n\n     make a determination on the claim. VA is required to comply \n     with these laws before issuing a decision on the claim.\n     House Bill\n       Section 107(a) of H.R. 5892, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to provide for the expeditious treatment of any \n     fully developed claim. A fully developed claim would be \n     defined as a claim for which the claimant received assistance \n     from a veterans service officer, a State or county veterans \n     service officer, an agent, an attorney or for which the \n     claimant submits with the claim an indication that the \n     claimant does not want to submit any additional information \n     and does not require assistance with respect to the claim. \n     The claimant would certify in writing that no additional \n     information is available or needed to be submitted in order \n     for the claim to be adjudicated. The Secretary would be \n     required to decide such claims within 90 days of submittal.\n       Section 107(b) of H.R. 5892, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to amend the notice required by section 5103 of \n     title 38 to require the creation of a detailed checklist for \n     claims for specific requests of additional information or \n     evidence.\n       The checklist would be required to be developed within 180 \n     days of enactment.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 221 of the Compromise Agreement accepts the House \n     provision with an amendment that creates two pilot programs \n     to test the effectiveness of providing expedited treatment of \n     fully-developed claims and providing an additional checklist \n     that includes information or evidence required to be \n     submitted by the claimant to substantiate the claim. The \n     pilot program on expedited treatment of fully developed \n     claims would be carried out at 10 VA regional offices for a \n     period of one year beginning 60 days after the date of \n     enactment; the pilot program on the provision of checklists \n     to individuals submitting claims would be carried out at four \n     VA regional offices for a period of one year beginning 60 \n     days after the date of enactment for original claims and for \n     a period of three years beginning 60 days after the date of \n     enactment for reopened claims and claims for increased \n     disability ratings. The Secretary would be required to \n     provide interim reports for each pilot authorized under this \n     section and final reports would be due to Congress upon \n     conclusion of the pilots.\n       The Compromise Agreement provides that such checklist be \n     construed as an addendum to the notice required by section \n     5103 of title 38 and shall not be considered as part of the \n     notice for purposes of reversal or remand of a decision of \n     the Secretary. As such, the Committees stress that these \n     checklists are intended to serve only as guidance for \n     claimants and that any errors in these checklists should not \n     be the basis for a remand of the claimant's claim.\n       The Committees expect that, in selecting locations for the \n     pilot projects, the Secretary shall ensure that regional \n     offices of various size and geographic location are included \n     in the pilot projects. The Committees encourage the Secretary \n     to locate the four pilot programs for the checklist at \n     locations selected for the expedited claims pilot projects.\n\n\n                     OFFICE OF SURVIVORS ASSISTANCE\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no relevant provision in current law.\n     House Bill\n       Section 101 of H.R. 5892, as amended, would require VA to \n     create an Office of Survivors Assistance (Office) within the \n     Veterans Benefits Administration that would provide policy \n     and program analysis and oversight regarding all benefits and \n     services delivered by the VA to survivors of deceased \n     veterans and servicemembers.\n       The Office would be responsible for ensuring that survivors \n     and dependents of deceased veterans and deceased members of \n     the Armed Forces have access to applicable benefits and \n     services provided under title 38. The Office would also be \n     responsible for regular and consistent monitoring of benefits \n     delivery to survivors and dependents and ensuring that \n     appropriate referrals are made with respect to various \n     administrations within the VA.\n       The Office would act as a primary advisor to the Secretary \n     on all matters related to the policies, programs, legislative \n     issues, and other initiatives affecting such survivors and \n     dependents.\n       The Secretary would be required to identify and include the \n     activities of the Office in the annual report to Congress \n     under section 529 of title 38.\n       In establishing the Office, the Secretary would have to \n     seek guidance from interested stakeholders, including \n     veterans service organizations and other service \n     organizations.\n       The Secretary would be required to ensure that appropriate \n     personnel, funding, and other resources are provided to the \n     Office to carry out its responsibilities.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provisions.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 222 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language with modifications. In the Compromise Agreement, the \n     Office is established in the Department rather than in the \n     Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). The Committees expect \n     that, by placing the Office under the Department, the full \n     spectrum of VA benefits and services for survivors would be \n     addressed.\n       The Compromise Agreement does not specify the duties of the \n     office in the legislation. However, the Committees intend \n     that the Office be responsible for ensuring that the \n     surviving spouses, children and parents of deceased veterans, \n     including deceased members of the Armed Forces, have access \n     to applicable benefits and services under title 38. The \n     Committees expect that programs carried out by the Department \n     for such survivors will be conducted in a manner that is \n     responsive to their specific needs. The Committees expect the \n     Office to conduct regular and consistent monitoring of the \n     delivery of benefits and services to this population. The \n     Committees expect the Office to ensure that policies and \n     procedures are such that such survivors will receive \n     appropriate referrals to the relevant administrations and \n     offices of the Department, so that such survivors may receive \n     all of the benefits and services for which they are eligible.\n\n\n  COMPTROLLER GENERAL REPORT ON ADEQUACY OF DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY \n  COMPENSATION TO MAINTAIN SURVIVORS OF VETERANS WHO DIE FROM SERVICE-\n                         CONNECTED DISABILITIES\n\n     Current Law\n       VA dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) is a benefit \n     that is paid to survivors of certain veterans. To be \n     eligible, the veteran's death must have resulted from: a \n     disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty \n     or active duty for training; an injury incurred or aggravated \n     in the line of duty while on inactive duty training; or, a \n     service-connected disability or a condition directly related \n     to a service-connected disability.\n       DIC may also be paid to survivors of veterans who were \n     totally disabled from service-connected conditions at the \n     time of death, even if the death was not caused by their \n     service-connected disabilities. To be eligible for the \n     benefit under this circumstance, the veteran must have been \n     rated totally disabled for the ten years preceding death; \n     rated totally disabled from the date of military discharge \n     and for at least five years immediately preceding death; or, \n     a former prisoner of war who died after September 30, 1999, \n     and who was rated totally disabled for at least one year \n     immediately preceding death.\n       Surviving spouses of veterans who died on or after January \n     1, 1993, receive a basic rate, plus additional amounts for \n     dependent children. Surviving spouses of veterans who died \n     prior to January 1, 1993, receive an amount based on the \n     deceased veteran's military pay grade, plus additional \n     amounts for dependents.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 807 of S. 1315, as amended, would require the \n     Comptroller General to report on the adequacy of DIC to \n     maintain survivors of veterans who die from service-connected \n     disabilities. The Comptroller General would be required to \n     submit, to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, a report regarding the adequacy \n     of the benefits to survivors in replacing the deceased \n     veteran's income. The Comptroller General would be required \n     to include a description of the current system of payment of \n     DIC to survivors, including a statement of DIC rates; an \n     assessment of the adequacy of DIC in replacing a deceased \n     veteran's income; and any recommendations that the \n     Comptroller General considers appropriate in order to improve \n     or enhance the effects of DIC in replacing the deceased \n     veteran's income. The Comptroller General would be required \n     to submit the report not later than ten months after the date \n     of enactment of the provision.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 223 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n          INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 7731 of title 38 requires the Secretary to carry \n     out a quality assurance program within the Veterans Benefits \n     Administration. Under this provision, the Secretary has \n     elected to carry out a separate quality assurance program, \n     the Systematic Technical Accuracy Review (STAR), for \n     measuring compensation and pension claims processing \n     accuracy.\n     House Bill\n       Section 106 of H.R. 5892, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to contract with an independent third-party entity \n     for an annual quality assurance assessment. The assessment \n     would measure a statistically valid sample of VBA employees \n     and their work product to assess quality and accuracy. The \n     provision would also require the production of automated \n     categorizable data to help identify trends. Under this \n     provision, the Secretary would be required to use information \n     gathered through the annual assessment to develop an employee \n     certification as found in section 105 of H.R. 5892, as \n     amended.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 224 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     bill with modifications.\n\n[[Page S10449]]\n\n     Under the Compromise Agreement, the Secretary would enter \n     into a contract with an independent third-party entity to \n     conduct a three-year assessment of the quality assurance \n     program. The Committees intend that this provision would be \n     applicable only to quality assurance programs involving the \n     adjudication of claims for compensation and pension benefits. \n     The Compromise Agreement does not include language from \n     section 106 of H.R. 5892, as amended, which would have \n     expressly required the Secretary to ensure the accuracy and \n     consistency across different regional offices with the \n     Department as an amendment to 7731, of title 38, United \n     States Code. However, the Committees agree that the Secretary \n     should strive to reduce variances in ratings for disability \n     compensation between regional offices. The Committees note \n     that section 104 of the Compromise Agreement requires a \n     report from the Secretary in addressing unacceptable \n     variances in compensation payments.\n       The Compromise Agreement also contains provisions from the \n     House bill which would require the Secretary to retain, \n     monitor, and store in an accessible format certain data with \n     respect to claims for service-connected disability \n     compensation. The Committee recognizes that sex and race data \n     are not kept by the Department within the database utilized \n     by the Veterans Benefits Administration at this time and, \n     therefore, excluded those items from the data required to be \n     collected.\n       In other respects, the Compromise Agreement generally \n     follows the House bill. The Committees agree that House \n     Report 110-789 contains a full explanation of the House \n     provisions which were modified in the Compromise Agreement.\n\n\n   CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES OF THE VETERANS BENEFITS \n            ADMINISTRATION RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING CLAIMS\n\n     Current Law\n       The Secretary has general authority to manage and provide \n     for certification of employees of the Department. There is no \n     specific applicable provision in current law.\n     House Bill\n       Section 105 of H.R. 5892, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to develop a certification examination to test \n     appropriate VBA employees and managers who are responsible \n     for processing claims for benefits. The Secretary would be \n     required to develop such examinations in consultation with \n     specified stakeholders. The Secretary would be directed to \n     require such employees and managers to take a certification \n     examination. The Secretary would be prohibited from \n     satisfying the requirements of the bill through the use of \n     any certification examination or program that exists as of \n     the date of enactment of the bill.\n       The House provision would also require the Secretary to \n     contract with an outside entity to conduct an evaluation of \n     VBA's training and quality assurance programs within 180 days \n     of enactment and provide the results of such evaluation to \n     Congress.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 225 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language with modifications. The Compromise Agreement would \n     apply only to employees and managers who are responsible for \n     processing claims for compensation and pension benefits. By \n     using the general term ``compensation and pension'' benefits, \n     the Committees intend that the provision would apply to \n     employees and managers responsible for processing claims for \n     all monetary benefits paid to veterans and survivors, \n     including DIC, death compensation, death pension and benefits \n     paid to children under chapter 18 of title 38.\n       Under the Compromise Agreement, the Secretary is required \n     to consult with examination development experts, interested \n     stakeholders, and employee representatives and consider the \n     data produced under section 7731(c)(3) of title 38 as added \n     by section 224 of the bill.\n       The Compromise Agreement does not contain the prohibition \n     on use of certification examinations or programs that \n     currently exist as in H.R. 5892, as amended. However, the \n     Compromise Agreement requires the Secretary to develop an \n     updated certification examination no later than one year \n     after the date of enactment of this bill and to begin using \n     the updated examination within 90 days after the date on \n     which development of the updated examination is complete.\n       The Compromise Agreement does not include the House \n     provision requiring that VA contract for an evaluation. \n     However, it does require the Comptroller General of the \n     United States to evaluate the training programs administered \n     for employees of the Veterans Benefits Administration and \n     submit a report on the findings of the evaluation to the \n     Committees.\n\n\n  STUDY OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF THE VETERANS \n                        BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable provision in current law.\n     House Bill\n       Section 103 of H.R. 5892, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to conduct a study of VBA's work credit system, \n     which is used to measure the work production of VBA \n     employees. This section of the House bill would require that \n     the Secretary consider the advisability of implementing: \n     performance standards and accountability measures; guidelines \n     and procedures for the prompt processing of claims that are \n     ready to rate upon submission; guidelines and procedures for \n     the processing of such claims submitted by severely injured \n     and very severely injured veterans; and requirements for \n     assessments of claims processing at each regional office for \n     the purposes of producing lessons learned and best practices. \n     A report on the study would be required no later than 180 \n     days after the Secretary submits to Congress the report; and \n     the Secretary would be obligated to establish a new system \n     for evaluating work production. This section of H.R. 5892, as \n     amended, would prohibit the Secretary from awarding a work \n     credit to any employee of the Department if the Secretary has \n     not implemented a new system within the time specified.\n       Section 104 of H.R. 5892, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to conduct a study on the work management system of \n     the Veterans Benefits Administration designed to improve \n     accountability, quality, and accuracy and reducing the time \n     for processing claims for benefits.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 226 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House language with modifications. Under the Compromise \n     Agreement, the Secretary would be required to conduct a study \n     on the effectiveness of the current employee work credit \n     system and the work management system of the Veterans \n     Benefits Administration which is used to measure and manage \n     the work production of employees of the Veterans Benefits \n     Administration who handle claims for compensation and pension \n     benefits. The Secretary would be required to report to \n     Congress on the work credit system and work management system \n     no later than October 31, 2009. The report would be required \n     to identify the components required to implement an updated \n     system for evaluating such VBA employees.\n       In addition, the Compromise Agreement requires that not \n     later than 210 days after the date on which the Secretary \n     submits to Congress the report required under this section, \n     the Secretary shall establish an updated system, based upon \n     the findings of the study, for evaluating the performance and \n     accountability of VBA employees who are responsible for \n     processing claims for compensation or pension benefits.\n\n\n  REVIEW AND ENHANCEMENT OF USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN VETERANS \n                        BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable provision in current law.\n     House Bill\n       Section 110 of H.R. 5892, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to conduct a review, no later than one year after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, on the use of information \n     technology within the Veterans Benefits Administration. It \n     also requires the Secretary to develop a comprehensive plan \n     for use of such technology in processing claims for benefits \n     so as to reduce subjectivity, avoidable remands, and regional \n     office variances in disability ratings for specific \n     disabilities.\n       The House bill would also require that the comprehensive \n     plan include information technology upgrades including web \n     portals, rules-based expert systems, and decision support \n     software.\n       Under the House bill, a report on the progress of the \n     review and plan would be due to Congress by no later than \n     January 1, 2009.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 227 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House bill, except that it clarifies two of the \n     comprehensive plan requirements contained in section 110 of \n     H.R. 5892, as amended. The Compromise Agreement gives the \n     Secretary the discretion to include the following elements, \n     to the extent practicable: the ability for benefits' \n     claimants to view applications online and compliance with \n     security requirements as noted in section 227(b)(3)(B)(ii) \n     of the Compromise Agreement.\n       The Compromise Agreement also requires that the plan be \n     developed, not later than one year after date of enactment.\n       The Compromise Agreement requires, no later than April 1, \n     2010, a report to Congress on the review and the \n     comprehensive plan required under this section.\n\n\n         STUDY AND REPORT ON IMPROVING ACCESS TO MEDICAL ADVICE\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable provision in current law.\n     House Bill\n       Section 108 of H.R. 5892, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to conduct a study to evaluate the need of the \n     Veterans Benefits Administration to employ medical \n     professionals who are not physicians, to act as a medical \n     reference for employees of the Administration so that such \n     employees may accurately assess medical evidence submitted\n\n[[Page S10450]]\n\n     in support of claims for benefits under laws administered by \n     the Secretary. The House bill would prohibit any medical \n     professionals of the Veterans Health Administration from \n     being employed to rate any disability or evaluate any claim. \n     It would require the Secretary to conduct a statistically \n     significant survey of VBA employees to ascertain whether, \n     how, and to what degree medical professionals could provide \n     assistance to such employee.\n       Section 108 would also require the Secretary to submit to \n     Congress a report, within 180 days of enactment of the bill, \n     to evaluate the need to employ such medical professionals. If \n     the Secretary hired medical professionals pursuant to this \n     study, the House bill would require that all employees of all \n     VBA regional offices have access to the medical \n     professionals.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 228 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House language with modifications. The Compromise \n     Agreement requires the Secretary to conduct a study to assess \n     the feasibility and advisability of various mechanisms to \n     improve communication between the Veterans Benefits \n     Administration and the Veterans Health Administration when \n     needed by Veterans Benefits Administration employees to carry \n     out their duties. The study is also required to evaluate \n     whether additional medical professionals are necessary to \n     provide access to relevant Veterans Benefits Administration \n     employees. The Compromise Agreement omits the requirement in \n     the House bill for a statistically significant study of \n     employees.\n\n                 Title III--Labor and Education Matters\n\n                Subtitle A--Labor and Employment Matters\n\n\n                   REFORM OF USERRA COMPLAINT PROCESS\n\n     Current Law\n       Chapter 43 of title 38 provides reemployment and employment \n     rights to servicemembers, veterans, and those who seek to \n     join a uniformed service through the Uniformed Services \n     Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Individuals \n     can privately enforce their rights by filing a complaint in \n     federal or state court, or, in the case of a complaint \n     against a federal employer, by submitting a complaint to the \n     Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). In addition, \n     individuals can request assistance from the federal \n     government by filing a complaint with the Department of \n     Labor's Veterans' Employment and Training Service (DOL VETS), \n     which investigates and attempts to resolve complaints, and, \n     if requested, will refer complaints for litigation. DOL VETS \n     refers complaints against federal agencies to the Office of \n     Special Counsel (OSC) and complaints against private sector \n     employers and state and local governments to the Attorney \n     General. The Special Counsel or Attorney General may \n     represent individuals before the MSPB or in federal court, \n     respectively.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 302 of S. 3023, as amended, would create deadlines \n     for DOL VETS, OSC, and the Attorney General to provide \n     assistance to servicemembers who believe that their rights \n     under USERRA have been violated.\n       Within 5 days of receiving a USERRA complaint, DOL VETS \n     would be required to notify a complainant in writing about \n     his or her rights to receive governmental assistance, \n     including the right to request a referral and the relevant \n     deadlines that the federal agencies must meet and within 90 \n     days of receiving the complaint, DOL VETS would be required \n     to complete its assistance and investigation and notify the \n     complainant of the results and his or her rights, including \n     the right to request a referral and the deadlines federal \n     agencies must meet. Within 48 days after receiving a request \n     for a referral, DOL would be required to refer a complaint to \n     OSC or the Attorney General. Within 60 days of receiving a \n     referral, OSC or the Attorney General would be required to \n     determine whether to provide legal representation to the \n     complainant and notify the complainant of that decision in \n     writing.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 311 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n MODIFICATION AND EXPANSION OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO \n                         ENFORCEMENT OF USERRA\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, the Secretary of Labor must file an \n     annual report to Congress that includes the number of cases \n     reviewed by DOL VETS and the Department of Defense Employer \n     Support of the Guard and Reserve, the number of cases \n     referred to OSC and the Attorney General, and the number of \n     complaints filed by the Attorney General.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 303 of S. 3023, as amended, would expand the \n     reporting requirements regarding the federal government's \n     enforcement of USERRA by requiring data on the number of \n     individuals whose cases are reviewed by both the Department \n     of Defense Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (DOD \n     ESGR), DOL VETS, OSC, and the Attorney General that involve a \n     disability-related issue, and the number of cases that \n     involve a person with a service-connected disability. In \n     addition, the Senate bill would change the date on which the \n     report is required.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 312 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n TRAINING FOR EXECUTIVE BRANCH HUMAN RESOURCES PERSONNEL ON EMPLOYMENT \n      AND REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OF MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable provision in current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 304 of S. 3023, as amended, would add a new section \n     to chapter 43 of title 38 to require the head of each Federal \n     executive agency to provide training for human resources \n     personnel on the rights, benefits, and obligations of members \n     of the Armed Forces under USERRA and the administration of \n     USERRA by Federal executive agencies. It would require that \n     the training be developed and provided in consultation with \n     the Office of Personnel Management. The training would be \n     provided as often as specified by the Director of the Office \n     of Personnel Management in order to ensure that the human \n     resources personnel are kept fully and currently informed \n     about USERRA.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 313 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n report on the employment needs of native american veterans living on \n                              tribal lands\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable provision in current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 305 of S. 3023, as amended, would require a report \n     by the Secretary of Labor on efforts to address the \n     employment needs of Native American veterans living on tribal \n     lands.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 314 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n                             equity powers\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 4323(e) of title 38 courts may, in an action \n     brought against a State or private employer, use their full \n     equity powers to vindicate the rights or benefits of \n     individuals provided under USERRA.\n     House Bill\n       Section 2 of H.R. 6225, as amended, would amend section \n     4323(e) of title 38 to require that, in USERRA actions \n     brought against private or State employers, courts shall use \n     their equity powers in any case in which the court determines \n     it is appropriate.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 315 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\nwaiver of residency requirement for directors for veterans' employment \n                              and training\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 4103(a)(2) of title 38 requires that each State \n     Director of Veterans' Employment and Training (SDVET) have \n     been, at the time of appointment, a bona fide resident of the \n     State for at least two years.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 303 of S. 1315, as amended, would permit waiver of \n     a residency requirement for SDVETs.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 316 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\nmodification of special unemployment study to cover veterans of post 9/\n                          11 global operations\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 4110A of title 38 requires the Secretary of Labor, \n     through the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to submit a report \n     every two years on the employment and unemployment \n     experiences of Vietnam-era veterans, Vietnam-theater \n     veterans, special disabled veterans, and recently separated \n     veterans.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 304 of S. 1315, as amended, would update this \n     special unemployment study to focus on veterans of the Post-\n     9/11 Global Operations period and require an annual report.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 317 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate language, except that the report would be required \n     to include veterans of the Vietnam era, as well as\n\n[[Page S10451]]\n\n     veterans of the Post-9/11 Global Operations period.\n\n                     Subtitle B--Education Matters\n\n\n modification of period of eligibility for survivors' and dependents' \n educational assistance of certain spouses of individuals with service-\n          connected disabilities total and permanent in nature\n\n     Current Law\n       Under the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance \n     (DEA) program, VA provides up to 45 months of education \n     benefits to certain children or spouses of military \n     personnel. For instance, the spouse of a veteran or \n     servicemember may be eligible for benefits if the veteran \n     died, or is permanently and totally disabled, as the result \n     of a service-connected disability or if the veteran died from \n     any cause while a permanent and total service-connected \n     disability was in existence.\n       The spouse generally must use these education benefits \n     within ten years after the date on which the veteran dies or \n     is found to be permanently and totally disabled. However, if \n     the servicemember died while on active duty, the spouse may \n     use the education benefits during the twenty-year period \n     after the servicemember's death.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 311 of S. 3023, as amended, would extend from ten \n     years to twenty years the time within which the spouses of \n     certain severely injured veterans have to use their DEA \n     benefits.

The Commission also found \n     that ``the effectiveness of various vocational rehabilitation \n     programs is not well established, and the VA should undertake \n     an effort to determine which have the greatest long-term \n     success.'' In addition, the Commission recommended that ``VA \n     should develop financial incentives that would encourage \n     completion'' of vocational rehabilitation.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 306 of S. 3023, as amended, would require VA to \n     conduct a study that would identify the various factors that \n     may prevent or preclude veterans from successfully completing \n     their vocational rehabilitation plans. It would also require \n     identification of actions that the Secretary may take to \n     address such factors. Not later than 270 days after beginning \n     the study, VA would be required to submit to the Committees \n     on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives a report including the findings of the study \n     and any recommendations on actions that should be taken in \n     light of that study.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 333 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate language, except that it includes language to \n     specify that the study is required only to the extent that it \n     does not duplicate elements of a VA study or report released \n     during the one-year period after the date of enactment.\n\n\n    LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS VOCATIONAL \n                        REHABILITATION PROGRAMS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under chapter 31 of title 38 VA provides vocational \n     rehabilitation and employment services for certain veterans \n     with service-connected disabilities. VA currently collects \n     data that does not accurately demonstrate the long-term \n     results of participation in, or completion of, VA's \n     vocational rehabilitation and employment program. Typically, \n     VA knows how long a veteran spends in the various phases in \n     long-term training and the costs related to that \n     participation. However, VA does not collect data on earnings, \n     promotions, and other long-term employment-related data \n     following completion of the program. VA also does not collect \n     data on those who may qualify for the program but do not \n     complete the track of the program appropriate to their \n     situation.\n     House Bill\n       Section 1 of H.R. 3889 would require VA, subject to the \n     availability of appropriated funds, to conduct a longitudinal \n     study, over a period of at least 20 years, of a statistically \n     valid sample of certain groups of individuals who participate \n     in VA's vocational rehabilitation and employment program. The \n     groups of individuals would include those who begin \n     participating in the vocational rehabilitation program during \n     fiscal year 2009, those individuals who begin participating \n     in such a program during fiscal year 2011, and those \n     individuals who begin participating in such a program during \n     fiscal year 2014.\n       By not later than July 1 of each year covered by the study, \n     the Secretary would be required to submit to the Committees \n     on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives a report on the study during the preceding \n     year. The Secretary would be required to include in the \n     report any data necessary to determine the long-term outcomes \n     of the individuals participating in the program. In addition, \n     each report would be required to contain (1) the number of \n     individuals participating in vocational rehabilitation \n     programs who suspended participation in such a program during \n     the year covered by the report; (2) the average number of \n     months such individuals served on active duty; (3) the \n     distribution of disability ratings of such individuals; (4) \n     the types of other benefits administered by the Secretary \n     received by such individuals; (5) the types of social \n     security benefits received by such individuals; (6) any \n     unemployment benefits received by such individuals; (7) the \n     average number of months such individuals were employed \n     during the year covered by the report; (8) the average annual \n     starting and ending salaries of such individuals who were \n     employed during the year covered by the report; (9) the \n     number of such individuals enrolled in an institution of \n     higher learning; (10) the average number of academic credit \n     hours, degrees, and certificates obtained by such individuals \n     during the year covered by the report; (11) the average \n     number of visits such individuals made to VA medical \n     facilities during the year covered by the report; (12) the \n     average number of visits such individuals made to non-VA \n     medical facilities during the year covered by the report; \n     (13) the average annual income of such individuals; (14) the \n     average total household income of such individuals for the \n     year covered by the report; (15) the percentage of such \n     individuals who own their principal residences; and (16) the \n     average number of dependents of each such veteran.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 334 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House language, except that study participants would be \n     selected from those individuals who begin participating in \n     VA's vocational rehabilitation program during fiscal years \n     2010, 2012, and 2014.\n\n                      Title IV--Insurance Matters\n\n\nREPORT ON INCLUSION OF SEVERE AND ACUTE POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER \nAMONG CONDITIONS COVERED BY TRAUMATIC INJURY PROTECTION COVERAGE UNDER \n                  SERVICEMEMBERS' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1980A of title 38 provides traumatic injury \n     protection coverage under the Servicemembers Group Life \n     Insurance (SGLI) program. Traumatic Servicemembers Group Life \n     Insurance (TSGLI) provides coverage against qualifying losses \n     incurred as a result of a traumatic injury event. In the \n     event of a loss, VA will pay between $25,000 and $100,000 \n     depending on the severity of the qualifying loss. At present, \n     active duty and reserve component servicemembers with any \n     amount of SGLI coverage are automatically covered under \n     TSGLI. A premium (currently $1 monthly) is collected from \n     covered members to meet peacetime program expenses; the DOD \n     is required to fund TSGLI program costs associated with the \n     extra hazards of military service.\n       Subsection (b)(1) of section 1980A lists some qualifying \n     losses for which injured servicemembers are covered under \n     TSGLI, including, among others, complete loss of vision, \n     complete loss of hearing, amputation of a hand or foot and \n     the inability to carry out the activities of daily living \n     resulting from injury to the brain. PTSD is not currently \n     among the conditions classified as qualifying a loss.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 501 of S. 3023, as amended, would require VA, in \n     consultation with the Department of Defense, to submit a \n     report to Congress assessing the feasibility of and \n     advisability of including severe and acute PTSD among the \n     conditions covered by TSGLI. The report would be due to the \n     Committees not later than 180 days after enactment of this \n     bill.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 401 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n     TREATMENT OF STILLBORN CHILDREN AS INSURABLE DEPENDENTS UNDER \n                  SERVICEMEMBERS' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE\n\n     Current Law\n       In 2001, section 4 of the Veterans' Survivor Benefits \n     Improvements Act of 2001, Public Law 107-14, established a \n     program of family insurance coverage under SGLI through which \n     an SGLI-insured member's insurable dependents could also be \n     insured. Section 1965(10) of title 38 defines insurable \n     dependents as the member's spouse, and the member's child. \n     Section 101(4)(A) of title 38 defines the term child as a \n     person who is unmarried and under the age of 18 years; who \n     became permanently incapable of self support before attaining \n     the age of 18; or a dependent over the age of 18 that is \n     pursuing education or training at an approved institution. \n     Dependents over the age of 18 are considered a child until \n     they complete their education, or until they reach the age of \n     23. Under current law, stillborn children are not eligible \n     for coverage as insurable dependents under SGLI.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 502 of S. 3023, as amended, would amend section \n     1965(10) of title 38, so as to cover a servicemember's \n     ``stillborn child,'' as an insurable dependent under the SGLI \n     program. The Committees expect VA to issue regulations that \n     would define the term in a manner consistent with the 1992 \n     recommended reporting requirements of the Model State Vital \n     Statistics Act and Regulations as drafted by the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health \n     Statistics. The Model Act recommends a state reporting \n     requirement of fetal deaths involving fetuses weighing 350 \n     grams or more, if the weight is unknown, or 20 or more \n     completed weeks of gestation, calculated from the date last \n     normal menstrual began to the date of delivery.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 402 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n  OTHER ENHANCEMENTS OF SERVICEMEMBERS' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE\n\n     Current Law\n       SGLI is a VA-supervised life insurance program that \n     provides group coverage for members on active duty in the \n     uniformed services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and \n     Coast Guard), members of the Commissioned Corps of the United \n     States Public Health\n\n[[Page S10453]]\n\n     Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, Reserve and National Guard members, Reserve \n     Officer Training Corps members engaged in authorized \n     training, service academy cadets and midshipmen, Ready \n     Reserve and Retired Reserve members, and Individual Ready \n     Reserve members who are subject to involuntary recall to \n     active duty service. VA purchases a group policy on behalf of \n     participating members from a commercial provider. Since the \n     inception of the SGLI program in 1965, The Prudential \n     Insurance Company of America has been the provider. VA's FY \n     2009 budget submission projects that 2,342,000 individuals \n     will be covered under SGLI in FY 2009.\n       Full coverage under SGLI is provided automatically at the \n     maximum coverage amount when an individual begins covered \n     service. Partial coverage at prorated premium rates is \n     available for Reserve and National Guard members for active \n     and inactive duty training periods. To be covered in an \n     amount less than the maximum, or to decline coverage \n     altogether, a member must make a written election to that \n     effect. Coverage amounts may be reduced in multiples of \n     $10,000. A member may also name, at any time, one or more \n     beneficiaries of his or her choice. Decisions concerning \n     coverage amounts and designation of beneficiaries are made at \n     the sole discretion of members insured under SGLI.\n       The Veterans' Insurance Act of 1974, Public Law 93-289, \n     established a new program of post-separation insurance known \n     as Veterans Group Life Insurance (VGLI). Like SGLI, VGLI is \n     supervised by VA but administered by Prudential. VGLI \n     provides for the post-service conversion of SGLI to a \n     renewable term policy of insurance. Persons eligible for \n     full-time coverage include former servicemembers who were \n     insured full-time under SGLI and who were released from \n     active duty or the Reserves, Ready Reservists who have part-\n     time SGLI coverage and who incur certain disabilities during \n     periods of active or inactive duty training, and members of \n     the Individual Ready Reserve and Inactive National Guard. \n     Like SGLI, VGLI is issued in multiples of $10,000 up to the \n     maximum coverage amount, but in no case can VGLI coverage \n     exceed the amount of SGLI coverage a member had in force at \n     the time of separation from active duty service or the \n     Reserves.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 503 of S. 3023, as amended, includes numerous \n     amendments to SGLI.\n       Subsection (a) of section 503 would extend full-time and \n     family SGLI coverage to Individual Ready Reservists (IRRs), \n     those individuals referred to in section 1965(5)(C) of title \n     38. This group of individuals volunteer for assignment to a \n     mobilization category in the Individual Ready Reserve, as \n     defined in section 12304(i)(1) of title 10. The Veterans' \n     Survivor Benefits Improvement Act of 2001, Public Law 107-14, \n     provided SGLI coverage for Ready Reservists, referred to in \n     section 1965(5)(B), but not to IRRs.\n       Subsection (b) of section 503 would provide that a \n     dependent's SGLI coverage would terminate 120 days after the \n     date of the member's separation or release from service, \n     rather than 120 days after the member's SGLI terminates.\n       Subsection (c) of section 503 would clarify that VA has the \n     authority to set premiums for SGLI coverage for the spouses \n     of Ready Reservists based on the spouse's age.\n       Subsection (d) of section 503 would clarify that any person \n     guilty of mutiny, treason, spying, or desertion, or who, \n     because of conscientious objections, refuses to perform \n     service in the Armed Forces or refuses to wear the uniform of \n     the Armed Forces, forfeits all rights to VGLI.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 403 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n      ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF SERVICE DISABLED VETERANS' INSURANCE\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, the administrative costs of the Service-\n     Disabled Veterans Insurance program are paid for by the \n     Government from VA's General Operating Expenses account.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 102 of S. 1315 would allow administrative costs for \n     the S-DVI program to be paid for by premiums, as is done with \n     all other National Service Life Insurance sub-funds. This \n     would allow administrative costs to be provided from Veterans \n     Insurance and Indemnities and not General Operating Expenses \n     in Function 700 of the Budget of the United States \n     Government.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 404 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n                        Title V--Housing Matters\n\n\nTEMPORARY INCREASE IN MAXIMUM LOAN GUARANTY AMOUNT FOR CERTAIN HOUSING \n           LOANS GUARANTEED BY SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3703 of title 38 stipulates the maximum loan \n     guaranty amounts that VA will provide to veterans under its \n     home loan guaranty program. Public Law 108-454 increased VA's \n     maximum guaranty amount to 25 percent of the Freddie Mac \n     conforming loan limit determined under section 305(a)(2) of \n     the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act for a single \n     family residence, as adjusted for the year involved. The \n     Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (Stimulus Act), Public Law 110-\n     185, temporarily reset the maximum limits on home loans that \n     the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) may insure and that \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may purchase on the secondary \n     market to 125 percent of metropolitan-area median home \n     prices, but did so without reference to the VA home loan \n     program. This had the effect of raising the Fannie Mae, \n     Freddie Mac, and FHA limits to nearly $730,000, in the \n     highest cost areas, while leaving the then-VA limit of \n     $417,000 in place.\n       On July 30, 2008, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of \n     2008 was signed into law as Public Law 110-289. That law \n     provided a temporary increase in the maximum guaranty amount \n     for VA loans originated from July 30, 2008, through December \n     31, 2008, to the same level as provided in the Stimulus Act.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 201 of S. 3023, as amended, in a freestanding \n     provision, would apply the temporary increase in the maximum \n     guaranty amount, enacted in Public Law 110-289, until \n     December 31, 2011.\n     House Bill\n       Section 203 of H.R. 6832 would amend section 2201 of Public \n     Law 110-289 by striking ``December 31, 2008'' and inserting \n     ``December 31, 2011''.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 501 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n         REPORT ON IMPACT OF MORTGAGE FORECLOSURES ON VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable provision in current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 205 of S. 3023, as amended, would require VA to \n     report on the impact of the mortgage foreclosure crisis on \n     veterans and the adequacy of existing mechanisms available to \n     help veterans. The report would have to include four specific \n     elements: (1) a general assessment of the income of veterans \n     who have recently separated from the Armed Forces; (2) an \n     assessment of the effects of the length of the disability \n     adjudication process on the capacity of veterans to maintain \n     adequate or suitable housing; (3) a description of the extent \n     to which the provisions of the Servicemembers Civil Relief \n     Act currently protect veterans from mortgage foreclosure; and \n     (4) a description and assessment of the adequacy of the VA \n     home loan guaranty program in preventing foreclosure for \n     recently separated veterans. The report would be due to the \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives no later than December 31, 2009.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provisions.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 502 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n  REQUIREMENT FOR REGULAR UPDATES TO HANDBOOK FOR DESIGN FURNISHED TO \nVETERANS ELIGIBLE FOR SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING ASSISTANCE BY SECRETARY \n                          OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 2103 of title 38 authorizes VA to provide, without \n     cost, model plans and specifications of suitable housing \n     units to disabled veterans eligible for specially adapted \n     housing under chapter 21 of title 38. Pursuant to this \n     authority, the VA published, in April 1978, Pamphlet 26-13, \n     ``Handbook for Design: Specially Adapted Housing.''\n     House Bill\n       Section 1 of H.R. 5664 would amend section 2103 of title 38 \n     to direct the Secretary to update at least once every six \n     years the plans and specifications for specially adapted \n     housing furnished to veterans by VA.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 503 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n          ENHANCEMENT OF REFINANCING OF HOME LOANS BY VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 3703(a)(1)(A)(i)(IV) of title 38, the maximum \n     VA home loan guaranty limit for most loans in excess of \n     $144,000 is equal to 25 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming \n     loan limit for a single family home. Public Law 110-289 set \n     this value at approximately $182,437 through the end of 2008. \n     This means lenders making loans up to $729,750 will receive \n     at least a 25 percent guaranty, which is typically required \n     to place the loan on the secondary market. Under current law, \n     this does not include regular refinance loans.\n       Section 3703(a)(1)(B) of title 38 limits to $36,000 the \n     guaranty that can be used for a regular refinance loan. This \n     restriction means a regular refinance over $144,000 will \n     result in a lender not receiving 25 percent backing from VA. \n     In this situation, the lender is less likely to make the loan \n     to the veteran. This situation essentially precludes a\n\n[[Page S10454]]\n\n     veteran from being able to refinance his or her existing FHA \n     or conventional loan into a VA guaranteed loan if the loan is \n     greater than $144,000.\n       Under section 3710(b)(8) of title 38, VA is also precluded \n     from refinancing a loan if the homeowner does not have at \n     least ten percent equity in his or her home.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 202 of S. 3023, as amended, would increase the \n     maximum guaranty limit for refinance loans to the same level \n     as conventional loans, which is 25 percent of the Freddie Mac \n     conforming loan limit for single family home. It would also \n     increase the percentage of an existing loan that VA will \n     refinance under the VA home loan program from 90 percent to \n     95 percent.\n     House Bill\n       Section 302 of H.R. 6832 contains identical language as the \n     Senate bill with respect to increasing the maximum guaranty \n     limit for refinance loans. In addition, section 302 would \n     increase the percentage of an existing loan that VA will \n     refinance from 90 percent to 100 percent.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 504 of the Compromise Agreement includes the \n     language pertaining to the increase in the maximum guaranty \n     limit for refinance loans that appears in both the House and \n     the Senate bills and follows the House language with respect \n     to the equity requirement.\n\n\n       EXTENSION OF CERTAIN VETERANS HOME LOAN GUARANTY PROGRAMS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3707 of title 38 authorizes VA to conduct a \n     demonstration project that offers guaranties of adjustable \n     rate mortgages (ARMs), loans with interest rates that change, \n     and ``hybrid'' adjustable rate mortgages (hybrid ARMs), loans \n     that carry a fixed rate of interest for an initial period \n     followed by annual interest rate adjustments thereafter. VA \n     currently has authority to continue these demonstration \n     projects through the end of fiscal year 2008.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 203(a) of S. 3023, as amended, would amend section \n     3707 of title 38 to extend VA's ARM and hybrid ARM programs \n     through fiscal year 2012.\n     House Bill\n       Section 208 of H.R. 6832 contains identical language.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 505 of the Compromise Agreement includes this \n     language.\n\n                        Title VI--Court Matters\n\n\nTEMPORARY INCREASE IN NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED JUDGES OF THE UNITED STATES \n                  COURT OF APPEALS FOR VETERANS CLAIMS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, section 7253(a) of title 38, the United \n     States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) is limited \n     to seven active judges.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 401 of S. 3023, as amended, would temporarily \n     increase the number of active judges on the CAVC from seven \n     to nine, effective December 31, 2009. Effective January 1, \n     2013, no appointment could be made to Court if that \n     appointment would result in there being more judges of the \n     Court than the authorized number of judges of the Court \n     specified in current law.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 601 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language. It is the Committees' expectation that the next \n     Administration will begin vetting candidates for the \n     additional judgeships as soon as practicable so that by the \n     effective date of this provision, December 31, 2009, Congress \n     might begin considering nominations to the Court.\n\n\n      PROTECTION OF PRIVACY AND SECURITY CONCERNS IN COURT RECORDS\n\n     Current Law\n       Current law, section 7268(a) of title 38, provides that \n     ``all decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \n     and all briefs, motions, documents, and exhibits received by \n     the Court. . . shall be public records open to the inspection \n     of the public.'' Section 7268(b)(1) provides that ``[t]he \n     Court may make any provision which is necessary to prevent \n     the disclosure of confidential information, including a \n     provision that any such document or information be placed \n     under seal to be opened only as directed by the Court.''\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 402 of S. 3023, as amended, would amend section \n     7268 of title 38, so as to require the Court to prescribe \n     rules, in accordance with section 7264(a) of title 38, to \n     protect privacy and security concerns relating to the filing \n     of documents, and the public availability of such documents, \n     that are retained by CAVC or filed electronically. The rules \n     prescribed by the Court would be required to be consistent, \n     to the extent practicable, with rules that address privacy \n     and security issues throughout the Federal courts.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provisions.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 602 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n  RECALL OF RETIRED JUDGES OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \n                            VETERANS CLAIMS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 7257 of title 38, retiring CAVC judges make \n     an election whether to be recall eligible. If a judge chooses \n     to be recall eligible, the Chief Judge of the CAVC has the \n     authority to involuntarily recall that judge for up to 90 \n     days per calendar year or, with the consent of the judge, to \n     recall the judge for up to 180 days per calendar year. Under \n     section 7296 of title 38, a recall-eligible retired judge \n     receives annual pay equal to the annual salary of an active \n     judge (pay-of-the-office) and that salary level is not \n     impacted by how much recall service is performed during a \n     year.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 403 of S. 3023, as amended, would modify the \n     authorities for the recall of retired judges and the \n     retirement pay structure. This section would repeal the 180-\n     day limit on how many days per calendar year a recall-\n     eligible retired judge may voluntarily serve in recall \n     status. In addition, for judges appointed on or after the \n     date of enactment, it would create a three-tiered retirement \n     pay structure. Specifically, pay-of-the-office would be \n     reserved for judges who are actively serving, either as a \n     judge of the Court or as a retired judge serving in recall \n     status. When not serving in recall status, a recall-eligible \n     retired judge would receive the rate of pay applicable to \n     that judge as of the date the judge retired, as increased by \n     periodic cost-of-living adjustments. A retired judge who is \n     not recall eligible would receive the rate of pay applicable \n     to that judge at the time of retirement. Finally, section 403 \n     would exempt current and future recall-eligible retired \n     judges from involuntary recall once they have served an \n     aggregate of five years of recall service.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 603 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n ANNUAL REPORTS ON WORKLOAD OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \n                            VETERANS CLAIMS\n\n     Current Law\n       Chapter 72 of title 38 establishes the organization, \n     jurisdiction, and procedures governing the CAVC. That chapter \n     does not require the Court to provide Congress with annual \n     reports on its workload.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 404 of S. 3023, as amended, would add a section to \n     chapter 72 to establish an annual reporting requirement for \n     the CAVC. The CAVC would be required to submit to the \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives an annual report summarizing the workload of \n     the Court.\n       The information required to be in the report would include \n     the number of appeals, petitions, and applications for fees \n     under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) filed with the \n     Court. It would also include the total number of dispositions \n     by the Court as a whole, by the Clerk of the Court, by a \n     single judge, by multi-judge panels, and by the full Court \n     and the number of each type of disposition by the Court, \n     including settlement, affirmation, remand, vacation, \n     dismissal, reversal, grant, and denial. In addition, the \n     required information would include the median time from \n     filing an appeal to disposition by the Court as a whole, by \n     the Clerk of the Court, by a single judge, or by multiple \n     judges; the median time from the filing of a petition to \n     disposition by the Court; the median time from filing an EAJA \n     application to disposition by the Court; and the median time \n     from completion of the briefing requirements by the parties \n     to disposition by the Court. The report would also include \n     the number of oral arguments held by the Court; the number of \n     cases appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Federal Circuit; the number and status of appeals, petitions, \n     and EAJA applications pending at the end of the fiscal year; \n     the number of cases pending for more than 18 months at the \n     end of the fiscal year; and a summary of any service \n     performed by recalled retired judges during the fiscal year. \n     In addition, the Court would be required to provide an \n     assessment of the workload of each judge of the Court, \n     including consideration of the time required of each judge \n     for disposition of each type of case, the number of cases \n     reviewed by the Court, and the average workload of other \n     Federal judges.\n     House Bill\n       Section 201 of H.R. 5892, as amended, would add a section \n     to chapter 72 to establish an annual reporting requirement \n     for the CAVC. The CAVC would be required to submit to the \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives an annual report summarizing the workload of \n     the Court. The information required to be reported would \n     include the number of appeals filed; the number of petitions \n     filed; the number EAJA applications filed; the number and \n     type of dispositions; the median time from filing to \n     disposition; the number of oral arguments; the number and \n     status of pending appeals, petitions, and EAJA applications; \n     a summary of any service performed by recalled retired \n     judges; and the number of cases pending longer than 18 \n     months.\n\n[[Page S10455]]\n\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 604 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n ADDITIONAL DISCRETION IN IMPOSITION OF PRACTICE AND REGISTRATION FEES\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 7285 of title 38, the CAVC is authorized to \n     impose a periodic registration fee on individuals admitted to \n     practice before the Court. The maximum amount of any such fee \n     is capped at $30 per year. That amount is significantly lower \n     than other Federal courts generally charge.

It makes the authority to provide assistance \n     to the Paralympic Program of the USOC a four-year pilot \n     program instead of a permanent program and makes it clear \n     that the agreement entered into is between VA and United \n     States Paralympics, Inc. The Compromise Agreement makes it \n     clear that the United States Paralympics, Inc., shall \n     continue to seek private sponsorship and donors. It further \n     provides for the Comptroller General of the United States to \n     provide a report to the Congress after three years.\n\n                       Title VIII--Others Matters\n\n\nAUTHORITY FOR SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF CLAIMS OF THE UNITED STATES \nAGAINST INDIVIDUALS WHO DIED WHILE SERVING ON ACTIVE DUTY IN THE ARMED \n                                 FORCES\n\n     Current Law\n       In January 2008, VA disclosed that, in an attempt to \n     collect debts owed to VA, the Department had contacted the \n     estates of twenty-two servicemembers who died while serving \n     in either Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom. Under the relevant law in effect at that time, \n     section 5302 of title 38, any veteran or active duty \n     servicemember indebted to VA due to the overpayment or \n     erroneous payment of benefits was able to apply for a waiver \n     from VA so as to remove the obligation to pay the debt. \n     However, under that law, VA was required to notify the \n     beneficiary, or his or her estate if the beneficiary was \n     deceased, when an outstanding debt arose and to provide \n     information on the right to apply for a waiver.\n       In an attempt to address this situation, the Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act, 2008, Public Law 110-252, included a \n     provision that added a new section 5302A to title 38, which \n     prohibits VA from collecting all or any part of a debt \n     owed to VA by a servicemember or veteran who dies as the \n     result of an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of \n     duty while serving in a theater of combat operations in a \n     war or in combat against a hostile force during a period \n     of hostilities after September 11, 2001. The Secretary is \n     required to determine that termination of collection is in \n     the best interest of the United States.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 601 of S. 3023, as amended, would amend section \n     3711 of title 31 so as to grant VA discretionary authority to \n     suspend or terminate the collection of debts owed to it by \n     individuals who die while serving on active duty in the Armed \n     Forces. The authority to suspend collection would cover all \n     individuals who die while serving on active duty as a member \n     of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard \n     during a period when the Coast Guard is operating as a \n     service in the Navy.\n       Section 601 of S. 3023, as amended, also includes a \n     freestanding provision that would permit VA to provide an \n     equitable refund to any estate from which it collected a debt \n     that it otherwise would have waived had this provision been \n     in effect at the time. VA would have the discretion to \n     determine in which cases, if any, the use of this authority \n     would be appropriate.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 801 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n   THREE-YEAR EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY TO CARRY OUT INCOME VERIFICATION\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 6103(l)(7)(D)(viii) of title 26 authorizes the \n     release of certain income information by the Internal Revenue \n     Service (IRS) or the Social Security Administration (SSA) to \n     VA for the purposes of verifying the incomes of applicants \n     for VA needs-based benefits, including pensions for wartime \n     veterans and compensation for Individual Unemployability. \n     Section 5317(g) of title 38 provides VA with temporary \n     authority to obtain and use this information in order to \n     ensure that those receiving benefits under these income-\n     programs are not earning a greater annual income than the law \n     permits. This temporary authority will expire on September \n     30, 2008.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 603 of S. 3023, as amended, would extend VA's \n     authority to obtain income information from the IRS or the \n     SSA until September 30, 2011.\n     House Bill\n       Section 206 of H.R. 6832 would extend VA's authority to \n     obtain income verification from the IRS or the SSA until \n     September 30, 2010.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 802 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\nMAINTENANCE, MANAGEMENT, AND AVAILABILITY FOR RESEARCH OF ASSETS OF AIR \n                           FORCE HEALTH STUDY\n\n     Current Law\n       Legislation enacted as section 714 of the John Warner \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, \n     Public Law 109-364, authorized the Air Force to transfer \n     custody of the data and biological specimens to the Medical \n     Follow-Up Agency (MFUA). There is no provision in current law \n     for the maintenance and management of the assets authorized \n     to be transferred.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 805 of S. 1315, as amended, would ensure that the \n     assets from the Air Force Health Study (AFHS) transferred to \n     the MFUA are maintained, managed and made available to \n     researchers. In order to ensure that sufficient funds are \n     made available for this purpose, funding in the amount of \n     $1,200,000 would be made available from VA accounts available \n     for Medical and Prosthetic Research in each fiscal year from \n     2008 through 2011. In addition, funding from the same source \n     would be provided in the amount of $250,000 for each year to \n     conduct additional research using the assets of the AFHS. \n     Finally a report would be provided to the Congress by March \n     31, 2011, concerning the feasibility and advisability of \n     conducting additional research using these assets or \n     disposing of them.\n       In the late 1970's, Congress urged the DOD to conduct an \n     epidemiologic study of veterans of ``Operation Ranch Hand,'' \n     the military units responsible for aerial spraying of \n     herbicides during the Vietnam War. In response, the AFHS was \n     initiated in 1982 to examine the effects of herbicide \n     exposure and health, mortality, and reproductive outcomes in \n     veterans of Operation Ranch Hand. The study is noteworthy for \n     the amount of data and biological specimens collected. It \n     cost over $143 million and was concluded in 2006.\n       The Senate bill would require VA to provide funding during \n     fiscal years 2008 through 2011 for the purposes recommended \n     by IOM in the Disposition of the AFHS report.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 803 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\nNATIONAL ACADEMIES STUDY ON RISK OF DEVELOPING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AS A \nRESULT OF CERTAIN SERVICE IN THE PERSIAN GULF WAR AND POST-9/11 GLOBAL \n                          OPERATIONS THEATERS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, veterans gain eligibility for disability \n     benefits by demonstrating a link between their disability and \n     their active military, naval, or air service. To establish \n     such a link, the veteran must show, generally, that his or \n     her disability resulted from an injury or disease that was \n     incurred or aggravated during the time of military service.\n       In addition to disabilities that can be directly linked to \n     service, certain diagnosed diseases are presumed, as a matter \n     of law, to be service-connected if they manifest under \n     conditions specified by statute. For example, section 1112, \n     title 38, provides a presumption for certain chronic diseases \n     if manifested to a degree of disability of 10 percent or more \n     within one year of separation from service, for certain \n     tropical diseases if manifested to\n\n[[Page S10456]]\n\n     a degree of disability of 10 percent or more, generally, \n     within one year of separation from service, and for active \n     tuberculosis or Hansen's disease if manifested to a degree of \n     disability of 10 percent or more within three years of \n     separation from service.\n       In 1962, Public Law 87-645 extended the period of time \n     after separation from service that a diagnosis of multiple \n     sclerosis may be presumed to be service-connected from three \n     to seven years for veterans with wartime service.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 806 of S. 1315, as amended, would require VA to \n     enter into a contract with the IOM to conduct a comprehensive \n     epidemiological study to identify any increased risk of \n     developing multiple sclerosis, and other diagnosed \n     neurological diseases, as a result of service in the \n     Southwest Asia theater of operations or in the Post 9/11 \n     Global Operations theaters. The Southwest Asia theater of \n     operations is defined in section 3.3317 of title 38, Code of \n     Federal Regulations. The Post 9/11 Global Operations theater \n     is defined as Afghanistan, Iraq, or any other theater for \n     which the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal is \n     awarded for service.\n       The mandated study would examine the incidence and \n     prevalence of diagnosed neurological diseases, including \n     multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and brain cancers, \n     as well as central nervous abnormalities, in members of the \n     Armed Forces who served during the Persian Gulf War period \n     and Post-9/11 Global Operations period. The study would also \n     collect information on possible risk factors, such as \n     exposure to pesticides and other toxic substances.

Mr. President, as the ranking Republican of the Finance\n\n[[Page S10457]]\n\nCommittee acting on behalf of a number of Republicans on the Finance \nCommittee, I am objecting to discharging S. 3656 from the committee. \nWhile there are several provisions in the bill I personally strongly \nsupport, there are many problems in this bill and questions that have \nbeen raised about this bill. In addition, this bill has not come before \nthe committee and the issues it addresses have not had the benefit of \nhearings or any committee action. As a result, I cannot support this \nbill being discharged from the committee at this time.\n  One of the provisions in S. 3656 that I personally support would \ndelay implementing provisions of a CMS proposed rule that would change \nconditions of participation for rural health clinics and decertify \nclinics that are no longer in nonurbanized areas. The provision would \nalso delay the proposed changes to the existing payment methodology for \nrural health clinics and Federally qualified health centers.\n  The CMS proposed rule would impose new location requirements for RHCs \nand require that clinics be located in a nonurbanized area, as defined \nby the U.S. Census Bureau, as well as meet shortage area designation \nrequirements. Only new RHCs applying for the program are currently \nrequired to meet these criteria, but the CMS proposal would extend \nthese requirements to already certified RHCs. According to CMS, about \n500 of the approximately 3,700 RHCs operating today may not meet these \nrequirements. Rural clinics in Iowa and elsewhere could also be \nseverely impacted by the CMS proposed payment changes since RHC costs \nin Iowa and other States are already higher than the existing Medicare \nreimbursement cap.\n  Iowa is currently in the throes of a growing shortage of physicians, \nespecially in the more rural areas of the State, due to inequitable \ngeographic adjustments in physician payment that result in Iowa \nphysicians receiving some of the lowest Medicare payments in the \ncountry even though they provide some of the highest quality care. \nThese geographic payment disparities, which discriminate against rural \nareas, have further exacerbated the problems of access to care for \nbeneficiaries in rural areas.\n  The CMS proposed rule could have a severe adverse impact on a number \nof rural health clinics in Iowa, including many located in counties \nthat have been declared disaster areas from the severe flooding Iowa \nsuffered earlier this year. If the CMS rule is finalized as proposed, \nrural health clinics in Iowa and elsewhere may be forced to close their \ndoors, even though they have served rural populations very well for \nmany years, leaving Iowa with fewer physicians and some patients with \nlittle access to primary care and other critical medical services.\n  As you can see, these provisions for rural health centers are \nimportant, which makes it all the more disappointing that my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle did not work together with us to develop a \nbipartisan bill and that the committee is not in a position at this \ntime to consider these important issues properly. I am very pleased, \nhowever, that a key issue for rural health centers in the proposal has \nalready been addressed through a provision that was included in the \nHealth Care Safety Net Act. That provision changes the CMS \ncertification period for shortage area designations from 3 to 4 years \nin order to align the CMS certification period for shortage area \ndesignations with the Health Resources and Services Administration's, \nHRSA's, designation review period. I want to thank Senators Orrin \nHatch, Pat Roberts, Gordon Smith, Tom Harkin, Ron Wyden, Kent Conrad, \nand John Barasso for championing the resolution of this important issue \nand Senator Max Baucus for working together with me to facilitate its \ninclusion in the Health Care Safety Net Act. And, of course, I want to \nagain thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi for working with us on this \nissue. Thanks to this bipartisan collaborative effort, that bill with \nthe RHC provision in it has now passed both Chambers and is on its way \nto being signed into law.\n  Another provision in S. 3656 would prevent the application of a CMS \npolicy to phase out a payment adjustment for indirect medical \neducation, IME, under the Medicare capital Inpatient Prospective \nPayment System, IPPS. Currently, teaching hospitals receive this upward \npayment adjustment under the capital IPPS. CMS announced in the fiscal \nyear 2008 Medicare Hospital IPPS final rule that they would begin to \nphase out the IME adjustment for capital IPPS in fiscal year 2009.\n  As the former chair and currently the ranking member of the Senate \nFinance Committee, it has long been one of my priorities to ensure \nMedicare payments are both accurate and equitable. I question whether \nthis proposed change to IME payments would further this goal, which \nmany of us share.\n  The appropriateness of the IME capital IPPS adjustment has been \nanalyzed extensively not only by CMS, but also by the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission, MedPAC, which advises Congress on Medicare payment \nissues. CMS has documented relatively high and continued positive \nmargins for teaching hospitals under the capital IPPS compared to \nnonteaching hospitals. In fact, from 1998 through 2006, teaching \nhospitals had an aggregate positive capital IPPS margin of 11.2 percent \nwhile nonteaching hospitals had an aggregate capital IPPS margin of \n-0.8 percent. Based on those figures, it leaves open the question of \nwhether the proposed change to IME payments is not justified. Certainly \nthis is something the Finance Committee should explore further.\n  S. 3656 also proposes to establish a moratorium on a CMS rule \nregarding Medicaid payments for hospital outpatient services. Earlier \nthis year, Congress placed moratoriums on 6 other proposed Medicaid \nregulations. Just as I opposed those moratoriums, I strongly oppose \nthis one as well. The Finance Committee has not held the first hearing \nas to why a delay in this regulation is justified. The Finance \nCommittee has not considered whether payments currently being made by \nsome states to hospitals for outpatient services are being made \nconsistent with the statutory rules governing the upper payment limit. \nThe CMS regulation in question was intended to clarify what payments \nfrom States to hospitals are allowable. We should not simply place a \nmoratorium on this regulation without the committee properly \ninvestigating the issue first. Medicaid is a critical program for \nchildren, pregnant women, the disabled, and the elderly. We have a \nresponsibility to the people who depend on the program to make sure \nthat funds are being appropriately spent. Placing a moratorium on these \nregulations without fully exploring these issues in the committee first \nis not consistent with that responsibility.\n\n  This bill also would intervene in a dispute between CMS and the State \nof California. The State of California has been seeking approval of an \nextension of their family planning waiver for 6 years. For 6 years, CMS \nhas been urging California to improve their collection of Social \nSecurity numbers and citizenship documentation for women enrolled in \nthe program. Given the concerns that have been raised about noncitizens \nreceiving benefits to which they are not entitled, this provision \nraises a number of serious concerns. This bill would essentially \nrequire CMS to approve of the extension of California's waiver without \nrequiring California to fulfill their obligation to improve their \nprocess of ensuring that people who receive benefits are actually \neligible for those benefits.\n  In addition, this bill does nothing to assist ``tweener hospitals,'' \nwhich are hospitals that are too large to be critical access hospitals \nbut too small to be financially viable under Medicare's prospective \npayment systems. I consider this to be a high priority because so many \nseniors in Iowa rely on these tweener hospitals for vitally needed \nhealth care services in rural areas of our State. If the Senate is \ngoing to consider Medicare legislation that is along the size and scope \nof the provisions proposed in S. 3656, including provisions to address \nthe problems tweener hospitals face is a must.\n  I understand that legislation is often the art of compromise. We \ncan't always get everything we want in every bill and keep everything \nwe dislike out. It is a balance. This bill is currently pending before \nthe Finance Committee, and it raises significant issues of Medicare and \nMedicaid payment policies. The Finance Committee has not held hearings \non these issues nor has it given these important issues proper \nconsideration. Without allowing the\n\n[[Page S10458]]\n\ncommittee process to work, this bill has not been subject to the \nrigorous analysis and debate that the legislative process should \nrequire to avoid unintended consequences and poor decisionmaking. This \nprocess should be permitted to take place before legislation of this \nmagnitude is sent to the full Senate. That is the committee's role and \nit is an important one.\n  If the full Senate were to routinely bypass the Finance Committee and \nconsider major Medicare bills like this one that have not been \nprocessed by the members of the committee, then nothing would prevent \nthe Senate from legislating on other Medicare and Medicaid issues \nwithout the benefit of hearings or committee action. Occasionally, the \ncommittee does process extensions of current law and smaller, generally \ntechnical bills through a more informal committee process, but it is a \ncommittee process nonetheless. If the committee is routinely bypassed \nentirely and not allowed to perform its vital role in the legislative \nprocess, it would be almost impossible to cope with the number and \nassortment of Medicare, Medicaid, and other issues that would come \ndirectly to the Senate floor in bills like S. 3656. To avoid that \nresult is why the Senate has committees in the first place.\n  Just an initial review of this legislation today produces more \nquestions than answers and many obvious and serious concerns. It is \ndisappointing that some of the important provisions in this bill, like \nthe rural health center provisions and IME policy, are packaged into a \nbill that has not been presented in a timely way or brought before the \ncommittee for appropriate consideration, debate, and amendment. Just a \nquick review of this bill today quickly reveals, in any case, that both \nin terms of process and policy, this bill does not sufficiently achieve \na balance I think is necessary, and I must, on behalf of myself and \nother members of the committee, object to discharging S. 3656 from \ncommittee for consideration by the full Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10458-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NUCLEAR POWER\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I don't want to repeat what has already \nbeen said by Senator Voinovich recently, but I do want to explain why I \nam cosponsoring legislation designed to tackle in a comprehensive way \nthe biggest issue still outstanding in our efforts to revitalize \nnuclear power for this Nation, that being how we handle the waste.\n  I also want to talk about the retirement of the ranking member of the \nSenate Energy Committee, Senator Pete Domenici, who I will so deeply \nmiss in the future.\n  Concerning the nuclear bill, I am cosponsoring the U.S. Nuclear Fuel \nManagement Corporation Establishment Act that has been crafted by \nSenator Voinovich, with Senator Sessions and a number of other \nSenators, and I have already cosponsored the SMART Act, which was \ncrafted by the ranking member of the Energy Committee, Senator \nDomenici, and cosponsored by Senator Sessions and others, since the two \nbills work together to set up the policy and the management structure \nto improve how we handle the waste that nuclear powerplants generate.\n  While it is obviously too late in this session of Congress for either \nbill to advance, I want to say that I am certainly intending to help \nreintroduce both bills next year and in working next session to merge \nthem into a comprehensive plan to recycle and then properly store the \nremaining waste that results from nuclear power production.\n  I am interested in working on these bills because I care about \nreducing greenhouse gases. And nuclear power is the best proven \ntechnology to produce power for this country without producing any \ncarbon emissions. For anyone serious about tackling carbon emissions, \nfinding a way to grow the next generation of nuclear power is vital.\n  Today nuclear energy provides about 20 percent of the Nation's \nelectricity. As Senator Voinovich may have mentioned those 104 \noperating powerplants save America from producing about 681 million \nmetric tons a year of carbon dioxide. If we are going to deal with \nglobal warming, we must find a way not just to keep nuclear power \ngoing, but also growing to help meet this Nation's growing thirst for \nelectricity.\n  I was in France in late June and toured the French nuclear waste \nrecycling facilities at LaHague. Recycling allows you to gain twice as \nmuch nuclear power from a given amount of uranium ore. More \nimportantly, it cuts substantially the amount and the half-life, and in \nsome cases, the toxicity of the waste that you later have to store. \nThat is important for the environment.\n  In these two bills, the Nuclear Fuel Management Corp. will set up a \nGovernment corporation to take authority to manage spent nuclear fuel \nand provide both interim storage, the development of geologic \nrepositories, such as the Yucca Mountain facility currently under \nconsideration, and also to handle the construction and operation of any \nreprocessing and fuel fabrication facilities.\n  The SMART bill is designed to further the process of siting and \nadvancing the construction of up to two reprocessing plants, since it \nwould help to encourage cities in this country to welcome such plants. \nThese bills, perhaps pared with one introduced last year to remove some \npotential regulatory hurdles to construction and opening of a Yucca \nMountain repository, would effectively amount to a comprehensive \nsolution to the waste issue. They would be the final pieces to the \npuzzle. That is the case because of the efforts of Senator Pete \nDomenici.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10458-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10458-S10459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PETE DOMENICI\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at the risk of embarrassing him, I want \nto take a moment to say how vital Senator Domenici has been in solving \nmost of the nuclear puzzle. He really led the rebirth of the nuclear \nindustry and I want to say how much I will miss him since he has been a \nprime mover in the effort to bring about a new nuclear age in this \ncountry.\n  As most of you know Senator Domenici has served 36 years in the \nSenate. But some of you may not know that he gave up a promising career \nin baseball to become a public servant. He started playing when he was \n10, eventually pitching for a minor league team called the Albuquerque \nDukes. But he left baseball to become a math and science teacher at \nGarfield Junior High in his native State of New Mexico, later went onto \nlaw school and ran for the U.S. Senate in 1972. And he's been here ever \nsince.\n  About a dozen years ago the Senator realized that this Nation \ndesperately needed a new source of electricity. He realized that there \nare higher uses for high-priced natural gas than to burn it for power \ngeneration, and that until carbon capture and storage can be perfected \nand widely practiced that the expansion of coal-fired power might have \nenvironmental drawbacks. So he crafted the forerunner of policies that \ntoday make up the Nuclear Power 2010 program, which is designed to have \nthe Government partner with industry to approve the design and speed \nthe licensing of the next generation of power plants that absolutely \npreclude the type of radiation accident that happened three decades ago \nat Three Mile Island.\n  He has been the sponsor of the loan guarantees, the architect of \nreauthorizing a responsible liability program and the person most \nresponsible for harnessing the research capacities of America to \nbreathe life into the research and nuclear construction sectors. One \nnews outlet called him ``the nuclear renaissance man.'' And he is \nrecognized by all as the driving force behind the industry's \nresurgence.\n  But he has done so much more. His work on the Energy Policy Act of \n2005 and on last year's Energy Independence and Security Act were \nlandmarks in bipartisan legislating. He helped renewable and \nalternative energy, from wind and solar to biomass, and especially \nbiofuels to develop, helping create Clean Renewable Energy Bonds to pay \nfor the construction of renewable energy plants. During the bills he \nrefereed more policy disputes and generated more compromises than I \nhave time to mention.\n  But he also was the sponsor of so much other landmark legislation \nduring his storied career. One bill finally passed the Senate earlier \nthis week to require parity for mental health treatment benefits. As \nSenate budget chairman, he helped set up the Nation's budgeting system, \nwhich was still\n\n[[Page S10459]]\n\nworking well when he assumed the chairmanship of the Energy Committee \nin 2003.\n  Pete Domenici's legacy has inspired so many of us and his retirement \nwill leave some pretty big shoes for us all to fill. I will miss the \nSenator's smile, as well as his lighthearted and joyful presence. He is \nknown as a man, who is firm in his convictions, but gracious in his \nnegotiations. He is an example of a true statesman who has served his \ncountry well.\n  I will truly miss him. I could say a lot more, but I clearly am out \nof time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10459-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GULF COAST HOSPITAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, Senator Ensign and I would like to engage \nin a brief colloquy with the distinguished chairman and ranking member \nof the Finance Committee, Senators Baucus and Grassley, regarding \nlegislation we have sponsored to fix an archaic provision in the Tax \nCode that adversely affects employees and businesses across the \ncountry. Under a little-noticed provision added in 1989, cell phones, \nblackberries, and similar devices are treated as ``listed property.'' \nAs a result, employees must keep detailed records of all calls made on \ntheir employer-issued cell phones--indicating whether they are personal \nor business-related--or have the value of the phone and phone service \nincluded as taxable income.\n  The current law provision was added at a time when cell phones were \nconsidered a luxury item. Now, they are a common and necessary part of \nconducting everyday business. Imposing strict substantiation \nrequirements on the business use of cell phones and blackberries is \nburdensome and highly impractical given their frequent use in a fast-\npaced global environment. To protect tens of thousands of employees and \ntheir employers from potential audits and tax liability, we should pass \nlegislation as soon as possible next year to fix this problem.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I want to join my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts and express my hope that legislation can be passed early \nnext year to fix the out-dated tax treatment of employer-provided cell \nphones. The bill he and I have introduced has broad bipartisan support \nwith over 60 cosponsors. Similar legislation has already passed the \nHouse. And both Treasury and the IRS are supportive of the fix. Thus, \nSenator Kerry and I would like to ask the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Finance Committee, for their help in passing this \nlegislation early next year.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I want to thank my distinguished colleagues from \nMassachusetts and Nevada for raising this issue with us. I want to \nassure them that we are aware of this problem and we will work with our \ncolleagues to consider legislation to eliminate the burden for \nemployees and employers as early as possible.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I also want to join the chairman and express my intent \nto have the committee consider legislation that addresses this problem \nas soon as we can. We should not be imposing unreasonable rules on \nemployees' use of cell phones and blackberries.\n  Mr. KERRY. Senator Ensign and I want to thank the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee for their \nwillingness to work with us to address this important problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10459-3", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10459-S10460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OFFSHORE TAX HAVENS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will ask to have printed in the Record a \ntimely opinion piece that was written by Mr. Robert M. Morgenthau, the \nDistrict Attorney of the County of New York, and appeared in the Wall \nStreet Journal on Tuesday, September 30. Since the 1960s, Mr. \nMorgenthau has been a leader in the fight against the abuse of offshore \nhavens for fraud, money laundering, tax evasion and a host of other \nillicit activities.\n  As Congress votes on a plan to restore the soundness and credibility \nof our financial system, Mr. Morgenthau's column correctly reminds us \nof a factor that contributed significantly to this financial crisis--\nthe activities of financial institutions that have hidden away \ntrillions of dollars in offshore tax havens and that claim to be \ndomiciled in those offshore havens, when all of their key personnel and \noperations are here in the United States. Mr. Morgenthau points out \nthat this charade places these trillions of dollars, and the activities \nof the entities that control them, outside the oversight and \nsupervisory control of the U.S. financial regulatory system. As the \nhearings held by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, have demonstrated, this charade is also a breeding ground for \ntax abuse, draining our system of billions of dollars in needed tax \nrevenues.\n  In his article, Mr. Morgenthau reminds us that the supervisory and \nsafety mechanisms that have been established to protect our citizens \nand their savings are dependent on transparency and strong regulatory \nvigilance. So is our tax system. When funds are hidden in offshore \njurisdictions that promote secrecy and weak regulatory standards, and \nthe funds are controlled by entities that claim they are not subject to \nour regulatory system, the safety net that we have established cannot \nfunction to provide our citizens the security it was designed to offer.\n  While we have voted on a plan to alleviate the current crisis, we \nhave a lot more work to do to rectify the root causes of this problem. \nAs Mr. Morgenthau points out, the abuse of offshore jurisdictions by \nfinancial institutions must be high on that agenda, and I look forward \nto addressing this matter in the next Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the opinion piece to \nwhich I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 30, 2008]\n\n                 Too Much Money Is Beyond Legal Reach'\n\n                       (By Robert M. Morgenthau)\n\n       A major factor in the current financial crisis is the lack \n     of transparency in the activities of the principal players in \n     the financial markets. This opaqueness is compounded by vast \n     sums of money that lie outside the jurisdiction of U.S. \n     regulators and other supervisory authorities.\n       The $700 billion in Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's \n     current proposed rescue plan pales in comparison to the \n     volume of dollars that now escape the watchful eye, not only \n     of U.S. regulators, but from the media and the general public \n     as well.\n       There is $1.9 trillion, almost all of it run out of the New \n     York metropolitan area, that sits in the Cayman Islands, a \n     secrecy jurisdiction. Another $1.5 trillion is lodged in four \n     other secrecy jurisdictions.\n       Following the Great Depression, we bragged about a newly \n     installed safety net that was suppose to save us from such a \n     hard economic fall in the future. However, the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve System, the \n     Comptroller of the Currency and others have ignored trillions \n     of dollars that have migrated to offshore jurisdictions that \n     are secretive in nature and outside the safety net--beyond \n     the reach of U.S. regulators.\n       We should have learned a long time ago that totally \n     unsupervised markets, whether trading in tulips or subprime \n     mortgages, will sooner rather than later get into trouble. We \n     don't have to look back very far in history to understand \n     this.\n       Long Term Capital Management, a hedge fund ``based'' in \n     Greenwich, Conn., but composed of eight partnerships \n     chartered in the Caymans, was supposed to be the wunderkind \n     of the financial world. At its peak in the late 1990s, its \n     gross holdings were valued\n\n[[Page S10460]]\n\n     at $1.8 trillion. But, regrettably, its liabilities exceeded \n     its assets and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had to \n     step in and rescue it when the value of its assets plummeted.\n       Most recently, two Bear Stearns hedge funds, based in the \n     Cayman Islands, but run out of New York, collapsed without \n     any warning to its investors. Because of the location of \n     these financial institutions--in a secrecy jurisdiction, \n     outside the U.S. safety net of appropriate supervision--their \n     desperate financial condition went undetected until it was \n     too late.\n       Of course, BCCI Overseas, which was part of the then \n     largest bankruptcy in history, was also ``chartered'' in the \n     Caymans.\n       We have to learn from our mistakes. Any significant \n     infusion to the financial system must carry assurances that \n     it will not add to the pool of money beyond the safety net \n     and supervisory authority of the United States. Moreover, the \n     trillions of dollars currently offshore and invested in funds \n     that could impact the American economy must be brought under \n     appropriate supervision.\n       If Congress and Treasury fail to bring under U.S. \n     supervisory authority the financial institutions and \n     transactions in secrecy jurisdictions, there will be no \n     transparency with the inevitable consequences of the lack of \n     transparency--namely, a repeat of the unbridled greed and \n     recklessness that we now face. Because of the monolithic \n     character of world financial markets, a default crisis \n     anywhere becomes a default crisis everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10460-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise with great sadness and a heavy heart \nto remember a young man and a great American. Army 1LT Thomas Brown, a \nnative of Shelton, CT, was killed in action in Iraq a few days ago--the \n41st citizen of my State to lose his life in the Iraq or Afghanistan \nwars. He was 26 years of age.\n  We honor the sacrifice of all our men and women who give their lives \nserving this country. But it is never easy to lose someone so young--\nespecially someone for whom life so clearly had much more in store.\n  As a teenager, Lieutenant Brown attended Notre Dame Catholic High \nSchool in Fairport, where it has been said he was all but inseparable \nfrom his twin brother, Timothy. He was an honor student and an athlete.\n  He would graduate from George Mason University in 2004, and like so \nmany young people, he was eager to serve his country--to give something \nback. He attended Ranger school, Airborne school and officer candidate \nschool.\n  This young man would go on to serve in the Army's 2nd Battalion, 6th \nInfantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Armored Division. \nThere, I understand, Lieutenant Brown earned great respect and \nadmiration from his fellow soldiers.\n  Lieutenant Brown was known among his comrades as an officer who led \nby example, not by order, and was immensely proud to serve his country \nin the U.S. Army. He was also known for his passionate love of the \nBoston Red Sox, and for his truly generous spirit.\n  In recognition of his heroic service and sacrifice, Thomas Brown was \nposthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart.\n  One of the saddest facts in this young soldier's passing is that he \nwas due to take leave and return home in 3 short weeks to visit his \nfriends, family and girlfriend. He wanted nothing more than the chance \nto visit home.\n  Timothy Brown said recently of his brother: ``He wanted to make a \ndifference.''\n  Let the record show that 1LT Thomas J. Brown, in his 26 short years \non this Earth, did make a difference--and that we are forever grateful \nfor the remarkable contributions he made to the country he did so love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10460-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10460-S10461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                U.S.-INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I want to convey some brief remarks \nregarding my views on the United States-India civil nuclear cooperation \nagreement. I cast a ``yes'' vote on this agreement, but not without \nsome serious reservations regarding the likely damage this agreement \nwill do to the global nuclear nonproliferation regime.\n  I had the opportunity to visit India earlier this year, spending a \nday meeting senior government leaders in New Delhi and another day in \nHyderabad, where I witnessed first hand the dynamic entrepreneurism \nthat has recently transformed India into an economic powerhouse, albeit \nwith still extreme poverty. Let me be clear: The United States and \nIndia, sharing a common commitment to democracy and personal freedoms, \nare natural allies. I congratulate President Bush for building upon the \ninitial steps taken by his predecessor, President Clinton, in nurturing \ncloser ties between our two great nations and laying the building \nblocks for an enduring strategic partnership.\n  India's exclusion from global trade in civil nuclear energy, a direct \nconsequence of its 1974 nuclear weapons test utilizing equipment and \nmaterials imported for a civilian energy program, represented a \ncontinuing thorn to an otherwise blossoming United States-Indian \nrelationship. Right or wrong, it was always the United States that was \nviewed as the leading advocate of the firewall between India and global \nnuclear trade--even though India never signed the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, NPT. So I understand why a resolution to this \nissue was necessary if the United States and India were to achieve a \ngenuine partnership that could endure in coming decades.\n  My strongest criticism of the United States-India nuclear cooperation \nagreement is that, in exchange for a historic exception to the \nprinciple that those states that refuse to abide by the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty cannot enjoy the fruits of global civilian nuclear \ntrade, the United States did not ask enough in return from the Indian \nGovernment. We could have pressed New Delhi to sign the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty and forswear all future nuclear weapons tests. But we \ndid not. We could have urged New Delhi to agree to a national \nmoratorium on production of nuclear fissile material, linking that \nmoratorium to a similar pledge by Pakistan. But we did not.\n  I worry over the message this agreement sends to states like North \nKorea and Iran. Are their leaders to believe that, with the passage of \ntime, one day the international community will also accept their \nnuclear weapons programs as a de facto reality and move to accommodate \nsuch programs? How do we convince the international community to \ndemonstrate solidarity against Iran's violations of the NPT while \ngiving a pass to India's refusal to abide by this very same treaty? Of \ncourse I am not equating the two states--India is a democratic regime, \na friend of the United States, and a force for stability in the world. \nThere is no comparison. But I am concerned when we begin to divide the \nworld into ``good'' proliferators and ``bad'' proliferators--instead, \nwe need to send the message that all nuclear proliferation harms our \nsecurity and increases the odds that a nuclear weapon will one day be \nused and kill millions.\n  Nevertheless, at every step of the process over the last 3 years, \nadministration officials often appeared excessively sensitive to the \nneed to smooth over domestic political concerns in India while \ndownplaying concerns expressed by nonproliferation experts. So I \ncongratulate Chairman Biden and Ranking Member Lugar for their \npersistence in ensuring this final agreement is a real improvement over \ninitial administration proposals. The legislation before us clarifies \nsome of the deliberate ambiguities contained within the Article 123 \nUnited States-India agreement and the international exemption for India \nprovided by the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\n  The United States-India civil nuclear initiative is a flawed \nagreement. Nonetheless, I am casting a ``yes'' vote for this \nlegislation for two primary reasons. First, in many respects, the \ndamage to the global non-proliferation regime has already been done. \nThe decision taken last month by the Nuclear Suppliers Group to provide \na universal exemption to permit India to participate in civil nuclear \ntrade means that, even if the United States Congress were to reject \nthis agreement, other nations like Russia and France are free to \ninitiate their own civilian agreements with India. The net result of a \nUnited States rejection would likely only ensure that United States \ncompanies--and United States workers--will be unable to participate in \nthe fruits of civilian nuclear trade with India.\n  Second, a ``no'' vote on this agreement will be unfairly construed as \na rejection of a broader strategic alliance between the United States \nand India. Through his rhetoric and actions,\n\n[[Page S10461]]\n\nPresident Bush unwisely has transformed this nuclear cooperation \nagreement into the centerpiece of our bilateral relationship with New \nDelhi. In doing so, he has ignored the broad range of areas on which \nthe United States and India can and should cooperate--ranging from \nscience and technology to economic and business partnerships. In the \nsecurity realm, our two nations should be doing more together on \ncounterterrorism, especially in the wake of the devastating attacks in \nIndia over the past year.\n  I strongly believe in the promise of the future partnership between \nour two great nations. I am voting in favor of this agreement, despite \nits serious nonproliferation flaws, because I do not want to jeopardize \nthat emerging alliance that can bring so many benefits to both of our \npeoples.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \ndiscuss my vote against the India Nuclear Agreement.\n  In 2006, I voted in favor of the Henry J. Hyde United States and \nIndia Nuclear Cooperation Promotion Act, primarily because of the \nsafeguards included in the act that would ensure that assistance to \nIndian's civilian nuclear program to meet its domestic energy needs, \nwould not assist the Indian nuclear weapons program. Unfortunately, I \ndo not believe that the United States-India Nuclear Cooperation \nApproval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act that we voted on last \nnight has the full scope of necessary protections.\n  India is the largest democracy in the world. Its economy is growing \nby 8 percent annually. Their domestic energy needs are enormous and \nthey simply do not have enough indigenous resources to meet them. India \nis an important ally and our nation has benefitted from a strong trade \nand defense relationship for decades. Furthermore, my State of Rhode \nIsland has prospered because of a vibrant Indian community. I believe \nthat the United States should do all that it can to assist India and \nfurther strengthen the partnership between the two countries.\n  However, our country's relationship with India must be balanced with \nconcerns about nuclear proliferation and the stability of the Middle \nEast and Asia.\n  I believe that proliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons material \nand technology is the greatest threat facing our country today. The \nmost effective method of controlling such proliferation is a \nmultilateral regime where all countries are subject to the same \nstandards.\n  The agreement that was approved by the Senate last night establishes \na separate and unique regime for India. This particular agreement would \nallow India to be treated like a nuclear weapons state but not impose \nupon India the responsibilities and commitments placed on other nuclear \nweapons states. As such I believe that this particular agreement is \nflawed. This agreement has the potential to actually weaken the \ncarefully constructed, long-standing nuclear nonproliferation regime \nthat the world depends on to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  This agreement does provide some benefits. Under this agreement India \nwill put 14 of its nuclear reactors under safeguards agreements with \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA. This will help to \nensure that these reactors and the fuel supplied to them will be used \nonly for the peaceful production of nuclear poser. In addition the IAEA \nwill bring its expertise to help to improve the operational safety of \nthe reactors.\n  On the other hand the rest of India's nuclear reactors will not come \nunder the IAEA and these reactors can be used as India wishes to \nproduce power or to produce more material for nuclear weapons. But it \nis troublesome to me that India retains the right to deny IAEA access \nto some or all of the reactors that it has now agreed will come under \nIAEA agreements.\n  While this agreement will help India with its energy needs, India is \nalso now free to use its limited indigenous uranium for to support a \nbuild up of its nuclear weapons stockpile. India has specifically \npreserved its ability to increase the number of nuclear weapons in its \narsenal, its ability to increase the amount of nuclear weapons \nmaterials that it produces and its right to conduct a test of a nuclear \nweapon.\n  While India has a voluntary moratorium on testing, India still \nrefuses to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to support a \nfissile material cut-off treaty. Finally, I am greatly concerned about \nthe effect this agreement will have on the region, particularly the \nreaction of Pakistan. Pakistan will undoubtedly seek a similar \nagreement if it perceives an increased threat from India. Pakistan may \nseek to partner with China--and the United States would have few \ngrounds to protest. In such a case, Pakistan will have additional \naccess to nuclear technology.\n  While I believe that the United States should help India with its \nurgent energy needs, I believe we missed an opportunity to provide \nassistance with adequate and necessary safeguards in place. For these \nreasons, I reluctantly decided to vote against this agreement. It is my \nhope that the United States and India continue to work together to make \nthe world safer from nuclear proliferation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10461-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORIAM: PAUL NEWMAN\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to remember a great American \nicon who was a renowned actor, activist, and philanthropist--Paul \nNewman, who passed away on September 26, 2008, at the age of 83.\n  Paul's movie career spanned five decades, acting in over 65 films. He \ncaptivated all of America with his natural on-screen talent and his \noff-screen ability to give to others. He was more than an incredibly \ngifted, Academy Award-winning actor; his zeal for life was evident \nthrough his remarkable charitable work and favorite pastimes.\n  Paul Leonard Newman was born in Shaker Heights, OH, on January 26, \n1925, to Arthur and Theresa Newman. Though he hoped to be a \nprofessional athlete, his gift for the performing arts showed early as \nhe acted in grade school and high school plays. After high school he \nserved in the U.S. Navy Air Corps and eventually went on to study \ntheatre at prestigious institutions such as the Yale School of Drama \nand the famous Actor's Studio in New York.\n  In the 1950s his acting career began in theatre and television. He \nmoved to films and was eventually nominated for 10 Oscars--winning Best \nActor for ``The Color of Money'' and also two honorary Oscars. He \nplayed many major roles in classic American films such as ``Exodus,'' \n``Hud,'' ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' ``The Verdict,'' ``The \nSting,'' and ``Absence of Malice.'' His legendary performances will \nforever entertain and captivate the American imagination.\n  Paul was not only an iconic actor, but he also fervently cared about \nour Nation. He opposed the Vietnam war and ardently favored civil \nrights and equality. In addition he was a world-class race car driver, \nand a flourishing nonprofit entrepreneur. He founded the popular \nNewman's Own line of food products 25 years ago, and 100 percent of its \nprofits are donated to charities around the world. Among those \ncharities are the Hole in the Wall Camps that Paul helped to create \nover 20 years ago. These camps allow for a carefree experience for \nchildren with illnesses. Newman's Own has raised $250 million so far.\n  When his son, Scott, tragically passed away, Paul established the \nScott Newman Center in 1980 to prevent drug abuse through educating \nchildren. He also helped to cofound the Committee Encouraging Corporate \nPhilanthropy, a consortium of global CEOs in support of corporate \ngiving. Paul Newman lived his life by giving to others and encouraging \nothers to give.\n  He is survived by his wonderful wife of 50 years, award-winning \nactress Joanne Woodward; five daughters, Susan, Stephanie, Melissa, \nNell, and Clea; two grandchildren; and his brother Arthur. I send my \ndeepest condolences to them.\n  Our Nation lost an amazing talent and humanitarian with the passing \nof Paul Newman, but his legacy to the State of California and to all of \nAmerica will live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10461-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10461-S10466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GAO SLOT AUCTION RULING\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and \nRelated\n\n[[Page S10462]]\n\nAgencies, I rise with my ranking member, Senator Bond, as well as the \nbipartisan leadership of the Senate Commerce Committee, to address an \nimportant issue pertaining to the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA. \nThat issue is the agency's plans to engage in the practice of \nauctioning off landing and takeoff slots at slot-controlled airports.\n  Controversial aviation issues do not always garner immediate \nagreement on the part of all committee and subcommittee leaders in the \nSenate. They often trigger disagreements fueled by regional interests \nor differing views on the appropriate role of the Department of \nTransportation, DOT, in regulating the market. But in this instance, it \nshould be noted that all four Senators with authorizing and \nappropriating responsibilities for the FAA are in agreement that the \nFAA's plans are illegal. We do not come to that conclusion lightly. \nJust yesterday, the committee received an authoritative legal opinion \nfrom the General Counsel of the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nthat reached that same conclusion.\n  GAO's legal opinion should not come as a surprise to the FAA. Indeed, \nthe FAA, as recently as 2 years ago, was of the same view as GAO and \nstated in the Federal Register that it did not have the authority to \nproceed with such slot auctions. More recently, however, the General \nCounsel at the DOT concocted what, in my view, is a new far-fetched \nlegal argument for the purpose of evading the clear limitations imposed \nby the authorizing statute and appropriations law. The GAO reviewed the \nDepartment's new interpretations of the law and found that they don't \nhold water. Indeed, the GAO concluded that, if the FAA were to proceed \nwith these auctions, the agency would be engaging in a blatant \nviolation of the Antideficiency Act. This legal opinion matters not \nsimply because it corroborates our collective bipartisan interpretation \nof the authorizing and appropriations laws. It matters because the GAO \nis statutorily charged with making determinations regarding violations \nof Appropriations law including the Antideficiency Act.\n  One would think that this opinion would bring an end to this debate. \nSince we now know, in advance, how the GAO would rule on this question, \none would expect the DOT to abandon its interpretation and cancel its \nplanned auctioning of slots. To do otherwise would signal the agency's \nintention to proceed with a process that will almost certainly be found \nto be illegal. Unfortunately, we are getting indications that this is \nprecisely what the Department intends to do--proceed with these slot \nauctions whether they are legal or not. I find the Secretary's plans to \nbe both startling and disappointing. In my view, agency heads should \nnot be launching into actions that are likely to be found to be \nillegal. And equally important, political appointees should not be \nforcing nonpolitical officials in their departments to participate in \nsuch acts.\n  So, Mr. President, I, along with my colleagues, am taking the time of \nthe Senate to implore Secretary Peters to review the GAO's findings and \nabandon the Department's plans. To do otherwise will just subject the \ntaxpayers to the costs both of litigating this matter while holding a \nlosing hand. The taxpayers will also have to foot the bill for \nfinancing the operation of this slot auction process. This represents \nan expense potentially in the millions of dollars. Those funds would be \nmuch better spent addressing the long list of critical safety \nimprovements that must be made by the FAA.\n  Mr. BOND. It is a rare occurrence in the Senate to get this level of \nstrong bipartisan cooperation, and I thank the chair and our colleagues \non the Commerce Committee, Senators Inouye and Hutchison, for their \nsupport on this issue.\n  As you mentioned, I, too, am concerned that the administration will \nignore the impartial legal opinion articulated by the GAO on slot \nauctions and proceed with their ill-conceived plan.\n  The flying public and taxpayers are not well served by carrying \nthrough on a plan that will only lead to increased delays and costly \nlitigation. Our aviation system needs a comprehensive overhaul, \noperationally and technologically, to fix the problems of congestion. \nAn untested scheme to further tax airlines and passengers is certainly \nnot what is needed. The delayed and weary flying public deserves \nbetter.\n  Should the administration proceed with their illegal auction scheme, \nit will do nothing to reduce congestion and will only postpone needed \nreforms to the system. The problem of chronic congestion and delays in \nour aviation system deserves the full attention of all of the \nstakeholders involved in aviation--from the administration and \nCongress, the airlines, airports, customers, and the air traffic \ncontrollers and operational personnel that keep our system moving. With \nthe GAO's legal ruling, it is my hope that we can move past this failed \nidea and work towards a real solution.\n  I look forward to working with you and our Commerce Committee \ncolleagues in addressing the fundamental causes of delays and \ncongestion throughout our system and thank you all again for your \ncontinued leadership and support on the issue.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee, I rise in support of the remarks \nmade by my colleagues and would like to express my concern with moving \nforward on this proposal.\n  Clearly, such a profound change in aviation policy must be supported \nby Congress and the agency's underlying authorizing legislation. \nCongress, however, has consistently opposed the DOT's attempt to \nauction slots and explicitly prohibited such actions in P.L. 110-161. \nJust this week, the GAO reaffirmed the position of Congress when it \nissued an opinion which concluded DOT's proposed initiative to auction \nslots is illegal.\n  It is perplexing that the DOT continues to pursue this course of \naction in the face of such strong Congressional opposition. Further, I \nam astonished that they would continue down this road in the face of \nlegislation that clearly prohibits them from taking such action. I, \nalong with my colleagues, implore the DOT to abandon its efforts to \nauction slots. The administration should focus its energy on more \nimportant issues, such as modernizing the Air Traffic Control System \nand ensuring the safety of its passengers.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my friends from the \nAppropriations Committee along with Commerce Committee Chairman Inouye \nfor their leadership and agreement on this issue. In the absence of \nexplicit authority and in response to the GAO determination, I join my \ncolleagues in urging DOT to cease action on any current auction \nproposal.\n  I believe market based solutions should play a role in the future of \nour congested airports, but the path the Department has taken is \nshortsighted, untimely and according to the GAO, apparently illegal. \nInstead, the Department should further focus on mitigating delays \nthrough capacity enhancements at congested airports.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I very much want to thank my colleagues \nfor engaging in this discussion today. I ask unanimous consent to have \nthe legal opinion sent to us by the GAO General Counsel printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Subject: Federal Aviation Administration--Authority to \n         Auction Airport Arrival and Departure Slots and to Retain \n         and Use Auction Proceeds\n\n                              Government Accountability Office\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2008.\n     Hon. James L. Oberstar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, and Urban \n         Development, and Related Agencies, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Transportation, \n         Housing, and Urban Development, and Related Agencies, \n         Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     Hon. Robert Menendez,\n     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate.\n\n       This responds to your request for our legal opinion \n     regarding the authority of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration (FAA) to auction airport arrival and departure \n     slots. As part of its efforts to reduce congestion in the \n     national airspace, in April and May 2008, FAA issued proposed \n     regulations to conduct such auctions at three New York-area \n     airports--LaGuardia Airport (LaGuardia), John\n\n[[Page S10463]]\n\n     F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), and Newark Liberty \n     International Airport (Newark) at some time in the future. In \n     August 2008, FAA announced that it was proceeding to auction \n     two specific slots at Newark on September 3, an action that \n     has since been administratively stayed. On September 16, \n     2008, FAA announced that ``[i]n accordance with rulemaking \n     activity that is not yet complete'' and ``if the rule is \n     adopted,'' it may auction slots at Newark, LaGuardia, and JFK \n     starting on January 12, 2009. As agreed with your staff, this \n     opinion addresses whether FAA has authority to auction slots \n     and if it does, whether it may retain and use funds obtained \n     through such auctions.\n       We conclude that FAA currently lacks authority to auction \n     arrival and departure slots, and thus also lacks authority to \n     retain and use auction proceeds. For the first time since it \n     began regulating U.S. navigable airspace nearly 40 years ago, \n     FAA now asserts that it may assign the use of that airspace \n     using its general property management authority. According to \n     FAA, slots are intangible ``property'' that it \n     ``constructs,'' owns, and may ``lease'' for ``adequate \n     compensation'' under 49 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 106 (l)(6) and (n) \n     and 40110(a)(2). An examination of those statutes read as a \n     whole, however, makes clear that Congress was using the term \n     ``property'' to refer to traditional forms of property. It \n     was not referring to FAA's regulatory authority to assign \n     airspace slots, no matter how valuable those slots may be in \n     the hands of the regulated community. Related case law \n     confirms our conclusion. The only other source of authority \n     for FAA to raise funds in connection with its slot \n     assignments is the Independent Offices Appropriations Act \n     (IOAA), 31 U.S.C. Sec. 9701, commonly referred to as the \n     ``user fee statute,'' but that authority is currently \n     unavailable. Since 1998, Congress has, through annual \n     appropriations restrictions, specifically prohibited FAA from \n     imposing ``new aviation user fees,'' and we conclude that \n     proceeds from FAA's proposed auctions would constitute such a \n     fee. Accordingly, in our opinion, FAA lacks a legal basis to \n     go forward with the Newark auction or any other auction, and \n     if FAA were to go forward with auctioning slots without \n     obtaining the necessary authority and retained and used the \n     proceeds, GAO would raise exceptions under its account \n     settlement authority for violations of the ``purpose \n     statute,'' 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1301(a), and the Antideficiency \n     Act, 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(a)(1)(A).\n\n\n                               background\n\n       FAA's control of congestion in the national airspace by use \n     of a ``reservation'' or ``slot'' system is not new. What is \n     new is FAA's proposal to assign the slots by auction. FAA \n     first instituted a slot control system nearly 40 years ago, \n     in 1968, in the so-called High Density Rule. See 33 Fed. Reg. \n     17896, 17898 (Dec. 3, 1968); 14 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 93.121-\n     93.129 (1969). Supplementing the traditional first-come, \n     first-served traffic control system, the High Density Rule \n     capped the number of hourly arrivals and departures permitted \n     at five designated ``high density traffic airports''--\n     LaGuardia, JFK, Newark, Washington National Airport \n     (Washington National), and Chicago O'Hare International \n     Airport--and required air carriers to obtain a \n     ``reservation'' for these operations from Air Traffic Control \n     (ATC). The number of reservations available for assignment \n     varied by airport, time of day, and class of user.\n       In promulgating the High Density Rule, FAA acknowledged \n     that it was acting pursuant to its regulatory authority to \n     ensure the efficient use of the national airspace under \n     sections 307(a) and (c) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. \n     33 Fed. Reg. at 17897, 17898. That act created FAA (as the \n     Federal Aviation Agency) and directed the FAA Administrator \n     to: ``assign by rule, regulation, or order the use of the \n     navigable airspace under such terms, conditions, and \n     limitations as he may deem necessary in order to insure the \n     safety of aircraft and the efficient utilization of such \n     airspace. He may modify or revoke such assignment when \n     required by the public interest. . . . [The Administrator \n     also] is authorized to prescribe air traffic rules and \n     regulations governing the flight of aircraft, for the \n     navigation, protection, and identification of aircraft, for \n     the protection of persons and property on the ground, and for \n     the efficient utilization of the navigable airspace. . . .''\n       Federal Aviation Act of 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-726, \n     Sec. 307(a), (c), 72 Stat. 731, 749-50, 49 U.S.C. Sec. 1348 \n     (a), (c) (1968) (emphasis added). See generally Northwest \n     Airlines, Inc. v. Goldschmidt, 645 F.2d 1309 (8th Cir. 1981) \n     (upholding 1980 amendment to High Density Rule as exercise of \n     FAA's section 307(a) and (c) authority to regulate efficient \n     use of airspace).\n       Reservations under the High Density Rule initially were \n     allocated by agreements between the airlines (acting through \n     airport scheduling committees) and ATC and by rule, the vast \n     majority of reservations were set aside for assignment to \n     scheduled air carriers. See 14 C.F.R. Sec. 93.123(a) (1969). \n     Because only a few carriers held certificates of public \n     convenience and necessity for these airports, as required \n     prior to deregulation of the airline industry in the early \n     1980's, there was only limited competition for the \n     reservations. With deregulation, however, any licensed \n     carrier could service any high density airport, with the \n     result that airport scheduling committees could no longer \n     reach agreements acceptable to prospective new entrants and \n     incumbent airlines wishing to expand their operations.\n       To accommodate the resulting demand for reservations while \n     ensuring continuity of operations for carriers providing \n     regularly scheduled service, FAA amended the High Density \n     Rule effective in 1986. See 50 Fed. Reg. 52180 (Dec. 20, \n     1985). It again acknowledged that it was acting pursuant to \n     its regulatory authority under sections 307(a) and (c) of the \n     Federal Aviation Act to ensure the efficient use of the \n     national airspace. Id. at 52181. Under a \n     ``grandfather'' policy, FAA initially assigned most \n     reservations--now called ``slots''--to the carriers who \n     already held them under scheduling committee agreements. \n     For the first time, FAA also authorized carriers to sell, \n     lease, or otherwise transfer the slots among themselves, \n     subject to confirmation by FAA and to a determination by \n     the Secretary of Transportation that transfer ``will not \n     be injurious to the essential air service program.'' Slots \n     could be withdrawn at any time for FAA operational needs, \n     and under a ``use-or-lose'' provision, slots not used 65 \n     percent of the time would be recalled. FAA made clear that \n     ``[s]lots do not represent a property right but represent \n     an operating privilege subject to absolute FAA control.''\n       In issuing the 1986 amendments, FAA noted that it had \n     decided not to pursue a proposal it had made in 1980, to \n     assign slots by means of an auction. It explained this was \n     because ``legislation would be required for the collection \n     and disposition of the proceeds.'' Id. at 52183. FAA noted \n     that ``several unresolved legal questions'' had been raised \n     by the Department of Justice which DOJ believed would make an \n     auction ``impractical,'' citing the Independent Offices \n     Appropriations Act (IOAA), 31 U.S.C. Sec. 9701, commonly \n     referred to as the ``user fee statute.'' IOAA could be \n     problematic, FAA noted, ``if these proceeds were to be \n     applied for airport improvements . . . .'' Id. As FAA had \n     explained in its earlier proposal, this is because ``in \n     accordance with [IOAA], the money received as a result of any \n     auction system will not be retained by DOT but will be paid \n     into the Treasury of the United States. Other disposition of \n     the revenues . . . [is] not now authorized by statute.'' 45 \n     Fed. Reg. 71236, 71240, 71241 (Oct. 27, 1980).\n       Over time, Congress became concerned that the High Density \n     Rule, particularly the 1986 amendments, hurt competition, \n     unfairly favored incumbent airlines, and was not the best \n     means to reduce congestion. After enacting several measures \n     in the 1980s and 1990s requiring greater access for certain \n     service providers, in 2000, Congress directed FAA to phase \n     out the High Density Rule altogether, at LaGuardia, JFK, and \n     O'Hare, no later than January 1, 2007. At about this same \n     time, Congress also began to enact annual appropriations \n     restrictions prohibiting FAA from promulgating any ``new \n     aviation user fees'' unless specifically authorized by \n     statute. The first of these restrictions was enacted in 1997 \n     for fiscal year 1998, and the most recent was enacted in 2007 \n     for fiscal year 2008.\n       As the 2007 High Density Rule phase-out deadline \n     approached, FAA remained concerned about congestion. In \n     August 2006, it therefore proposed to continue caps on hourly \n     arrivals and departures at LaGuardia and to assign the \n     majority of slots (now called ``operating authorizations'') \n     to incumbent carriers. 71 Fed. Reg. 51360 (Aug. 29, 2006). \n     FAA also now proposed to set expiration dates for most slots, \n     with 10 percent of the slots each year to be redistributed, \n     as they expired, using a market-based mechanism yet to be \n     determined. FAA could not propose a specific market mechanism \n     at that time, it explained, because it lacked authority to do \n     so and would be seeking such authority from Congress: ``[FAA] \n     will seek authority to utilize market-based mechanisms at \n     LaGuardia in the future [to allocate capacity]. Such \n     legislation would be necessary to employ market-based \n     approaches such as auctions or congestion pricing at \n     LaGuardia because the FAA currently does not have the \n     statutory authority to assess market-clearing charges for a \n     landing or departure authorization. If Congress approves the \n     use of market-based mechanisms as we plan to propose, a new \n     rulemaking would be necessary to implement such measures at \n     LaGuardia.''\n       Id. at 51362 (emphasis added); see also id. at 51363. FAA \n     subsequently requested such authority from Congress, but it \n     has not been enacted. When FAA was unable to finalize its \n     2006 proposal before the January 1, 2007 phase-out deadline, \n     it issued a series of temporary ``capping orders'' \n     maintaining caps and slots at LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark.\n       Finally, as noted above, in April and May 2008, FAA issued \n     its most recent proposals for a cap and slot system at \n     LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark. FAA proposes to continue to \n     assign the majority of slots to incumbent carriers and, as in \n     its 2006 proposal, to withdraw a portion of the slots for re-\n     distribution (along with unassigned slots). However, calling \n     its 2006 legal analysis ``overly simplistic'' and \n     ``incorrect,'' FAA now proposes to do what it previously \n     stated it had no authority to do: assign the withdrawn slots \n     by auctioning slot ``leaseholds'' to the highest bidder. The \n     proceeds from the auctions would either be retained by FAA \n     and used to mitigate congestion in the New York City area or, \n     after deducting FAA's administrative costs, paid to the \n     airline that previously held the auctioned slot. To impose \n     caps on hourly arrival and departure slots, FAA continues to \n     rely on its regulatory authority to ensure efficient use of \n     the airspace, now codified at 49 U.S.C. Sec. 40103(b)(1), \n     (2). See 73 Fed. Reg. at\n\n[[Page S10464]]\n\n     20846, 29626. To assign the slots by auctioning slots \n     leaseholds, FAA for the first time relies on its general \n     authority to lease or otherwise dispose of ``property'' under \n     49 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 106 and 40110. See id. at 20853, 29631.\n\n\n                                analysis\n\n       Whether FAA may raise funds in connection with its \n     assignment of slots--by holding a slot auction, imposing a \n     user fee, assessing a tax, or by some other mechanism--\n     depends on whether it has the proper statutory authority. \n     Congress has granted FAA explicit statutory authority to \n     collect fees in several different situations, but no explicit \n     authority exists for the imposition of fees related to the \n     assignment of slots. We therefore look to whether FAA has any \n     other authority that would permit it to auction slots.\n     I. FAA's authority to auction slots under its property \n         disposition authority\n       In evaluating whether FAA may assign slots using its \n     general property disposition authority, it is important to \n     understand what a slot is. FAA has consistently characterized \n     a slot as an ``operating authorization'' or ``operational \n     authority'' to conduct one operation (arrival or departure) \n     in the airspace during a specified time period. At the five \n     high density airports, this authorization is in addition to \n     the authorization or ``clearance'' that must be obtained from \n     ATC to operate within the airspace at those facilities. 14 \n     C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 91.131(a)(1), 91.173. While these two \n     authorizations differ in some respects--clearances are \n     normally required of all users of this airspace, while slots, \n     due to capacity demands, are issued only to some users--both \n     constitute regulatory permission without which aircraft may \n     not be operated. So understood, a slot is a regulatory \n     license--a legal permission, revocable by FAA, to conduct an \n     act that otherwise would not be permitted.\n       As FAA itself emphasizes, it is also important to \n     understand that caps and slots are two interconnected parts \n     of FAA's regulatory structure to ensure the efficient use of \n     the airspace. 2008 FAA Letter at 1. Limiting aircraft traffic \n     by capping the number of arrivals and departures reduces the \n     amount of traffic that is airborne, but it does not avoid the \n     backup of aircraft seeking access to the air traffic system \n     or provide a mechanism for prioritizing traffic. Assigning \n     slots accomplishes this objective; without slots, traffic \n     will queue on a first-come-first-served basis (as it does at \n     non-slot controlled airports), undermining scheduling. \n     Whether the assignment system is called a reservation system, \n     an operating authorization system, or a slot system, the use \n     of an assignment mechanism is key to accomplishing what FAA \n     believes is necessary to promote orderly and efficient \n     traffic flow and use of airspace.\n       According to FAA, however, slots are not a license but \n     ``property'' that it ``acquires'' or ``constructs'' and, as \n     the property ``owner,'' may ``lease'' using its general \n     property disposition and contracting authority in 49 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 106 (l)(6) and (n) and 40110(a)(2). Section \n     106(n)(1) authorizes FAA: ``(A) to acquire (by purchase, \n     lease, condemnation, or otherwise), construct, improve, \n     repair, operate, and maintain--(i) air traffic control \n     facilities and equipment; (ii) research testing sites and \n     facilities; and (iii) such other real and personal property \n     (including office space and patents), or any interest therein \n     . . . as the Administrator considers necessary; [and] (B) to \n     lease to others such real and personal property . . . .''\n       Section 106(l)(6) authorizes FAA: ``[to enter into] such \n     contracts, leases, cooperative agreements, or other \n     transactions as may be necessary to carry out the functions \n     of FAA.''\n       Section 40110(a)(2) authorizes FAA: ``[to] dispose of an \n     interest in property for adequate compensation. . . .''\n\n     (All emphasis added.)\n\n       As evidence that these provisions authorize slots to be \n     ``leased'' as ``property,'' FAA points to bankruptcy \n     proceedings where slots subject to lease have been accorded \n     some proprietary status. 2008 FAA Brief at 41-43. FAA asserts \n     that it, too, has a property interest in slots subject to \n     lease because: (1) FAA has sovereignty over U.S. navigable \n     airspace; (2) airspace has been characterized as ``public \n     property;'' (3) FAA regulates the use of navigable airspace; \n     (4) as a ``product'' of its regulation, FAA has \n     ``constructed'' slots as an ``intangible property interest'' \n     in airspace use; and (5) as the slot ``constructor,'' FAA \n     ``owns'' and may ``lease'' its ``intangible'' slots. FAA \n     states further that it may--in fact, must--charge ``adequate \n     compensation,'' and even ``market prices,'' for this \n     ``property'' under 49 U.S.C. Sec. 40110. 2008 FAA Brief at \n     41, 50-53.\n       As discussed below, however, slots are not ``property'' \n     subject to FAA's property disposition authority. Nor are they \n     the mere ``product'' of FAA regulation; they are FAA \n     regulation. Moreover, FAA's argument that slots are property \n     proves too much--it suggests that the agency has been \n     improperly giving away potentially millions of dollars of \n     federal property, for no compensation, since it created the \n     slot system in 1968.\n\n\n                                   A.\n\n       Parsing its property acquisition and disposition \n     authorities under 49 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 106(n) and 40110(a)(2) \n     and applying general dictionary definitions, FAA maintains \n     that when it uses its regulatory authority to delineate a \n     time period for authorized takeoff or landing--a slot--it \n     ``constructs'' or ``acquires'' an intangible ``property'' \n     interest in airspace use that it may ``lease'' to others for \n     ``adequate compensation.'' 2008 FAA Letter at 2-3; 2008 FAA \n     Brief at 47-48. ``Understanding Congressional will requires \n     more than the mechanical application of dictionary \n     definitions,'' however, see Faircloth v. Lundy Packing Co., \n     91 F.3d 648, 660 (4th Cir. 1996) (Michael, J., concurring and \n     dissenting), and it is a cardinal rule of statutory \n     construction that statutes must be read as a whole, ``since \n     the meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on \n     context.'' King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U.S. 215, 221 \n     (1991) (citations omitted). When taken in context and read as \n     a whole, the term ``property'' as used in FAA's statute \n     clearly refers to traditional property, not to FAA's \n     regulatory licensing authority over the use of navigable \n     airspace. Almost all of the ``property'' examples listed in \n     49 U.S.C. Sec. 106(n)(1) are traditional tangible property--\n     real estate, equipment, and infrastructure--and the \n     legislative history repeats the same examples. See H. R. \n     Conf. Rep. 104-848 (1996) at 107, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3703, \n     3729. The other example referenced in Sec. 106(n)--a patent-- \n     has long been recognized as intangible property. Other \n     terminology used in Sec. 106(n)(1) reinforces that Congress \n     was referring to traditional property. For example, the \n     statute refers to property that is ``leased'' and \n     ``condemned'' (applied to traditional real property) and \n     ``constructed, improved, repaired, operated, and maintained'' \n     (applied to traditional real and personal property). Under \n     the statutory construction rule of ejusdem generis, ``such \n     other . . . property . . . or any interest therein'' as used \n     in Sec. 106(n)(1)(A) must mean property of a nature similar \n     to the traditional real and personal property examples cited \n     in the statute. This would not include FAA's regulatory \n     authorizations for aircraft takeoffs and landings--that is, \n     slots.\n       The structure of FAA's statutory authority and its \n     legislative history support this conclusion. Congress has \n     given FAA different authorities to carry out different \n     responsibilities--it has regulatory authority in 49 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 40103 to ensure the safe and efficient use of the \n     navigable airspace, and property acquisition and disposition \n     authority in 49 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 106 and 40110 to support \n     FAA's mission and general operations. As relevant here, FAA \n     has had these same basic authorities since its creation in \n     1958. The fact that Congress authorized FAA to carry out its \n     regulatory responsibilities (including assignment of slots) \n     under the strictures of Sec. 40103 undercuts FAA's argument \n     that Congress simultaneously authorized FAA to carry out many \n     of these same responsibilities under the very different \n     strictures of Sec. Sec. 106 and 40110. Congress has never \n     suggested as much in the half-century of FAA's existence, \n     nor, until 2008, has FAA. Thus FAA may not rely on its \n     general property disposition authority to carry out its \n     regulatory slot assignment functions. See, e.g., American \n     Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, 52 F.3d 1113, 1119-20 (D.C. Cir. \n     1995) (EPA cannot rely on general rulemaking authority to \n     regulate air pollutant in manner conflicting with authority \n     specific to that pollutant and ``cannot uncouple the first \n     sentence of [Clean Air Act provision] from the rest of the \n     section in order to expand its authority beyond the aims and \n     limits of the section as a whole.'').\n       Finally, FAA's reading of its property authority, \n     particularly the purported significance of a 1996 amendment \n     to that authority, is unavailing because it would interfere \n     with Congress' constitutional prerogatives to set \n     programmatic spending levels and oversee agency activities. \n     U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 9, cl. 7. As noted above, in the \n     past FAA has considered imposing a user fee under IOAA in \n     connection with its assignment of slots. Congress also has \n     considered FAA's imposition of user fees. In FAA's 1996 \n     reauthorization legislation, for example, Congress authorized \n     FAA to charge certain cost-based user fees, but called for \n     further study of the agency's funding needs and funding \n     mechanisms. See Air Traffic Management System Performance \n     Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-264, Title II, \n     Sec. Sec. 221(12), 273, 274. And in 1997, Congress enacted \n     the first of its now-annual appropriations restrictions \n     expressly prohibiting FAA from imposing any ``new aviation \n     user fees'' without specific statutory authority. FAA \n     nevertheless asserts that when Congress amended its property \n     authority in the 1996 reauthorization act by enacting \n     Sec. 106(n)--which clarified FAA's property acquisition \n     authority to include personal as well as real property, and \n     authority not just to ``acquire'' property but, as discussed \n     above, to ``construct, improve, repair, operate, and \n     maintain'' it, see Pub. L. No. 104-264, Sec. 228, codified at \n     49 U.S.C. 106(n)--this amendment granted FAA authority to \n     ``construct'' and auction slots. 2008 FAA Brief at 47-48. \n     Given Congress' substantial concerns about FAA's imposing \n     user fees in 1996 and its outright ban on new FAA aviation \n     user fees the following year, we find it highly unlikely that \n     Congress at the same time authorized FAA to obtain non-\n     appropriations funding through the ``back door'' of its \n     general property disposition authority.\n\n\n                                   B.\n\n       Case law regarding the legal status of slots and regulatory \n     licenses confirms our conclusion that slots are not \n     ``property'' in the hands of FAA. To demonstrate that slots \n     are property, FAA cites three bankruptcy cases--In re McClain \n     Airlines, Inc., 80 B.R. 175 (Bankr. D. Ariz. 1987); In re \n     American Central Airlines, 52 B.R. 567 (Bankr. N.D. Iowa \n     1985); and In re Gull Air, Inc., 890 F.2d 1255 (1st Cir.\n\n[[Page S10465]]\n\n     1989)--which considered whether an airline in bankruptcy had \n     a sufficient proprietary interest in its slots to include \n     them as ``property of the estate'' (or in McClain, an \n     interest in a right to seek restoration of a withdrawn slot). \n     2008 FAA Brief at 42-43, 61; 2008 FAA Letter at 3. The courts \n     in these cases focused in part on the fact that after FAA's \n     1986 amendments to the High Density Rule, carriers could \n     sell, lease, or otherwise transfer slots among themselves.\n       The cases do not support FAA's position. At most, they \n     recognize the undisputed fact that slots have value in the \n     hands of carriers to whom they are assigned, at least when \n     the slots are transferable to other carriers. The decisions \n     do not address the issue we face here: the nature of slots \n     when they are unassigned and ``held'' by FAA. In fact, the \n     cases underscore the limited nature of slots even after they \n     are assigned: they remain subject to FAA withdrawal at any \n     time for operational reasons and to FAA recall for non-use. \n     In Gull Air, for example, the most recent, and the only \n     appellate court, decision cited by FAA, FAA itself argued \n     that slots were not the carrier's property but rather, \n     as specified in FAA's regulations, ``operating privileges \n     subject to absolute FAA control.'' 890 F.2d at 1258. The \n     First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled only that slots' \n     transferability under the High Density Rule created a \n     ``limited proprietary interest in slots'' that is \n     ``encumbered by conditions that FAA imposed in its \n     regulations.'' Id. at 1260. The court declined to decide \n     whether the slots constituted ``property of the estate'' \n     because whatever that interest was, it was lost \n     automatically under FAA's ``use or lose'' requirement when \n     the airline ceased operations. Thus Gull Air stands only \n     for the proposition that slots have one characteristic of \n     property--transferability--which may qualify slots as \n     ``property of the estate'' under the Bankruptcy Code when \n     held by carriers. This is a far cry from finding that \n     slots are FAA's ``property'' subject to its property \n     disposition statute.\n       Furthermore, even if slots were not transferable, there is \n     little doubt that they have value to carriers. Yet the U.S. \n     Supreme Court has made clear that the fact that a government \n     license is valuable to the license holder does not render the \n     license ``property'' in the hands of the issuing agency. \n     Rather, the license is ``no more and no less than [the \n     agency's] sovereign power to regulate.'' Cleveland v. United \n     States, 531 U.S. 12, 23 (2000). In Cleveland, the Supreme \n     Court had to decide whether a Louisiana video poker machine \n     license was ``property'' under the federal mail fraud \n     statute, which makes it a felony to use the mail to further \n     ``any scheme . . . to defraud, or for obtaining money or \n     property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses . . . .'' \n     18 U.S.C. 1341 (emphasis added). Upholding the rulings of \n     five circuit courts of appeals, the unanimous Supreme Court \n     ruled that the licenses were not ``property'' when held by \n     the issuing state agency:\n       ``Without doubt, Louisiana has a substantial economic stake \n     in the video poker industry. The State collects an upfront \n     `processing fee' for each new license application . . ., a \n     separate `processing fee' for each renewal application . . ., \n     an `annual fee' from each device owner . . ., an additional \n     `device operation' fee . . ., and, most importantly, a fixed \n     percentage of net revenue from each video poker device . . . \n     It is hardly evident, however, why these tolls should make \n     video poker licenses `property' in the hands of the State. \n     The State receives the lion's share of its expected revenue \n     not while the licenses remain in its own hands, but only \n     after they have been issued to licensees. Licenses pre-\n     issuance do not generate an ongoing stream of revenue. At \n     most, they entitle the State to collect a processing fee from \n     applicants for new licenses. Were an entitlement of this \n     order sufficient to establish a state property right, one \n     could scarcely avoid the conclusion that States have property \n     rights in any license or permit requiring an up front fee, \n     including drivers' licenses, medical licenses, and fishing \n     and hunting licenses. Such licenses, as the Government itself \n     concedes, are `purely regulatory.'''\n\n     531 U.S. at 22 (second emphasis added).\n\n       FAA compares its proposed slot leases to patents, a type of \n     intangible property it is authorized to dispose of under 49 \n     U.S.C. 106(n)(1)(A)(ii). 2008Sec. FAA Brief at 33, 51. But \n     the Cleveland Court rejected this patent analogy, which had \n     been made by the United States:\n       ``[T]hese intangible rights of allocation, exclusion, and \n     control amount to no more and no less than Louisiana's \n     sovereign power to regulate. . . [T]he state's right of \n     control does not create a property interest any more than a \n     law licensing liquor sales in a State that levies a sales tax \n     on liquor. Such regulations are paradigmatic exercises of the \n     States' traditional police powers.\n       ``The Government compares the State's interest in video \n     poker licenses to a patent holder's interest in a patent that \n     she has not yet licensed. Although it is true that both \n     involve the right to exclude, we think the congruence ends \n     there. Louisiana does not conduct gaming operations itself, \n     it does not hold video poker licenses to reserve that \n     prerogative, and it does not ``sell'' video poker licenses in \n     the ordinary commercial sense. Furthermore, while a patent \n     holder may sell her patent . . ., the State may not sell its \n     licensing authority. Instead of a patent holder's interest in \n     an unlicensed patent, the better analogy is to the Federal \n     Government's interest in an unissued patent. That interest, \n     like the State's interest in licensing video poker \n     operations, surely implicates the Government's role as \n     sovereign, not as property holder.''\n\n     531 U.S. at 23-24 (emphasis added).\n\n       Just as Louisiana did not run the video poker machines in \n     Cleveland, so FAA does not operate commercial air carriers. \n     Just as Louisiana regulated gaming as part of its police \n     power to protect the public welfare, so FAA regulates air \n     traffic as part of its responsibility to ensure efficient use \n     of the national airspace. As in Cleveland, the fact that \n     FAA's slots have value to slot holders does not transform \n     them into alienable ``property'' in FAA's hands. FAA seeks to \n     distinguish Cleveland because the licenses there were not \n     transferable, and because a rule of leniency applicable to \n     criminal statutes drove the Supreme Court's interpretation. \n     As noted above regarding Gull Air, however, slot \n     transferability is irrelevant to FAA's ``property'' rights \n     because slots do not acquire this trait until after FAA \n     assigns them. And while FAA's property disposition provisions \n     are not criminal statutes, studied skepticism in defining \n     their reach is also warranted. In this regard, there is an \n     acute public interest in protecting Congress' exercise of its \n     constitutional responsibility to set spending levels through \n     the appropriations process, and as discussed above, this \n     would be jeopardized if FAA could circumvent the \n     appropriations process by obtaining funding through slot \n     auctions.\n     II. FAA's authority to auction slots under its user fee \n         authority\n       Because FAA may not auction slots under its property \n     disposition authority and has no explicit authority to charge \n     a fee for the assignment of slots, the only other arguable \n     authority on which FAA could rely is IOAA. That authority is \n     currently unavailable because as of fiscal year 1998, \n     Congress has prohibited FAA's imposition of any new aviation \n     user fees unless it obtains specific statutory authority. \n     Because FAA lacks authority to collect such fees, if it \n     nevertheless goes forward with an auction, it may not retain \n     or use the proceeds.\n       To understand the impact of Congress' prohibition, some \n     context and a brief history are helpful. FAA is funded from a \n     combination of sources, which can be roughly divided into \n     three types: excise tax revenue, General Fund appropriations, \n     and reimbursements from services provided and user fees \n     charged. FAA, Fiscal Year 2007 Performance and Accountability \n     Report, at 121. For the last 10 years, Congress has annually \n     prohibited FAA from implementing any ``new aviation user \n     fees'' not authorized by Congress. The prohibition first \n     appeared in the 1998 Department of Transportation and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act and stated:\n       ``[N]one of the funds in this Act shall be available for \n     the Federal Aviation Administration to plan, finalize, or \n     implement any regulation that would promulgate new aviation \n     user fees not specifically authorized by law after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.''\n       Pub. L. No. 105-66, 111 Stat. 1425, 1429 (1997). At the \n     time, the Conference Committee expressed ``very serious \n     concerns,'' ``on both technical and policy-related grounds,'' \n     about new aviation user fees that FAA had proposed. The \n     Committee made clear that the existing excise tax system, \n     supplemented by appropriated funds, would provide sufficient \n     revenue for FAA without new fees. H. R. Rep. No. 105-313 at \n     40-41 (Conf. Rep.) (1997). The Committee specifically \n     acknowledged the authority that IOAA generally provides to \n     agencies and made clear that it intended to restrict this \n     authority in FAA's case:\n       ``The conferees are aware of FAA's opinion that the agency \n     has the legal authority to establish new user fees under the \n     generic authority provided in the User Fee Statute, and do \n     not wish to see FAA circumvent the legislative process and \n     avoid the normal cost controls which apply to other federal \n     agencies through the administrative implementation of new \n     user fees. The conferees emphasize, however, that this \n     provision does not prevent the FAA from implementing new \n     user fees. It only provides that such fees must be \n     specifically authorized by the Congress.''\n       Id. at 41. A slightly modified version of the restriction \n     has been included in every subsequent yearly appropriation. \n     The 2008 fiscal year prohibition states:\n       ``[N]one of the funds in this [Appropriations] Act shall be \n     available for the Federal Aviation Administration to finalize \n     or implement any regulation that would promulgate new \n     aviation user fees not specifically authorized by law after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.''\n       Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161, \n     121 Stat. 1844, 2379 (2007).\n       In considering the fiscal year 2008 prohibition, the House \n     Committee on Appropriations commented on its ``serious \n     concerns about the impact of user fees,'' and the Senate \n     Committee on Appropriations expressed its desire that ``any \n     degradation in the Committee's ability to annually set \n     programmatic spending levels and oversee the agency's \n     spending habits as part of the reauthorization process should \n     be strenuously resisted.''\n       This fiscal year 2008 prohibition precludes FAA's use of \n     IOAA as authority to auction slots because FAA's slot \n     auctions would amount to a ``new aviation user fee'' not \n     specifically authorized by law. FAA has never previously \n     imposed a fee for authorization to use navigable airspace at \n     a specific time; thus FAA's slot auction would constitute \n     exactly the type of ``new aviation user fee''\n\n[[Page S10466]]\n\n     that Congress has prohibited. Indeed, FAA recognized that \n     slot auctions would constitute a user fee when it proposed to \n     institute such a fee in 1980, and again in 1986 when it \n     decided not to do so. FAA also appeared to recognize that \n     slot auctions would constitute a user fee in 2006 and 2007 \n     when, in the face of the annual appropriations restrictions, \n     it promised to and did seek legislation authorizing it to \n     conduct the auctions. FAA's April 2008 proposal in fact \n     acknowledges that because of the appropriations restriction, \n     FAA ``continues to believe that it cannot rely on a market-\n     based [slot] allocation method under a purely regulatory \n     approach, which is why it explicitly sought legislation on \n     this matter.'' 73 Fed. Reg. at 20846, 20852.\n       FAA suggests that because it will conduct the Newark \n     auction by solicitation of bids for slot leases, rather than \n     by issuance of a new regulation, the language of the 2008 \n     Consolidated Appropriations Act--which prohibits ``any \n     regulation'' imposing new aviation user fees--does not apply. \n     2008 FAA Brief at 61 n. 36. Contrary to FAA's suggestion, \n     because the auction would, in effect, amount to a user fee \n     under IOAA, and IOAA requires agencies to prescribe \n     regulations to impose new user fees, see 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 9701(b), implementation of the auction would require a \n     new regulation. FAA cannot elude the requirements of \n     otherwise applicable law simply by failing to follow the \n     law's requirements. ``It is axiomatic that an agency cannot \n     do indirectly what it is not permitted to do directly.'' \n     Forest Products Laboratory Agreement with University of \n     Wisconsin, 55 Comp. Gen. 1059 (1976).\n       FAA points to examples of other agencies auctioning or \n     charging market-based fees for use of public lands or other \n     public ``property.'' 2008 FAA Brief at 48-49. These are \n     inapposite because unlike FAA, those agencies had specific \n     statutory authority for their activities. See, e.g, 16 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 472a (U.S. Department of Agriculture auction of timber \n     rights on National Forest Service land); 43 U.S.C. Sec. 315b \n     (U.S. Department of Interior issuance of grazing permits for \n     public lands for ``reasonable fees''). FAA's most analogous \n     example is the Federal Communications Commission's auction of \n     license rights to the electromagnetic spectrum. Again, \n     however, Congress has specifically authorized the FCC to \n     conduct such auctions, including specifying the conditions \n     necessary for auction, bidder qualifications, and treatment \n     of auction proceeds. See 47 U.S.C. Sec. 309(j). As discussed \n     above, despite FAA's specific requests, Congress has given \n     FAA no comparable auction authority.\n       Finally, even if Congress were to remove the annual \n     appropriations restriction that prohibits FAA from \n     promulgating new aviation user fees, without other specific \n     authority, it could impose only a cost-based fee, not the \n     type of market-based fee it seeks to obtain by auctioning \n     slots to the highest bidder. Under IOAA, when an agency is \n     but one actor in the marketplace, it acts in a commercial, \n     non-governmental capacity and may charge a fee based on the \n     market price of the service provided. When instead an agency \n     exercises its sovereign power and regulates activities based \n     on public policy goals--as FAA would be acting, if it were to \n     auction slots--it acts in a regulatory capacity, and user \n     fees are limited to the agency's costs of providing the \n     specific benefit to the individual recipient. If FAA's fee \n     were based on market value and exceeded its cost of providing \n     the slot to the recipient airline, the fee could rise to the \n     level of a tax. A tax would be beyond IOAA's grant of \n     authority and FAA would have to have some other \n     Congressionally-delegated authority to impose it. National \n     Cable Television Ass'n, Inc. v. United States, 415 U.S. 336, \n     341 (1974); National Park Service--Special Park Use Fees, B-\n     307319, Aug. 23, 2007.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       We conclude that FAA may not auction slots under its \n     property disposition authority, user fee authority, or any \n     other authority, and thus also may not retain or use proceeds \n     of any such auctions. Going forward with the planned Newark \n     auction or any other auction would be without legal basis, \n     and if FAA conducted an auction and retained and used the \n     proceeds, GAO would raise significant exceptions, under its \n     account settlement authority, 31 U.S.C. Sec. 3526, for \n     violations of the ``purpose statute,'' 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1301(a), and the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1341(a)(1)(A).\n       If there are questions concerning these matters, please \n     contact Managing Associate General Counsel Susan.

Mr. President, I would like to voice my support for \nthe difficult work that Ethiopia is doing on the battlefield of the war \non terror in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia is a country of great \nimportance to the United States, and is located in what some have \ncalled one of the roughest neighborhoods in the world. As one of our \nstrongest allies in this complicated region, Ethiopia has shown promise \nin meeting both economic and security challenges.\n  Although Ethiopia remains one of the poorest countries in the world, \nit is developing a market-based economy which has experienced an \nimpressive 10 percent annual growth since 2003. In addition, the \nGovernment of Ethiopia, in close collaboration with regional and \ninternational health organizations, has achieved some success in \naddressing global public health concerns, including the fight against \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.\n  The US-Ethiopia bilateral relationship is strong and enduring. \nEthiopia is a vital partner of the United States in the fight against \nterrorism, promoting regional stability and combating violent \nextremism. As a growing democracy, Ethiopia shares with the United \nStates a common commitment to promoting freedom and human dignity.\n  With respect to Ethiopia's involvement in Somalia, it is important to \nunderstand that the U.S., U.N., E.U., and A.U., all have urged Ethiopia \nto remain in Somalia until replacement forces arrive or a stable \ngovernment is formed. Ethiopian government officials have stated that \nwhile the Government of Ethiopia is anxious to remove their forces at \nthe earliest possible time, it has delayed the withdrawal of troops \nfrom Somalia, at great political and economic cost, until replacement \ntroops arrive to ensure the stability of Somalia's Transitional Federal \nGovernment.\n  Unfortunately, while several nations have pledged to send replacement \ntroops under the auspices of the African Union, only a small fraction \nof those pledged have actually arrived. I am grateful that Ethiopia \nremains committed to securing stability and peace in Somalia, and hope \nthat the full African Union contingent arrives soon to enable the safe \nwithdrawal of Ethiopian forces.\n  Ethiopia faces a host of ongoing challenges both at home and abroad, \nand merits our support and assistance. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin recognizing the progress made by this Ethiopia in promoting the \nhealth and welfare of its people, and assisting in the war on terror in \nthe Horn of Africa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10466-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10466-S10467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PATIENT SAFETY AND ABUSE PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the Patient \nSafety and Abuse Prevention Act, S. 1577. This bill takes needed, \npractical steps to protect seniors in nursing homes and other settings \nwherever long-term care services are delivered. The background check \nprocedures used by most States today are inadequate to keep out \nthousands of criminals, who can and do take advantage of loopholes and \ngaps in State systems. This results in needless tragedies and terrible \nharm to seniors.\n  As chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I have read and heard \nabout too many of these stories. One young woman, Jennifer Coldren, \ntestified earlier this year that her 90-year-old grandmother was \nbrutally assaulted by a predator who had a criminal record that went \nunnoticed. If a more comprehensive background check had been done on \nthis individual, he would not have been working in this nursing \nfacility, and the course of Jennifer's life and her grandmother's life \nwould not have been so horribly altered.\n  It is past time for the Federal Government to take the lead in asking \nStates to improve their screening processes. To do so, States must \nimprove their infrastructure. They must connect and coordinate their \nState registries, such as those established for sex offenders and child \nabusers. They must screen all long-term care workers, including those \nwho work in private homes. They must require State police checks and \nchecks against the FBI's national criminal history database.\n  We know that States will take these steps to improve their background \ncheck procedures if Congress incentivizes them to do so. Seven States \ndid exactly that after we provided them with modest grants under a \npilot program enacted as part of the Medicare Modernization Act of \n2003. The dollar amounts required to get these States to expand and \nimprove\n\n[[Page S10467]]\n\ntheir systems were modest, ranging from about $1.5 million to $3 \nmillion per State.\n  The results have been extremely impressive. At the close of the pilot \nprogram, more than 9,000 applications had been disqualified--because a \ncomprehensive check showed that the applicant had a serious criminal \nhistory or a record of substantiated abuse. As a result, thousands of \nindividuals who could have harmed our parents, grandparents, and loved \nones have not been allowed to do so. And all seniors in these States \nwho are receiving long-term care services--in Alaska, Idaho, Illinois, \nMichigan, Nevada, New Mexico, and Wisconsin are now safer.\n  We have a responsibility to build on this record of resounding \nsuccess. If we help States to take these steps I have outlined, we can \nreduce the terrible toll of elder abuse. If we do nothing, experts tell \nus abuse rates will continue to rise.\n  I am pleased to have Senator Domenici as a partner and many of my \ncolleagues as cosponsors, including Senator Lincoln of Arkansas and \nSenator Cochran of Mississippi. Thanks to the leadership of Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley, the cost of this bill--$100 million over 3 \nyears--is fully offset. With regard to all other Senators, the only \noffices that have expressed concerns are those of Senator Coburn of \nOklahoma and Senator DeMint of South Carolina. I appreciate the \nwillingness of their staffs to meet with my staff and trust that they \nwill be able to reach agreement shortly.\n  In closing, the Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act has made \nsubstantial progress during the 110th Congress. It is strongly endorsed \nby attorneys general across the country, by the business community, \nlabor unions, and elder justice advocates. It has been thoroughly \ndiscussed in public hearings and also during a markup in the Senate \nFinance Committee, where it was unanimously approved. The \nadministration has provided technical assistance on the bill. I hope \nthat all Senators will recognize the wisdom of approving this measure. \nFailing to take action to protect our Nation's frailest citizens should \nbe unacceptable to all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10467-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10467-S10468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PAYMENTS TO PHYSICIANS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have been examining several doctors at \nuniversities across the country to see if they are complying with the \nfinancial disclosure policies of the National Institutes of Health. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my latest letter to \nEmory University regarding Dr. Charles B. Nemeroff and the Emory-\nGlaxoSmithKline-National Institute of Mental Health Initiative.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 2008.\n     Hon. James W. Wagner, Ph.D.,\n     President, Emory University, Dowman Drive, Atlanta, GA.\n       Dear Dr. Wagner: The United States Senate Committee on \n     Finance (Committee) has jurisdiction over the Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs and, accordingly, a responsibility to the \n     more than 80 million Americans who receive healthcare \n     coverage under these programs. As Ranking Member of the \n     Committee, I have a duty to protect the health of Medicare \n     and Medicaid beneficiaries and safeguard taxpayer dollars \n     appropriated for these programs. The actions taken by thought \n     leaders, like those at Emory University (Emory), often have \n     profound impact upon the decisions made by taxpayer funded \n     programs like Medicare and Medicaid and the way that patients \n     are treated and funds expended.\n       I would like to expand on concerns I brought to your \n     attention regarding problems with the disclosures of outside \n     income filed with Emory by Dr. Charles Nemeroff, Chair of the \n     Department of Psychiatry. I have previously cited \n     discrepancies pertaining to Dr. Nemeroff's disclosures filed \n     with Emory and reports that I received by several companies \n     regarding payments made to Dr. Nemeroff. I also raised \n     concerns about Dr. Nemeroff's conflicts of interest relating \n     to several National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants.\n       Federal regulations place numerous requirements on a \n     university or hospital when its researchers apply for NIH \n     grants. These regulations are intended to ensure a level of \n     objectivity in publicly funded research, and state in \n     pertinent part that NIH investigators must disclose to their \n     institution any ``significant financial interest'' that may \n     appear to affect the results of a study. NIH interprets \n     ``significant financial interest'' to mean at least $10,000 \n     in value or five percent ownership in a single entity.\n       From the summer of 2003 until the summer of 2008, Dr. \n     Nemeroff was the primary investigator on a collaborative \n     grant between Emory, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the National \n     Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)--the Emory-GSK-NIMH \n     Collaborative Mood Disorders Initiative (Initiative). This \n     Initiative examined five novel GSK antidepressant candidates. \n     The NIH budgeted approximately $3.95 million over this \n     grant's five year period with about $1.35 million paid \n     directly to Emory for overhead costs. Apparently, Dr. \n     Nemeroff also received some payment for his salary from this \n     grant, although the exact amount has not yet been made \n     available to the Committee.\n       On several occasions during the life of this grant, it \n     appears that Dr. Nemeroff failed to report to Emory that he \n     was participating actively on the speaker's bureau for GSK. \n     For instance, in an email regarding his outside activities \n     dated October 1, 2003, Dr. Nemeroff wrote: . . . I have to \n     dig up the agreement and send it to you, GSK no standing \n     contract, I chair their ad board 2-3 times per year and I am \n     paid per board meeting at a standard rate of $5K per weekend.\n       However, and based upon information in our possession, in \n     2003 GSK paid Dr. Nemeroff about $119,000 in speaking fees \n     and expenses. Based upon information provided from Emory, Dr. \n     Nemeroff did not report that he was giving promotional talks \n     for GSK on Paxil and Lamictal.\n       On March 19, 2004, Dr. Nemeroff again addressed his \n     relationship with GSK in response to questions from Emory's \n     Conflicts of Interest (COI) Committee. Again, it appears that \n     Dr. Nemeroff did not mention the fees he was receiving for \n     promotional speaking on behalf of GSK. In a letter to the \n     Assistant Dean for Administration, Dr. Nemeroff wrote: Apart \n     from speaking at national symposia, such as the American \n     Psychiatric Association, for which GSK might serve as a \n     sponsor, my consultation to the company is limited to \n     chairing their Paroxetine Advisory board and for that, I am \n     remunerated $15,000 per year.\n       However, on March 16, 2004, three days prior to signing \n     this letter, GSK paid Dr. Nemeroff $3,500 for a talk he gave \n     on Paxil at the Citrus Club, a members only business \n     establishment in Orlando, Florida. On March 17, 2004, he gave \n     another $3,500 talk about Paxil in Kissimmee, Florida. The \n     week after he signed this letter, Dr. Nemeroff gave three \n     talks on Paxil, for $3,500 each, at various venues in New \n     York State.\n       In June 2004, Emory's COI Committee released a report on \n     Dr. Nemeroff's company sponsored grants and outside \n     activities. Dr. Nemeroff was provided a copy of the report \n     which stated in pertinent part:\n       The Committee concluded that you did not follow procedures \n     and policies regarding the review of your consulting \n     agreements and that you failed to disclose your potential \n     conflicts of interest in research in your Annual Disclosure \n     Form for 2002-2003, your Sponsored Projects Approval Forms, \n     and your IRB and IACUC forms.\n       In response to this report, Dr. Nemeroff wrote a memorandum \n     to the executive associate dean on July 6, 2004, explaining \n     how he would manage his conflicts in the future. He included \n     the last page of the COI Committee's report with his \n     signature to indicate ``that I will follow the management \n     plans for my conflicts of interest.'' As part of this \n     management plan, Dr. Nemeroff wrote, ``In view of the NIMH/\n     Emory/GSK grant, I shall limit my consulting to GSK to under \n     $10,000/year and I have informed GSK of this policy.''\n       Barely a week after this promise, on July 12, 2004, GSK \n     paid Dr. Nemeroff $3,500 in fees and $505.40 in expenses for \n     a talk he gave regarding Paxil at the Larkspur Restaurant and \n     Grill in Las Vegas, Nevada. The following day, Dr. Nemeroff \n     gave two more talks in exchange for $7,000 from GSK ($3,500 \n     per talk).\n       On July 19, 2004, Dr. Nemeroff received an invitation from \n     the marketing team of Lamictal to attend their national \n     advisory board meeting on November 15-16. Dr. Nemeroff \n     responded by email: I cannot attend this meeting, \n     unfortunately for two reasons. First I have a prior \n     commitment presenting grand rounds at St. Louis University on \n     the 16th and a chairs meeting at Emory on the 15th. Secondly \n     because I serve as the Principal Investigator of the Emory/\n     GSK/NIMH grant from NIH on Antidepressant Drug Discovery, I \n     am very limited in my ability to consult with GSK as this is \n     viewed as a conflict of interest.\n       Records supplied from GSK show that Dr. Nemeroff was most \n     likely in St. Louis on the 16th of November. On November \n     17th, GSK paid Dr. Nemeroff $7,000 for two clinical \n     roundtables at two physicians' offices in St. Louis, and \n     $3,500 for a lecture he gave at Kemoll's Italian Restaurant.\n       On July 15, 2004, Emory's Office of the Dean sent Dr. \n     Nemeroff a letter regarding the Emory-GSK-NIMH Collaborative \n     Moods Disorders Initiative grant. The letter concerned the \n     COI Committee's review of his relationship with GSK. The \n     letter stated: The [COI] Committee understands that you serve \n     on the GlaxoSmithKline Paroxetine Advisory Board and provide \n     advice to GSK on their products that are already on the \n     market. For these services, you receive approximately $15,000 \n     annually. You do not have any stock options or equity \n     interests in GSK.\n\n[[Page S10468]]\n\n     Please correct the record if this is not correct. . . . The \n     [COI] Committee found that you have a significant financial \n     interest in GSK because your consulting fees are more than \n     the de minimis amount established by Emory's University \n     Policy, the AAMC guidelines, and PHS regulations, which is \n     currently $10,000 annually. . . . In order to manage this \n     conflict of interest, the [COI] Committee requires that you \n     keep your consulting fees from GSK to an amount equal to or \n     less than $10,000 on an annual basis throughout the grant \n     period, its renewals, and final collection of data.\n       In response, Dr. Nemeroff sent a letter to the executive \n     associate dean on August 4, 2004. Dr. Nemeroff wrote: \n     However, to reiterate, I have already taken the necessary \n     steps to be in compliance with the recommendations of the COI \n     Committee, namely my consulting fees from GSK will be less \n     than $10,000 per year throughout the period of this NIH \n     grant, its renewals and final collections of data. GSK has \n     been informed of this change and certainly understand the \n     reasons for this decision and is supportive of my compliance \n     with the university recommendations.\n       According to GSK reports, Dr. Nemeroff exceeded the $10,000 \n     limit within that very same month. On August 23, 2004, Dr. \n     Nemeroff was paid $3,500 for a teleconference with the \n     Louisiana State University Psychiatry Department. GSK reports \n     that this was a ``non product'' talk. However, Dr. Nemeroff \n     gave talks on the 25th and 26th at two restaurants in New \n     York regarding Paxil--one at Passion Fish Restaurant in \n     Woodbury and the second at Burton and Doyles in Great Neck. \n     For each talk, GSK paid Dr. Nemeroff a $3,500 speaking \n     honorarium. On August 31, 2004, Dr. Nemeroff held a ``non \n     product'' teleconference for an additional $3,500.\n       On October 29, 2004, the assistant dean for administration \n     sent Dr. Nemeroff a letter concerning his grants. Relying on \n     Dr. Nemeroff's promise to maintain his consulting fees from \n     GSK below $10,000, Emory informed him that he did not have a \n     conflict with the Emory-GSK-NIH Collaborative Mood Disorders \n     Institute.\n       However, GSK reports that Dr. Nemeroff's final lecture on \n     Paxil was given on January 26, 2006. That day he gave two \n     talks in Springfield, Missouri. He gave one lecture at the \n     Burrel Behavioral Health and the second at Mille's Turn of \n     the Century Cafe. GSK paid Dr. Nemeroff $7,000 for the \n     lectures along with $174.98 in expenses.\n       Based upon information provided to me, it appears that Dr. \n     Nemeroff denied giving these lectures. For instance in a \n     letter on November 20, 2006, Dr. Nemeroff wrote the following \n     to the Emory dean about his outside activities:\n       ``I was somewhat surprised by the suggestion that I serve \n     as [primary investigator] or co-PI in any research protocols \n     funded by a company with which I have a financial \n     relationship. This is absolutely untrue. Quite some time ago, \n     I made that decision based on the 2004 letter from Dr. \n     Adkison and have stuck to it. Thus, this is not an issue.''\n       However, during the years that Dr. Nemeroff served as the \n     primary investigator of the Emory/GSK/NIMH Initiative it \n     seems he failed to report approximately half a million \n     dollars in fees and expenses from GSK. These fees covered \n     dozens of talks given to promote drugs sold by the company.\n       Accordingly, I request that your institution respond to the \n     following questions and requests for information. For each \n     response, please repeat the enumerated request and follow \n     with the appropriate answer.\n       (1) For each year that the Emory/GSK/NIMH grant was active, \n     please provide the following:\n       a. Total amount of grant;\n       b. Amount provided to Emory for overhead; and\n       c. Amount of grant provided as salary to Dr. Nemeroff.\n       (2) Please provide all communications regarding this \n     investigation and/or Dr. Nemeroff's outside consulting. This \n     information may be held by Dr. Nemeroff and/or his assistant \n     and/or supervisors to Dr. Nemeroff. The time span of this \n     request covers November 2007 to the present.\n       (3) According to documents provided to us by Emory, Dr. \n     Nemeroff wrote a memo to himself on the letterhead of the \n     journal Depression and Anxiety, stating that he was paying \n     himself $3,000 to write a supplement for that journal. Dr. \n     Nemeroff then filled out an Emory form for payment, with the \n     money being withdrawn from Emory account 9-30410-2170. Please \n     provide documents and explanation for the source of funds \n     that were placed in this account.\n       Thank you again for your continued cooperation and \n     assistance in this matter. As you know, in cooperating with \n     the Committee's review, no documents, records, data or \n     information related to these matters shall be destroyed, \n     modified, removed or otherwise made inaccessible to the \n     Committee.\n       I look forward to hearing from you by no later than October \n     16, 2008. All documents responsive to this request should be \n     sent electronically in PDF format to Brian_Downey@finance-\nrep.senate.gov.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Snowe and myself, I \nrise today to express our concern that the Small Business \nAdministration has taken steps to hide from public view the details of \none of the largest lending scandals in that agency's history. As \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship, we take our oversight role of the SBA seriously, \nand we believe that transparency is vital to a well-functioning \ngovernment.\n  On July 11, 2007, the SBA's Office of Inspector General issued a \nreport on the agency's oversight of Business Loan Center, LLC, \notherwise known as BLX. That report was not made publicly available \nuntil October of the same year, in a heavily redacted form. BLX was one \nof SBA's largest 7(a) lenders when the $76 million in fraudulent loans \nit made was exposed in January 2007. An OIG investigation regarding \nallegations of the fraudulent loans helped lead to the arrest of a BLX \nexecutive vice president and 18 other individuals, who were not BLX \nemployees. OIG followed up the investigation by releasing the report on \nSBA's oversight of BLX. Despite the obvious need for more, not less, \ntransparency of SBA's oversight activities, when the report was made \npublicly available in October of that year, it was heavily redacted and \nvirtually useless to the public in trying to determine what the SBA is \ndoing to address the multimillion dollar loan fraud that took place \nunder its watch.\n  To further underscore the damage that took place, it is important to \nnote that, in the time that has elapsed since the report was issued, \nBLX--now called Ciena Capital has declared bankruptcy. According to the \ncompany, it will continue to manage its assets as a ``debtor in \npossession'' under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. However, \nwe are still concerned that the former BLX will not fulfill its \nobligations to the SBA and the American taxpayer, in turn.\n  Even so, as detailed in hearings on SBA lender oversight, our \ncommittee remains very concerned by the number and breadth of the \nredactions of the BLX report. At the lender oversight hearing on \nNovember 13, 2007, then SBA Administrator Steven Preston promised to \nwork with the committee to make more of the report publicly available. \nTo date, there has been no agreement on a meaningful release of \nredacted material.\n  In the context of conducting oversight, it has become apparent to the \ncommittee that the OIG did not exercise independent authority on what \nwas redacted and instead let the agency it was investigating dictate \nthat large sections of the report be redacted. This is contrary to the \nusual process that occurs with SBA OIG reports. Of the 15 reports that \nthe OIG has released this year, there have been none with a volume of \nredactions even close to those in the BLX report. Of the 30 reports OIG \nissued in 2007, only 3 reports have a comparable amount of text \nredacted and those are all reports regarding agency information \nsecurity.\n  In this statement, I will bring to light the OIG's first three \nrecommendations to the SBA and a summary of the SBA's comments on the \nrecommendations, which were redacted in the publicly released report. \nThere is nothing in this material that should have been withheld. In \nfact, on August 3, 2008, the New York Times reported in an article that \nrevealed the substance of the three redacted recommendations that \n``With the American taxpayer assuming responsibility for all manner of \nbad loans made by reckless lenders, it's puzzling that a scathing 2007 \naudit of the Small Business Administration's\n\n[[Page S10469]]\n\noversight of one of its top private lenders remains hidden from view.'' \nAdditionally, even if there had been a reason to withhold this \ninformation, the public interest would outweigh that. Given the crisis \nin the credit market, it is more important than ever that the public \nhave confidence that SBA can handle its lender oversight \nresponsibilities.\n  The redacted portion is a recommendation on how to go forward in \nimproving SBA's lender oversight and is illustrative of a process that \nbroke down in this instance and needlessly made information \nconfidential without due consideration.\n  According to both the SBA's Office of General Counsel and the OIG, \nthe SBA followed a preemptive Freedom of Information Act process when \npreparing for the public release of the BLX report. At its heart, the \nFOIA is a disclosure statute, with certain outlined exemptions. Indeed, \nalthough FOIA responsiveness has been problematic at best under the \nBush administration, it has at least recognized FOIA's importance on \npaper as a tool to increase accountability of Government. As is stated \nin former Attorney General John Ashcroft's FOIA memo of October 12, \n2001, which set the policy standard for FOIA compliance for the \nAdministration: ``It is only through a well-informed citizenry that the \nleaders of our nation remain accountable to the governed and the \nAmerican people can be assured that neither fraud nor government waste \nis concealed.''\n  Unfortunately, discussions with the OIG and OGC make clear that \nneither office fully evaluated each redaction with the above-mentioned \nguidance in mind. The OIG faced a large number of requested redactions \nfrom the OGC and, rather than challenge the OGC on them, simply decided \nto release the report with SBA's huge number of requested redactions \nintact. The OGC expressed surprise the OIG did not push back more on \ntheir requested redactions and seemed to have clearly acted on the \ninstinct to ask for more redactions they expected to have made. The end \nresult was a report that did nothing to increase transparency of \nGovernment and was virtually useless to the public.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the treatment of this report is in stark \ncontrast to that of other OIG reports, which tend to have few \nredactions. Indeed, the followup report on lender oversight that was \nreleased by OIG in May 2008 had comparatively few redactions. However, \nin the BLX report, the redactions were so severe that the OIG felt \ncompelled to write a summary as a cover page because the extensive \nredactions made the report difficult to understand. Without question, \nthe nature of this report also contributed to the number of redactions, \nsince it concentrated on SBA's oversight of one company. Even so, a \nmore thorough process would have undoubtedly resulted in far fewer \nredactions being made to the public version of this report. That said, \nSenator Snowe and I would like to see the OIG write reports in a manner \nthat allows for the maximum availability of information for the public \nwhenever possible.\n  The redacted passages that the committee is making public, in \naccordance with both Senate and committee rules, are those that the \ncommittee believes will be the most useful to the public and that were \nredacted under privileges that, given the passages themselves, are \noutweighed by the public good that can be gained by their disclosure. \nThe SBA asserted that the first three recommendations and the summary \nparagraph in its response should be redacted due to the ``deliberative \nprocess privilege,'' and for the first recommendation they also \nincluded the bank examination FOIA exemption and privilege. The \ndeliberative process privilege is exemption (b)(5) of the FOIA and \ncovers ``inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which \nwould not be available by law to a party other than an agency in \nlitigation with the agency.'' It traditionally covers the advice, \nrecommendations and subjective evaluation that agency staff make in the \nperformance of their duties. In this case, the public can see from the \nrelease of this information how the SBA and its OIG were interacting in \nthe investigation of SBA's failed oversight of BLX, a lender making \nGovernment-backed loans. Regarding the ``bank examination'' FOIA \nexemption (b)(8) and privilege claim, that exemption only pertained to \na portion of recommendation No. 1, for which SBA indicated it believed \nit could approve the release of an unredacted version.\n  SBA claims that the deliberative process privilege exemption applies \nbecause the OIG is a part of the agency. However, we believe that \napplying the exemption to the OIG--which is an independent office \ncreated within the SBA by law to conduct and supervise audits, \ninspections, and investigations relating to SBA programs and supporting \noperations; and to detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse--in the \nblanket manner SBA has done has the potential to render the OIG \nuseless. If the deliberative process privilege exemption is as broad as \nSBA asserts, then the recommendations in the reports that preceded this \none, as well as the two recommendations in the BLX report it did not \nredact, should have also been redacted. If that were the case, there \nwould be virtually no use in having an OIG.\n  We are very concerned that the SBA's actions in redacting key \ninformation and recommendations in the BLX could undermine the future \nauthority and efficacy of the OIG. The OIG is an independent office \ncreated within the SBA by law to conduct and supervise audits, \ninspections, and investigations relating to SBA programs and supporting \noperations; to detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse; and to \npromote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration \nand management of SBA programs. According to the SBA Web site, the SBA \ninspector general ``keeps the SBA Administrator and the Congress fully \ninformed of any problems, recommends corrective actions, and monitors \nprogress in the implementation of such actions.''\n  To resolve this situation, the committee has engaged in staff \ndiscussions with OIG and OGC with the intention of coming to an \nagreement with the OGC on additional portions of the report that could \nbe released. However, OGC has simply not been responsive. Even when \nmade aware of the committee's concern about the adequacy of its \nresponse, in subsequent followup by the committee, OGC did not address \ncritical issues and did not agree to make any new releases of \ninformation. It also continued asserting Executive Privilege which, as \nthe committee has previously pointed out, must be, and has not been, \nasserted by the President personally.\n  Therefore, to put an end to this matter, the committee is putting on \nthe record some information that was withheld to serve as an example of \na process gone wrong that prevented accountability in Government by \nkeeping from the public information about the oversight capabilities of \nan agency that, though comparatively small, can have a huge impact on \nour economy. BLX made over $76 million in fraudulent Government-backed \nloans despite SBA's oversight of their lending activities. More \ntransparency, not less, is called for to explain to the American people \nwhat happened and how it will be prevented in the future.\n  Without objection, I ask to have the redacted portion of the OIG's \nrecommendations printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       We recommend that the Associate Administrator for Capital \n     Access take further action to mitigate the risk posed by BLX \n     and to promote consistent and uniform enforcement actions by:\n       1. Setting specific performance goals and target dates for \n     BLX to demonstrate improvement. At a minimum, the goals \n     should require BLX to obtain a risk rating of at least ``3.''\n       2. Reducing the guaranty percentages for all new loans \n     originated by BLX, until such time as BLX has demonstrated \n     the required level of performance.\n       3. Suspending BLX's delegated lending authorities until the \n     goals in recommendation one are met.\n\n  The SBA's comments on those recommendations were completely redacted. \nThese sentences are from the first paragraph of the section that \nsummarizes the SBA's response.\n\n       SBA management partially agreed with recommendation 1, \n     neither agreed nor disagreed with recommendation 2, provided \n     a conflicting and unclear response to recommendation 4, and \n     disagreed with recommendations 3 and 5. Management noted that \n     it recently created a new Office of Credit Risk Management \n     (OCRM) out of the\n\n[[Page S10470]]\n\n     former OLO, which is now responsible for lender oversight. ).\n\n  While the former BLX's bankruptcy makes the contents of the report \nmoot to that particular company, we want to set the record straight on \nhow this matter was handled so that, hopefully, SBA will handle such \nreports with more openness in the future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10470-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10470-S10471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through an address set up specifically for this \npurpose to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       We have tried to have a fair amount of expendable income \n     for emergencies and unexpected expenses, but with the rising \n     gas prices we have seen this ``buffer'' disappear. We are \n     both employed outside the home and must drive a fair distance \n     to get to work. We have owned the same vehicles for over four \n     years. We do not have a lot of options to lower our fuel \n     costs. We cannot sell our home and move closer to our jobs. \n     We cannot sell our vehicles and buy more fuel efficient \n     vehicles so we are kind of stuck. For the first time in our \n     lives, we have had to resort to putting gasoline on credit \n     cards to get from paycheck to paycheck. It is not just the \n     gas prices, but I have seen a 400% increase in my power bill \n     that I have no explanation for. Nothing has changed in my \n     usage and, in fact, I switched to a gas dryer to try to \n     decrease consumption. But, last year my average power bill \n     was $30 a month. This year it is $120 a month. Also, I have \n     found that the $100 per week I spend on groceries only buys \n     half of what it used to. The rising gas prices have affected \n     many areas of my life and my budget. In fact, my husband was \n     asked to take a 10% cut in pay about two months ago because \n     the construction company he works for was having a difficult \n     time keeping up with rising costs in construction. It seems \n     like every aspect of our lives is being affected by the \n     rising gas prices, and we are powerless to do anything about \n     it. What is even more frustrating is knowing that the problem \n     could be remedied by the federal government if they would be \n     willing to take action. There are options available to use \n     our own resources and refuse to have an entire nation held \n     prisoner by foreign oil. I am aware of the concerns by \n     environmentalists, but I believe we have the technology to \n     remove these resources with minimal effect on the \n     environment. It is wrong to allow one group of individuals to \n     have the power to adversely affect an entire nation just \n     because they have the time and resources to scream in the \n     government's ear while the rest of America is too busy just \n     fighting to survive.\n       We are lucky because we have good-paying jobs and are able, \n     so far, to absorb the cost. But I worry about my children who \n     are struggling to make ends meet and raising their children \n     and are being forced sometimes to choose between buying food \n     or paying their utilities and putting gas in their car to get \n     to work. We all need help--now.\n     Jane, Iona.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to respond on the rising cost \n     of gasoline, food, energy, etc. I am amazed at how much \n     everything has risen in the past six months. My electricity \n     bill is on level pay (I do not like surprises so I opt to \n     have a set amount each month). This past month my level pay \n     went up $24 a month! I am already paying $95 a month for \n     natural gas to heat my home and water. Our city has just \n     raised the cost of water, garbage and sewer by $12 a month; \n     at least that is how much my bill went up.\n       Gasoline--boy, where do I start! When it started going up \n     three years ago, I started cutting back then; now there \n     really is not a lot that I can do. I plan my day around where \n     I need to go. I try to do everything in one day so that I am \n     not running into town for one item. We are walking or riding \n     our bikes to places that do not require us to carry a lot. If \n     I have a doctor's appointment, I try to make other \n     appointments the same day and spend the day going from one to \n     the other--doing shopping, errands, etc. all in that day. It \n     makes for a very long day, but then I do not drive anywhere \n     for two or three days. I think it saves me in the long run. I \n     do belong to a fitness club and try to carpool with my cousin \n     to that. We take turns driving and if we have errands to do, \n     we do them together if it is in the same area--saves us both \n     on gas.\n       I have a small business where I have to travel to people's \n     homes. I have had to charge a service call of $25 if it is \n     out of Pocatello. I used to give free estimates all around \n     the area, but I cannot afford it any more. If the clients \n     purchase from me, then I will apply the $25 to their order. \n     It is the only way I can afford to run my business. What else \n     can I do?\n       My two adult sons purchased scooters three years ago and \n     some of their friends at ISU laughed at them--now my sons are \n     the ones that are laughing as their friends tell them how \n     smart they were to get those scooters when they did, because \n     the price of them have doubled! My husband rides his \n     motorcycle to work (a 22-mile round trip) every day when the \n     weather is good. It saves us about $100 a month because we \n     are not filling his truck up weekly.\n       I wish that the government would listen to the people, not \n     those environmentalist wackos who are tree huggers. I want \n     more refineries in our country. I want more drilling in our \n     country. I do not like the fact that our money goes to those \n     foreign countries who hate America! Why are we supporting \n     them? They take our money, control the oil prices and are out \n     to get us one way or another! We need to become independent \n     of them--we do not need them--let's use the resources that \n     are in our own country! Let us make America great and the \n     super power we once was.\n       I wonder why the car manufacturers do not design a car that \n     gets better gas mileage! I know that the technology is there. \n     I heard about 25 years ago that a gentleman had developed a \n     car that got better gas mileage and the car manufacturers and \n     gas companies paid him millions for his plans and the rights \n     to them and he sold them to them. So I think that car \n     manufacturers are in cahoots with the gas companies too!\n       Another thing--we do not need to help those countries that \n     hate us. Stop sending aid to countries that want us dead! Let \n     them help themselves--we have our own problems here that we \n     really need to take care of--do not worry about these other \n     countries--take care of us!!\n     Debbie.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your concerns. It is appreciated. High fuel \n     prices have affected every single item we purchase and \n     everyday living. We spend roughly around $500 per month just \n     traveling to work and back home. We only travel when it is \n     absolutely necessary. We had planned a family reunion in \n     Washington State this summer, but have cancelled due to the \n     higher and ever increasing cost of fuel. We turn off our oil \n     furnace unless it is too cold that we cannot get by with \n     extra blankets. Our heating fuel cost for 1\\1/2\\ month is up \n     to $668. Food and necessities are up 20% from four months \n     ago, on most items. Clothing prices are up as much as 40% on \n     some items. Everything is costing more.\n       I am employed with a state entity. I received a 4% \n     increase, which I am grateful for, just enough of an increase \n     to cover the increase in cost of our health insurance. As you \n     can see, it does not cover the cost of inflation. My husband \n     and I now worry if we are going to have to save less for our \n     retirement in order to just live!\n       Our children have families of their own. It is even harder \n     for them. Even though Idaho has increased the wages, it still \n     does not seem to be in line with the continuing increases in \n     the cost of living. I do not see things getting any better in \n     the near future. In fact, I feel they will just get worse.\n     Anna.\n                                  ____\n\n       This e-mail is in response to your recent e-newsletter on \n     energy prices.\n       Stories: Our church is investing in modern, high-efficiency \n     heating and improved insulation including blinds over windows \n     that we believe will reduce energy use and cost. The downside \n     is that the money for these improvements and high energy \n     costs will not be spent on community mission work in \n     Pocatello and beyond.\n       Individual persons and families we know are changing \n     habits. We held a group discussion at worship to invite ideas \n     and solutions. Examples are: more use of bikes with emphasis \n     on Pocatello Free Bikes (rebuilt by teenagers) for people \n     with less money for new bikes; more thoughtful planning of \n     shopping trips such as combining stops rather than multiple \n     home-store trips; use of mass transit and calls for more \n     organized carpooling in Pocatello; calls for coordination \n     between bus fleet operators (Pocatello, School District 25, \n     ISU, etc.) to increase flexibility and service. We all lose \n     some choices in how we use our time.\n       Some commuters (Pocatello to Blackfoot or Idaho Falls) are \n     looking for work closer to home. Pocatello is a poor city \n     with average per capita income only about \\2/3\\ the national \n     average. Workers who accept lower pay in Pocatello to \n     compensate for high motor fuel costs simply reduce the \n     disposable income in town. The long-term effect will be local \n     businesses further in decline (or not growing and expanding) \n     and a shift of economy to grey-market (you help me fix my \n     car; I'll help fix your deck) that is outside normal commerce \n     and taxation. So this impact will begin to reduce government \n     income.\n       There is more discussion among thoughtful people about \n     sustainability than I have heard in years. People are asking \n     questions about an energy-intensive economy that will\n\n[[Page S10471]]\n\n     reveal massive cheap energy misuse and waste in the \n     agriculture system; considering community design around live-\n     work-play areas as opposed to commuting; and raising concerns \n     that short-term greed in the energy economic system will lead \n     to further economic class division and injustices. Congress \n     cannot allow our economy to decline to a survival of the \n     richest over the general public without inciting class \n     warfare. We are seeing the beginnings of mass protest \n     worldwide--trucker strikes, etc.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thoughts on Congressional priorities.\n       Short-term: Get the Department of Energy to be pro-active. \n     US-DOE has lots of information on their web site but little \n     seems to be circulating in terms of press releases, \n     supplements to K-12 or university education, advice to \n     businesses about how to conserve and make better energy \n     investments leading to sustainability.\n       Do not give blanket permission to energy companies to use \n     non-renewable resources (e.g. drilling on land, off-shore, \n     sensitive areas, dirty coal, etc.) until a parallel energy \n     use reduction for sustainability system is working. Using our \n     children's and grandchildren's resources to feed the pig of \n     US energy consumption levels and obscene energy company \n     profits now would be immoral.\n       Do more to expand public education around energy and \n     resource conservation for a sustainable US energy future. \n     This should be a crash project. I wrote to you, Sen. Craig \n     and Rep. Simpson recommending that the 2005 Federal Energy \n     Bill include funding for education. There is not a penny. So \n     market forces (AKA Greed) are driving the energy train now. \n     Coordinate all the players in the energy mess: governments \n     (federal, state, and local); corporations and other \n     businesses; non-government/non-profit organizations \n     (information and advocacy, compassionate action for impacted \n     people); and, organized crime (like Enron-thinking companies \n     who are taking windfall profits). Use principles of social \n     marketing that uses commercial advertising/marketing tools to \n     sell products but for common good purposes (anti-smoking, \n     AIDS prevention, etc.)\n       Longer/long-term: Get the Department of Energy to be pro-\n     active in developing policy and programs. These folks have \n     not developed viable federal energy policy or jaw-boned to \n     reduce corporate greed for decades. For example, technology \n     and policy for nuclear power developed into the 70s simply \n     died in favor of status-quo non-renewable resource use and \n     shift of food production (corn) to energy. If the nation \n     could build nuclear bombs and nuclear submarines in crash \n     projects in the past, the nation can do it again!\n       Support the next President of the United States in \n     collaborating with other nations about energy sustainability \n     worldwide through the United Nations. Revitalize and support \n     treaties and alliances among groups willing to sacrifice and \n     change to achieve sustainability on the planet. Without this \n     effort there will be conflict and violence over competition \n     for dwindling non-renewable resources. Competition for Iraq \n     oil is the tip of the iceberg here.\n       Actively promote public education, research and development \n     for the two major non-polluting energy sources: nuclear power \n     and solar power. Support renewable energy research into \n     smaller make-a-difference energy contributions such as wind, \n     tidal, geothermal, etc. Support research in related \n     technology such as: high-MPG vehicles, innovative mass \n     transit, and improved batteries to store solar/wind energy, \n     easy-to-use sensors for home and business energy audit \n     (thermal/electrical waste). Pay for energy research by \n     cutting back on spending for fear reduction by violence--\n     reduce military missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and shift to \n     political, diplomatic, economic efforts with other nations \n     involved.\n       Use the national energy crisis as a lever to re-think the \n     role of corporations. Once corporations were set up to help \n     remove liability from individuals so they would take risk, \n     invest, and build enterprise for America and Americans. Over \n     the past few decades, corporations have lost their social \n     responsibility and think of top management and shareholders \n     as the only stakeholders worthy of decisions. But \n     corporations are the nation's best hope for good jobs and \n     `doing well by doing good.' If you folk cannot help get \n     corporations back into part of the American dream for all \n     Americans then the masses will push for government shift \n     toward socialism. I lived and worked in the UK for many years \n     and know the stifling effect of an entitlement mentality.\n                                                         Laurence.\n       I am a Federal Police Officer, and I work at the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs hospital in Boise. I live 50 miles from \n     the VA, so I have a daily commute of 100 miles. My wife and I \n     would consider moving closer to Boise; however, she is a \n     federal employee at the Mountain Home Air Force Base. She has \n     a 20-mile daily commute (roundtrip). I prefer for her to have \n     a shorter commute than me.\n       We do see the effects of the higher gas prices. I drive a \n     2002 Ford Ranger 4X4. I never wanted to own a full-size \n     truck, and I am glad I bought the Ranger. However, the best \n     mileage I can get is about 21 mpg. I would hate to sell my \n     truck, because we need it for working on our land. Besides \n     that, it is tough to get a load of lumber at the Home Depot \n     in a little economy car. So, I eat the gas prices and \n     continue to work at my good federal job. We are cutting back \n     on some of the things we like to do, such as go out to \n     dinner, golf, and travel. These are all things that help the \n     economy, and we enjoy doing them. But something has to be \n     done, hence the cutbacks. I am also spending the night in \n     Boise at least one night a week so I can avoid the commute, \n     and the gas station. I do not like being away from my family, \n     but it is another sacrifice I have to make to save at the \n     pump.\n       I hate to think about the future, as the price of gas will \n     be passed down to food, clothing, and other essential \n     elements of life. I pray that the government will open up \n     drilling, build more refineries, and start building more \n     nuclear plants. We need to cut our ties with OPEC and other \n     corrupt oil-producing countries.\n       Congress, please help us!\n     Greg, Mountain Home.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am happy to see you working on the renewable energy \n     efficiency caucus. For 28 years before recent retirement, I \n     founded and owned the first solar electricity equipment \n     business in Idaho, providing electric systems for homes \n     located beyond the reach of power lines, of which there are \n     many in our state. My own home has been primarily powered by \n     solar and wind since 1978.\n       I would like to point out that Idaho drivers actually do \n     have some important choices available which you did not \n     mention at the start of your newsletter where you said we \n     have no choice but to keep driving. The choice of exactly \n     what vehicle we drive, as well as consolidating travel for \n     efficiency can cut family fuel costs by 25% or more. \n     Traveling in Europe and Central America one sees many fuel-\n     efficient vehicles that are not even available to Americans: \n     the small diesel flatbeds that carry more weight than a pick-\n     up truck and use less fuel to do it (they are slower going up \n     hills). While traveling in Ireland and England for a month \n     last year, we did not see even one standard pick-up truck, \n     for the reason of fuel efficiency. And I did see many quality \n     small cars and scooters that are not imported to the US, such \n     as a motor scooter with seat back and roof by BMW.\n       I would also question whether your efforts to stifle \n     climate change legislation in trade for avoiding high fuel \n     costs in the short term make economic sense in the long-term \n     interests of US citizens. If what is said of climate change \n     effects comes to pass, those with credentials to know have \n     shown that taking no action to mitigate those effects now may \n     not be in the best interests of the country or our \n     descendents. Please consider the long range balance of \n     benefit here.\n       I have watched inventors working on their own electric cars \n     (Orin Bridges, now deceased, here in Sandpoint converted his \n     car to electric plug-in and drove it 15 miles to town and \n     back in the 1990s, and recharged it from solar panels on the \n     roof of his mountain house). I have seen buses of college \n     kids come through teaching classes on bio-diesel, which \n     powered the bus they traveled in, also around year 2000. And \n     for decades I sold and installed solar electric modules as \n     the most economical power option for people living over half \n     a mile from the nearest power line.\n       Now that world fuel production has not increased for three \n     years running and fuel demand and prices are rising, we are \n     seeing tremendous mainstream progress in looking at \n     sustainable fuel sources and independence from imported oil. \n     Please check the January edition of Scientific American for a \n     national solution for the electric grid that uses technology \n     available today, and costs no more than the Iraq war has cost \n     to date.\n     Steve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10471-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10471-S10472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have the honor of rising today to \nrecognize an important part of Detroit's public education, my alma \nmater, Detroit Central High School, which is celebrating the 150th \nanniversary of its opening.\n  Since 1858, when the first 24 students entered a single classroom, \nthousands of students have passed through its doors. It was originally \nconceived to help prepare students to study at the University of \nMichigan, then just a few decades old itself. Today, Central has been \ncontinuously accredited by the University of Michigan for more than 135 \nconsecutive years.\n  It has occupied the current location at Tuxedo Avenue and La Salle \nBoulevard for more than 80 years.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a great citizen \nof Michigan, the Honorable Avern Cohn. Avern has distinguished himself \nas a leader among leaders in Michigan's legal community and the \nMichigan community at large. Later this month Avern's synagogue, \nCongregation Shaarey Zedek, will offer a tribute to him and I am \nhonored to join in recognizing his many accomplishments and \ncontributions to our community life that he has so strengthened and \nsupported.\n  Professionally, for nearly three decades Judge Cohn has served on the \nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. He currently \nserves as the Senior Judge, a position he has held for the past nine \nyears. His quick wit and sharp mind have left a lasting impression on \nthe countless attorneys who have argued before him. Throughout his \ncareer, Avern's guiding beacon has been justice, and his legacy is one \nof true independence and impartiality.\n  Avern's commitment to justice in Michigan has extended well beyond \nhis courtroom. He is a past director of the Detroit Bar Association, a \nformer trustee of the Detroit Bar Foundation, and served as director of \nthe American Judicature Society. Before he was appointed to the court, \nhe led a successful private practice that continues to flourish today. \nHe also served the people of Michigan in an array of positions \nincluding as chairperson of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, \nchairperson of the Detroit Board of Police Commissioners, and as a \nmember of the Michigan Social Welfare Commission.\n  As a member of the board of trustees of Shaarey Zedek, a former \npresident of the Jewish Welfare Federation of Metropolitan Detroit, and \na past vice president of the American Jewish Committee, Avern has used \nhis intellect and drive to the great benefit of our Jewish community. \nHe has also helped bring the focus and resources of these organizations \nto the fight for the poorest and most vulnerable among us. He is a \nmensch in the truest sense: his wholehearted dedication to a host of \nnoble causes has marked his character and his life.\n  I should mention as well that it was Avern's father who introduced my \nparents to each other. I am proud to call Avern my cousin.\n  Avern is recognized far and wide as a rarity. All who have known him, \nwho have had the good fortune to work with him, or who have come before \nhim are appreciative of his unique commitment to doing what is right. \nMany who have never heard his name have benefited and will continue to \nbenefit from his lifetime of good deeds. Barb joins me in offering our \nthanks and congratulations to Avern.

Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the 2008 \nMinor League Triple-A baseball champions, the Sacramento River Cats.\n  On September 16, 2008, the Sacramento River Cats, of the Pacific \nCoast League, PCL, defeated the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees, of the \nInternational League, 4 to 1 in the Bricktown Showdown to become back-\nto-back Triple-A champions. Sacramento is the Triple-A affiliate of the \nOakland Athletics.\n  The Sacramento River Cats finished the regular season atop the \nPacific Coast League Southern Division with a record of 83 wins and 61 \nlosses. The River Cats were assisted this season by their always \nfaithful fan base, which has led Triple-A in attendance for nine \nconsecutive seasons.\n  In the opening playoff series between the River Cats and the Salk \nLake City Bees, the River Cats excelled by scoring 39 runs en route to \na 3-games-to-1 series victory. The series victory demonstrated the \nRiver Cats' depth of talent as four starting pitchers, four relief \npitchers, two infielders, and one outfielder were called up to the \nOakland Athletics before the series began.\n  In the Pacific Coast League Championship Series, the River Cats \ndefeated the Texas Rangers Triple-A affiliate Oklahoma City Red Hawks, \nwinning the series three games to one to repeat as PCL champions. \nDuring this series, the River Cats proved their ability to perform on \nthe road by achieving two of their three victories in Oklahoma. The win \nalso earned the River Cats their fourth Pacific Coast League \nChampionship in the last 6 years.\n  In the Triple-A championship game, River Cats manager Todd Steverson \nshowcased his talented pitching staff. The River Cats used six pitchers \nwho combined for nine strikeouts while only giving up a single run. The \nvictory gave the Pacific Coast League all three of the Triple-A \nchampionships since the Triple-A championship game was reinstated 3 \nyears ago.\n  As the River Cats' fans, players, and staff gather to celebrate this \nremarkable accomplishment, I would like to congratulate them on an \noutstanding season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10472-3", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NORTH CAROLINA AZALEA FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I recognize the 62nd North Carolina \nAzalea Festival, NCAF, which will be held from April 1-5, 2009, in the \nGreater Wilmington area.\n  The Azalea Festival is a showcase for Wilmington's rich array of \nartwork, gardens, history and a testimony to the rich heritage of \ncoastal Carolina. This year's celebration marks the 50th anniversary of \nthe Azalea's Festival's name being changed from the Wilmington Azalea \nFestival to the North Carolina Azalea Festival.\n  The NCAF is Wilmington's annual community celebration and the largest \nfestival of its kind in the State. This festival encourages \nvolunteerism and civic participation as it contributes to the region's \neconomy and promotes the unique qualities of Wilmington's river-to-the-\nsea community.\n  The festival's concerts, fairs and special events are viewed by more \nthan 1 million people each year, in person and through media coverage. \nMore than 200,000 people are estimated to attend the annual 2-day \nstreet fair, while more than 100,000 gather to watch the festival \nparade.\n  It takes an extensive volunteer network to run the NCAF. More than \n1,000 volunteers are needed to stage over 125 events ranging from \nconcerts to art shows, a street fair with interactive displays, home \nand garden tours, a parade, special exhibits, a circus, and a variety \nof other entertainment and events.\n  The NCAF generates an additional approximate $5 million to the area's \neconomy and the Southeast Tourism Society selected the NCAF as one of \nits top 20 events for the second year in a row.\n  I am pleased to recognize the unique cultural and historical \ncontributions of the 62nd annual North Carolina Azalea \nFestival.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10472-4", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10472-S10473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING GULFSTREAM AEROSPACE CORPORATION\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge an \nimportant occasion in the history of Savannah, GA, and the business-\naviation industry--the 50th anniversary of Gulfstream flight.\n  Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation got its start in 1958 when Grumman \nAircraft Engineering Company, a company known for military aircraft \nproduction, developed the first aircraft specifically designed for \nbusiness travel.\n  On August 14, 1958, Grumman test pilots Carl Alber and Fred Rowley \ntook that aircraft--the twin-engine turboprop Gulfstream I--on its \nmaiden flight over the company's headquarters in Bethpage, NY. After \n800 hours of additional testing, the G-1 received Federal Aviation \nAdministration certification on May 21, 1959.\n\n[[Page S10473]]\n\n  The G-1 laid the foundation for the future of Gulfstream Aerospace. \nFive decades after that first flight and more than four decades after \nmoving to Savannah, Gulfstream has manufactured more than 1,800 \naircraft. The company's jets have been used to train NASA crew members, \ntransport top Government officials, and support our Armed Forces, \nmaking Gulfstream a vital part of America's aerospace industry.\n  Gulfstream also plays a key role in the city of Savannah, where its \nworkforce has grown from just 100 employees in 1967 to more than 6,000 \ntoday, making it the largest manufacturing employer in the city. That \nworkforce is expected to grow even more in years to come thanks to a 7-\nyear, $400 million-plus Long-Range Facilities Master Plan that includes \nat least 1,100 new jobs.\n  I am delighted to recognize the golden anniversary of Gulfstream \nflight and to congratulate its employees on their many contributions to \nthe community, the country, and the worldwide aviation industry. With \nthe help of its employees, Gulfstream has become a corporate citizen of \nthe highest standard. I commend Gulfstream Aerospace on all their \nachievements and look forward to their continued success in the city of \nSavannah and the great State of Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10473-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nmoments today to pay tribute to the Employee Benefit Research \nInstitute, or EBRI, on the occasion of its 30th anniversary. EBRI is a \nwell-known, nonpartisan research institution providing invaluable \nanalysis, briefings, and publications on health and retirement issues, \nwhich are critically important to both America's workers and the \nemployers that sponsor these benefits. The high-quality and objective \nwork done by EBRI has won it respect within the halls of Congress, \namong members on both sides of the aisle in the House of \nRepresentatives and in the Senate.

In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Bettendorf Community School District received a 2001 Harkin \nconstruction grant for $75,000 which it used for a fitness education \ncenter and a 2002 Harkin fire life safety grant for $150,000 which was \nused for an addition to the high school. The Federal grants have made \nit possible for the district to provide quality and safe schools for \ntheir students.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute superintendent Harrison Cass, Jr., former \nsuperintendents Marty Lucas and John Perdue, the entire staff, \nadministration, and governance in the Bettendorf Community School \nDistrict.

In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, \nsome 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The \nharsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United \nStates is nearly 50 years.\n  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming \nsports arenas on weekends but during the week go to school in rundown \nor antiquated facilities.

As you know, Iowa public schools \nhave an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores \nare among the highest in the Nation.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes today to salute the dedicated \nteachers, administrators, and school board members in the Harmony \nCommunity School District, and to report on their participation in a \nunique Federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities.\n  This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction \nGrant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among \neducators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public \nschools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 \nmillion for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school \ndistricts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Harmony Community School District received several Harkin grants \ntotaling $1,198,374. A 2000 construction grant for $315,799 was used to \nhelp build an addition to the elementary school in Bonaparte and to \nrenovate the historic school. A 2002 grant for $757,575 helped build an \naddition to the high school which included a computer lab. This grant \nalso enabled the district to make renovations to the middle school and \nhigh school facilities and to install a new HVAC system at the high \nschool. These schools are the modern, state-of-the-art facilities that \nbefit the educational ambitions and excellence of this school district. \nIndeed, they are the kind of schools that every child in America \ndeserves. The district also received four fire safety grants totaling \n$125,000 to make improvements throughout the district.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in \nthe Harmony Community School District. In particular, I would like to \nrecognize the leadership of the board of education--Dennis Grossman, \nTracey Hudson, Tina Denly, Cody Warth and Bill Rice and former board \nmembers Burton Mills, Barb Wellman, Dave Drummond, Myron Helmers, Steve \nAdam, Matt Mitchell and David Hellwieg. I would also like to recognize \nsuperintendent Joe Hundeby, former superintendents Alan Marshall and \nKelly Rogers.\n  As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in \nIowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings \nand facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation \nor replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, \nsome 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The \nharsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United \nStates is nearly 50 years.\n  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming \nsports arenas on weekends but during the week go to school in rundown \nor antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message to our \nyoung people about our priorities. We have to do better.\n  That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in \nthe Harmony Community School District. There is no question that a \nquality public education for every child is a top priority in that \ncommunity.

Mr. President, today I wish to speak in regards \nto the Blue Water Creek Massacre of 1855. On September 3, 1855, while \ncamped near the Blue Water Creek in present day Nebraska, a group of \nLakota were attacked by COL William S. Harney and his troops. According \nto Army records, 86 Lakota were killed and 70 captured. The Battle of \nBlue Water Creek is also known as the Battle of Ash Hollow or the \nHarney Massacre according to the Nebraska State Historical Society, \nwhich maintains a historical marker, along U.S. 26, 1\\1/2\\ miles west \nof Lewellen, NE.\n  There are several historical accounts of what transpired that day in \n1855 and the Little Thunder Tiospaye contacted me because they seek to \ncommemorate and to preserve for future generations the history \nsurrounding Mni To Wakpala--Blue Water Creek. They are the direct \nlineal descendants of Wakinyan Cikala--Little Thunder--a man who was \namongst the leaders of that Lakota camp destroyed 153 years ago. \nAdditional leaders who survived that morning include Iron Shell, \nSpotted Tail, and Red Leaf, each of whom also bore lineal descendants \nliving upon Sicangu territories today.\n  According to the family, oral history passed down through generations \ntells the story of the younger Little Thunder, a boy who survived the \nMassacre and subsequently journeyed to join his relatives once again. \nWithout his survival, the Little Thunder Tiospaye\n\n[[Page S10480]]\n\nwould not exist today. I would like to recognize their work as they \nseek to honor their ancestors by collecting historical accounts, and \nlocating important artifacts from this time in history. Accordingly, \nthe Lakota language includes an expression that fits their mission: \nHecel lena Oyate kin nipi kte, so that our people may live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10480-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GEORGE WARRINGTON\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in light of today's historic \nvote on the Amtrak reauthorization legislation, I wish to honor a great \ntransportation leader and a son of New Jersey George Warrington, who \npassed away at his home in Mendham, NJ, on December 24, 2007. During a \npublic service career that spanned more than 30 years, Mr. Warrington \nheld an influential and decisive role in the development and continued \nsuccess of public transportation systems not just in our State of New \nJersey but throughout the entire region. His role in the early \ndevelopment of NJ Transit helped make the agency what it is today one \nof the largest and most successful transit agencies in the country.\n  George Warrington's contributions to public transportation cannot be \noverstated. His work to secure funding for NJ Transit in the 1970s was \ncrucial to the creation and early development of the agency. He later \nserved as vice president and general manager of NJ Transit's rail \noperations and brought a necessary focus on customer service, ontime \nperformance, and repairing the rail system's infrastructure. He worked \ntirelessly to expand regional rail capacity by adding additional \nseating in cars and parking spaces at stations across the State. He \nalso promoted the development of new rail lines, such as the Midtown \nDirect Montclair service and Newark Light Rail extension, and he \nspearheaded the addition of key rail stations such as Hoboken Terminal \nand Secaucus Junction. These initiatives were central in creating and \nmaintaining a successful public railroad transportation system in New \nJersey and the surrounding region, and I was proud to secure Federal \nfunding for these efforts.\n  George's efforts on one project, in particular, will help secure the \neconomic future of the New Jersey-New York region and that is the new \nHudson River Rail Tunnel. Also called the Trans-Hudson Express, THE, \nTunnel, part of the Access to the Region's Core, ARC, Project, this new \nrail tunnel will ensure that travel between New Jersey and Manhattan by \nrail will be available well into the future. Existing tunnels are \nalready at capacity during peak hours, with trains moving through them \nat a rate of one every 2\\1/2\\ minutes. Without this new tunnel, our \nregion's economy will suffer. New Jerseyans would lose out on a \nconvenient and environmentally friendly way to commute to work into New \nYork City and New York City would lose out on a strong and dedicated \nlabor pool of New Jersey workers. George garnered critical early \nsupport for the new tunnel project from both sides of the river, a feat \nacknowledged by many experts as vital to the project.\n  George Warrington also listened to passengers and employees, a \ncritical feature of any successful organization. He considered their \ninput in new rail car designs, such as the popular new multilevel cars. \nThese rail cars eliminate the dreaded ``third seat,'' while adding to \nthe overall number of seats in the car.\n  For several years, George also served as executive director of the \nDelaware River Port Authority, which governs the Delaware River port \nsystem, four major vehicle bridges in the region, and the PATCO rail \nsystem. He is credited with speeding up project delivery times and \nmanaging the conversion to collecting tolls in just one direction on \nthe bridges.\n  George Warrington must also be recognized for his significant \ncontributions to national transportation as Amtrak's corporate \npresident and CEO and chief executive of its Northeast corridor. He was \ninstrumental in the launching of Acela Express, the nation's first \nhigh-speed rail line, as well as carrying out the completion of the \nelectrification of the entire Northeast corridor rail line between \nBoston and Washington, DC, another project I was proud to secure \nFederal funding for. The Northeast corridor now offers the country's \npremier high-speed rail service and carries more passengers than all of \nthe airlines combined between key northeastern cities. George will \nalways be remembered as an important advocate of a strong national rail \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, while George Warrington passed away on December 24, \n2007, his legacy lives on through his family and through his lasting \ncontributions to the rail industry both in New Jersey and throughout \nthe Nation. On behalf of the people of New Jersey, I am proud to \ncommemorate his many achievements to make New Jersey and our Nation a \nbetter place and convey our best wishes to his family and \nfriends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10480-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10480-S10481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING REV. DR. WALTER SOBOLEFF\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, when Americans think about what \nthey most admire about my home State of Alaska, the breathtaking \nscenery first comes to mind. What I most admire about my home State of \nAlaska are the people, and in particular our Native Elders.\n  Our Elders are the bearers of our uniquely Alaskan culture. They have \naccepted the responsibility of ensuring that succeeding generations \nknow where they came from. They preserve and transmit the traditions \nthat make Alaska different from anyplace else.\n  Looking at the face of an Alaska Native Elder is like looking at the \nconcentric rings in the trunk of a tree. Every line on that face \nrepresents a precious slice of Alaska history.\n  It would be a vast understatement to characterize the Elders as \nwitnesses to Alaska history. They are the living embodiment of Alaska's \nhistory. They were the first generation of Alaskans to experience and \nadapt to the challenge of living in two worlds. They have come to \nembrace the traditional world of subsistence and the modern world of \nthe Internet in the same breath. Some like the individual I speak about \ntoday have devoted their lives to preserving Alaska Native languages as \nspoken and written languages for all eternity.\n  Today I pay tribute to a most respected Tlingit Elder, the Reverend \nDoctor Walter Soboleff, who will celebrate his 100th birthday on \nNovember 14, 2008. Walter Soboleff was born on a small island called \nKillisnoo near Admiralty Island in Southeast Alaska. His father was the \nson of a Russian Orthodox priest serving in Southeast Alaska. His \nmother, a Tlingit Indian. Four languages were spoken in his home: \nRussian, German, English, and Tlingit.\n  Walter Soboleff was educated at a US Government Indian school on his \nisland and subsequently at the Sheldon Jackson School in Sitka. Several \nyears after graduating from Sheldon Jackson with a high school diploma \nhe enrolled at Dubuque University in Iowa, receiving a bachelor's \ndegree in education in 1937 and a divinity degree in 1940.\n  Ordained as a Presbyterian minister he returned to Southeast Alaska \nto take the pulpit at the Memorial Presbyterian Church in Juneau. The \nchurch, which was built to minister to the Tlingit people, opened its \ndoors to all. Its congregation included Caucasians and African \nAmericans, and Filipinos as well as Haidas and Tsimshians.\n  We take diverse congregations like this for granted in 21st Century \nAlaska. It must be remembered, though, that Jim Crow racial segregation \nlaws and practices were quite prevalent in pre-World War II Southeast \nAlaska.\n  Reverend Soboleff emerged a key player in the maintaining and \nenhancing the Tlingit culture, serving seven terms as President of the \nAlaska Native Brotherhood and broadcasting church services in Tlingit \non the radio. From 1962-1970 he took his ministry to the water \ntraveling on mission vessels to Native villages, logging camps and \nCoast Guard facilities in the archipelago of islands that make up \nSoutheast Alaska.\n  In 1952, Reverend Soboleff accepted a commission in the Alaska Army \nNational Guard, serving as Chaplain for 20 years, retiring with rank of \nLieutenant Colonel on February 1, 1973.\n  In 1970, Walter Soboleff founded the Alaska Native Studies Department \nat the University of Alaska Fairbanks. He\n\n[[Page S10481]]\n\ntaught Tlingit history, language and literature, retiring again in \n1974.\n  You may have discovered that it is difficult to use the words \nretirement and Walter Soboleff in the same sentence. Every time Walter \nSoboleff retires he embarks on a new and ever more vital project.\n  Awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity by Dubuque University in 1952 \nand an honorary Doctor of Humanities by the University of Alaska \nFairbanks in 1968 he continues to serve as Pastor Emeritus of the \nNorthern Lights United Church in Juneau and as a member of the Board of \nTrustees of the Sealaska Heritage Foundation. And lest I forget, he was \nthe first Alaska Native to serve on the Alaska State Board of \nEducation, where he served as chairman.\n  I think I can speak for the entire Senate in wishing the Reverend \nDoctor Walter Soboleff a happy 100th birthday. We extend our best \nwishes to Dr. Soboleff for continued good health and good \nworks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10481-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING LARRY G. SALYERS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish today to congratulate \nLarry G. Salyers on his years of service as the manager of Tri-State \nAirport. Larry's hard work and continuous efforts have greatly enhanced \nthis important regional airport as well as the community it serves. I \nam honored to have served with him and to share his story with you \ntoday.\n  In December 1975, Larry began working at the airport as Director of \nOperations and Security. He exhibited extraordinary dedication and hard \nwork and, in March 1980 he was promoted to assistant airport manager. \nIn 1981, he was named acting manager and by May 1982 he was appointed \nas the airport manager.\n  Under Larry's leadership, the airport has experienced many positive \nchanges. He has overseen numerous structural renovations in Tri-State's \nterminal design and the conditions of the runways. At present, the \nairport is in the process of a major runway extension which will allow \nTri-State to continue its reputation for excellence for many years to \ncome. Larry has also diligently worked to ensure that the airport has \nthe best maintenance vehicles and equipment possible.\n  Throughout his long service, Larry has seen Tri-State Airport through \nsome of the aviation industry's hardest times. He has seen the \nderegulation of the industry which left many small communities across \nthe country with significantly diminished air service. The September 11 \nterrorist attacks also had enormous repercussions throughout the \naviation business as many airlines went into bankruptcy and new \nsecurity measures were required at all the Nation's airports. Tri-\nState, like many small airports across the country, is often the first \nto feel the pain during trying times for the aviation industry and the \nlast to recover. Despite these challenges, Larry was able to \nsuccessfully keep everything going, and I am pleased to say that in \nrecent years, Tri-State Airport has seen significant financial and \npassenger growth. Between 2006 and 2007, passenger traffic increased by \n62 percent, and the airport is currently producing its highest boarding \nnumbers in over 13 years. Much of this success can be directly \ncontributed to Larry's efforts to bring Allegiants Air's low-fare \nflights to the airport. This accomplishment has helped Tri-State \nAirport to contribute roughly $50 million annually to the local \neconomy.\n  The hard work and dedication of Larry Salyers personifies the \nattitude of America and the true nature of West Virginians. When he \nretires, he will have left Tri-State Airport and the region around the \ncity of Huntington better than it was when he first began his career \nthere over 33 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10481-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10481-S10482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL HENRY A. ``TREY'' OBERING, III\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I honor a great American, a \nnative of Birmingham, AL, LTG Henry A. ``Trey'' Obering III, on the \noccasion of his retirement after 35 years of dedicated service to our \ncountry. His passion for progressing missile defense has been \nimperative to its success and critical to our national security and the \nsafety of our allies.\n  General Obering entered the Air Force in 1973 and received his \npilot's wings in 1975. From there he went on to become a skilled air-\nto-air Top Gun-trained F-4E pilot and lead a very distinguished career. \nAs an Air Force captain, General Obering was assigned to the Space \nShuttle Program the year before the first orbiter flew into space. \nGeneral Obering became an important part of this pioneering endeavor \nand participated in 15 space shuttle launches as a NASA orbiter project \nengineer.\n  I want to highlight the critical role General Obering played in \ndeveloping, testing, and fielding this Nation's ballistic missile \ndefense system. General Obering joined the Missile Defense Agency in \nDecember of 2001, the very month the United States announced its \nwithdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which had \nseriously impeded the development and deployment of missile defenses. \nHe deserves credit for the tremendous progress our Nation has made in \nrecent years in the field of missile defense. The advancement of all \napproaches to ballistic missile defense, BMD, including kinetic energy \ninterceptor, KEI, ground-based midcourse defense, GMD, Aegis ballistic \nmissile defense, and terminal high altitude area defense system, THAAD, \ncan be attributed to the hard work of General Obering and those he has \nled.\n  Under General Obering's leadership, the Agency addressed current and \nemerging ballistic missile threats by fielding missile defenses at an \nunprecedented pace to defend the United States, our deployed troops, \nand U.S. allies and friends around the world. During his tenure as \ndirector, the Agency emplaced ground-based interceptors in Alaska and \nCalifornia, developed and deployed missile defenses to defeat shorter-\nrange threats to our troops and our allies, and successfully modified \n18 U.S. Navy Aegis warships to give U.S. military commanders a highly \neffective regional ballistic missile defense capability.\n  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our missile defense to our \nfriends, our allies, and, importantly, those that would mean us harm, \nGeneral Obering presided over a series of historic flight tests of our \nballistic missile defense system and spearheaded efforts to train the \nwarfighters employing the system. These tests proved to our allies that \nwe are prepared to defend ourselves and our allies and will pursue \ntechnologies to further reduce and eventually eliminate the threat of \nattack by ballistic missiles.\n  General Obering has pursued an aggressive development program to \naddress future threats, such as boost phase defenses, space tracking \nand surveillance, and technologies to destroy multiple threat objects \nusing a single interceptor.\n  General Obering recognized early on the importance of working with \nour international partners and he led the expansion of the Department's \nmissile defense cooperative activities. He pursued bilateral programs \nwith Japan, Israel, the Czech Republic, and Poland, among others, as \nwell as multilateral programs with NATO. Working closely with the State \nDepartment and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, General \nObering's vision and personal engagement resulted in a broad consensus \namong international leaders, combatant commanders, and the \ninternational communities on the growing need to establish long-range \nmissile defenses in Europe.\n  General Obering has overseen the expansion of the Missile Defense \nAgency. During his tenure, while executing all of the activities in one \nof the most important programs in the Department of Defense, the Agency \nsuccessfully underwent unprecedented organizational changes. Thanks to \nhis guidance, this transition is proceeding smoothly.\n  General Obering's leadership proved critical during two real-world \ncrises. During North Korea's provocative missile launches in July 2006, \nGeneral Obering oversaw the Agency's input to the Nation's strategic \nresponse and provided situational awareness to the President, combatant \ncommanders, and the missile defense community. His assurances that the \nNation had the option of a responsive missile defense capability, had \nit been necessary, contributed greatly to the maintenance of \ninternational stability. And in February 2008, General Obering also led \nthe\n\n[[Page S10482]]\n\nAgency's participation in a successful national joint mission to \ndestroy an out-of-control U.S. satellite laden with toxic hydrazine \nfuel.\n  General Obering has consistently exemplified a true dedication to our \nNation and its ideals. His vision and drive enabled the Missile Defense \nAgency to field a truly worldwide ballistic missile defense capability \nthat will be a part of this Nation's defensive infrastructure for \ndecades to come. Our Nation owes a debt of gratitude to General Obering \nfor his outstanding leadership and service. I am proud to express my \nappreciation for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10482-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JAMES HERMAN FAULKNER, SR.\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to James \nHerman ``Jimmy'' Faulkner, Sr., a friend, who passed away last month. \n``Mr. jimmy'' to the scores who knew and admired him, was a great \nAlabamian who, during his life, served as a mayor, State senator, \ncandidate for governor, newspaper publisher, businessman, and \nphilanthropist.\n  Born in Lamar County, AL, the son of a schoolteacher and a farmer, he \nlost his father at the age of 12. He attended college in Tennessee and \nthe School of Journalism at the University of Missouri. At age 20, he \npurchased The Baldwin Times newspaper and moved to Baldwin County, AL, \nwhere he lived his life and became one of, if not the most, well known \nof its citizens.\n  Mr. Jimmy served as the Mayor of Bay Minette, AL, from 1941 to 1943, \nwhen he was called to serve in World War II as a first lieutenant, \npilot, and flight instructor. Following that service, he represented \nBaldwin County in the Alabama State Senate, where he became an advocate \nfor education and the State's teachers.\n  He served as Chairman of the Board of Directors for Alabama Christian \nCollege in Montgomery, and as a testament to his success in putting \nthat institution in a position of financial stability and his personal \ngenerosity, it was renamed Faulkner University in his honor in 1985. \nRemarkably, because he was instrumental in bringing Faulkner State \nUniversity, a community college, to Baldwin County, that State \nuniversity is also named for him. Few persons, if any, have had both a \nprivate and State university named in their honor.\n  Mr. Jimmy believed in Baldwin County. He brought business to the \ncounty. A friend of his, Scott Hunter, told me that Jimmy told him in \n1990 to buy all the real estate he could in Baldwin County because it \nwould double in population by 2010. And it has. Jimmy was able to \npredict economic, demographic, and political changes with uncanny \naccuracy. He lived to know 14 Alabama governors and he wrote, ``We have \nhad some good ones and some not so good. Because of my longevity, it \nhas been my privilege, and usually my pleasure, to have known \npersonally, and been on friendly terms, with every governor back to \nBibb Graves.''\n  During his lifetime, he served as president and founder of two \ninsurance businesses, and owner and publisher of three newspapers in \nBaldwin County. He was the recipient of more than 35 awards including 8 \nhonorary doctorate degrees.\n  Jimmy Faulkner was a great man, and a world traveler who visited over \n100 countries during his lifetime. He had a unique view of the entire \nworld and the part of it he occupied, and he used that view and his \nknowledge to make Alabama and our Nation a better place. Those of us \nwho knew him are all better for having shared his interesting life and \nbenefitted from his brilliant mind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10482-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING THE TOWN OF BELK, ALABAMA\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to tell you about \nthe small town of Belk located in Fayette County, AL. While having a \nrelatively small population--205 in 2007--Belt has an abundance of \ncommunity spirit and people willing to give of their time and energy to \nmake it a better place to live. They exemplify the ``can-do, \ncooperative attitude which made America great.\n  I visited Belk in August and was inspired by their attitude and \napproach. They feel greatly blessed to obtain any assistance, and use \nit along with their own efforts to maximize the benefits to Belk. They \nhave a Volunteer Fire Department with 15 active members that purchased \na new fire truck in 2001 with a grant and have since purchased 2 \nadditional pumper-service trucks.\n  In 2004, they built a fine new Community Center using a grant from \nthe State of Alabama and a loan of $48,000. Holding a number of \nfundraising activities, including a gospel singing, silent, auction, \ngolf tournament, and bluegrass festival, they have reduced that loan \nbalance to $15,230. Every second Friday night they have a bluegrass \nfestival at the center and volunteers donate food to be served in the \nkitchen. All revenues go to pay on the center's debt and everyone has a \nwonderful time.\n  In addition, in 2005 they constructed a community storm shelter using \na small grant of $52,000 from FEMA. The design work was donated by a \nlocal contractor, and local tradesmen donated their time to do \nplumbing, electrical and water line work.\n  This past spring they built a new outdoor stage using donations from \ncorporations and local businesses for the design and materials, and the \nlabor of local volunteers for the construction.\n  This is the kind of volunteer effort, self-help, and love of \ncommunity that I grew up knowing. It is still a common trait of small \ncommunities in Alabama, but, frankly, is being lost too often today. \nBelk has taken on the task of making their piece of America a better \nplace to live. I would like to commend Mayor Ronald Waldrop, who sets \nthe example, and every citizen who has volunteered their efforts to the \ngreater good. I am truly honored to represent such people. They are \nmen, women, and youth of faith, integrity, and hard work. Such are the \npeople who have made America great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10482-3", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10482-S10483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING ALVINA ELIZABETH SCHWAB PETTIGREW\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today, out of a sense of pride and \ngratitude, I wish to recognize the remarkable yet unheralded work of a \ngroup of women who quite literally saved innumerable lives and made a \nnotable contribution to the Allied victory during World War II. One \nmight wonder what has taken us so long to honor a group of women whose \nefforts date back over 65 years. The reason is that the nature of their \nwork was so secret, the women were warned that they could be shot for \ntreason if they ever revealed their activities. And so they didn't. As \na result, they never received the recognition they deserved.\n  I am speaking of the WAVES (Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency \nService), who played an instrumental role in cracking the complex codes \nthat the Germans used to radio instructions from German headquarters to \nthe submarines that were sinking Allied ships. And when I said I was \nspeaking out of a sense of pride, it is because Alvina Elizabeth Schwab \nPettigrew from my home State of South Dakota was among this determined \ngroup of heroes.\n  Alvina was born in 1919 on a farm near Mina, SD. She completed grades \n1-8 in a one-room schoolhouse and graduated from Mina High School. She \nreceived a scholarship to Grand Island Business College in Nebraska in \n1936. But in 1942, this everyday American embarked on a journey that \nwould call her to do extraordinary things in the service of our Nation.\n  Alvina enlisted in the WAVES in October 1942 and was sent to \nStillwater, OK, for 3 months of training. Following graduation, orders \narrived for her to report to the Naval Communications Annex in \nWashington, DC. In nondescript buildings now housing the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security, more than 600 WAVES labored secretly \nin support of the war effort. German U-boats had been sinking Allied \nships at alarming rates. Between January and March 1942, the Germans \nsank 216 ships off the east coast alone. But the Americans, improving \non cryptological breakthroughs by the Poles and the British, finally \ncracked the German codes. The WAVES were the ones who actually operated \nthe machines that deciphered the codes. They had the German U-boat \nfleet fighting for its life. The WAVES ran the machines around the \nclock. The noise was head-splitting, the summer heat sweltering. But \nthey forged ahead, knowing that American lives were at stake.\n\n[[Page S10483]]\n\n  Although one could argue that the honor does not begin to match the \nmagnitude of the achievement, Alvina and the other WAVES are being \nrecognized through a public arts project in the Cathedral Heights \nneighborhood of Washington, DC. A turn-of-the-century ``call box'' that \nonce housed fire emergency equipment will contain a portrait of Alvina \nSchwab Pettigrew and a description of what the WAVES did in the Navy \nAnnex just 200 yards away. It is a lasting tribute to the women who \nturned the tide on the Germans and helped the Allied forces win the \nwar. I am proud that a South Dakotan is being honored in this way and \nthat I am able to convey to Alvina and the WAVES a belated thank-you \nfrom a most grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10483-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT TO EXTEND THE PERIOD OF PRODUCTION OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM \n     RESERVES FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS FROM APRIL 5, 2009--PM 65\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 7422(c)(2) of title 10, United States Code, I \nam informing you of my decision to extend the period of production of \nthe Naval Petroleum Reserves for a period of 3 years from April 5, \n2009, the expiration date of the currently authorized period of \nproduction.\n  Attached is a copy of the report investigating continued production \nof the Reserves, consistent with section 7422(c)(2)(B) of title 10.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 3680. A bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to provide for \nthorium fuel cycle nuclear power generation; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Thorium \nEnergy Independence and Security Act of 2008, together with my dear \nfriend and colleague Senator Harry Reid. This is a simple bill that \nwould establish offices at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the \nDepartment of Energy to regulate domestic thorium nuclear power \ngeneration and oversee possible demonstrations of thorium nuclear fuel \nassemblies.\n  I am very much in favor of our Nation's nuclear power industry. It is \nan industry that has successfully relied on mixed oxide uranium fuel \nfor decades, and I foresee a long future for nuclear power. I am \nparticularly excited about the potential of thorium nuclear power as a \nnew source of nuclear power in the future.\n  Thorium nuclear power has a number of potential benefits over \nconventional uranium. For one, it is much more abundant in the world \nand in the United States than uranium. Also, a thorium fuel rod would \nremain the reactor about three times as long as conventional nuclear \nfuel, thereby cutting the volume of spent nuclear fuel coming out of \nreactors by as much as two-thirds. Thorium nuclear fuel could also \nsignificantly reduce the possibility that weapons grade material would \nresult from the process. Finally, a thorium fuel cycle can be used as a \nvery effective and efficient means for disposing of existing plutonium \nstockpiles.\n  Our Nation has focused mostly on mixed oxide nuclear fuel cycles, and \nour regulatory structure reflects that. With the growing interest in \nthorium nuclear power in the world and in the United States, it is time \nwe made sure our government has a regulatory infrastructure in place to \naccommodate this new generation of nuclear power.\n  Clearly, we are introducing this legislation late in the 110th \nCongress. We hope to raise awareness of the bill and generate feedback \nfrom interested parties. A number of governments throughout the world \nare aggressively seeking to establish thorium nuclear power as an \nelement of their power supply. These governments want the benefits of \nnuclear power, without the difficulties associated with large volumes \nof waste, much of which can be turned to weapons grade material. Our \naim with this legislation is to ensure that the United States does not \nfall behind the movement. I hope my colleagues will take a look at the \npotential for thorium power.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 3681. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 5070 Vegas Valley Drive in Las Vegas, Nevada, as the \n``Joseph A. Ryan Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Joseph \nA. Ryan, a former Postmaster from Las Vegas, NV. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation, which will designate the U.S. Post Office \nat 5070 Vegas Valley Drive in Las Vegas, NV, in his name.\n  Joseph ``Joe'' Ryan was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, on May 19, 1927. \nHe attended the College of St. Thomas and the University of Minnesota, \nand went on to do post-graduate work at UCLA, Duke University, and the \nWharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. During World War II, \nMr. Ryan honorably served our country in the United States Coast Guard, \nand he later went on to work for Northwest Airlines before joining the \nUnited States Postal Service. Prior to serving as the Postmaster for \nLas Vegas, Mr. Ryan worked as the Postal Service's General Manager of \nCustomer Programs for the Western Region.\n  Mr. Ryan was appointed Postmaster of Las Vegas in May of 1983 and \nretired in October of 1992. As Postmaster, Mr. Ryan was responsible for \noverseeing the many post offices in the Las Vegas valley. The 1980s and \nearly 1990s was a time of tremendous growth in southern Nevada, and \nunder his leadership, eight new post offices opened throughout the \ncommunity, including the stunning main facility on Sunset Road. During \nhis tenure, Joe was known for his exceptional dedication to customer \nservice and was greatly admired by the\n\n[[Page S10489]]\n\nlocal Postal Service employees. His work as Las Vegas Postmaster was \nrecognized in 1988 by the Direct Marketing Association, which awarded \nhim the National Postmaster of the Year Award. In 1991, I was happy to \njoin my friend and colleague Senator Richard Bryan in honoring \nPostmaster Ryan with the U.S. Senate Productivity Award.\n  Beyond his work with the Postal Service, Mr. Ryan has been an active \nmember of the Las Vegas community and has given his time and efforts to \nimprove this fast-growing city. He worked with the Nevada Development \nAuthority, served on the board of the United Way of Southern Nevada, \nand was a member of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce Leadership Group.\n  Joe and his wife Pamelia have been married for over 50 years and have \nfour children and three grandchildren. Mr. and Mrs. Ryan are especially \nproud that all four of their children are college graduates. Joe Ryan \nhas served the Postal Service admirably and has contributed greatly to \nour community, so it is fitting that the Congress recognize his hard \nwork by naming a post office in his honor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no ojbection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3681\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. JOSEPH A. RYAN POST OFFICE BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 5070 Vegas Valley Drive in Las Vegas, \n     Nevada, shall be known and designated as the ``Joseph A. Ryan \n     Post Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Joseph A. Ryan Post Office Building''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 3682. A bill to provide incentives to small business concerns for \ninnovative energy-efficient technologies and products, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Small Business \nEnergy Innovation Act, which I am introducing today to inspire \nAmericans to invest in the technologies that will ultimately solve our \nenergy crisis. As our country confronts the challenges of an economic \ncrisis it is essential that the financial resources for our nation's \nenergy entrepreneurs are sustained. This legislation will provide \ntechnical assistance and make financial resources available to ensure \nthat energy innovators have greater access to capital to develop \nmeritorious energy ideas.\n  One of the truly concerning aspects of the current financial \nsituation is that loans to small businesses are becoming more difficult \nto obtain. One industry in particular, our clean energy sector, is \nworking harder to find startup funds in order to help meet the \nchallenges of greenhouse gas emissions, energy costs to consumers, and \nour reliance on foreign oil. At a recent speech in Atlanta, author Tom \nFriedman urged America to retake the lead in the world through \ninnovation in ``ET''--Energy Technology. Friedman said the United \nStates needs to ``invent a source of abundant, cheap, clean, reliable \nelectrons.'' He compared the ``ET'' movement to the ``IT'', Information \nTechnology, movement of the last decade. The author called on \nWashington to create the environment and the incentives to allow the ET \nmovement to prosper.\n  As Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee, I have heard \ncountless stories of small business success and how the Small Business \nAdministration can facilitate the transition of a small business to a \nmajor company. Nowhere is this role more critical than in our renewable \nenergy sector. Businesses and families are struggling with the \ninordinate costs of diesel, gasoline, electricity and home heating oil. \nYet, we know that our country can do better. We must develop \ntechnologies that allow Americans to utilize clean energy from \nAmerica's resources. Accordingly, my legislation would create a \nDirector of Energy Innovation in the Small Business Administration who \nis entrusted with coordinating energy innovation at the SBA and \n``promoting energy independence.''\n  In addition, the legislation provides grants of up to $200,000 for \nnonprofits to assist small businesses that are developing renewable \nenergy systems, advanced energy efficiency systems, advanced \ntransportation fuels, carbon capture and sequestration practices, \nadvanced electrical generation, efficient end-use energy technologies, \nproduction facilities for fuel efficient vehicles, and pollution \ncontrol equipment. These critical initiatives require expertise that \nis, in many cases, difficult for a small business to find. This \nprovision will assist small businesses in bringing products to market.\n  The Small Business Energy Innovation Act creates in the Department of \nEnergy a grant program of up to $250,000 for small businesses that are \nworking to improve our energy security. When you consider the potential \ndividends of this investment, this critical seed money for energy \ninnovators who are leading our energy revolution is a prudent \ninvestment. The potential rewards to our economy, our environment, and \nour national security are well worth this modest government \nexpenditure.\n  Finally, this legislation develops a small business guaranteed loan \nprogram that is modeled after the loan guarantee program that was \nauthorized in the 2005 Energy Bill. The current loan guarantee program \nis fostering the development of commercial scale innovative \ntechnologies for large companies, while this legislation will develop a \ncorresponding small business loan program. Loan guarantees will enable \nthe Department of Energy to share some of the financial risks of \nprojects that employ new or significantly improved energy technologies \nthat will move our country towards energy self-sufficiency.\n  I hope that this legislation, coupled with the America Competes Act, \nwhich I cosponsored last year, will bring about the research and \nentrepreneurship that our country requires to claim the lead in \nproducing energy efficient products. I look forward to working with \nChairman Bingaman of the Energy Committee and Chairman Kerry of the \nSmall Business Committee and my other colleagues to pass this \nlegislation and create a strong commitment to the energy innovators who \npossess the ideas that will facilitate the end to our reliance on \nforeign oil.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10489-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 702--COMMENDING DAVID J.

Res. 705\n\n       Whereas the Senate is committed to protecting and \n     preserving the cultural heritage of all national, religious, \n     and ethnic groups, including cemeteries and other sacred \n     sites of those groups in the United States and abroad;\n       Whereas the Holocaust annihilated much of the Jewish \n     population of Europe, and in many countries in Europe, no \n     Jewish people were left to care for the communal properties \n     that represent a historic culture in the area and constitute \n     an integral part of the Jewish religion;\n       Whereas the Holocaust and 45 years of atheistic, Communist \n     governments in Eastern Europe created a critical need that \n     led to the establishment of the United States Commission for \n     the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad under section \n     1303 of the International Security and Development \n     Cooperation Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 469j);\n       Whereas the United States Commission for the Preservation \n     of America's Heritage Abroad is tasked with identifying and \n     reporting on cemeteries, monuments, and historic buildings in \n     Eastern and Central Europe that are associated with the \n     heritage of United States citizens and obtaining assurances \n     from the governments in those regions that those properties \n     will be protected and preserved;\n\n[[Page S10491]]\n\n       Whereas many of those properties continue to be endangered \n     and governments and communities continue to face fundamental \n     and compelling challenges in the preservation of those \n     properties;\n       Whereas experts within Lithuania and from around the world \n     believe that the cemetery located in the Snipiskes area of \n     Vilnius, Lithuania, is an historic Jewish cemetery and is \n     sacred ground;\n       Whereas, in 2005, municipal authorities in Vilnius, \n     Lithuania, approved the construction of an apartment building \n     at the outer edge of that Jewish cemetery;\n       Whereas that cemetery dates to the 15th century and is \n     known by scholars in Lithuania and around the world as the \n     first Jewish cemetery in Vilnius;\n       Whereas it is believed that, before the Government closed \n     the cemetery in the early 1800s, more than 50,000 Jews were \n     buried there;\n       Whereas, in December 2006, several months after experts and \n     groups from around the world expressed grave concern about \n     the desecration of the Snipiskes cemetery, the Prime Minister \n     of Lithuania established a working group to define the \n     cemetery's borders and to consider how to memorialize it;\n       Whereas, in 2007, before the conclusion of the working \n     group, authorities of the Government of Lithuania approved \n     additional construction on the disputed ground;\n       Whereas, in May 2007, the working group, consisting of \n     historians, scientists, and rabbis from Lithuania and around \n     the world, called for a halt in construction activity until \n     completion of a site study to be undertaken using ground-\n     penetrating radar;\n       Whereas, on September 3, 2008, a group commissioned by the \n     Government of Lithuania to study the area using the ground-\n     penetrating radar concluded that the boundaries of the \n     cemetery included the disputed apartment buildings;\n       Whereas the Ministry of Culture of Lithuania released a \n     statement dismissing the study as inconclusive;\n       Whereas the fact that the Government of Lithuania has \n     allowed construction to take place at the Jewish cemetery \n     located in the Snipiskes area of Vilnius, Lithuania, and that \n     desecration of sacred sites continues into the 21st century, \n     is an affront to the international Jewish community, the \n     people of the United States, and everyone who values \n     religious freedom and ethnic diversity around the world;\n       Whereas the United States and Lithuania signed the \n     Agreement on the Protection and Preservation of Certain \n     Cultural Properties on October 15, 2002;\n       Whereas Article 1 of the Agreement states, ``Each Party \n     will take appropriate steps to protect and preserve the \n     cultural heritage of all national, religious or ethnic groups \n     . . . who reside or resided in its territory and were victims \n     of genocide in its territory during the Second World War. The \n     term `cultural heritage' for purposes of this Agreement means \n     . . . cemeteries and memorials to the dead. . .'';\n       Whereas cemeteries are sacred sites and are established to \n     remain undisturbed in perpetuity, and the sanctity of a \n     cemetery is determined by the bodies buried in the cemetery; \n     and\n       Whereas, while vandalism of headstones or construction of a \n     commercial building on the site disgraces the cemetery, it \n     does not change its sacred status: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses strongly to the Government of Lithuania that \n     the cemetery located in the Snipiskes area of Vilnius, \n     Lithuania, which is an important part of the cultural \n     heritage of the Jewish people, should not be further \n     desecrated;\n       (2) urges the Government of Lithuania to take all the \n     necessary steps to immediately stop and, if necessary, \n     reverse, construction on that cemetery;\n       (3) reaffirms that constructive bilateral relations between \n     Lithuania and the United States are important to the \n     Governments and citizens of both countries; and\n       (4) expresses strong support for the work of the United \n     States Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage \n     Abroad and for the European countries that continue to work \n     to preserve sacred historical sites, despite ongoing \n     challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10491-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5692.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n                         department of justice\n\n       Jeffrey Leigh Sedgwick, of Massachusetts, to be an \n     Assistant Attorney General.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate confirmed five more \nexecutive nominations that were reported by the Judiciary Committee, \nincluding the nomination of Greg Garre to be Solicitor General of the \nUnited States, one of the highest and most prestigious positions at the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  The nominations considered today also include Jeffrey Leigh Sedgwick \nto run the Department's Office of Justice Programs, George W. Venables \nto be United States Marshal for the Southern District of California, \nBrian Albritton to be United States Attorney for the Middle District of \nFlorida, and another that I have agreed to discharge from Committee: \nDennis Michael Klein to be United States Marshal for the Eastern \nDistrict of Kentucky. I thank Senator Kennedy for his expedited \nconsideration of Mr. Klein's nomination. He has long been focused on \nmaintaining the qualifications of those appointed to be U.S. Marshals.\n  We tried as well to move forward with the President's nominations to \nthe Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board and the Sentencing \nCommission, but Republican holds prevented us from making progress and \nconfirming President Bush's nominees to those important posts.\n  After today's confirmations, we have confirmed 40 executive \nnominations this Congress, including the confirmations of 13 U.S. \nattorneys, 9 U.S. marshals, a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, \nanother Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney \nGeneral, and Solicitor General. Eighteen of those nominations will have \nbeen confirmed this year alone, despite this being a Presidential \nelection year.\n  Of course, we have considered these executive nominations while \nsimultaneously moving forward with the confirmation of dozens of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominations. I have spoken many times about \nthe partisan actions of the Republican-led Senate that created a \njudicial vacancies crisis by not considering circuit court nominees in \n1996, 1997 and 1998. Those years included\n\n[[Page S10502]]\n\nthe congressional session in the 1996 Presidential election year, when \nthe Republican Senate majority confirmed only 17 judicial nominations \nand refused to allow the Senate to confirm even one circuit court \njudge. That same presidential election year the Republicans confirmed \njust four of President Clinton's executive nominees. By comparison, \nwith today's confirmations, we have confirmed 18 of President Bush's.\n  As we prepare to close this Congress, I thank the members of the \nJudiciary Committee for the tireless work that resulted in the \nconfirmation of 68 of President Bush's nominees to lifetime \nappointments to the Federal bench. This work was all the more \nimpressive because of the time and effort we devoted to rebuilding and \nrestoring the Department of Justice after years of scandals led to the \nresignations of the Department's entire senior leadership.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, the Judiciary Committee began its \noversight efforts. Those efforts revealed a Department of Justice gone \nawry. The leadership crisis came more and more into view as I led a \nbipartisan group of concerned Senators to consider the U.S. attorney \nfiring scandal, a confrontation over the legality of the \nadministration's warrantless wiretapping program, the untoward \npolitical influence of the White House at the Department of Justice, \nand the secret legal memos excusing all manner of excess and subverting \nthe rule of law.\n  What our efforts exposed was a crisis of leadership that took a heavy \ntoll on the tradition of independence that has long guided the Justice \nDepartment and provided it with safe harbor from political \ninterference. It shook the confidence of the American people. Through \nbipartisan efforts among those from both sides of the aisle who care \nabout Federal law enforcement and the Department of Justice, we joined \ntogether to press for accountability.\n  After we exposed and uncovered the abuses at the Department, we \nreferred a number of matters to the Department's Inspector General, \nOIG, and Office of Professional Responsibility, OPR, for further \ninvestigation. The three reports we have now received from those \ninternal investigations have confirmed the worst of our findings and \nour fears.\n  The first two reports confirmed what the Judiciary Committee \nuncovered about the politicization of hiring practices at the \nDepartment. They confirmed that the same senior Department officials \ninvolved with the firing of United States Attorneys were injecting \nimproper political motives into the process of hiring attorneys for \ncareer positions throughout the Department, from career prosecutors, to \nimmigration judges, to young attorneys through the Department's \nprestigious honors program.\n  Just this week, OIG and OPR issued a third report, this one \nvalidating our findings about the improper and unprecedented firing of \nU.S. Attorneys for political reasons. These findings add up to another \ndisturbing report card on the conduct of the Gonzales Justice \nDepartment. This report confirms that the two most senior officials at \nthe Department of Justice--Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Deputy \nAttorney General Paul McNulty--``abdicated their responsibility to \nsafeguard the integrity and independence of the Department by failing \nto ensure that the removal of U.S. Attorneys was not based on improper \npolitical considerations.'' It confirms what I have said all along--the \nresponsibility for this debacle was not the work of a few bad apples, \nas Attorney General Mukasey, former Attorney General Gonzales have \nsuggested. Responsibility rests at the top, and at the White House.\n  This report might have told us even more if the investigation had not \nbeen impeded by the Bush administration's refusal to cooperate and \nprovide documents and witnesses. In this debacle as in others, the Bush \nadministration's self-serving secrecy has shrouded many of their most \ncontroversial policies--from torture, to investigating the causes of 9/\n11, to wiretapping. The evidence in our investigation and in reports \nfrom the Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility \nshows that Karl Rove and others from the highest ranks of the White \nHouse were involved in the firings and focused on the political impact \nof Federal prosecutions. The White House should not be allowed to hide \nfrom accountability.\n  Even though it has been clear for a long time that Attorney General \nGonzales allowed politics to permeate the Department's ranks, he \ncontinues to try to avoid accountability. He has provided the Inspector \nGeneral the same response he gave so frequently to Congress: I don't \nrecall. The threads of secrecy of this administration--from the White \nHouse to the Executive agencies--will continue to unravel for years to \ncome.\n  When this investigation was handed over to a Federal criminal \nprosecutor recently to determine whether there was criminal wrongdoing, \nI warned the President that the American people will see any use of the \npardon power or any grant of clemency or immunity to those from his \nadministration involved in the U.S. Attorney firing scandal as an \nadmission of wrongdoing and another misuse of power. His administration \nhas stonewalled the Congress and the inspector general. They should \ncome clean. They should have testified and given us the information we \nwere forced to subpoena. We do not want to see another repeat of the \nScooter Libby misuse of power where the President's people misled \ninvestigators and then he excused them from their lies and evasiveness. \nThere should be accountability and consequences.\n  Our oversight efforts did not complete our work. In the last year \nalone we have held eight hearings to replenish the leadership ranks at \nthe Department. We confirmed the new Attorney General last November. \nToday, in confirming Mr. Garre's nomination to be Solicitor General, we \ncomplete that work.\n  The position of Solicitor General is a critical post that encompasses \nduties quite different than any other lawyer in the Government. The \nSolicitor General is not only one of the highest ranking officials at \nthe Justice Department and the chief advocate on behalf of the United \nStates Government, but also holds a unique position as an officer of \nthe court, with a duty to bring forward aspects of cases that the \nSupreme Court might not otherwise know. Because of this critical role, \nthe Solicitor General is often called ``the Tenth Justice.''\n  I remain concerned about many of the positions he has advocated while \nserving in the Solicitor General's office and more recently as Acting \nSolicitor General. For example, I strongly disagree with the \nadministration's position last year in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and \nRubber Co., a case in which the Supreme Court stuck a severe blow to \nthe rights of working women to equal pay for equal work and to all \nworking Americans. The amicus brief filed by the government, which Mr. \nGarre signed as Principle Deputy Solicitor General, helped bring about \nthat wrong decision. I strongly believe it was contrary to the purpose \nand intent of Congress' bipartisan efforts to root out discrimination \nagainst working women.\n  For nearly two decades, Lilly Ledbetter, a supervisor at Goodyear \nTire, was paid significantly less than her male counterparts. \nNevertheless, the brief Mr. Garre signed contended that she was not \neligible for title VII protection against discriminatory pay because \nshe did not file her claim within 180 days of Goodyear's discriminatory \npay decision. That view contradicted the position of the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission, which had stated that each paycheck \ncould separately provide a cause of action. The administration's \nposition was wrong and provided cover for the Court to throw out a jury \nverdict and compound the harm from the discrimination against Ms. \nLedbetter. I hope that, once confirmed, Mr. Garre will take seriously \nthe intent of Congress and the need for equal justice for all in \nadvocating the position of the United States before the Federal courts.\n  I also disagree strongly with the position taken in an amicus brief \nthis year signed by Mr. Garre in Crawford v. Marion County Election \nBoard. In this Supreme Court case Mr. Garre argued that Indiana's \nrequirement of a photo identification for voting was ``reasonable'' and \nfurthered the State's interest in combating vote fraud. He made this \nargument even though in-person voter fraud has proven time and time \nagain to be a myth, and evidence shows that photo ID laws have already \nserved\n\n[[Page S10503]]\n\nto disenfranchise some of the most vulnerable American voters. In \nseveral instances elderly nuns who were not able to vote as a result of \nIndiana's laws. Although the Supreme Court agreed with Mr. Garre's \nposition, 6-3, the Court left the door open for ``as applied'' \nchallenges and statutory challenges to laws that burden voters' \nfundamental right to participate in the electoral process by mandating \na photo ID. If confirmed, I hope Mr. Garre will act as he said in his \nhearing he would to enforce the Voting Rights Act's antidiscrimination \nprovisions against State photo ID laws that deter minority voter \nparticipation.\n  I hope Mr. Garre shares my view that it is vital that we ensure that \nwe have a functioning, independent Justice Department, and that we \nensure that this sad era in the history of the Department is not \nrepeated. We have seen what happens when the rule of law plays second \nfiddle to a President's agenda and the partisan desires of political \noperatives and it is a disaster for the American people. Both the \nPresident and the Nation are best served by a Justice Department that \nprovides sound advice and takes responsible action, without regard to \npolitical considerations--not one that develops legalistic loopholes \nand ideological litmus tests to serve the ends of a particular \nadministration.\n  Jeff Sedgwick will also have an important role to play in the few \nmonths remaining in this administration. The Office of Justice Programs \nplays a vital role in developing the Nation's capacity to prevent and \ncontrol crime and compensating and assisting crime victims. Crime, \nincluding violent crime, has been on the rise, particularly in rural \nareas and smaller cities. Many of us think it is in part the \nconsequence of this administration's failure to provide financial \nassistance to our state and local law enforcement partners. Despite our \nrepeated warnings, the Bush administration has systematically tried to \ndismantle Federal support for local and state law enforcement that was \nbeing provided through our successful Community-Oriented Policing \nServices, COPS, program, Byrne grants and other programs. Under \nPresident Bush, billions have been cut from our state and local law \nenforcement efforts while we continue writing blank checks for police \nin Iraq. I hope that Mr. Sedgwick helps us reverse this trend and turn \nthe tide back against crime in rural areas and smaller cities where it \nhas been on the rise.\n  I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmations \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10503-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 7222, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 7222) to extend the Andean Trade Preferences \n     Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, President John F. Kennedy said that ``if a \nfree society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few \nwho are rich.''\n  This week, Congress has worked hard on the American economy. No \nmatter how grave our problems today, America remains the world's \nrichest nation. Our domestic challenges are great. But ours remains a \nland of opportunity and prosperity.\n  With our own economy in hard times, it is easy to forget the world's \npoorest. It is easy to forget that more than a billion people around \nthe world live on a dollar a day or less. Concerned about maintaining \nour own standard of living, we can forget that the wealth of too many \nconsists of little more than the clothes on their backs and the few \ncoins in their pockets.\n  The legislation that we consider today proves we are not an island--\neconomically or morally. Today's legislation accomplishes four key \nobjectives. It extends the Generalized System of Preferences for 1 \nyear, extends the Andean Trade Preferences Act for 6 months to 1 year, \nwith safeguards to ensure that Bolivia and Ecuador comply with that \nprogram's rules, affords the Dominican Republic enhanced access to the \nU.S. market in a way that benefits U.S. producers, and allows our trade \npreference program with Africa--known as AGOA--to work better.\n  I am proud that, by considering and passing this legislation, America \nagain proves that we are still capable of thinking of others. By acting \non this bill, Americans underscore that those who do not share our \nwealth must not be denied hope for a better life. By extending our \ntrade preference programs, Americans reaffirm the fundamental belief \nthat the world's poor are no less human than we are, and they deserve a \nfair shake for a hard day's work.\n  America has crafted trade preference programs for those hundreds of \nmillions of poor around the world, not with a handout, but with a leg \nup. These preference programs offer more than 130 countries a way out \nof extreme poverty--poverty that is not just morally repugnant, but \npolitically destabilizing. Our GSP and ATPA programs give developing \ncountry workers a living, rewards productive investment, and grants \nbetter access to America's market.\n  The benefits of these programs are mutual and create jobs that earn \ngood wages in Montana and the rest of the country. Retail and \ntransportation jobs in America depend on flower exports from Ecuador \nand Colombia. We sell American cotton to Andean and Dominican textile \nbuyers who turn it into fabric and apparel. American manufacturers rely \non imports from GSP beneficiaries to lower input costs on electrical \nparts and building materials. And American consumers benefit from lower \npriced products from diamond rings to tires.\n  Our preference programs are not perfect. My colleagues and I are \nconcerned that our preference programs may help those who do not need \nor deserve our help. We are concerned that certain beneficiary \ncountries boast globally competitive industries and wealthy owners. We \nare concerned that certain beneficiary countries show disdain for \nAmerica's foreign policies and do not provide adequate protections for \nthe American companies operating in those countries.\n  Yet I recognize that the good and prosperity of the many cannot be \nsacrificed to punish the few. The inappropriate actions of a few cannot \nlead us to inaction that hurts the many and throws entire economies \ninto a spiral of insecurity and poverty.\n  This legislation on our preference programs is no blank check. Our \npreference programs require beneficiary countries to protect U.S. \ninvestment and intellectual property and to provide workers with \ninternationally recognized worker rights. Our programs provide the \nadministration with the flexibility to work within the program in order \nto determine whether or not to designate a country a beneficiary \ncountry. And when beneficiary countries do not abide by these \neligibility criteria, they must be held responsible. I commend the \nadministration for launching an ATPA review of Bolivia to ensure that \nit continues to abide by the eligibility criteria.\n  Our preference programs also contain measures to make sure that \ndeveloping countries that become globally competitive graduate to \noperate under the same terms as the rest of America's trading partners.\n  These policies are not perfect. No policy this body passes is static. \nEvery policy requires review and reevaluation to make sure it works how \nit should, for whom it should. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I \nam committed with my colleagues to reviewing and reevaluating our trade \npreference programs to make them work better for Americans and our \ntrading partners.\n  Let us do things the right way, the American way, and extend our \npreference programs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that a Reid substitute amendment \nat the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate, and that any statements related to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S10504]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Tinsley on \n     his service to the United States Senate.\n\n       Whereas Dave Tinsley, a native of the Commonwealth of \n     Virginia and graduate of Virginia Tech and the University of \n     Maryland, has worked in the Office of the Secretary of the \n     Senate since October 1977;\n       Whereas Dave Tinsley has served the Senate with distinction \n     as a staff assistant, a reference assistant, as the assistant \n     Executive Clerk, assistant Journal Clerk and assistant \n     Legislative Clerk;\n       Whereas Dave Tinsley has, since 1999, served as the \n     Senate's Legislative Clerk and Director of Legislative \n     Services, supervising 36 employees and has at all times \n     discharged his duties with dedication and diligence;\n       Whereas Dave Tinsley's sonorous voice is known to all in \n     the Senate and the C-SPAN audience;\n       Whereas Dave Tinsley has earned the respect and affection \n     of the Senators, their staffs and all of his colleagues for \n     his calm and kind demeanor and his good humor; and\n       Whereas Dave Tinsley now retires from the Senate after 31 \n     years to spend more time with his wife, Jane, and his \n     children, Joe, Dan and Katie: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate expresses its appreciation to \n     Dave Tinsley and commends him for his lengthy, faithful and \n     outstanding service to the Senate.\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a \n     copy of this resolution to David J. Tinsley.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would only say, for those who are either \nreading the Record at this point or watching or listening to the \nproceedings, that our leaders spoke last night eloquently about Dave \nTinsley, his service to this Senate, to the Nation. Somehow or other, I \nwould love to see this resolution connected with those words that were \nspoken in a very historic moment last night, with, I think, just about \nevery Senator in the Chamber, with the gallery filled, that if I could \nmake an incorporation by reference, I would love to do that. But I \nthink I better resist the temptation to do that and simply refer our \nlisteners and readers to last night's proceedings.\n  Our leaders spoke for not just every Senator but every member of the \nstaff. Anyone who has known Dave and the great work he has done for us \nand his loyalty to this institution is grateful for that service and \nfor those wonderful words last night of our leaders.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc and the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 702) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/02/senate-section/article/S10504-3", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ORDERS FOR MONDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2008, THROUGH MONDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2008\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.
