HINCKLEY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say very briefly that someone I have \ngotten to know over the last number of years died last night at 7 \no'clock--the leader of the Mormon Church, a man who has been \ninstrumental in the tremendous growth of the church. During his period \nof time, the church has grown by millions of new people coming into the \nchurch. He has been a phenomenal builder, building scores of new \ntemples around the world. As we speak, there is one new church building \nbeing built every day, being dedicated every day. That is a lot of \nconstruction. I was told last week that the largest single builder of \nbuildings in the United States next to the Federal Government is the \nLDS Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which \nthis good man was the leader.\n  He is someone who has done some very unique things. He started what \nis called the Perpetual Education Fund. About half the members of the \nchurch are located outside of the United States. Millions of members of \nthe church are located in Mexico, Central and South America. He started \nwhat is, as I have indicated, called the Perpetual Education Fund, \nwhich is a voluntary contribution made from members of the church to \nhelp these people who are coming into the church be educated. As a \nresult, tens of thousands of people are now educated and are now church \nand community leaders around the world.\n  There is so much more that could be said about this good man who was \nkind and gentle and epitomized everything that is good in mankind, and \ncertainly on a personal basis I will miss him greatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/28/senate-section/article/S370-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, tonight, in keeping with an old custom, \nthe President will speak to Congress and the Nation about the state of \nthe Union. Every President since George Washington has given these \nperiodic updates because the Constitution requires them to do so.\n  While the Constitution makes no similar demands on congressional \nleaders, there is no doubt that this year the American people are \ndemanding something from us. They are looking for proof that \nRepublicans and Democrats can come together to get a few things done on \ntheir behalf.\n  Just 1 week into the session, and we are faced with a crucial test, \ntwo issues of vital significance to every American citizen: Will we \nreauthorize a terror-fighting tool that we know has made us safer, and \nwill we put money back into the taxpayers' hands quickly enough for it \nto have a positive effect on the Nation's economy? It is not an \nexaggeration to say that the choices we make on these issues will show \nthe public whether we are serious about protecting them from harm and \nserious about protecting their wallets. So the question is this: Will \nwe find a way to work together or will we find a way to get out of it \nand then blame the other side?\n  We got off to a good start. Last Thursday, millions of Americans were \nabsolutely stunned to turn on their television sets and see the \nDemocratic Speaker of the House and the House Republican leader \nstanding together on a stage behind the Treasury Secretary from the \nBush administration and nodding in agreement about an economic growth \npackage they had all worked out among themselves. It was the kind of \nscene many people have wondered if they would ever see again.\n  For the first time in years, the parties have come together in good \nfaith and responded swiftly to a pressing national concern. They sensed \nthat the Nation was impatient for action, and so they gave up a lot of \nwhat they wanted in order to find common ground. House Republicans made \nmajor sacrifices. So did House Democrats. Now the Nation's attention \nturns to us, to the Senate, to see if we are capable of the same. Here \nis our moment to show that we are.\n  A number of Senators have expressed a desire to add to this package \ntens of billions of dollars in spending on contentious programs. But we \ndon't have the time for ideological debates. In order for this plan to \nwork, Congress needs to act and to act at once.\n  This is not the package, frankly, that I would have put together. In \nmy view, the best way to stimulate the economy would be to lower \nmarginal rates. But neither is it the package my good friend, the \nmajority leader, would have put together. I gather from his public \nstatements he would prefer there be more spending on Government \nprograms. The Speaker and the House Republican leader would also have \nbuilt a package differently if they had written it on their own, but \nthey put their differences aside because they know we will all get \nnothing if we are not willing to make some serious sacrifices.\n  The editorial writers at the Washington Post urged us Friday not to \nlet the perfect be the enemy of the good. Low- and middle-income \ntaxpayers certainly agree. They are tapping their fingers wondering if \nwe can do it.\n  Americans are also wondering if we can agree on something as \nfundamental as our national security, and for good reason. We saw some \nworrisome signs last week that some of our friends were looking for a \nway out of what would be and could be a good bipartisan achievement on \nreauthorizing a terrorist surveillance program.\n\n  They should remember that 3 years ago, following the lead of the 9/11 \nCommission, Congress came together to create the Office of the Director \nof National Intelligence, approving the bill that established it by a \nvote of 89 to 2. The Director of National Intelligence was supposed to \nbe the person who would connect the dots, who would make sure \nintelligence gaps were closed, who could look across the entire \nintelligence landscape and tell us about our vulnerabilities before \nterrorists discovered them on their own.\n  Last year, he did just that. The Director of National Intelligence \ncame to Capitol Hill and asked us to either fix the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act that allowed us to monitor foreign \nterrorists overseas or risk weakening this vital intelligence-gathering \ntool.\n  Our friends across the aisle put off action for months before finally \npassing a temporary revision right up against the August recess. Then \nthey delayed again last fall, pushing us up against the expiration of \nthe temporary extension. Now they are delaying again.\n  There is only one version of a long-term extension that agrees with \nthe recommendations of the Director of National Intelligence, and that \nis the pending Rockefeller-Bond substitute bill. This bill was \ncarefully crafted on a strong bipartisan basis and reported out of the \nIntelligence Committee on a vote of 13 to 2. It is the only version the \nDirector of National Intelligence has approved. It is the only version \nthe President would sign. Therefore, it is the only one that has any \nchance of becoming law before the current extension expires on Friday \nof this week.\n\n[[Page S371]]\n\n  The time to act has long since passed. We need to approve \nRockefeller-Bond, and we need to do it this week.\n  Some of our friends on the other side say they will not vote for \ncloture on Rockefeller/Bond because they could not amend it. No one \nshould be deceived by this complaint. The amendments they want would \ntransform it into a replica of the partisan bill that was reported out \nof the Judiciary Committee last fall. In other words, allowing \namendments would guarantee failure.\n  Some of our friends on the other side say they want a 1-month \nextension. Never mind that we have had 10 months to act already. No one \nshould be deceived by this complaint either. The real reason for the 1-\nmonth extension, of course, is to give Members who vote in favor of it \nthe political cover they need to vote against Rockefeller/Bond. This is \nanother clever way to make the bill fail.\n  Some of our friends on the other side say we are wrong to insist that \nphone carriers who may have cooperated with the Government in tracking \nterrorists be immune from lawsuits. The implication is that this is \nsome kind of a favor for big business. But this advice is coming from \nthe intelligence community, not politicians, because they know that we \ncould never expect these companies--or any others--to cooperate in the \nfuture as long as the threat of a lawsuit looms.\n  Finally, some of our friends accuse us of being scaremongers for \nurging passage now. But the terrorist threat has not diminished since \n9/11. It hasn't expired. The Director of National Intelligence assures \nus it hasn't. The memory of 9/11 tells us it has not. Attacks in Madrid \nand London and Bali tell us it has not. And the terrorists themselves \ntell us it has not. The threat is real. And we cannot let success in \npreventing another one keep us from staying on offense with all the \ntools and resources we have. The bottom line is this: by voting for \ncloture on Rockefeller/Bond, Members will guarantee that this important \nantiterror tool does not expire. And those who vote against it are \nvoting either to delay its reauthorization or to weaken, not \nstrengthen, our terror-fighting tools.\n  Fixing FISA is within our grasp. Will we come together and embrace \nthe compromise approach that protects us, and doesn't force companies \nto make a false choice between the good of the firm or the good of the \ncountry or will we go the partisan route? It would be a worrisome sign \nindeed if the first bill Democrats filibuster this year deals with \nnational security. We must resist the mistakes of last year, and act.\n  Last week, we saw the kind of tough compromise that's necessary when \nlawmakers are more concerned about making a difference than making a \npolitical point. Now it is our turn. The second session is young. But \nthe choices we make this week will define us. And in my view, it is a \nwelcome opportunity.\n  Here in the second week of the session we have a chance to show \nAmericans that we can work together on their behalf, to solve problems; \nto protect their security and protect their wallets. This is a defining \nmoment for the 110th Congress. Let's put the mistakes of last year \nbehind us. Let's show that the U.S. Senate can get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/28/senate-section/article/S371-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

HINCKLEY,\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as the majority leader noted, last night \nGordon B. Hinckley, the oldest serving president of the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints in the history, passed away. He was 97 \nyears old. Many might think that in lasting until 97 he passed away as \na wasted, worn-out man. That is not true. President Hinckley was \nenergetic and enthusiastic and fully engaged within just a day or two \nof his passing. With my senior colleague Senator Hatch, I have had \nmeetings with him and the other leaders of the church and was always \namazed at how well connected he was. He read the papers. He watched the \ntelevision. He knew what was going on in the world outside the church \nevery bit as much as we did. His memory was phenomenal. There are many \npeople who were 20 to 30 years his junior who could not remember \ncurrent items of news as well as he could.\n  So it is appropriate we take a moment or two to comment on the \nstewardship and contribution of this great man at the time of his \npassing. We do not mourn for him. He has joined his wife, his parents, \nand those others who have gone before him who may have a little sense \nof ``Gordon, what took you so long?'' But he stayed at his job and he \nfulfilled his stewardship in an impressive manner. The mourning we have \non this occasion is mourning for ourselves, for the loss we have \nsustained in seeing this great and good man go on.\n  I have made mention of his energy. I should also mention his \nenthusiasm. He had a great zest for life. He was always looking forward \nto the next activity and the next opportunity. Along with his energy \nand enthusiasm, he was a man of humility and humor. You were never \nquite sure when he stood at the pulpit to speak if he was going to say \nsomething that would put you at ease and make you laugh, because that \nhappened much more often than it did with some others who were a little \nmore serious in their message. His messages were always serious, but \nthey always had that touch of humor.\n  The last message we heard from him, speaking to the entire world in \ngeneral, and to the church specifically, was his sermon of last \nOctober. I am sure he did not know that would be his final sermon to \nthe members of the church. But it started out again with a touch of \nHinckley humor. He noted, as he stood to speak, that singers will sing \nthe same song over and over again, as people ask them to perform; \norchestras will play the same symphony over and over again; but \nspeakers are always expected to say something new. He said that \nbothered him a little, as he was going to repeat a sermon he had given \nbefore. After we smiled at his early comments, we heard a lecture on \nanger. He talked about the toxic effects of anger and how we should do \nour very best, both in our personal lives and in our professional \nlives, and, if I may, here in the Senate in national dialog, to do away \nwith the sense of anger.\n  I have just returned from the annual session in Davos, Switzerland, \nwhere I heard a lot of people who could benefit from that sermon, as \nthere was a lot of anger people had toward other governments and other \ngovernment officials.\n  I will not in any way attempt to capsulize what President Hinckley \nhad to say about anger, except to demonstrate that this was his \nbenediction prior to his death to the members of his church, telling \nthem not to be angry with their families, not to be angry in their \ncommunities, and not to be angry with the world.\n  A former Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, Paul, spoke in his letter \nto the Corinthians about the three most important attributes of a \nChristian: faith, hope, and charity. Gordon B. Hinckley spoke of these \nsame attributes and lived them in his life. But he put them, if you \nwill, in modern terms: optimism, confidence, and love. A sermon telling \nus not to be angry with our fellow men is a fitting capstone to the \nstewardship of this man. It is a modern way of saying Paul's term \n``charity'' or the pure love of Christ. We shall miss him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor about 5 minutes on Gordon B. Hinckley.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of my \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Bennett.\n\n[[Page S372]]\n\nHe basically stated in very articulate terms how important President \nGordon B. Hinckley was, not just to Senator Bennett and myself, but to \npeople all over the world.\n  I express my deepest empathy, sympathy, and love to the family of \nGordon B. Hinckley. I agree with Senator Bennett, that President \nHinckley in dying was happy to go and again be with his beloved eternal \ncompanion, Marjorie, whom he missed, who died about 4 years before him, \nand to be with others he has known here on this Earth, and others he \nwould like to know who helped to make this country the greatest in the \nworld, and many others as well. I extend my deep sympathy to his \nfamily--a wonderful family; they are terrific people.\n  President Hinckley was as ecumenical as a person could be. He led a \nworldwide church, the fifth largest church in America, the Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He basically taught all of us to \nunderstand that all religions are good and that we should work \ntogether. I don't think there has been a humanitarian mission or a \nmajor disaster anywhere in the world where the Church of Jesus Christ \nof Latter-day Saints--nicknamed the Mormons--hasn't cooperated with \nCatholic charities and other Christian charities--especially Catholic \ncharities--to immediately go into action and provide the needed food, \nclothing, pharmaceuticals, et cetera, all over the world. These two \ncharities have done so much. He made sure our members--13 million \nstrong around the world--participated in each humanitarian concern. In \nfact, we have thousands and thousands of humanitarian missionaries all \nover the world. Many are older people who are retired and are giving 18 \nmonths, or even more, of their time--and some less--to be able to bring \nhumanitarian help to people all over the world. This man led that. He \nwas also a great business leader. Imagine, we had a man like this run \nthis very important worldwide church.\n  Senator Bennett mentioned his sense of humor. You hardly heard a set \nof remarks by President Hinckley where he didn't very wittily make his \npoints even better than he would have if they were just stern and \ntough. He was never stern and tough, unless it was essential. He was \nalways kind and loving. He was kind to me. Elaine, my wife, and I \npersonally love him and we are going to miss him very much. He traveled \nall over the world. I have traveled all over the world, and generally \nhave done it on military planes with military liaisons helping us and \ncarrying our bags, doing everything to make it a reasonable trip. I \ncome back beat every time. In every case, I wanted to kiss the ground \nwhen I got back here. He traveled extensively all over the world, \nalmost a million miles. In that regard, I pay tribute to Jon Huntsman, \nSr., who made it possible in his later years for him to have a very \ngood airplane that I think extended his life for a longer period of \ntime for the benefit of mankind all over this world. It was a wonderful \nthing.\n  He had love for all human beings and he expressed that love not only \nthrough his words but also through his actions.\n  I might add that, as Senator Reid mentioned, he established the \nperpetual education fund where members of our faith donate millions of \ndollars every year to help unfortunate young people in these foreign \nlands to be able to go to school and raise their educational level so \nthey can become leaders in their own country, and so they can make \ngreat contributions. I think it is one of the most inspired things I \nhave ever seen. We have thousands of young men and women who are now \nleaders in their countries--teachers, doctors, lawyers, and others--all \nbecause of the vision of this great man, whom we call a prophet.\n  I might mention that in his travels he dedicated dozens of temples, \nthe most of any president of the church, all over the world. To LDS \npeople those temples are extremely important. We believe marriage is so \nsacred and it is for all eternity, not just this life. Frankly, we try \nto live that way. Many do. These temples are extremely important to us. \nHe went all over the world doing it.\n  I can truthfully say this is a man I loved. He was a profound \ninfluence on Senator Bennett, me, and millions of others. He was a man \nwho got along with leaders of other faiths. He taught us we must \nrespect everybody.\n  Today I add my voice to those of 13 million other members of the \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in bidding farewell to our \nbeloved prophet, President Gordon Bitner Hinckley. His death late \nyesterday in his home in Salt Lake City has reminded us that all good \nthings must come to an end. It is a sad day for all Utahns. We have \nlost our friend, our leader, and our fellow servant. President Hinckley \nlived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people, \nleaving behind him a fame and a name which will be known for \ngenerations to come.\n  In our effort to follow in President Hinckley's footsteps, Latter-day \nSaints found they had to lengthen their stride to keep up with him. \nEven into the sunset of his life, President Hinckley was indefatigable. \nHe set a vigorous pace, traveling the world and sharing his message of \nservice, love, and compassion with millions of all faiths. Everywhere \nour prophet traveled, he succored the weak, lifted the hands which hung \ndown, and strengthened the feeble knees. When I think of the blessing \nPresident Hinckley was to those around him, I am reminded of the words \nfrom the great Mormon hymn, ``Every day some burden lifted, every day \nsome heart to cheer, every day some hope the brighter, blessed honored \npioneer.''\n  President Hinckley was born to humble surroundings on June 23, 1910, \nin Salt Lake City, UT. He attended public schools, and graduated with a \nbachelor's of arts from the University of Utah. His first job was as a \nnewspaper carrier for Utah's Deseret News. This modest start with a \nnewspaper was a prelude of things to come. President Hinckley became \nthe most media savvy leader the LDS Church has ever known, sharing his \nwarmth and spirit with countless reporters, cultivating great \nfriendships with notables like Larry King and Mike Wallace. Wallace \nonce described President Hinckley as ``a man I admire and I love \nreally, because he's just an extraordinary guy.''\n  As many Latter-day Saints do, Gordon B. Hinckley served a mission for \nthe church while he was young. President Hinckley served in Great \nBritain in the 1930s, sharing the gospel's message of peace and hope \nduring a time of great political and economic turmoil. Discouraged by \nthe lack of receptivity he found among the Britons, he confided his \ndismay to his father, who instructed the young Gordon to ``forget \nhimself and go to work.''\n  Young Gordon did, both in Great Britain and in the 70 years of \nservice that followed.\n  His love of God fueled his love of country. President Hinckley \ncarried the torch of patriotism, and the spirit of America burned in \nhis heart. He once said, ``I love America for [its] great \nconstitutional strength, for the dedication of its people to the peace \nand the prosperity of the entire earth. I love America for the \ntremendous genius of its scientists, its laboratories, its \nuniversities, its researchers, and the tens of thousands of facilities \ndevoted to the improvement of human health and comfort, to the \nextension of life, to better communication and transportation. Its \ngreat throbbing and thriving industries have blessed the entire world. \nThe standard of living of its people has been the envy of the entire \nEarth. Its farmlands have yielded an abundance undreamed of by most \npeople of the Earth. The entrepreneurial environment in which has grown \nits industry has been the envy of and model for many other nations.''\n  President Hinckley's patriotism inspired him to great acts of civic \nservice, in addition to his church duties. He was a chairman or board \nmember of many businesses and educational entities. He received \nhonorary doctorates from five colleges and universities, the \nDistinguished Service Award from the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, the Silver Buffalo Award from the Boy \nScouts of America, and special recognition for his contributions to \ntolerance from the National Conference of Christians and Jews.\n  President Hinckley's ministry earned him national prominence. In \n2004, President George W. Bush awarded our prophet with the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civil award. \nPresident Hinckley was one of the spiritual leaders President Bush \ninvited to the White House following the\n\n[[Page S373]]\n\nSeptember 11 attacks. It was a great honor, both for him and our faith, \nthat the President invited him to that gathering. A few months later, \non the eve of the Winter Olympics in 2002, President Bush said, \n``President Hinckley represents a great religion, he is a strong part \nof the American scene.''\n  But President Hinckley never let his love of the United States \nobscure his vision for the rest of the world. Prior to becoming the LDS \npresident in 1995, Hinckley supervised the church's organization in \nAsia, Europe, and South America. During his tenure, the number of \nmembers living inside North America was surpassed by those living \noutside of it. The nations of the Earth heard his voice and he brought \nthem a knowledge of the truth by the wonderful testimony which he bore.\n  As president, he administered to both the ecclesiastical and temporal \nneeds of the church, whose 13 million members are spread over some 160 \nnations and territories. President Hinckley lifted his voice on every \ncontinent, in cities large and small, from north to south and east to \nwest across this broad world. One global vision President Hinckley had \nfor the LDS Church was a perpetual education fund, whereby members in \nwealthier nations could donate to the education of those in developing \nnations, thereby empowering them to help themselves and strengthening \nthe infrastructure in struggling parts of the world, particularly Latin \nAmerica.\n\n  When he became president of the church in 1995, the church had only \n47 temples, our special meeting houses such as the magnificent one in \nnearby Kensington, MD. Thanks to President Hinckley's vision of \nexpansion, today there are 124 in operation, and 12 more are under \nconstruction.\n  One of his first messages upon becoming our prophet in 1995 was a \nproclamation to the world, declaring the divine nature of the family \nunit and providing direction on how to nurture strong family \nrelationships. There is no greater duty or privilege among the Latter-\nday Saints than to serve our families. President Hinckley admirably \ndemonstrated that service as a grandfather, father, and husband to his \neternal companion, Marjorie, who walked side by side with him for two-\nthirds of a century.\n  Now he and Marjorie are walking together in the fields of paradise, \nenjoying a richly deserved peace in the Lord. I am sure at this time he \nwould remind us that death is the great equalizer. No matter what a man \nor woman may accomplish in this life, this final inevitability is \nwaiting for them. Shortly before his own passing, perhaps seeing the \nend was nigh, President Hinckley told church members, ``A man must get \nhis satisfaction from his work each day, must recognize that his family \nmay remember him, that he may count with the Lord, but beyond that, \nsmall will be his monument among the coming generations.''\n  Our heads are bowed now, as we bid him farewell. Gordon Bitner \nHinckley joins the ranks of departed prophets, on whose shoulders he \nstood and in whose mighty company he can now proudly mingle. God be \nwith you, our friend, till we meet again.\n  I have to say, he stood for everything that was good, and I love him.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/28/senate-section/article/S373-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S373-S374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak \nbriefly in opposition to the motion to invoke cloture. The amendment \nwhich I have filed goes to the heart of the issue on removing liability \nfrom the telephone companies to impose retroactive immunity. The \namendment which I have filed and has been discussed on the floor of the \nSenate would substitute the Government for the party defendant, where \nthe Government would have the same defenses--no more, no less.\n  For example, the telephone companies do not have the defense of \ngovernmental immunity; and the Government, when substituted, would not \nhave the defense of governmental immunity. The telephone companies can \nplead state secrets to foreclose the litigation; and when the \nGovernment would be substituted, for example, the Government could \nassert the doctrine of state secrets in order to foreclose the \nlitigation.\n  If the motion to invoke cloture is granted, I am advised by the \nParliamentarian my amendment would not be germane and, therefore, would \nbe stricken. We went through a long session last year where the \nargument was made, repeatedly and persuasively, not to invoke cloture--\nthe argument advanced on this side of the aisle--in order to give \nMembers on this side of the aisle an opportunity to propose their \namendments. Now we have the first situation sought to be applied, and \nit is my hope this body will reject the cloture motion.\n  There has been very little time spent on this very important subject \nin this body, and when you have a matter of the importance of \nretroactive immunity, where you are going to shut off the courts of the \nUnited States from hearing cases that are already pending, there ought \nto be time for consideration of an amendment such as the one Senator \nWhitehouse and I have offered to substitute the U.S. Government.\n  The purpose of our amendment is to comport with the basic \nconstitutional provision of separation of powers, which is the \ncornerstone of the Constitution, and we have found, regrettably, it has \nbeen inadequate to have congressional supervision, congressional \noversight, because of its ineffectiveness. For example, when the \nJudiciary Committee seeks to obtain records on the destruction of CIA \ntapes, you find the administration resisting and the inevitable \nargument of politics. When the court issues an order, as the Federal \nCourt did last week for a report on the destruction of documents, \nseeking to find out what happened on the destruction of the CIA \ndocuments, the court can't be charged with politics. We find in Rasul, \nand in other litigation matters, the judicial branch has been effective \nin maintaining the separation of power.\n  One further comment. It is a surprise to me that the amendment which \nI have offered with Senator Whitehouse has been ruled nongermane. I \ntook a look at Webster's International Dictionary and germane is \ndefined as:\n\n     closely or significantly related; relevant; pertinent; \n     closely akin.\n\n  I consulted with a Parliamentarian and asked why our amendment was \nruled as nongermane, and the answer given was because there was no \nspecific statement of the underlying bill on governmental liability. In \npursuing the issue with the Parliamentarian, I then said: I am going to \nseek to change the rules.\n  It seems to me peculiar, if not absurd, that my amendment, the \nSpecter-Whitehouse amendment, would not be germane under the common \nmeaning of the English language. I said: Suppose we change the rules to \nprovide that it was relevant? And the answer I got, and I don't want to \nmisquote anybody, was that: Yes, that would stand the test of \nrelevancy. As he put it, a more permissive standard.\n  So then I checked the definition of relevant in Webster's \nInternational Dictionary, and it says:\n\n       Bearing upon or connected with the matter in hand; to the \n     purpose; pertinent, raise, lift up, syn applicable, germane, \n     appropriate, suitable, fitting.\n\n  Well, the key part about the definition of relevant is that one of \nthe synonyms is germane, just as one of the synonyms of germane is \nrelevant. Now, it is a loss to me. I have been here a while, and I have \nhad a hard time understanding the ruling of what is germane, and I have \nnever seen one as close to the core point as putting the Government as \na substitute for the telephone companies, but somehow it is not \ngermane.\n  So I wish to put my colleagues on notice that I intend to try to \nchange the rules. I can't see why one is necessary when Webster's has \ngermane as a substitute for relevant and relevant as a substitute for \ngermane. If the Parliamentarian thinks that relevant is OK, it is, \nagain, hard for me to see why germane is not. A little surprising.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for question? I \ndon't want to interrupt his comments.\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, morning session is up at 3, and I am \nscheduled for 15 minutes. I might ask to extend the time. I don't know \nhow much time the Senator is going to use, but I want to make certain I \nhave the opportunity that was previously ordered, for 15 minutes on \nthis side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 10 minutes, 12 seconds \nremaining, and morning business is under the control of the majority.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much additional time does the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania need?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Less than a minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask unanimous consent that we extend by 5 minutes \nthe time for morning business so it terminates at 3:05.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank my colleague for his courtesy.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  Well, I have made my argument. I think it is important to have a \nruling, a vote by this body on whether we are going to apply \nretroactive immunity to the telephone companies. I said on the floor \nlast week that if my amendment is not adopted, I will support \nretroactive immunity. I think it is a bad practice, but I think, as bad \nas that practice is, it would be worse to cut off the information which \nour intelligence community thinks we need. I think it is not advisable. \nAnd when we have a method of having both objectives, that is to have \nthe Government have access to the information and at the same time not \nimpose the cutting off of the judicial system for checks and balances, \nI think that ought to be adopted.\n  And further, a final comment on the hard-to-understand definition of \ngermane. The dictionary defines it as being relevant, and the \ndictionary defines relevant as being germane, with the Parliamentarian \ngiving a supplemental opinion that if the standard was relevance, it \nwould be appropriate to have the amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/28/senate-section/article/S374-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S374-S375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, tonight we will hear from the President in \nhis annual State of the Union Address. I know the President is expected \nto talk a great deal about the economy and the need for an economic \nstimulus package. I wanted to talk for a moment about this because I \nthink it is important for us to understand what is happening to our \neconomy.\n  I know there are some who think the field of economics is some field \nwith precision and elegance and that we are dealing with the ship of \nstate. If we can find our way to the engine room and find all the knobs \nand gauges and valves and levers and turn them the right way, such as \nproviding an investment credit and bonus depreciation, that somehow we \nwill get this ship of state moving again. Of course, that is not what \nis at stake at all. There isn't an engine room with knobs and valves \nand gauges. This is the field of economics, which I have said \npreviously is a lot like psychology pumped up with helium.\n  So we talk a lot about knowing what is going on. The fact is we are \ngoing to now do a stimulus package because there is a notion that there \nis a problem with the economy. Well, there is more than a problem, \nthere is a very serious problem with this economy. Take a look at the \nstock market, which is a barometer of confidence--up and down similar \nto a yo-yo--mostly down. The housing market has cratered, with \nconstruction of new homes and apartments in 2007 down 25 percent from \nthe prior year. That is one of the giant job engines in our economy--\nthe housing market. The unemployment rate has jumped, with some 1.4 \nmillion workers without a job for 27 months or longer. The trade \ndeficit recently hit a 14-month high. Oil prices are still way up. \nRetail sales are their worst in years. So we have a very serious \nproblem.\n  Now, the Federal Reserve Board took bold action last week and that is \nunusual for the Federal Reserve Board. They all wear gray suits and \nwire-rimmed glasses and seldom do anything that is very bold, but last \nweek they did. They cut interest rates by three-quarters of 1 percent. \nSo the expectation is that because the Fed is taking that action and \nseems to be very concerned about the economy, that we should take a \nlook at our fiscal policy, so there is talk about a stimulus.\n  Frankly, I think a stimulus package is fine. I don't think it does \nall that much. But the absence of doing something on the Senate side of \nCongress would send the wrong signal. Psychologically, it is important \nwe work on a stimulus. We are talking about a stimulus that is probably \n1 percent of our economy, so it is not exactly going to jump start the \nAmerican economy. In addition, if all we do is a stimulus package and \nwe continue to ignore the fundamentals, the things that are \nstructurally wrong in this economy, the things that have not just \ncaused the economy to be in some trouble but caused the American people \nand people all around the world to look at us and say: You know \nsomething, you are off track. You are not addressing the things that \nmatter, and this is unsustainable. If we don't do something to address \nthose things, we will not be addressing the basic problem of our \neconomy.\n  So let me talk about that. No. 1, a fiscal policy. A reckless fiscal \npolicy. I mean, in recent years, think of it. This administration \ninherited a large budget surplus. Then we got hit with a recession, a \nwar in Afghanistan, a war in Iraq, a war on terrorism--and a whole \nseries of events--including Hurricane Katrina. Many of us said to the \nPresident: Don't propose we spend surpluses that don't yet exist. Let \nus be conservative. He said: Katy bar the door, let us have big tax \ncuts and most of it for the wealthy, and he pushed it through Congress.\n\n  Now, I didn't push for it, he did, and we ran up a huge deficit \nbecause of all these unexpected circumstances we were confronted with. \nSo now, in recent years, we have sent soldiers off to war, and the \nPresident says to Congress: We are sending soldiers to go fight, but we \ndon't intend to pay for it. I want the Congress to provide emergency \nspending in order to pay for that, and we will add it to the debt. Last \nyear, he asked Congress for $196 billion for the current fiscal year. \nThat is $16 billion a month, $4 billion a week, none of it paid for, \nand all of it added to the debt. As if to say to the soldiers: You go \nfight, and when you come home, we will have you and your kids pay the \nbills. That is a fiscal policy that is completely off balance.\n  We are going to borrow about $600 billion this year. That is how much \nwill be added to the debt. I know that is not what they say the deficit \nis. They say the deficit is lower because, among other things, they are \ntaking all the Social Security surplus from the trust funds and using \nit to show a lower deficit. We are going to borrow about $600 billion a \nyear to sustain the budget policies of this administration. Add to that \na $700 billion to $800 billion a year trade deficit, $2 billion a day \nevery single day, and you are talking about a combined red ink in our \nbudget and trade policies of some $1.3 trillion. That is almost 10 \npercent of the American economy. Think of that. That is unsustainable.\n  Now, add to a reckless fiscal policy and a trade policy in which we \nare hemorrhaging red ink and exporting American jobs, regulators who \nwere asleep on the job--people who came to Government but didn't want \nto regulate--and the subprime loan scandal occurred right under their \nnoses. We all heard the advertisements. When you turned on the \ntelevision, you heard the ads. It couldn't have escaped the notice of \nthe regulators, surely. The ads said: Have you been bankrupt? Do you \nhave trouble getting credit? Have you been missing your house payments? \nCome to us. We have a loan for you. We will give you a new home \nmortgage. And so they did, with a teaser rate at 2 percent and \nunbelievable circumstances.\n  Everybody was making lots of money. The brokers were making millions, \nthe mortgage banks were making a lot of money, and then they were \npacking these mortgage loans, the good ones, with the bad ones, just \nlike they used to pack sausage with meat and\n\n[[Page S375]]\n\nsawdust. They would use the sawdust as filler back in the old days.\n  Well, during unregulated times, just like packing sawdust into \nsausages, what these folks did is, they took good loans and bad loans, \npackaged them up. They sliced them up, then they securitized them, and \nsent them out, sold them, and everybody was happy and everybody was fat \nand everybody was making a lot of money, until it all came home to \nroost. A whole lot of folks could not make housing payments.\n  So what we found with the subprime loan scandal is 2.2 million \nfamilies with subprime loans will lose their homes to foreclosure; 7.2 \nmillion with subprime mortgages have an outstanding mortgage value of \n$1.3 trillion. And when those interest rates reset, a whole lot of them \nwill not be able to pay the bills to keep their homes.\n  All of this happened under the nose of regulators who came to \nGovernment not wanting to regulate. And it caused severe damage to our \ncountry. Now, add to that a reckless fiscal policy, a trade deficit in \nwhich we are hemorrhaging in red ink and shipping jobs overseas and a \nscandal in the home mortgage industry that caused enormous damage to \nour country, made a lot of folks rich in the short term, and victimized \na lot of others. Add to that the unbelievable speculation that is going \non in hedge funds, most all of it outside of the view of regulators.\n  Hedge funds are about $1.2 to $1.5 trillion in value; but that does \nnot describe their importance to the economy. They are heavily \nleveraged. That $1.2 to $1.5 trillion of hedge funds is engaged in one-\nhalf of all of the trades every day on the New York Stock Exchange. \nThey are engaged in, among other things, credit default swaps.\n  There is something called credit default swaps, derivatives, with \nnotional values of $43 trillion. There is so much unbelievable \nspeculation with dramatic amounts of leverage in hedge funds and \nderivatives that it is scary. Nobody knows what is going on because it \nis outside the view of regulators. That is the way they want to keep \nit.\n  We will talk about stimulus; we will talk about short-term measures. \nBut if we do not deal with this issue of a fiscal policy that is way \noff track, a trade policy that is an abject failure, regulators who \nhave no interest in regulating, scandals will develop and mature right \nunder their noses, this country is not going to recover. Our economy is \nnot going to thrive and grow. It is fine to do a stimulus package of 1 \npercent of GDP, I do not object to that. We will borrow the money from \nChina, likely, to do it; perhaps put some money in the hands of people \nwho will go to Wal-Mart and buy goods from China, for all I know.\n  But, psychologically, I think it is fine to create a fiscal policy \ninitiative that compliments what they are doing at the Fed with \nmonetary policy. But that will not solve the underlying problems in our \neconomy. We have deep abiding problems in fiscal policy, trade policy, \nand regulatory failures.\n  This Congress and this President have a responsibility to address \nthem. Talking about stimulus, and just talking about stimulus, means we \nhave not addressed that which moves this ship of state forward in the \nfuture, creating expansion opportunities and jobs and economic health. \nThe only way we do that is to stare truth in the eye and understand \nwhat is causing the problems in the country and how to fix it.\n  There is an old saying on Wall Street I was told by a friend: You \ncannot tell who is swimming naked until the tide goes out. Well, the \ntide has gone out, and now we are going to see some sights that are not \nvery pretty. It has to do with speculation and a whole series of things \nthat we have to correct. And my hope is, starting this evening at the \nState of the Union Address and following that, at last long last, we \nmight see a President and a Congress work together to face the truth \nabout fiscal policy, trade policy, and inept regulation that has put \nthis country in significant difficulty and trouble.\n  We need not have a future that manifests that trouble forever. If we \ntake bold action and courageous action to understand what is wrong and \nwhat the menu of items are that we need to go to fix it, I think we can \nhave a much better and brighter economic future in this country. I want \nto be a part of that work, and I know many of my colleagues do as well. \nSo let's hope the first step to do that begins this evening at the \njoint session of the Congress at the State of the Union Address.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/28/senate-section/article/S375-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         NOMINATION DISCHARGED\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have at \nleast 10 minutes to give my remarks on FISA.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been to this floor on numerous \noccasions to aggressively support the immunity provisions of the FISA \nmodernization bill. I cannot understate my\n\n[[Page S376]]\n\npassion for this issue. I am of the firm belief that the lawsuits \nfacing the telecom providers constitute a grave threat to national \nsecurity. The potential risks from inadvertent disclosure of classified \ninformation cannot be understated. The potential damage to our \nintelligence sources and methods from allowing these lawsuits to go \nforward is substantial. Unfortunately, the more we delay this \nlegislation, the more likely it is that our sensitive intelligence \nmethods will be exposed, and not just exposed to the American people \nbut to al-Qaida and thousands of other terrorists and enemies around \nthe world. Remember, the very point of these lawsuits is to prove \nplaintiffs' claims by disclosing classified information through the \ndiscovery process.\n  Let's think about this. Do we really want any person to be able to \nmake accusations that are utter hearsay and then be given the ability \nto jeopardize the intelligence community's sources and methods by \ndemanding discovery during frivolous litigation?\n  We simply cannot do this. We should never reveal our intelligence \nagencies' technical capabilities, who they work with, who they target, \nor what their strengths and weaknesses are. We on the Intelligence \nCommittees have that assignment because we are expected to honor the \nclassified nature of those matters. The reasons should be obvious to \nall of us.\n  Here is an example that illustrates this point: If criminals are \nrunning drugs northbound along I-95, they may have an idea that they \nwill encounter police checkpoints. But they need to transport the \ndrugs, so they will balance this risk. But what if they know for sure \nthere is a checkpoint in a specific State? What if they then find out \nthe checkpoint is at a specific mile marker? Will they change their \nroutes and methods? You better believe they will. They are not stupid \nand neither is al-Qaida. Does it really make sense for us to broadcast \nacross the globe, over the Internet, how we work? Do we want to replace \nthe uncertainty of how we track terrorists with established fact?\n  Confirmations or denials of the allegations in the lawsuits will \ncertainly reveal certain intelligence agencies' sources and methods. \nEven when the proceedings are in camera or ex parte, this risk is still \napparent. I cannot stress this point enough: The identity of any \ncompany that may or may not have cooperated with the Government with \nthe terrorist surveillance program is highly classified. Accusations \nand hearsay do not confirm any relationship. The very activities these \ncases seek to disclose could reveal whether a company has or hasn't \nassisted the Government. In addition, any verdict in the case would \nlikely provide the same type of information, and replacing the \nGovernment for these companies in the litigation does not solve the \nproblem.\n  Our enemies have tough decisions to make regarding how they \ncommunicate. They cannot stay silent forever, and they have to weigh \nthe need to communicate against the chances that their communications \nare intercepted. We know they are carefully watching us and following \nevery proceeding to see how our Government collects information. If \nthey think they see a weakness in our collection capabilities, they \nwill certainly try to take advantage of it. Make no mistake, al-Qaida \nand the other terrorist organizations would benefit tremendously from \nlearning the identity of any company that assisted the Government \nfollowing the attacks of 9/11.\n  A few of my colleagues and many in the outside media have highlighted \naccusations from a former telecom employee. His name is Mark Klein. Mr. \nKlein claims he has proof that computers diverted domestic electronic \ncommunications from a phone company directly to the NSA, the National \nSecurity Agency. In fact, his accusations play a major role in one of \nthe lawsuits currently facing a telecom provider.\n  It is important to note the Government chose not to classify Klein's \ndeclarations or exhibits in one of the lawsuits. The Government could \nhave, but it didn't. So Klein's court documents are public. Due to the \nongoing litigation, I do not want to speak directly to his claims, but \nI will highlight a statement that was made by an official representing \nthe Government during a court proceeding in one of the lawsuits against \na telecom provider. This statement was from the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral on June 23, 2006, in front of Judge Vaughn Walker. Here is what \nwas said about the decision not to classify Klein's declarations. This \nis the Government statement regarding Mark Klein:\n\n       We have not asserted a privilege over the Klein \n     declarations or exhibits. Mr. Klein and Marcus never had \n     access to any of the relevant classified information here, \n     and with all respect to them, through no fault or failure of \n     their own, they don't know anything.\n\n  I cannot understate the importance of this quote as it has never been \nmentioned during this debate. No further commentary on it is needed, \nbut I think its meaning is extremely important when Senators and the \npublic weigh the relevancy and reliability of Klein's accusations. I am \nparticularly hopeful that three of my distinguished colleagues who have \nhighlighted Klein's claims on this floor are aware of these statements \nfrom the Government. I hope we all realize Klein's accusations \nhighlight only one side of the story.\n\n  I also want to draw attention to another claim repeatedly made on \nthis floor: the false declaration that the immunity provision in this \nbill will ``close the courthouse door.'' These claims seek to convey \nthe false impression that the immunity provision in this bill will halt \nall litigation relating to the terrorist surveillance program, or TSP.\n  This is absolutely false. There are no fewer than seven lawsuits \ncurrently pending against Government officials that are related to the \nTSP. The immunity provision in this bill will not--I repeat that, will \nnot--affect any of those cases. These cases are completely unaffected \nby the immunity provision in this bill.\n  Here are the cases. Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, Inc. v. George W. \nBush; ACLU v. National Security Agency; Center for Constitutional \nRights v. George W. Bush; Guzzi v. George W. Bush; Henderson v. Keith \nAlexander; Shubert v. George W. Bush; Tooley v. George W. Bush.\n  Finally, it is imperative for us to understand national security is \ngreatly dependent on the cooperation of telecom providers. We cannot do \nit by ourselves. Yet many foreign governments are in quite the opposite \nsituation, one which gives them an advantage in certain electronic \ninterceptions. Many foreign telecoms are run by the respective host \ngovernment. Many others have government officials with controlling \nauthority. These countries do not have to worry about telecom \ncooperation. They can simply force the telecoms to comply.\n  We have chosen not to have that system in our great Nation. Rather, \nwe rely on the voluntary assistance of telecommunication providers. \nWhen these companies are asked to assist the intelligence community \nbased on a program authorized by the President and based on assurances \nfrom the highest levels of Government that the program has been \ndetermined to be lawful, they should be able to rely on these \nrepresentations.\n  For those who argue we need a compromise, let me be clear: We already \nhave a compromise. The Government wanted more than what is represented \nin this bill, and they did not get it. The chairman of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence stated the following in the \nIntelligence Committee report:\n\n       The [Intelligence] Committee did not endorse the immunity \n     provision lightly. It was the informed judgment of the \n     Committee after months in which we carefully reviewed the \n     facts in the matter. The Committee reached the conclusion \n     that the immunity remedy was appropriate in this case after \n     holding numerous hearings and briefings on the subject and \n     conducting thorough examination of the letters sent by the \n     U.S. Government to the telecommunications companies.\n\n  The immunity provisions in this bill are limited in scope. Not \neveryone is going to be happy with them, and that is the whole point. \nI, for one, wanted to see more protection for companies and Government \nofficials in this bill, but I am willing to accept the compromise, and \nmy colleagues should be willing to do the same. We are not all getting \nwhat we want. We are getting what the public has to have--what the \npublic needs.\n  We have been working on legislation to modernize FISA since at least \nApril\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\nof 2007. I am extremely proud of the bipartisan efforts that led to \nthis bill in the Intelligence Committee where all of the investigations \nwere made, where the intelligence was protected. We found a balance. \nLet's show the confidence and resolve to vote on this compromise, not \nback away from it.\n  I will support cloture on the Rockefeller-Bond substitute amendment, \nand I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  In that regard, I pray that my colleagues will listen to the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, Senator \nBond, who has played a significantly proper and important role in \nhelping to get this bill through the committee and to the Senate floor. \nThis is a major bill of protection for our country, and I attribute \nmuch of the success of it to Senator Rockefeller, the chairman of the \ncommittee, and Senator Bond, the ranking member, both of whom have been \nsterling leaders on this issue. I hope it is not true that anybody in \nthis body will support some of the amendments that may be brought to \nthe Senate floor because we have looked at this issue frontwards, \nbackwards, all over the place. We have examined it. We spent many \nmonths on this subject in the Intelligence Committee. That should not \nbe ignored. It passed the Intelligence Committee 13 to 2 compared to \nthe substitute we defeated with cloture that was 10 to 9 in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask that we support cloture on this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe our time on this side has expired. \nI thank my colleague from Utah, who is a valued member of the \nIntelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee, truly a real \nauthority in this area. When he speaks, he speaks from not only a great \ndeal of knowledge but study. We are grateful for his assistance. He is \na tremendous asset to this body in many ways but none more so than on \nthe Intelligence Committee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the vote to invoke \ncloture on the FISA bill. I have no choice but to vote against cloture \nin order to preserve the rights of my colleagues to have their \namendments to this landmark legislation considered.\n  It has been a very weird process. The FISA legislation before the \nSenate has been taken, in effect, hostage. In a transparent attempt to \nscore political points off of national security issues, the White House \nhas decided, once again, that scaring the American people with \nunfounded and manipulative claims is in order.\n  The President's decision to use the FISA bill in a game of chicken \nrepresents a new low, even by Washington standards.\n  The administration's practice of placing politics above national \nsecurity when it serves the poll-driven agenda of its advisers has \nbecome an addiction in this White House. Even when the Senate is on the \nverge of producing much needed national security legislation that the \nPresident supports and wants, the addictive political cravings that \nhave coursed through the administration's body for the past 7 years \nkick in once again.\n  As is often the case, addictions produce behavior that is both \nirrational, and in this case more, unfortunately, self-destructive. In \nthis case, the White House has misguidedly calculated that it is worth \njeopardizing passage of a bill which they support, which strengthens \nthe collection of foreign intelligence, in order to obtain a short-term \npolitical objective.\n  The White House is gambling with the safety of Americans and the \ncontinued cooperation of companies that we rely on to aid in our \nefforts to protect our country. It is time for the Senate to take a \nstand and reject these reprehensible tactics.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee took enormous care to craft \nlegislation that would give our intelligence community greater latitude \nto conduct surveillance of foreign targets while not compromising the \nconstitutional and statutory protections afforded to Americans both \nhere and overseas.\n  Senator Kit Bond and I worked extremely closely on that, as we did, \nas I will explain, with many others. This was a painstaking process. It \nwent over many months, but it ultimately produced this balanced \nlegislation that the vice chairman and the committee and I sought.\n  It is a solid bill. And I believe with some limited changes it can be \na better bill; limited changes, I might add, that will in no way impede \nor in any way intrude into the collection of the intelligence we need.\n  Every step of the way during the process of producing this bill gave \nme great satisfaction. We worked in a consultive way with the \nadministration. These discussions have always been in good faith. We \nhave talked as professionals, trying to work out a hard problem to \nwhich most people do not pay a lot of attention but which has enormous \nconsequences for our country, and we have done it in good faith, the \nvery good faith that the actions of the White House now threaten to \nunravel.\n  From when the Intelligence Committee called on the administration to \npropose a FISA modernization bill last spring--the vice chairman and I \ndid that--to the many committee hearings that followed, to section-by-\nsection, line-by-line, word-by-word consultations too numerous to count \nthat we had with the lawyers and intelligence experts in the Justice \nDepartment, from the National Security Agency, from the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence to outside experts, we have worked in \ngood faith with the administration to achieve, against, frankly, \nconsiderable odds, the unthinkable, to wit: a bipartisan bill dealing \nwith the issues of profound complexity that has the endorsement of not \nonly the President but also of the intelligence community professionals \nwho will be the ones who carry out this surveillance. They want this \nbill.\n  The committee included in its FISA bill a narrowly crafted provision \nthat would provide immunity for telecommunications companies that \nparticipated in the President's warrantless surveillance program after \nSeptember 11 and until the program was placed under court authorization \nlast January.\n  We rejected the administration's proposed open-ended language in \ndefining very tailored immunity language. We rejected their open-ended \nlanguage to extend immunity to Government officials. That was taken \nout. So if there was wrongdoing somewhere, do not make the assumption \nautomatically, without thinking this thing through deeply, that it came \nfrom a private sector entity as opposed to public officials.\n  I realize this is a controversial matter with many of my colleagues, \nparticularly on my side of the aisle, but I reject the games that are \nbeing played on both sides: by those Senators who are prepared to \nfilibuster the bill due to their opposition to narrow immunity, and the \nadministration's wishes to prevent the Senate from considering any \nalternative amendments to the immunity provision.\n  We should debate the liability issue fully, and the Senate should be \nallowed to consider alternative amendments. And I say this, and I think \nthe vice chairman would agree with me, out of an abundance of \nconfidence that the committee position will ultimately be sustained by \nthe Senate in the end.\n  The majority leader has made prompt passage of the FISA bill the top \npriority for the Senate. He pushed off other subjects so that it could \nbe conferenced with the House and eventually be placed on the \nPresident's desk for his signature. If allowed, the Senate can complete \naction on the FISA bill in a matter of a few days. Unlike many bills \nthe Senate considers where the number of amendments that can be \ndisposed of can approach or exceed 100 or 150 or 175, passage of the \nFISA bill will probably involve relatively modest numbers of amendments \nand a very manageable number of amendments.\n  I estimate that number would be somewhere in the 12-to-15 amendment \nrange, probably fewer. Some of these amendments I would support as \nneeded as improvements to the bill of the committee, the Intelligence \nCommittee. Many I would oppose because of my concern that it would undo \nthe careful balance we achieved in the underlying Committee bill. This \nis a stitched piece of work between collection of intelligence for the \nnational security and\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\nthe rights and privacy of individuals. I will oppose anything that \nundoes that balance.\n\n  The amendments that are likely to pass with a majority vote, at least \nin my view, such as the Feinstein exclusivity and Cardin sunset \namendments, are further refinements of provisions already in the \nIntelligence Committee bill, and they in no way bear on the collection \nof intelligence authorities sought and provided by our bill. Those that \nwould undercut these authorities to be able to do collection, I am \nconfident, would go down to defeat.\n  But the Republican leadership, under orders from the White House, \nobjected to these amendments being considered and voted on, and the \nbill passed before the February 1 expiration of the temporary and \nflawed Protect America Act passed last August. So that is where we are \ngoing to be unless we can resolve this in the Senate, which we could do \nby the end of the week.\n  Why? Why has the White House used obstructionist tactics to prevent \nthe Senate from passing a FISA bill that it wants, that it has declared \nacceptable?\n  The President says he wants the Intelligence Committee bill passed as \nsoon as possible. He said as recently as last Friday that he \nunderstands there may be some limited number of changes that will be \nneeded to make the bill stronger. Others, including Minority Leader \nMcConnell and Vice Chairman Bond, also have acknowledged the reality \nthat amendments will have to be brought up and voted on before the \nSenate can pass the bill. That is, after all, the way of the Senate.\n  Why, then, are they preventing the Senate from voting on the limited \nnumber of amendments before us and passing the bill, a bill that they \nwant? Why? A bill that has everything to do with the future of our \ncountry, our national security, and a bill which we will not soon come \nto again if we don't achieve success in the coming days.\n  The majority leader has repeatedly offered the proposal to extend the \nFebruary 1 expiration date in the current stopgap law 30 days to allow \nsufficient time to complete our work on the legislation. But each time \nthis 30-day extension consent request was sought, it was killed by the \nRepublican leadership under orders from the White House.\n  Why in the world would a temporary extension be objectionable to a \nPresident who is on record as saying he doesn't want the current law to \nexpire without a more lasting FISA modernization bill in place? Yet, in \none of the most astounding ``Alice in Wonderland'' moments I have ever \nwitnessed in my time in the Senate, the White House announced last week \nthat the President would veto a 30-day extension of the current foreign \ncollection authorities passed by Congress.\n  So let's recap. The President wants the FISA bill passed by the \nSenate, but he has sent the decree down to the Republican leadership \nthat they are to prevent its prompt passage. Well, prompt passage we \nhave to have. The President does not want the current 6-month Protect \nAmerica Act to expire this Friday. He does not want that to happen. But \nhe has stated he will veto any extension and thereby ensure that it \nwill expire. What more evidence is needed to demonstrate the irrational \nand self-destructive political addiction that drives this White House? \nDoesn't drive the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I \nguarantee that.\n  Under the tortured logic of protecting America against terrorism, the \nWhite House has decided to exercise, frankly, its own form of political \nterrorism and has taken the FISA bill hostage.\n  From the beginning, the administration has demonstrated a deep-seated \ncontempt for the role of Congress in authorizing and monitoring \nintelligence activities.\n  Whether it is the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance \nprogram or the Central Intelligence Agency's secret detention and \ninterrogation program, the White House for over 5 years walled off the \nCongress and the courts from conducting the sort of meaningful \noversight and checks and balances that are essential to making sure our \nintelligence programs are on sound legal operational footing.\n  To make matters worse, the administration has successfully used \nobjections and delaying tactics over the past 3 years to keep the \nintelligence authorization bill from being passed and signed into law. \nIt is this flawed policy of Executive Branch unilateralism that has \ncreated the mess we are now dealing with.\n  There is no possible way I can overstate the importance of this bill. \nBut it is hard to explain. Everybody can grasp on to the immunity \nissue, leap to one side or the other, often without sufficient thought. \nBut the bill as a whole, meshed together as a whole like an Appalachian \nquilt, is a thing of beauty, can be improved, and should be passed.\n  Nevertheless, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Republican cloture \nmotion on the FISA bill so that we can reassert something called the \nrole of Congress that we must play on these and other important \nnational security matters. Oversight is what we do. We don't write a \nlot of bills in the Intelligence Committee, but we do oversight. But it \nis not welcome in the current atmosphere.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Republican cloture motion so that \nwe can consider on their merits the limited, manageable number of \namendments to the bill and, in the process, push bipartisan FISA reform \nacross the finish line.\n  I know Vice Chairman Bond and others are ready to get back to \nbusiness and start disposing of amendments. I feel confident that he \nand I, as managers of this bill, will work closely, as we have in the \ncommittee, to ensure that we do no unintended harm to this bill in the \nmatters of collection of intelligence or any other unbalancing of this \nAppalachian craftwork.\n  There is still time for the Senate to work its way on the FISA bill \nand pass it before the week's end. I hope we do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is my understanding that this side has 40 \nminutes of debate; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's side has 46 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that be \ndivided; that I be allocated 15 minutes and that I be notified when my \n15 minutes is up; that at the appropriate time, the Senator from Texas \nbe recognized for 15 minutes; and then, after intervening discussion \nfrom the other side, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, be \nrecognized for 5 minutes. I would reserve the remainder of the time for \nclosing argument.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we began consideration of this bill on December 17, \nthe FISA Amendments Act of 2007. As my friend the chairman said, it was \npassed by the Senate Intelligence Committee with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. It has garnered the support of the Director of \nNational Intelligence, and I believe it is the way forward.\n  I was a bit amused to hear my friend say that the FISA bill was being \ntaken hostage; they were scoring political points. I haven't heard from \nthe White House anything other than they want to have this bill passed.\n  We have sought to protect the rights of Republican Members on the \nminority side. We have suggested that this bill is so controversial, as \nall intelligence bills are, that amendments be subjected to a 60-vote \nmajority. The simple fact is, we could pass perhaps a number of \namendments that could destroy the structure of the bill we have \npresented and put us in the position where it would not get the 60 \nvotes needed to pass.\n  My suggestion is that we move forward accepting some amendments. \nThere are amendments on both sides, I agree with the chairman, that can \nbe accepted. Maybe we could even accept them without a vote or accept \nvotes on others at a simple majority, a 51-vote majority, and then on \ncertain controversial ones, we may have to have 60 votes. But we are \nready to move forward. We are not the ones who have held up this bill. \nVery briefly, in April, the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral \nMcConnell--and I will refer to him as the DNI--sent a bill to the \nSenate Intelligence Committee and said FISA is out of date. It has to \nbe updated. He came before us and testified in May. I asked him to do \nsomething.\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\nNothing happened. He came before the full Senate, actually, in closed \nsession, all Senators invited; that was in June. He explained how \nurgent it was and how we were being left deaf and blind to \ncommunications of terrorists. Nothing happened.\n  It was at the end of that session, going into the August recess, that \nhe proposed a temporary shortened version of FISA which became the \nProtect America Act. I was pleased to support that in the Senate. It \npassed the House and was signed.\n  We came back in September, knowing we had to work together on a \nbipartisan basis, and the Senate Intelligence Committee and staff \nworked very hard on a bipartisan basis to produce a bill, a very good \nbill. It was the ultimate compromise. There were some on both sides who \nwere sullen but not rebellious. But we got the job done. We provided \nthe tools the intelligence community needed and significantly expanded \nthe protection of American civil liberties and privacy rights.\n  The bill sat on the floor in October. It finally came to the floor \nDecember 17. A number on the majority side spoke out against the civil \nliability protection afforded providers who allegedly assisted the \nGovernment with the President's terrorist surveillance program, or TSP. \nThey criticized various provisions in the Intelligence Committee bill. \nThey spoke in favor of what regrettably was a partisan Judiciary \nCommittee substitute.\n  Debate is good for democracy but only if it is based on facts. \nUnfortunately, during the December filibuster, we heard a number of \nallegations, accusations, and even misrepresentation about the \ncommittee's bill and the TSP. Some of those comments will be repeated \ntoday.\n  Our intelligence community professionals must have the tools they \nneed to protect us. This is not the time to pass legislation that will \nmake people feel good or will score political points. We must pass a \nbill the DNI will support and, thus, the President will sign. That \nshould be our goal. Distorting the truth will not help us get there.\n  The record must be set straight, and these are some of the myths we \nhave heard. What are the facts? We were told that a ``new and \naggressive'' interpretation of article II authority was used to justify \nthe TSP. There is nothing new or aggressive about relying on the \nPresident's article II authority in the context of foreign intelligence \nsurveillance.\n  Courts, including the FISA Court of Review in the 2002 In re: Sealed \nCase decision and the Fourth Circuit in the Truong case, have long \nrecognized distinctions between domestic and foreign surveillance and \nthe President's constitutional authority to conduct foreign \nintelligence surveillance. Nor is it ``an invitation to lawlessness'' \nto argue that the President has inherent constitutional authority to \nwiretap without a court order. The Constitution is the highest law of \nthe land and trumps any statute.\n  In 1978, when Congress recognized the tension between FISA and the \nPresident's inherent authority under article II, they noted that \nwarrantless surveillance for foreign intelligence gathering has been an \nintegral part of our Nation's foreign intelligence. During World War \nII, our warrantless surveillance of the German and Japanese militaries \nand the breaking of their codes preserved our democracy. More recently, \nthe Clinton administration conducted a warrantless search of the \nresidence of convicted spy Aldrich Ames.\n\n  The Intelligence Committee conducted a comprehensive, bipartisan \nreview of the TSP. There is no evidence to substantiate the claims that \nthe administration began its warrantless surveillance before September \n11 or that the TSP covered domestic calls between neighbors, friends, \nand loved ones. As the President has stated, the TSP collected \ninternational calls involving members of al-Qaida.\n  For many months, critics have argued that TSP could have been \nconducted under FISA. That argument needs to be laid to rest. A \ndecision by a FISA court last spring proved that the TSP could not have \nbeen done under FISA as it existed. The court decision resulted in \nsignificant intelligence gaps which led to the passage of the Protect \nAmerica Act.\n  I was not there, but I understand this matter was discussed by the \nPresident with the top leaders of this body and the other body, as well \nas the Intelligence Committee, and was told at the time it would not be \npossible to redraft and change the old FISA law in time to collect the \ncritical information they hoped to gather before attacks occurred \nimmediately following September 11.\n  The liability protection for those carriers who allegedly assisted \nthe Government with the TSP lies at the heart of this legislation. The \nPresident did what he had to do under article II, and our country was \nsafer for it, and our country was safer because some of the carriers \nalleged to have participated acted in reliance and good faith on orders \nof the Attorney General, transmitting the President's order--and the \nintelligence community.\n  In his original FISA modernization request in April of 2007, the DNI \nasked for full liability protection for all those allegedly involved. \nSome Members have attacked DNI McConnell's integrity, calling him ``an \naccidental truth teller'' and accusing him of backing out of an \nagreement made under the PAA. These comments are not only unjustified, \nunwarranted, and unfair, they are counterproductive. Throughout this \ndebate, the DNI and other intelligence professionals have given us \nunbiased advice and technical assistance. They have assisted Democrats \nand Republicans. We need to focus on the task at hand, not engage in \npersonal attacks against a man who has served his country honorably in \nthe military and the intelligence community, and continues to do so as \nhead of the community.\n  Some of the Members have downplayed the need for liability \nprotection. They argue that carriers already have statutory immunity \nand that continued litigation will not harm providers or our \nintelligence efforts. These statements reflect a startling lack of \nknowledge about our intelligence collection, which is dangerous to the \ncontinued operation of our gathering.\n  First, the companies cannot prove they are entitled to statutory \nimmunity because the Government must assert state secrets to protect \ntheir intelligence collection methods. Second, while it is true that \nthe existence of the TSP has been revealed, there are still, \nfortunately, a few details about the program that have not. Each day \nthe lawsuits continue--with the prospect of civil discovery--there come \nnew risks that sensitive details about our intelligence sources and \nmethods will be revealed. As General Hayden stated a year and a half \nago: The disclosure of the TSP has had a significant impact on \nintelligence gathering of terrorists. We are applying the Darwinian \ntheory. We are only capturing the dumb ones. We should not give \nterrorists additional insight through continued TSP litigation.\n  Further, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies rely on the \nwillingness of providers to cooperate--in emergencies, as with the \nkidnapping of a child, or when court orders are not required. Yet some \ncarriers have already told us if they do not get liability protection, \nthey will not be able to risk their business, their reputation, by \ncontinuing to help without court orders. That would be devastating to \nour intelligence collection.\n  Our committee weighed all these arguments for and against liability \nprotection. We concluded by a 12-to-3 bipartisan vote that civil \nliability protection for providers--and only providers, not Government \nofficials--was not only fair, it was the only way to safeguard our \nintelligence sources and methods, and to ensure the continued \ncooperation of the providers.\n  Substitution is not a solution since it would allow civil discovery \nto proceed against providers, still leaving them open to disclosure and \nexceedingly serious competitive and reputational harm, perhaps even \nphysical retaliation by radicals who oppose our intelligence gathering. \nThe intelligence community advised us through testimony and gave us \ndocuments that these companies acted in good faith, and we in the \ncommittee agreed with them. The providers who may have participated \nrelied upon representations from the highest levels of Government.\n  There is no need to create a statutory mechanism for a court, whether \nit be the FISA Court or any other, to second-guess this determination. \nAllowing\n\n[[Page S380]]\n\na court to do so would throw uncertainty into an area where the \ncommittee's intent is clear: The ongoing civil litigation against \nproviders must end. On this last point, the term ``amnesty'' was tossed \naround in December. But that incorrectly assumes that alleged carriers \ndid something illegal. These carriers do not need amnesty. They did \nnothing wrong. They deserve liability protection.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the DNI said he will support the Intelligence \nCommittee's bill with two revisions. Yet some Members insist there are \nfatal flaws. We heard, No. 1, that there are no consequences if the \nFISC rejects the targeting/minimization procedures; No. 2, the bill \ndoes not contain a ``reverse targeting'' prohibition; and, No. 3, it \nallows warrantless interception of purely domestic communications. A \nplain reading of our bill shows that each one of these arguments is \nfalse.\n  The bill that came out of our committee goes farther than ever before \nin providing a meaningful role for the courts and Congress in \noverseeing acquisitions of foreign intelligence. The FISA Court will \nreview the targeting and minimization procedures to ensure they comply \nwith the law. If the court finds any deficiency, it can order the \nGovernment to correct the deficiency or cease the acquisition.\n  There is nothing--I repeat, nothing--in this bill that will allow \nwarrantless wiretapping of Americans in violation of title III criminal \nwiretaps or FISA. There are explicit prohibitions against ``reverse \ntargeting'' and the targeting of the person inside the United States \nwithout a court order. Americans abroad are given new FISA Court \nprotections. The acquisitions must also comply with the fourth \namendment. These are major new protections for Americans. Yet in spite \nof these measures--protections we have never seen before in the world \nof foreign targeting--we have been told the intelligence community will \nstill target innocent Americans, listening to calls between parents and \nchildren overseas, between students and their friends studying abroad. \nThat is absolute nonsense. The Intelligence Committee's bill only \nallows targeting of persons outside the United States to obtain foreign \nintelligence information. This is not a dragnet of surveillance. We are \nnot listening to, quote, completely innocent people overseas, unquote, \nas some have claimed. The targets must be foreign targets--suspected \nterrorists or terrorist group members--and the Attorney General and the \nDNI must certify that a significant purpose of the acquisition is to \nobtain foreign intelligence information.\n\n  For example, if a foreign target is believed to be an agent or member \nof al-Qaida, then all communications will be intercepted. Only \nAmericans who communicate with that target will have those specific \nconversations monitored. If those same conversations turn out to be \npurely innocent, they will be ``minimized,'' or suppressed. Even if the \ncommunication contains foreign intelligence information, it is likely, \nin many instances, the identity of any U.S. person will be masked--or \nprotected--in any intelligence reporting. Americans' privacy rights are \nprotected up to the point where they are actually engaging in a \nterrorist operation.\n  Mr. President, I see my time is running out. I will reserve the \nremainder of my time. I will give the rest of my remarks at a later \ntime.\n  Thank you.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  The Senate should not be having a cloture vote on this legislation \ntoday. What we should be doing is considering and voting on the \namendments that I and my colleagues tried to bring up last week, and \nother amendments that have been proposed to improve this badly flawed \nbill. But the minority does not think we should have the right to \nactually legislate here. They expect this body to rubberstamp that \nbill.\n  I am afraid I have to say the conduct of the minority has been very \ndisturbing on this. They insisted for weeks that it is absolutely \ncritical to finish the FISA legislation by February 1, even going so \nfar as to object repeatedly to efforts by the majority leader to extend \nfor only 1 month the Protect America Act--a law they rammed through \nthis Chamber in August--and they still don't want to give us another \nmonth so the Senate can carefully consider changes to it.\n  So the majority leader brought to the floor the Intelligence \nCommittee bill, the legislation that the minority wanted to consider \nand urged the Senate to stay in session through the weekend to complete \nwork on it. I criticized the majority leader for bringing the \nIntelligence Committee bill to the floor because I thought the Senate \nshould be working from the much better bill reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee, on which I also serve, but I would have thought the minority \nwould be pleased by the majority leader's decision.\n  So what have they done in response? They have obstructed all efforts \nto actually work on this bill. They will not allow me to get a vote on \nthe one amendment I have offered--an amendment cosponsored by Senator \nHagel--and they will not allow me or anyone else to offer any other \namendments. They filed for cloture the day this Senate began working on \nthe bill, after allowing only a single amendment to be called up. They \nhave effectively halted Senate consideration of this bill, despite the \nfact they are the ones--they are the ones--who are arguing that the \nFebruary deadline is so critical. They seem to think that scare tactics \npeddled by administration officials, such as the Vice President, will \nbe enough to pressure the Senate into letting them have their way. I \ncertainly hope they are wrong.\n  Mr. President, as you well know, this legislation is in serious need \nof fixing. It authorizes widespread surveillance involving Americans at \nhome and abroad. Yes, it does. Despite what the Senator from Missouri \nsaid, it certainly does do that. I have a number of amendments I want \nto offer, both to ensure that the FISA Court has more authority to \noversee these authorities, and to guarantee Americans their fourth \namendment rights. But I cannot even get a vote on the one, simple, \nstraightforward, and extremely modest amendment I offered last week. \nThis demonstrates how brazen these tactics are. This bipartisan \namendment would merely require that the Government provide copies of \nimportant FISA Court orders and pleadings for review to the committees \nof jurisdiction in a classified setting, so that Members of Congress \ncan understand how FISA has been interpreted and is being applied. You \nwould think this amendment would be, as they say, a no-brainer, and yet \nthe minority will not even consent to a vote on that.\n  But at least that one amendment is pending, and we will get a vote \neventually. If the Republicans succeed in cutting off debate on this \nlegislation, the Senate will not be able to vote on any other \namendments, including the amendment Senator Dodd and I wish to offer to \ndeny retroactive immunity to telecom companies that allegedly \ncooperated with the administration's illegal wiretapping program. It is \nunconscionable to think that the Senate should have to make a final \ndecision on this legislation without even having an opportunity to \ndebate and vote on whether to grant retroactive immunity to companies \nthat allegedly cooperated with an illegal program.\n  And why are we in this situation? Because the minority and the \nadministration think they are entitled to ram the deeply flawed \nIntelligence Committee bill through the Senate without any changes. It \nseems they are worried the Senate might actually pass some of the very \nreasonable amendments I and others would like to offer if they give us \na chance to do so or perhaps they are trying to sabotage the bill and \nthen figure out a way to blame that outcome on Democrats.\n\n  No Senator--no Senator--should go along with these cynical, strong-\narm tactics. We have to stand up to the administration and stand up for \nour rights.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose cloture. Invoking cloture on \nthis bill would be an abdication of our responsibility to consider \nlegislation that will have a huge impact on the\n\n[[Page S381]]\n\nAmerican people for years to come. I hope even those who support the \nIntelligence Committee bill will think twice before voting to make this \nbody a rubberstamp.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I don't know why any Member of the Senate \nwould object to procedures we would employ within the bounds of the law \nto listen to communications of terrorists in order to detect and deter \nfurther terrorist attacks on our own soil or against Americans or our \nallies. That is what this legislation does. Unfortunately, I think we \nare beginning to see a dangerous trend on the part of the Senate: Never \nfailing to put off until tomorrow what we could and should do today.\n  This legislation has been considered for an awfully long time, as we \nall know, in a bipartisan vote of the Senate Intelligence Committee, 13 \nto 2. In October, this legislation was voted out of the Intelligence \nCommittee in a carefully crafted attempt to consult with the Director \nof National Intelligence, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, \nand all other intelligence community members who might be impacted by \nthis legislation. There has been opportunity after opportunity for \ninput into this legislation by Members of the Senate. Yet we hear today \nthere are those on the floor of the Senate who are saying: Well, let's \nnot vote on this legislation now. Let's kick the ball down the road \nanother month so we can have the same debate, the same discussion we \nhave been having for all those many months leading up to this point. \nThe only reason we are where we are today is because we were unable to \nget a lengthy extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in \nAugust. Because of objections by those on the other side who are \ncomplaining about this legislation again today, we were only able to \npass this legislation until December and then another extension was \ngranted until February 1, when this Protect America Act expires of its \nown terms. I would hope this body would continue to act in a strong \nbipartisan manner in which the Intelligence Committee has voted this \nbill out of the Intelligence Committee by a vote of 13 to 2.\n  I appreciate the fact that this body tabled the Judiciary Committee's \npartisan substitute and sent a signal that bipartisanship and consensus \nmay once again become ascendant in matters of national security in the \nSenate. I think we would see that as a welcome development. At a time \nwhen we are talking about an economic stimulus package and seeing \ncooperation from the Speaker and the minority leader in the House and \nthe President of the United States on matters affecting the economy, \nwhy can't we get that same sort of bipartisan cooperation on matters \naffecting national security?\n  Today, the Senate is poised to move this critical national security \nlegislation one step closer to the President's desk. Today's vote will \ntell us much more about whether this Senate is ready to set aside \npartisanship and willing to get the job done.\n  Members of this body will remember that in December we had to pass an \nOmnibus appropriations bill that affected all discretionary spending of \nthe U.S. Federal Government because we had been unable to pass 11 out \nof the 12 appropriations bills that it was our responsibility to pass. \nUnfortunately, this Senate has an unfortunate recent tendency to put \noff things until tomorrow what we should and could be doing today, and \nwe should not let that happen. We need to finish this legislation to \ngive Members a chance to debate and then to vote.\n  I don't favor each and every provision included in the bipartisan \ncompromise that is sponsored by Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman \nBond, but I do appreciate the fact that it is a carefully crafted \ncompromise. It is a bipartisan compromise. It is the product of \nextensive consultation and negotiation with the experts in our \nintelligence and defense communities.\n  In other words, this legislation reflects the valuable and necessary \ninput of the very men and women who are currently intercepting phone \ncalls, text messages, and e-mails between al-Qaida and their \noperatives--those who wish to do America and America's interests harm.\n  The Senate has two choices today as the deadline for action rapidly \napproaches on February 1. On the one hand, we can show the American \npeople that at least when it comes to matters of national security, it \nis possible to put partisanship aside and to get the job done in a \nbipartisan way. The other choice, which the majority leader has \nproposed, is we ask the American people for an extension, that we kick \nthe can down the road for another month, only to find ourselves back in \nprecisely the same posture we are in today: With no issues resolved and \nwith the same old debates to be rehashed when we ought to finish the \njob today and follow the path of maximum responsibility.\n  I ask my colleagues: What excuse could there possibly be to put the \ntough choices off for another month? What justifies asking the American \npeople for more time to get the job done when we know what the choices \nare and we have simply to make those choices by our vote today. We have \nhad 6 months since the Protect America Act was passed in August of last \nyear to get the job done. In that time, this legislation has been \nsubjected to scrutiny by two Senate committees, and there has been \nsignificant time debating this legislation on the floor.\n\n  The fact is there is no acceptable excuse for failing to do our duty \nand our job. The excuses offered for delay are as compelling as the old \nschool house claim that my dog ate my homework, I couldn't get it done.\n  I say no more excuses, no more extensions. It is time for Congress to \ncome together in a bipartisan fashion in the national security \ninterests of the United States.\n  It is specious to say there is no consequence to another extension, \nand it is the height of irresponsibility to argue that delay is the \nonly responsible choice. As America's elected leaders, we have a \nresponsibility to keep America safe. We cannot simply close our eyes \nand wish away the terrorist threat. It is easy this many years after \nSeptember 11 to be lulled into a false sense of security as time takes \nus further away from that terrible attack on American soil. But it is \nundeniable that the threat from al-Qaida and Islamic extremists \nremains.\n  In the face of the very real threat of radical Islamic terror, \nCongress must be resolute and we must eschew attempts to split along \npartisan lines, and we must embrace bipartisan solutions to our very \nreal national security problem. That is what a vote on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee bill would reflect: a bipartisan solution to a \nnational security challenge.\n  That is why it defies credibility to argue that the responsible thing \nto do is to put the job off for another month. The majority leader's \nplea for an extension implies that the only two choices we have are, on \nthe one hand, an extension for 1 month and, on the other hand, no bill \nat all. Neither of those is a responsible choice.\n  In fact, there is a third option, and that option is for the Senate \nto pass a consensus bill that has the bipartisan support of the \nchairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate, experts in the intelligence \ncommunity, and the President of the United States.\n  Let's be clear about what an extension means. An extension means \nfurther delay. It means putting off tough choices. It means not only to \ndo so in a time of war but in a time of economic fragility, when we \nhave other work we need to be doing on the floor of the Senate that is \nbeing taken up unnecessarily by repeating the same arguments over and \nover without any conclusion. It also means Congress has lacked the \ncourage to relieve some of America's leading companies from the burdens \nand costs of litigation arising from their cooperation in the war on \nterror.\n  Let us remember the telecommunications companies that may have \ncooperated with our Government at the request of our President, and \nupon the certification of the Attorney General, the chief law \nenforcement officer, that what they were being asked to do was within \nthe law. To continue to subject them to litigation for doing their \ncivic duty, to incur ongoing expense and inconvenience and to risk \ninformation that is sensitive to our security coming out during the \nprocess is simply not a responsible option.\n\n[[Page S382]]\n\n  Some in Congress apparently think these companies should have second-\nguessed the legal representations made by the President and the \nAttorney General in the days and weeks and months following the 9/11 \nattacks. Some in Congress have argued that the companies had a duty not \nto cooperate, a duty to refuse to assist this Nation's intelligence \ncommunity with tracking terrorists during wartime. That is, \nunfortunately, how far we have come in this debate and how off the mark \nsome have come.\n  These companies, as every good citizen who cooperates with their \nGovernment to try to keep America secure in good faith, deserve the \nprotection we are being asked to give them in this legislation. These \ncostly lawsuits have not only put in jeopardy the future cooperation of \nthese firms but also the critical national security concerns \npotentially exposed to the discovery process in civil litigation. It \nmay be popular in some quarters to bash corporate America, but that \nrhetoric is sorely misplaced in this debate. The men and women who \nmanage these companies made a good-faith decision to do their patriotic \nduty--to help their Government to track terrorists and to save American \nlives, and they should not be punished for it. They should be thanked \nfor their cooperation.\n  For Congress to allow these burdensome lawsuits to continue this long \nis unfortunate and unjust indeed, but for Congress to continue to put \noff the tough choices and leave these companies in legal limbo is not \nonly unfortunate and unjust, it is also irresponsible. Now is the time \nfor Congress to decide the question--no more excuses, no more delays, \nno more extensions. Today, the Senate can choose a path forward, a \nbipartisan path on critical national security measures, and I urge all \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to move this \nbipartisan bill forward by voting for cloture at 4:30.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of cloture on \nS. 2248, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act, or FISA \nAmendments Act. Time is running out on congressional action to fix \nFISA. The Protect America Act, which Congress passed in August to close \ngaps in our foreign intelligence collection, expires this Friday, \nFebruary 1, 2008.\n  Prior to congressional action in August, our intelligence community \nwas unable to collect vital foreign intelligence without the prior \napproval of a court. And I emphasize in that ``foreign'' intelligence. \nThis will be the case again if we do not make permanent these changes. \nBefore August, if our intelligence community wanted to direct \nsurveillance at an al-Qaida member located in Pakistan who was \ncommunicating with an operative terrorist in Germany, they would have \nto first petition the FISA Court for approval. In August of this year, \nour intelligence community told us that without updating FISA, they \nwere not just handicapped, but they were hamstrung.\n  The Protect America Act temporarily fixed the intelligence community \nlegal gaps. The Director of National Intelligence highlighted some of \nthe critical intelligence gained under the Protect America Act, \nincluding: insight and understanding leading to disruption of planned \nterrorist attacks; efforts of an individual to become a suicide \noperative; instructions to a foreign terrorist associate about entering \nthe United States; efforts by terrorists to obtain guns and ammunition; \nterrorist facilitator plans to travel to Europe; identifying \ninformation regarding foreign terrorist operatives; plans for future \nterrorist attacks; and movements of key extremists to abate a risk. \nWith the Protect America Act set to expire, Congress must act swiftly \nbefore our core collectors are faced with losing this kind of valuable \nintelligence as a result of inaction by Congress.\n  Although the Protect America Act enabled the intelligence community \nto continue its important work, Congress would be derelict in its \nduties to merely extend the expiration of this act.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee has been reviewing and drafting \nFISA legislation since April of last year. Last fall, the committee \nconsidered and passed the bill that is now before us. In December, the \nbill came to the Senate floor for consideration, but some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle delayed its consideration. We \nare now faced, after almost 10 months of thorough consideration, with \nthe ability to pass legislation which will improve our intelligence \ncollection and which contains safeguards for U.S. citizens' privacy \nrights that the Protect America Act does not contain.\n  The FISA Amendments Act contains a clear prohibition against \nintentionally targeting persons located inside the United States and a \nprohibition on reverse targeting of U.S. persons, which the Protect \nAmerica Act does not. The FISA Amendments Act makes clear that the FISA \nCourt approval is required for intentionally targeting U.S. persons \nabroad and requires that any collection be consistent with the fourth \namendment. Most important, the FISA Amendments Act contains \nretrospective immunity for our telecommunications carriers that may \nhave assisted the Government in protecting American lives.\n  Extending the Protect America Act does not ensure the continued and \nnecessary cooperation of those who may have assisted the Government \nwith the terrorist surveillance program after September 11.\n  The Government often needs assistance from the private sector in \norder to protect our national security. Telecommunications carriers may \nprovide the Government access to communication contents and records \npursuant to many Federal processes, including judicial warrants, \nsubpoenas, title III orders, FISA orders, attorney general \ncertifications, administrative subpoenas, national security letters, \nand other statutory authorizations. In return, they should be able to \nrely on the Government's assurances that the assistance they provide is \nlawful and necessary for our national security.\n  In Smith v. Nixon, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia suggested that the Government's request to wiretap a home \ntelephone was illegal. Yet they dismissed the telephone company from \nany liability because of the assurances they received from the \nGovernment, the reasonable expectation of legality, and their limited \ntechnical role in assisting the Government in surveillance initiated by \nthe Government.\n  As precedence suggests, America's telecommunications carriers should \nnot be subjected to costly legal battles and potentially frivolous \ncases, yet ones which could expose intelligence sources and methods, \nharming our national security, merely for their good-faith assistance \nto the Government. It is necessary and responsible for Congress to \nprovide telecommunications carriers with liability relief.\n  I urge my colleagues to support cloture on the Rockefeller-Bond \nsubstitute amendment and oppose a simple extension of the Protect \nAmerica Act. Senators Rockefeller and Bond have worked hard and long \nhours to make sure we got it right in this bill that came out of the \nIntelligence Committee. After many hours of negotiating, debate, and \nhard work, it would a shame to see this bill not come to fruition and \npass this body at this point in time. Our intelligence community needs \nthe tools and additional safeguards provided in the FISA Amendments Act \nto keep our people safe, and Congress needs to act quickly before the \nProtect America Act expires and these tools are taken away.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nIntelligence Committee's version of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Amendments Act of 2007. It is without question that I \nsupport giving the administration the surveillance tools it needs to \nkeep us safe. But Congress has both a duty to keep the American people \nsafe and uphold the Constitution.\n  It is therefore incumbent upon us in the Senate to craft clear \nlegislation that protects both our national security and our civil \nliberties. We can do that by passing the Judiciary Committee \nsubstitute, which gives the administration the tools it needs to \ncollect foreign intelligence and protects innocent Americans by \nensuring that the FISA Court, and not the Attorney General, decides \nwhether surveillance of a U.S. person is proper.\n\n[[Page S383]]\n\n  One of the defining challenges of our age is to combat international \nterrorism while maintaining our national values and our commitment to \nthe rule of law and individual rights. These two obligations are not \nmutually exclusive. Indeed, they reinforce one another. Unfortunately, \nthe President's national security policies have operated at the expense \nof our civil liberties. The examples are legion, but the issue that \nprompted the legislation before us today is one of the most notorious--\nhis secret program of eavesdropping on Americans without congressional \nauthorization or a judge's approval.\n  After insisting for a year that the President was not bound by the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act's clear prohibition on \nwarrantless surveillance of Americans, the administration subjected its \nsurveillance program to FISA Court review in January of last year.\n  Then, last August, citing operational difficulties and heightened \nthreats that required changes to FISA, the administration passed the \nProtect America Act--over my objection and that of many of my \ncolleagues. The Protect America Act, which sunsets at the end of this \nmonth, amended FISA to allow warrantless surveillance, even when that \nsurveillance intercepts the communications of innocent American \ncitizens inside the United States.\n  The administration identified two problems it faced in conducting \nelectronic surveillance under FISA. First, the administration wanted \nclarification that it did not need to obtain a FISA warrant in order to \nconduct surveillance of calls between two parties when both of those \nparties are overseas. Because of the way global communications are now \ntransmitted, many communications between people all of whom are \noverseas are nonetheless routed through switching stations inside the \nUnited States. In other words, when someone in Islamabad, Pakistan, \ncalls someone in London, that call is likely to be routed through \ncommunications switching stations right here in the United States. \nCongress did not intend FISA to apply to such calls, and I support a \nlegislative fix to clarify that point.\n  The second problem the administration identified is more difficult. \nEven assuming that the government does not need a FISA warrant to tap \ninto switching stations here in the United States in order to intercept \ncalls between two people who are abroad--between Pakistan and England, \nfor example--if the target in Pakistan calls someone inside the United \nStates, FISA requires the government to get a warrant, even though the \ngovernment is ``targeting'' the caller in Pakistan.\n  The administration wants the flexibility to begin electronic \nsurveillance of a ``target'' abroad without having to get a FISA \nwarrant to account for the possibility that the ``foreign target'' \nmight contact someone in the United States. I agree with the \nadministration's assessment of the problem, but I don't support its \nsolution.\n  The administration's proposal, which is reflected in the Intelligence \nCommittee's version of the FISA Amendments Act, would significantly \nexpand the scope of surveillance permitted under FISA by exempting \nentirely any calls to or from the United States, as long as the \ngovernment is ``targeting'' someone reasonably believed to be located \noutside the United States.\n  The government could acquire these communications regardless of \nwhether either party is suspected of any wrongdoing. The Attorney \nGeneral and the Director of National Intelligence would make the \ndetermination about whom to target on their own, and they would merely \ncertify, after-the-fact, to the FISA Court that they had reason to \nbelieve the target was outside the United States, regardless of how \nmany calls to innocent American citizens inside the United States were \nintercepted in the process.\n  This Intelligence Committee bill authorizes surveillance that is \nbroader than what is necessary to protect national security and that is \nwhy I oppose it.\n  The Intelligence Committee bill offers no protection for the innocent \nAmericans who communicate with overseas relatives, business partners, \nor friends. Indeed, it allows the government unfettered access to these \ninnocent Americans' communications. And once the government collects \nthese communications, it can share them with other agencies throughout \nthe government.\n  The Judiciary Committee substitute--which authorizes much broader \nsurveillance powers than the government had under FISA before the \nProtect America Act became law--offers several significant protections. \nI will mention a few: First, the Judiciary Substitute protects against \nthe ``bulk collection'' of communications by requiring the government \nto target a specific person or phone number abroad, rather than \nallowing the acquisition in bulk the millions of communications going \ninto and out of the United States. Second, it requires the government \nto obtain an individualized warrant from the FISA Court if the \ngovernment's acquisition of a person inside the United States becomes a \nsignificant purpose of its surveillance of the foreign target. Third, \nit provides for much more robust and meaningful congressional \noversight. And fourth, it does not provide retroactive immunity for the \ntelecommunications carriers.\n  I oppose granting retroactive immunity because if the carriers \nviolated clearly stated Federal law, they should be held accountable. \nCases against the carriers are already making their way through the \ncourts. Retroactive immunity would undermine the judiciary's role as an \nindependent branch of government. Furthermore, the provision that holds \ncarrier liable for violations of the act is an important enforcement \nmechanism. It is fundamental to securing the privacy rights that FISA \nwas meant to protect.\n  When the Senate passed FISA, after extensive hearings, 30 years ago \nby a strong bipartisan vote of 95 to 1, I stated that it ``was a \nreaffirmation of the principle that it is possible to protect national \nsecurity and at the same time the Bill of Rights.'' I still believe \nthat's possible, but not if we enact the Intelligence Committee bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nfor the quorum we will go into be equally divided between Senators Bond \nand Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, while we are waiting for Members of the \nother side to come forward, I will make a few remarks, and we will see \nif we have some others join us.\n  I was talking about some of the proposed amendments and questions \nthat have arisen about this bill. There are some who would demand that \na court order be obtained any time a call involved a U.S. citizen. But \nanybody who understands FISA or intelligence collection knows that is \noperationally impossible.\n  For 30 years, the intelligence community has used minimization \nprocedures when inadvertently intercepted calls come to or from \nnontargeted U.S. persons. So far, we are totally unaware of any abuses \nof this system. The minimization procedures have worked well. They \nworked well when information was being collected by radio, without a \nFISA Court order, and they continue to work well because the well-\ntrained people who run the NSA operations are overseen by multiple \nlayers of supervisors and inspectors general and attorneys from the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  There is no way to know, when a terror suspect places a call from a \nlocation in the Middle East, whether that\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\nperson is going to call someone in his country or a neighboring country \nor the United States. So if you say you cannot intercept that call if \nit goes to a U.S. person, what, in effect, you are saying is you cannot \nintercept that call because you don't know where the call is going. So \nit means there will have to be an order for every foreign terrorist \nsurveillance conducted by the NSA, and that is totally unworkable. We \nhave seen that before. That shut the system down. It is unsound policy \nto require a FISA Court order if a terrorist target abroad calls a U.S. \nperson. That may be the most important call to intercept in order to \nprotect us from a terrorist attack at any time, and time matters. Do we \nreally mean that the call cannot be intercepted until a court filing is \nprepared and reviewed by Government lawyers and that the FISA Court \nmust review the application and supporting amendments? I hope not. Our \nenemies are not stupid. They would figure out very quickly that they \ncan slow us down and bring our intelligence community to a halt simply \nby placing periodic calls to the United States.\n  Some believe that the FISA framework in place is enough to keep us \nsafe and that we don't need the Intelligence Committee bill. I find \nthat comment disturbing. It is the FISA framework that created \nsignificant intelligence gaps threatening the security of our Nation. \nIt is only because we passed the Protect America Act that those gaps \nwere closed.\n  I have already spoken about the problems with the Judiciary Committee \nbill. I wish to address some concerns and some ideas raised about the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the FISA Court.\n  I think our bill out of the Intelligence Committee strikes the \nappropriate balance between providing tools needed to collect \nintelligence and a meaningful oversight role for Congress and the FISA \nCourt.\n  There are a lot of misperceptions about the FISA Court. As mentioned \npreviously, for example, there are those who suggest the court should \nhave decided whether providers acted in good faith before immunity is \ngranted. We were told this makes sense because the court ``sits 24/7 \nand this is all they do. They would act en banc.'' That is not \naccurate. The FISA Court does not sit 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It \nis composed of U.S. judges from U.S. district courts throughout the \ncountry who have their own full caseloads and come to Washington, DC, \non a rotating basis simply, as the enabling legislation says, to issue \nFISA Court orders. As a result, it would be difficult to get them to \nsit together.\n  Given the court's facilities, it is not set up to preside over \nlitigation. We were told that this is why the FISA Court was set up, \nbut the legislative history and the measures----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that he is going \ninto the time reserved for the Republican leader.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I will then close and urge that our \ncolleagues adopt cloture so that we may move forward on this very \nimportant bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen and a half minutes, with 10 minutes \nreserved for the leader.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 9\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the legislation, \nSenator Rockefeller. Once again, I will say that I have great \nadmiration for the work done by the committee. It is not an easy \nmatter. The Intelligence Committee has serious work to do. Much of what \nthey have done, I agree with. My objections here this afternoon are \nfocused on one aspect of the legislation rather than the cumulative \neffort the committee has made.\n  Let me address the issue we will be voting on, and that is cloture. \nThat is a critical issue for all of us.\n  Aside from the question of whether I agree or disagree with various \namendments, or even the bill, we find ourselves in the midst of a \nparliamentary nightmare. We have been in this position since late last \nyear, going back to December.\n  So much hinges on this bill. It will set America's terrorist \nsurveillance policy well into the next Presidential term and beyond if \na period of 6 years is adopted or even the 4 years suggested by Senator \nCardin and others. Depending on the outcome of the debate, this \nlegislation has the power to bring that surveillance under the rule of \nlaw or to confirm the President's urge to be a law of his own. It has \nthe power to bring the facts of warrantless spying to light and to \npublic scrutiny, or to lock down those facts as the property of only \nthe powerful.\n\n  It has the power, obviously, to declare the same law applies to all \nof us regardless of economic circumstances, well connected or not, or \nto set the precedent that some corporations are far too rich, far too \naffluent to be sued, that immunity can effectively not be brought \nagainst them.\n  Wherever you come down on these choices--and I know there are those \nof us who have different opinions--you certainly cannot be neutral, in \nmy view. None of us can be neutral on a matter such as this. This is \none of the most important and contentious pieces of legislation we will \ndebate in this session, and I argue any session of Congress, and yet \nthe Senate is frozen today.\n  I objected passionately to retroactive immunity, but I did not shut \nout debate. Republicans have frozen this body since debate began, not \nonly last week but going back further, and they unwittingly created a \nperfect microcosm of retroactive immunity right here in this body. \nBecause both flow from the same impulse: shutting down the organs of \nGovernment--in this case, the legislation, the courts, and now, because \nof the procedural nightmare we find ourselves in, the Senate--when you \nare afraid, of course, you will not get your way. That is why President \nBush wants his favored corporations saved from lawsuits, it appears. \nThat is why the minority party wants this bill saved from any and all \namendments, saved from serious and thoughtful discussion.\n  As a committee chairman myself, as I pointed out the other day, I \nwish I had the privilege being requested by the minority. I sometimes \nwished the bills we passed out of committee would have swept out of \nthis body when I came to the Senate floor without a single amendment. \nThat is not how this body works. It was never intended to work that \nway. It is certainly not the way the Founders intended it to work.\n  Amendments are not entitled to pass, but they are entitled to a fair \nhearing, a fair debate, and a fair vote. The minority can object as \nstrenuously as it wants, but it must do so fairly. I accept that \nprinciple, even when it does not go my way; even on immunity itself, I \nunderstand a minority cannot stand forever. Is it too much for \nRepublicans to extend the same courtesy?\n  On a bill as important as this one, it would be ridiculous to curtail \ndebate, shut out new ideas, or rush to a conclusion without even \nextending the Protect America Act for a month to give us the time we \nneed. Whether you agree with them or not--and some I disagree with \nmyself--the amendments offered by my Democratic colleagues are serious \nproposals and deserving of serious consideration.\n  Shouldn't we debate whether this new surveillance regime ought to \nstay inflexible through the next Presidential term and into the one \nafter that?\n  Shouldn't we debate whether we are going to categorically outlaw \nunconstitutional reverse targeting or indiscriminate vacuum cleaner \nbulk collection?\n  Shouldn't we debate whether Congress even gets to see the secret \nrulings of the FISA Court?\n  Those are some of a few of the well-intentioned proposals we need to \nconsider before we vote on this bill. But across the board, the \nRepublican answer to those questions is absolutely not, in every single \ninstance: No debate, no votes. I disagree, and I will vote against \ncloture because we haven't done our job yet.\n  I will also vote against cloture because I cannot support the bill as \nit now stands, as my colleagues know. First, the legislation still \ncontains some egregious provisions for corporate immunity. I already \nmade my objection to immunity many times\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\nover the last number of days. It puts the President's chosen few above \nthe law, in my view; it endorses possibly illegal spying on Americans; \nand it strikes a harsh blow against the rule of law. I will continue to \nfight retroactive immunity with all the strength any one Senator can \nmuster.\n  But I also strongly object to many of the intelligence-gathering \nportions of the bill, as well as supporting many of them that have been \nincluded. This bill reduces court oversight of spying nearly to the \npoint of symbolism. It would allow the targeting of Americans on false \npretenses. It opens up new twisted rationales for warrantless \nwiretapping, which is exactly what it ought to prevent. It could allow \nbulk collection of communications of millions of Americans as soon as \nan administration, whether this one or future one, has the wherewithal \nto build such an enormous dragnet, and it sets all of these deeply \nflawed provisions in stone for 6 years, depriving us of the flexibility \nwe need to fight terrorism.\n  For all of those reasons, as well, I will vote against cloture later \nthis afternoon.\n  Tonight, the President will come to Congress to speak to us and to \nthe American people about the state of our Union. I hope he will use \nthat opportunity to realize the Senate needs more time to do its \nconstitutional duty to debate and consider this important legislation. \nHowever, I am concerned that he will instead continue to threaten to \nveto this legislation unless it includes retroactive immunity for the \ntelecommunications industry.\n  The President has said this bill is essential to ``protecting the \nAmerican people from enemies who attacked our country.'' That is a \nquotation. So why is he trying to stop it? Why is he promising to veto \nit? Why is he throwing it all away to protect a few corporations from \nlawsuits?\n  I fear that if we give this President what he wants, we risk \nweakening the rule of law and placing the rights of some of the \nPresident's favored corporations over the rights of ordinary American \ncitizens.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with those of us who oppose cloture \ntoday on the substitute amendment to allow the Senate the time it needs \nto debate and improve the FISA Amendments Act. This issue is far too \nimportant for the security of our Nation and to our civil liberties to \ndo otherwise.\n  As we all know, as I have stated over and over, this is historic \ntension that dates back to the founding of our Republic, of keeping us \nsafe from those who would do us harm, and protecting the rights and \nliberties of American citizens. It has been a tension that has been \ndebated and argued for more than 200 years, and the adoption of the \nFISA legislation three decades ago created the means by which that \nbalance could be struck, allowing us to do what is necessary to protect \nus against those who would do us harm while simultaneously guaranteeing \nthose rights and liberties we enjoy as Americans would be protected in \nthese circumstances.\n\n  It is a critical point to maintain that balance. My fear is this \nlegislation, particularly with retroactive immunity, upsets that \nbalance significantly.\n  As I said before, and I will repeat in closing, had this been a few \nmonths, even a year in the wake of 9/11, had this administration had a \nrecord of by and large supporting the rule of law, I would not stand \nhere and demand that we not include retroactive immunity under those \ncircumstances. But there has been a pattern of behavior by this \nadministration from the very outset. We now know these warrantless \nwiretaps began in January or February of 2001, not in the wake of 9/11. \nSo even prior to the tragic events of September 11, 2001, this \nadministration had begun a pattern of seeking warrantless wiretaps on \naverage American citizens without the court orders provided for under \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Of course, it went on for 5 \nyears and would still be ongoing were it not for a whistleblower in a \nreport in a major American newspaper uncovering this program.\n  This went on for 5 long years amidst a pattern of behavior by this \nadministration. I do not think I need to necessarily enumerate the \nexamples of that pattern, beginning with Abu Ghraib, secret prisons and \nrendition, habeas corpus, the U.S. Attorney's Office, and the list goes \non and on. I cannot undo those mistakes, but they are more than just \nmistakes. They are tragic examples of this administration's trampling \nall over the rule of law. What we can do this evening and what we can \ndo in the coming days, collectively, Democrats and Republicans, is pass \na FISA bill, much of which is included in the work of Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Bond. There will be some objections, obviously, \nto some amendments that will be offered, but to get our work done, pass \nthis legislation, and move on to other business. The issues are far too \nimportant to leave them otherwise.\n  I thank, again, Senator Rockefeller for giving me some time and urge \nour colleagues to vote against the cloture motion when that moment \noccurs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are now only a few days away from \nthe expiration of the Protect America Act, days away from a situation \nin which the intelligence community will be unable to freely monitor \nnew terrorist targets overseas. We are flirting with disaster, and the \nAmerican people deserve to know how we got in this predicament. So let \nme review it.\n  Ten months ago, the Director of National Intelligence asked us to \nreform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Our friends on the \nother side waited until July to take up a bill that agreed with his \nrecommendations. It was not until August that Congress finally answered \nhis pleas by authorizing for 6 months the overseas surveillance of \nforeign terrorist targets with the Protect America Act.\n  When our friends on the other side got back from the August break, \nthey vowed to quickly address what they decried as the shortcomings of \nthe Protect America Act.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee, under the leadership of Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Bond, took up the task. Reforming FISA was \ncomplicated and demanding work, but the committee members came \ntogether, as they were intended to, along with the executive branch, \nwhich, of course, was necessary.\n  Everyone involved acted with determination, deliberation, and \nconsiderable skill. The process lasted 4 months. It involved numerous \nhearings, briefings, and negotiation sessions. The final product was a \nmodel of bipartisanship and accommodation across the Senate aisle and \nwith the White House. The committee vote was not 15 to 0, but around \nhere 13 to 2 is almost as impressive.\n  But what was perhaps even more impressive is the fact that such a \nbroad coalition of players had come together to meet the minimum \nstandards required of any legislation that replaces the Protect America \nAct, something that allows the intelligence community to operate \nwithout unreasonable and counterproductive restrictions, which protect \nphone carriers from frivolous lawsuits for helping the Government hunt \nfor terrorists, and which is guaranteed to be signed into law. All of \nthose things are contained in the Bond-Rockefeller, Rockefeller-Bond \nproposal.\n  Unfortunately, it was not until just before the Christmas break that \nour friends decided to even turn back to this vital issue, and even \nthen we had to listen to a filibuster against FISA reform. Then when we \nbegan this session, our Democratic colleagues delayed consideration of \nFISA reform again by moving to the Indian health care bill instead.\n  So here we are, once again, pushed up against a looming deadline. \nDuring last week's consideration of the FISA reauthorization, the \nmajority said it would not consider a 60-vote threshold for votes. It \ndid not offer time agreements, nor did it make any effort to limit the \nnumber of amendments.\n\n  In short, the Senate faces a legislative logjam that ensures that we \nwill\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\nlet the February 1 deadline come and go without making a reasonable \neffort to enact a law.\n  It should not have turned out this way. The administration negotiated \nin good faith with the Democratic majority on the committee that has \nthe technical, operational expertise to handle the subject. And in the \ncourse of painstaking negotiations, the administration made tough \nconcessions to our Democratic colleagues. It did this in order to \narrive at a fair, bipartisan result that would allow it to continue to \nprotect the homeland. Now that work is being brushed aside.\n  The menu of amendments to the Intelligence Committee bill is little \nmore than an effort to renegotiate this hard-won deal, an effort to \ndeconstruct the bipartisan Intelligence Committee bill, and \nreconstruct, amendment by amendment, the divisive Judiciary Committee \nbill that was tabled by a strong bipartisan majority. That bill will \nnot--I repeat, will not--become law.\n  Reconstructing the Judiciary Committee bill is a pointless exercise. \nAnd with only 5 days until the Protect America Act expires, it is an \nexercise in which we do not have the luxury to engage.\n  We can get serious and pass the bipartisan Intelligence Committee \nproduct or we can waste time on voting for poison pill amendments that \nweaken the bill and that will prevent it from becoming law.\n  I urge our colleagues to make the right choice, to vote for cloture \nso that we can continue to protect the homeland and against cloture on \nthe 30-day extension. We cannot delay this important legislation for \nanother month. Of course, the President will not sign a 30-day \nextension.\n  That said, if we cannot complete this bill, Republicans will not \nallow this critical program to expire and will offer a short-term \nextension, if necessary.\n  To be perfectly clear, I urge that there be a ``yes'' vote on cloture \non the bill, a ``no'' vote on cloture on the 30-day extension, an \namendment to the bill which actually would not achieve a 30-day \nextension anyway but I think is a place that we do not want to go on \nrecord as having supported because the President will not sign that \nanyway. And in the next few days, we will consider what kind of short-\nterm options might be appropriate to let us get back to this very \nimportant legislation so painstakingly put together by the expert \nleadership of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand I ask that the time involved be divided between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to my friends for keeping \neveryone waiting. It hasn't been long--a matter of a minute or so.\n  In a few hours, President Bush will stand across the way in the House \nChamber and deliver his final State of the Union Address. This will be \nhis eighth State of the Union Address. From what I have heard earlier \ntoday in my meetings with the press who met with him, it is a fair bet \nin this speech that he will continue the drumbeat started by Vice \nPresident Cheney last week by trying to scare the American people into \nbelieving that if he does not get his way on the FISA bill now before \nus, America's national security will be gravely jeopardized.\n  I have said on more than one occasion in recent days we face a \nfaltering economy here at home and a failing foreign policy abroad. So \nI call upon all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to rise above \npartisanship. I have also said on more than one occasion that we extend \nour hand to the President and congressional Republicans and ask them to \njoin with us in a genuine spirit of bipartisanship. In my nearly 26 \nyears, I have never seen anything quite as cynical and \ncounterproductive as the Republican approach to FISA.\n  I gave the example in my last statement that it was a Catch-22 the \nPresident has put us in. The American people deserve to know when \nPresident Bush talks about the foreign intelligence legislation tonight \nthat he is doing little more than shooting for cheap political points, \nand we should reject any statements he makes about this. Members of \nCongress from both parties have legitimate policy disagreements on \nFISA--both parties. Some of us believe that history proves the need for \nmore protections against Government abuse. Others support the law the \nway it stands. Now, that is appropriate; people have different views \nand opinions on an important part of our legislation and our laws in \nthe country. But all of us, Members of Congress, Democrats and \nRepublicans, want to wage an effective fight against terror. All of us, \nDemocrats and Republicans, want to give our intelligence professionals \nthe tools they need to win this fight against terror.\n  We will be taking two votes. The first is on whether to invoke \ncloture on the Bond-Rockefeller substitute to the FISA bill we have on \nthe floor. The second is a substitute, on whether to extend the \nauthorities of the Protect America Act for another 30 days while \nCongress works to pass a new FISA bill.\n  I will oppose cloture on the substitute and support cloture on the \nextension. The extension will give the Congress time to debate and pass \na long-term bill that protects America without compromising the privacy \nof law-abiding Americans. Both the Intelligence Committee bill and the \nJudiciary Committee bill authorize the same surveillance tools our \nintelligence community needs. Democrats and Republicans stand together \nin all the terrorism fighting components of this bill. Some Democrats, \nincluding me, support the additional privacy protections in the \nJudiciary Committee bill. Others are satisfied with the protections in \nthe Intelligence Committee bill.\n  Again, people are entitled to their opinions, but all of us believe \nthe Senate should have an opportunity to vote on these important \nquestions.\n  There was a nice piece written in one of the op-eds today talking \nabout how the Republicans have talked a long time about all we want is \nan up-or-down vote. Well, if there were ever a time they should follow \ntheir own advice it is now--an up-or-down vote.\n  Many Democrats, including Chairman Rockefeller, who has worked so \nhard, are going to oppose cloture on the substitute because they \nobject--we object--to the heavy-handed tactics we saw with this \nlegislation this past week. The Republican leader filed cloture on this \nbill after we had been on the floor for a few hours. Cloture was filed \nafter Republicans blocked every amendment--every amendment--from being \noffered and blocked all amendments from getting votes. In simple terms, \nthis means the Republicans were filibustering their own bill--their own \nlegislation. Let me repeat that. The Republicans were filibustering \ntheir own legislation. In my time in the Senate, I can't remember this \ntaking place.\n  Meanwhile, at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, President Bush \nhas actually threatened to veto a temporary extension. Talk about \ntrying to figure out what is in the mind of someone who is talking that \nway. Let us remember, a temporary extension would guarantee that all \nthe terrorism fighting tools remain in effect. There is absolutely no \npolicy or security problem with an extension. All it would do is give \nus more time to work this out on an uninterrupted basis. There is no \nreason to vote against an extension or for the President to veto one, \nexcept for political posturing.\n  None of us want the current law to expire. None of us want that to \nexpire, except Cheney and Bush. But if it does expire because of \nRepublican tactics, surveillance will not end. Even if they stop us \nfrom extending the bill, it would not end. Surveillance would not end. \nAll surveillance orders issued under the law we passed last August--the \nProtect America Act--are effective for a year, so they will continue \nuntil at least August of 2008--August of this year.\n  Even in a last resort--if the current law expires--our intelligence \nprofessionals can get surveillance orders under the FISA law as it has \nexisted\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\nfor decades, before we passed the Protect America Act last August. FISA \nincludes provisions for emergency warrantless surveillance, and it \nalways has. Again, no one is arguing the law should be allowed to \nexpire. Doing so would send the wrong message. But it still is going to \nallow the collection of this information. The safeguards in place \nensure that our war on terror will not be adversely affected, and \nanyone who says otherwise--from the President on down--is not being \ntruthful.\n  Why do Democrats seek an extension? We believe bipartisanship is \nappropriate when possible. The economic stimulus package shows us that \nwhen circumstances are difficult, we can work together. The Republican \nleadership's actions in this FISA debate have not given us reason for \nconfidence that they are interested in working with us, but we owe it \nto the American people to give them every opportunity to do so.\n  We have requested a 30-day extension repeatedly--I have done it \nrepeatedly--and each time the Republicans have said no. Compromise is a \ntwo-way street. Bipartisanship is a two-way street. As I said last \nweek, we are willing to pass an extension of current law for 2 weeks, \n30 days, 18 months, 14 months, 15 months or whatever our colleagues \nwant, but we need to pass an extension now if we are to ensure the law \ndoesn't expire. I have explained if it expires what happens.\n\n  The House is going out of session shortly. They have a retreat this \nweek--after tomorrow. Already Democrats have introduced several \namendments to strengthen the bill. Senator Feingold sought a vote on \nhis amendment to provide FISA Court documents to the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. Republicans blocked that. Senator Whitehouse \nsought to offer an amendment to give the FISA Court authority to review \ncompliance with minimization rules to protect the privacy of Americans \nwhose communications are inadvertently intercepted. We were blocked \nfrom having that vote. Senator Cardin sought to offer an amendment to \nsunset the legislation in 4 years rather than 6 years. Even that was \nblocked from having a vote. Senator Kennedy offered an amendment--or I \nshould say tried to offer one--providing for a report by the inspectors \ngeneral of the relevant agencies to review the conduct of these \nprograms in the past. No vote on that either. Senator Feinstein sought \nto offer an amendment making crystal clear that FISA is the exclusive \nmeans by which the executive branch may conduct surveillance. Blocked \nby the Republicans.\n  Whether these amendments pass or not, we should be allowed to have \nvotes on them. Senator Feingold wasn't saying he wanted to talk for 2 \nhours. Senator Feinstein wasn't saying she wanted to talk a long time. \nNo one was--a short debate and have a vote on them. We were prevented \nfrom doing that.\n  So what does the Senate do? We take up bills all the time reported to \nus by committees. This is a little more complicated because we had two \ncommittees. It is not often we have concurrent jurisdiction, but there \nwas here. But an eighth grade student could figure out what it is all \nabout. It is not that difficult. Senators offer amendments to these \nbills and we let the Senate work its will. I don't understand how the \nRepublicans can expect to block us from voting on any amendments and \nexpect us to follow along. Senators are entitled to vote on their \namendments.\n  Now, if someone is stalling--and we all went through that--there \ncomes a time when you shut off the debate. But there is none of that \nhere. With the Republicans blocking the amendments I have talked about, \nwe haven't gotten to the crucial issue of immunity.\n  Mr. President, I will use my leader time now.\n  Let us not forget: The question of retroactive immunity wouldn't be \nbefore us if President Bush hadn't ignored Congress and established his \nown process outside the law. But far from taking responsibility for his \nactions, the President bullies and threatens the Congress he is \nsupposed to be working with. He is similar to the kid in the school \nyard, the bully who says: OK, you are not doing what I want to do, so I \nam taking my ball home and none of us will be able to play.\n  When the President talks tonight about how important this program is \nand how it must continue, I say to him now that he must consider and \nreconsider his political posturing and ask his colleagues in the Senate \nto support an extension, especially when he is going to come and say \nhow much he wants to work on a bipartisan basis.\n  We are a deliberative body. It was set up that way by the Founding \nFathers. Let us deliberate. I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on \nthe substitute so the Senate can return to considering this bill. We \nmust pass a bill that gives our intelligence authorities the tools they \nneed while protecting the privacy of all Americans. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the extension so we can ensure current authority \ndoesn't expire while Congress works to pass a new and stronger FISA \nbill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to explain \nthe next vote. The President indicated over the weekend that he would \nveto a 30-day extension. We have been dealing with this issue for \nalmost a year. We have in the Rockefeller-Bond proposal a bipartisan \ncompromise that came out of Intelligence 13 to 2. There is no need for \na 30-day extension. But even if there were, you wouldn't get a 30-day \nextension by adding it to this bill. It is extremely important to \noppose the 30-day extension. We know it won't become law on this bill. \nIt wouldn't become law if it were passed freestanding, because the \nPresident would veto it. We may be talking about a very short-term \nextension here in the next few days, but we are still on FISA after \ntoday. We will not get off FISA until we make some determination of how \nwe are going to dispose of this important measure.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote against cloture on the 30-day \nextension amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we all acknowledge the Intelligence \nCommittee did a good job on this piece of legislation. But the \nIntelligence Committee knew, everyone knew, there was concurrent \nreferral of this legislation. It was always anticipated and believed, \nrightfully so, that the Judiciary Committee would take up this matter. \nAnd they did. They made some suggestions in the way of changes. We are \nentitled to vote on those. That is all we are asking. That isn't too \nunreasonable. For the President to not agree to any extension is \nunreasonable. The House is going to pass a 30-day extension in the \nmorning. They are going to pass that. We are going to have the \nopportunity to vote on a 30-day extension. This would send an \nappropriate message to everyone that a 30-day extension is fair and \nreasonable. As I said in my remarks before the last vote, people are \ncrying wolf a little too often. This legislation we have before us, if \nit doesn't pass, the work done by the Intelligence Committee and the \nJudiciary Committee will go for naught. But still, under the \nlegislation we passed previously, the legislation will still be in \neffect. FISA is not gone. We all want to work to improve this. That is \nwhat this is all about. But we need some votes to do that. That is what \nwe are asking.\n  Everyone here should understand, if you are voting today not to \nextend this legislation for 30 days, you are going to have to vote on \nit in the near future because the House is sending us the exact same \nmeasure tomorrow.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier. SGT Jon \nMichael Schoolcraft, III, 26 years old, died January 19 in Taji, Iraq. \nSergeant Schoolcraft died of injuries he sustained when an improvised \nexplosive device detonated near his vehicle. With an optimistic future \nbefore him, Jon risked everything to fight for the values Americans \nhold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Jon Schoolcraft, called Mike by his friends, graduated from \nWapakoneta High School in Ohio in 2001. Growing up in Ohio with his \nmother, Cindy Schoolcraft-Hooker, Mike also spent time in Madison, IN, \nvisiting his father, Mike Schoolcraft, Jr. Mike excelled at sports and \nparticularly enjoyed skateboarding. His sense of duty to his country \nand a desire to see the world drove him to enroll in the Army's Delayed \nEntry Program while in high school.\n  After serving a first tour in Iraq, Mike reenlisted, telling a friend \nthat he could not imagine doing anything other than being a soldier. In \nNovember of last year, Mike married his wife Amber and decided that his \nnext tour in Iraq would be his last so they could begin a family. Mike \nwas assigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th \nInfantry Division in Schofield Barracks, HI. For his extraordinary \nservice, Mike was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart.\n  Today, I join Mike's family and friends in mourning his death. While\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Mike. Today and always, Mike will be \nremembered by family members, friends and fellow soldiers as a true \nAmerican hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Mike's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Mike's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of SGT Jon Michael Schoolcraft, \nIII, in the Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country \nand for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Mike's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Mike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/28/senate-section/article/S389-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SMALL BUSINESS STIMULUS ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, over the past few months, our country has \nexperienced instability and volatility in its credit markets. This \nlooming credit crisis is affecting virtually every sector of the \neconomy, including small business financing.\n  Since its inception in 1953, the Small Business Administration's 7(a) \nloan guaranty program has become the largest single source of long-term \ncapital for small businesses. However, in the wake of the credit crunch \nand a slowing U.S. economy, we are now noticing that this essential \nfinancing resource is not serving nearly as many small businesses as it \nshould. For example, during the first quarter of the 2008 fiscal year, \n7(a) lending was down by 12 percent compared with the same period last \nyear. In addition, at his State of the Agency Address this past \nTuesday, SBA Administrator Steven Preston acknowledged that SBA lending \nwas down in its largest program.\n  The Small Business Stimulus Act of 2008 will help reverse this \ndownward trend in small business lending. The bill will temporarily \nreduce the fees collected from borrowers and lenders. This will \nimmediately reduce the cost of capital for small businesses. With lower \nmonthly loan payments, more money will be placed into the hands of \nsmall business owners money that will be quickly injected into the \neconomy through purchases of inventory, real estate, and equipment. The \nfee reduction for lenders, coupled with the government guarantee, will \ngive them an incentive to make 7(a) loans, as banks are scrambling for \nways to salvage declining revenues and take on less risky loans. A \nsimilar stimulus was adopted after 9/11, and lending increased to \nbusinesses nationwide, pumping almost $3 billion into local economies \nand creating or retaining more than 90,000 jobs.\n  The bill also provides additional funding for the SBA's microloan \nprogram. As its name implies, microloans are small-scale business \nloans, which provide an essential financing source to underserved \nmembers of the business population, including women and minorities. \nThis bill provides $12 million to expand the SBA's microloan program, \nincluding $2 million that will help leverage nearly $20 million in \nmicroloans.\n  The Small Business Stimulus Act of 2008 also includes two business \ntax incentives that will help small businesses that are feeling the \nimpact of the economic downturn. The first provision would increase the \namount that businesses can expense from $125,000 to $200,000 for 2008. \nThis will help businesses immediately write off business purchases. The \nsecond provision increases the net operating carry back period for \nlosses arising in taxable years ending in 2007 and 2008 from 2 years to \n5 years. This provision will help business with cash flow. Expanding \nthe carry back allows business owners to balance out net losses over \nyears when the business has had a net operating gain.\n  I am confident that each of these targeted measures will provide \ntimely, effective incentives to spur spending and encourage new \ninvestment and job growth in the hundreds of thousands of small \nbusinesses that drive this Nation's economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/28/senate-section/article/S389-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING THE UKRAINIAN FAMINE\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I wish to remember the trials faced by \nthe Ukrainian people and to pay tribute to their fortitude and love of \nfreedom. At times in its history, Ukraine has been exploited and \nsuffered greatly under repressive occupations. The Stalinist regime of \nthe former Soviet Union sought to maintain control of the people and \nresources of the Ukraine through vicious oppression. The Ukrainian \npeople have weathered many trials, but they have always fought for \ntheir freedom. It is my belief that as we embrace Ukraine's future, we \nmust always remember the hardships of its past.\n  The Ukrainian peasantry rebelled against the collectivization \npolicies imposed on them by the Stalinist regime starting in 1925. It \nis documented that very few farmers voluntarily joined collectives \nuntil Soviet secret police and Bolshevik brigades were sent to crush \nthe resistance. As agricultural production fell in 1932 due to drought \nand these Stalinist policies, the regime attempted to maintain its \nexport level. To do this the regime brutally confiscated grain and \nfoodstuffs from hunger-stricken villages. Trade and supplies of food \nand goods were banned from those villages which were considered to be \n``underperforming,'' while families who resisted were banished to \ncentral Asia. The totalitarian regime meted out harsh sentences, even \nthe death penalty, against those who stole even small amounts of grain. \nWe can never forget that over 2,000 innocent people, including children \nas young as 12 years old, were executed under this law.\n  In 1932, Stalin imposed barricades throughout the USSR to prevent \npeasants from fleeing those regions stricken by famine. It was a state-\norganized program of mass starvation against the nation of Ukraine as a \nwhole and the revived Ukrainian nationalism. It had been inflicted on \nthem deliberately to punish Ukraine and destroy the basis of its \nnationhood. The famine-genocide of the Holodomor resulted in the tragic \nand unforgettable loss of millions of Ukrainian lives. Nevertheless, \nthe Stalinist regime denied reports of mass deaths and forbade travel \nto the area to deter foreign journalists from reporting on these \nterrible crimes. In fact, these horrible crimes remained largely \nunknown to the broader world for decades as a result of the denials and \ncoverups of the Soviet authorities and their refusal of offers of \ninternational aid.\n  Through its determination to remember the victims of the famine and \nSoviet oppression, the Ukrainian American community has helped to bring \nthese events to light. Their efforts have helped to give a voice to the \nmillions of people who suffered, starved, and died as a result of a \nflawed policy and authoritarian regime.\n  On the 75th anniversary of the Ukrainian famine-genocide, we must \ncontinue the important work of the Ukrainian American community by \nremembering the cruel injustices suffered by the Ukrainian people \nduring that part of history. By so doing, we are not only honoring the \nmillions of victims of this oppression, but we are helping to prevent a \ntragedy like this from happening again in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/28/senate-section/article/S389-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S389-S390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CURRENT ELECTORAL CRISIS IN KENYA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, just over 1 month ago, in the days \nbefore the December 27 president election, I\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\nnoted that it had become the closest political contest in that \ncountry's history and that the two leading candidates were running \nrobust, active campaigns. Although I also acknowledged the persistence \nof a deeply entrenched culture of corruption, I was encouraged by the \ngrowing engagement of Kenyan citizens and civil society organizations \nduring the relatively peaceful, well-run, and competitive campaign \nseason. I joined many others in hoping that the presidential and \nparliamentary elections held on that day would confirm Kenya's place \namong the world's most promising emerging economies and young \ndemocracies. Instead, that hope turned to dismay as we watched a \nblatant disregard for democratic principles and processes by the ruling \nparty and an extraordinary disrespect for rule of law and human rights \nby both leading candidates' parties. The serious allegations of vote \nrigging, the rushed declaration of a presidential winner, and the \ndestructive violence that have ensued are not only hurting the Kenyan \npeople--they are jeopardizing Kenya's previous democratic progress.\n  With Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Uganda as neighbors in the \nvolatile Horn of Africa, Kenya has long been regarded as a stable \ncountry making slow but persistent progress towards democracy. Kenya's \npress and courts seemed to be asserting their independence from the \npresident-dominated government, and the mere fact that all pre-election \nopinion polls put the incumbent president neck-and-neck with his \nchallenger from the main opposition party seemed to be an encouraging \nsign of a vibrant democracy. But on December 27 and in the days that \nfollowed, this progress came to a grinding halt. The Kenyan election \nsuffered a fate all too common in Africa, with the votes tallied behind \nclosed doors and the results finally announced by Kenya's Electoral \nCommission suggesting significant rigging.\n  The resulting frustration and deadlock have sparked violence, \nlooting, destruction of property, and disruption of normal activity, \ncreating an economic and humanitarian emergency on top of the current \npolitical crisis. Hundreds have been killed--some of them because of \ndisproportionate use of force by Kenyan police as they seek to quell \nprotests--and tens of thousands have fled their homes. Trust in the \ngovernment, law enforcement, and even in one's neighbor has been \nseriously undermined.\n  The rival political leaders--incumbent President Mwai Kibaki and \nleader of the Orange Democratic Movement opposition party, Raila \nOdinga--can work to end this violence and destruction by refraining \nfrom using, inciting or condoning violent tactics. In recent days, Mr. \nOdinga and his supporters have demonstrated noteworthy restraint and it \nis essential that both parties respect the importance of a peaceful \nresolution as they begin to participate in an internationally brokered \ndialogue, led by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.\n  It is early days yet, and it remains unclear how committed these \nleading candidates are to seeing the negotiation through to the finish \nline. Although he has agreed to participate in an internationally \nbrokered meeting with Mr. Odinga, Mr. Kibaki has been less than \ncooperative by rushing to appoint his own cronies to top cabinet \npositions and declaring he will follow the recommendations only of the \nKenyan courts, which are also packed with his supporters. A political \nsettlement is a key element in working through this electoral crisis \nbut it must be part of a greater initiative that includes institutional \nreform. The road ahead is long, and I remain concerned that while both \nleading candidates have come to the table for negotiations, they could \nstill decide to abandon the effort.\n  The past few weeks have shown how superficial Kenya's democratic \ngains may really have been. Now the international community--and the \nUnited States in particular--must live up to its rhetoric in favor of \nfree and fair elections and institutional building. Many of the other \ncountries that have suffered botched elections had a long history of \nsuch fraud but if this relatively stable and prosperous country is \nallowed to abandon its democratic experiment, the appeal of democracy \nwill inevitably dim around the world. The citizens of Kenya as well as \nthose from around the world had higher expectations for Kenya.\n  Resolving Kenya's current political, humanitarian, and economic \ncrisis will require a coordinated international effort to engage all \nplayers in identifying and addressing the deeper problems that allowed \nthe election fraud to occur and to ignite such a wave of outrage. \nAlthough a power-sharing agreement will likely be part of the solution, \nserious underlying problems need to be addressed. The challenges facing \nKenya include an over-concentration of power in the office of the \npresident, insufficient independence of the judiciary and electoral \ninstitutions, the need for professionalization of police and armed \nforces, and a persistent lack of transparency and inclusiveness \nthroughout the political system. Only by addressing these root causes \nof the recent conflict will Kenya be able to truly restore stability \nand emerge from this crisis a stronger and more prosperous nation. Such \na task will not be quick, easy, or cheap, but the alternative--not \nseizing this chance to bring about essential political reform--would be \nenduring, complex, and costly.\n  Last week, along with my ranking member on the Senate Subcommittee on \nAfrican Affairs, Senator Sununu, and Senators Cardin and Kerry, I \nintroduced a resolution to encourage the United States and the wider \ninternational community to resist the temptation for a quick fix in \nKenya and to instead pursue a more intensive, encompassing plan for \npolitical transition and transformation. I hope the Senate will pass \nthis resolution shortly. The administration has played an active role--\nsending Assistant Secretary Frazer to Nairobi shortly after the \nelections to meet with both leading candidates--and I know Ambassador \nRanneberger has been actively engaged in-country. But we need to see \ngreater collaboration from all donors--with one consistent message that \nhelps move Kenya to the next stage. I hope that Members of Congress \nfrom both parties will come together to support this initiative and the \ndiplomatic and humanitarian efforts in Kenya that must follow in the \ncoming weeks and months.\n  The U.S.-Kenya partnership is a longstanding and important one, but I \ncan-not condone a continued relationship with a government that has \napparently stolen an election and uses tactics of fear and intimidation \nto address dissent. This is not the Kenya I have come to know, and I am \nsure, not the Kenya its citizens want to know. We must close this \ndevastating chapter by addressing the reasons for the electoral crisis \nand ensuing violence. Without such vital work, our historic partnership \nwill deteriorate. There is a window of opportunity to ensure this does \nnot happen, and I encourage all key actors to seize upon this opening. \nAbove all, I want to see violence end and hope restored in Kenya.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/28/senate-section/article/S390-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

In that time, our country has been tested\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\nin ways none of us could have imagined. We have faced hard decisions \nabout peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the \nhealth and welfare of our citizens. These issues call for vigorous \ndebate, and I think it's fair to say we've answered that call. Yet \nhistory will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose. \nAnd together, we showed the world the power and resilience of American \nself-government.\n  All of us were sent to Washington to carry out the people's business. \nThat is the purpose of this body. It is the meaning of our oath. And it \nremains our charge to keep.\n  The actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and \nprosperity of our Nation long after this session has ended. In this \nelection year, let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our \nresponsibilities and are determined to meet them. And let us show them \nthat Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for \nresults at the same time.\n  From expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we have made \ngood progress. Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the \nAmerican people expect us to get it done.\n  In the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our \nNation great. As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to \ndetermine their destiny and shape the course of history. We believe \nthat the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom \nof ordinary citizens. So in all we do, we must trust in the ability of \nfree people to make wise decisions, and empower them to improve their \nlives and their futures.\n  To build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own \nmoney and empower them to grow our economy. As we meet tonight, our \neconomy is undergoing a period of uncertainty. America has added jobs \nfor a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower \npace. Wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas. Exports are \nrising, but the housing market has declined. And at kitchen tables \nacross our country, there is concern about our economic future.\n  In the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic \ngrowth. But in the short run, we can all see that growth is slowing. So \nlast week, my Administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and \nRepublican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax \nrelief for individuals and families and incentives for business \ninvestment. The temptation will be to load up the bill. That would \ndelay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable. This is a good \nagreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working. \nAnd this Congress must pass it as soon as possible.\n  We have other work to do on taxes. Unless the Congress acts, most of \nthe tax relief we have delivered over the past 7 years will be taken \naway. Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a \ntax increase. Try explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who \nwould see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800. Others have said \nthey would personally be happy to pay higher taxes. I welcome their \nenthusiasm, and I am pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks \nand money orders.\n  Most Americans think their taxes are high enough. With all the other \npressures on their finances, American families should not have to worry \nabout the Federal Government taking a bigger bite out of their \npaychecks. There is only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: make \nthe tax relief permanent. And Members of Congress should know: If any \nbill raising taxes reaches my desk, I will veto it.\n\n  Just as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn \ntheir trust by spending their tax dollars wisely. Next week, I will \nsend you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful \nor bloated programs totaling more than $18 billion. And this budget \nwill keep America on track for a surplus in 2012. American families \nhave to balance their budgets, and so should their Government.\n  The people's trust in their Government is undermined by congressional \nearmarks--special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last \nminute, without discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to \nvoluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked \nyou to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even \ncome to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if \nyou send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and \ncost of earmarks in half, I will send it back to you with my veto. And \ntomorrow, I will issue an Executive Order that directs Federal agencies \nto ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by the Congress. If \nthese items are truly worth funding, the Congress should debate them in \nthe open and hold a public vote.\n  Our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and \nspending.\n  On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of \nhomeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the \nhousing market. My administration brought together the HOPE NOW \nalliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid \nforeclosure. The Congress can help even more. Tonight I ask you to pass \nlegislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernize the Federal \nHousing Administration, and allow State housing agencies to issue tax-\nfree bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. These are \ndifficult times for many American families, and by taking these steps, \nwe can help more of them keep their homes.\n  To build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and \ndoctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better \ninformation and better options. We share a common goal: making health \ncare more affordable and accessible for all Americans. The best way to \nachieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not government \ncontrol. So I have proposed ending the bias in the tax code against \nthose who do not get their health insurance through their employer. \nThis one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, \nand I call on the Congress to pass it this year. The Congress must also \nexpand health savings accounts, create Association Health Plans for \nsmall businesses, promote health information technology, and confront \nthe epidemic of junk medical lawsuits. With all these steps, we will \nhelp ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the \nprivacy of your doctor's office--not in the halls of Congress.\n  On education, we must trust students to learn if given the chance and \nempower parents to demand results from our schools. In neighborhoods \nacross our country, there are boys and girls with dreams--and a decent \neducation is their only hope of achieving them. Six years ago, we came \ntogether to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today no one can \ndeny its results. Last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the \nhighest math scores on record. Reading scores are on the rise. And \nAfrican-American and Hispanic students posted alltime highs. Now we \nmust work together to increase accountability, add flexibility for \nStates and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, and \nprovide extra help for struggling schools. Members of Congress: The No \nChild Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement. It is succeeding. \nAnd we owe it to America's children, their parents, and their teachers \nto strengthen this good law.\n  We must also do more to help children when their schools do not \nmeasure up. Thanks to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarships you approved, \nmore than 2,600 of the poorest children in our Nation's capital have \nfound new hope at a faith-based or other non-public school. Sadly, \nthese schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of America's \ninner cities. So I will convene a White House summit aimed at \nstrengthening these lifelines of learning. And to open the doors of \nthese schools to more children, I ask you to support a new $300 million \nprogram called Pell Grants for Kids. We have seen how Pell Grants help \nlow-income college students realize their full potential. Together, we \nhave expanded the size and reach of these grants. Now let's apply that \nsame spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public \nschools.\n  On trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in \nthe world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas. Today, \nour economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell \nAmerican goods, crops, and services all over the world.\n\n[[Page S392]]\n\nSo we are working to break down barriers to trade and investment \nwherever we can. We are working for a successful Doha round of trade \ntalks, and we must complete a good agreement this year. At the same \ntime, we are pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing \nfree trade agreements.\n  I thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru. Now I \nask you to approve agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. \nMany products from these nations now enter America duty-free, yet many \nof our products face steep tariffs in their markets. These agreements \nwill level the playing field. They will give us better access to nearly \n100 million customers. And they will support good jobs for the finest \nworkers in the world: those whose products say ``Made in the USA.''\n\n  These agreements also promote America's strategic interests. The \nfirst agreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of \nAmerica that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug \ntraffickers. If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the \npurveyors of false populism in our hemisphere. So we must come \ntogether, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region \nthat democracy leads to a better life.\n  Trade brings better jobs, better choices, and better prices. Yet for \nsome Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the Federal Government \nhas a responsibility to help. I ask the Congress to reauthorize and \nreform trade adjustment assistance, so we can help these displaced \nworkers learn new skills and find new jobs.\n  To build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative \ngenius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to \npioneer a new generation of clean energy technology. Our security, our \nprosperity, and our environment all require reducing our dependence on \noil. Last year, I asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil \nconsumption over the next decade, and you responded. Together we should \ntake the next steps: Let us fund new technologies that can generate \ncoal power while capturing carbon emissions. Let us increase the use of \nrenewable power and emissions-free nuclear power. Let us continue \ninvesting in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power \nthe cars and trucks of the future. Let us create a new international \nclean technology fund, which will help developing nations like India \nand China make greater use of clean energy sources. And let us complete \nan international agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and \neventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases. This agreement will \nbe effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and \ngives none a free ride. The United States is committed to strengthening \nour energy security and confronting global climate change. And the best \nway to meet these goals is for America to continue leading the way \ntoward the development of cleaner and more efficient technology.\n  To keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the \nskill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the \nbreakthroughs of tomorrow. Last year, the Congress passed legislation \nsupporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never followed \nthrough with the funding. This funding is essential to keeping our \nscientific edge. So I ask the Congress to double Federal support for \ncritical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America \nremains the most dynamic nation on earth.\n  On matters of science and life, we must trust in the innovative \nspirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new \ntreatments while respecting moral boundaries. In November, we witnessed \na landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram \nadult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough \nhas the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by \nextending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human \nlife. So we are expanding funding for this type of ethical medical \nresearch. And as we explore promising avenues of research, we must also \nensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves. So I call \non the Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices such \nas the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life.\n  On matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders \nand empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it \nsays. I have submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of \nthe law, not the whim of the gavel. Many of these nominees are being \nunfairly delayed. They are worthy of confirmation, and the Senate \nshould give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote.\n  In communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of \nthe American people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need. \nOver the past 7 years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that \nthe pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service. Americans have \nvolunteered in record numbers. Charitable donations are higher than \never. Faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with \nnewfound support from the Federal Government. And to help guarantee \nequal treatment for faith-based organizations when they compete for \nFederal funds, I ask you to permanently extend Charitable Choice.\n  Tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in \nthe Gulf Coast. America honors the strength and resilience of the \npeople of this region. We reaffirm our pledge to help them build \nstronger and better than before. And tonight I am pleased to announce \nthat in April we will host this year's North American Summit of Canada, \nMexico, and the United States in the great city of New Orleans.\n  There are two other pressing challenges that I have raised repeatedly \nbefore this body, and that this body has failed to address: entitlement \nspending and immigration.\n  Every Member in this Chamber knows that spending on entitlement \nprograms like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster \nthan we can afford. And we all know the painful choices ahead if \nAmerica stays on this path: massive tax increases, sudden and drastic \ncuts in benefits, or crippling deficits. I have laid out proposals to \nreform these programs. Now I ask Members of Congress to offer your \nproposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital \nprograms for our children and grandchildren.\n  The other pressing challenge is immigration. America needs to secure \nour borders--and with your help, my administration is taking steps to \ndo so. We are increasing worksite enforcement, we are deploying fences \nand advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings, we have \neffectively ended the policy of ``catch and release'' at the border, \nand by the end of this year, we will have doubled the number of border \npatrol agents. Yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully \nsecure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to \ncome here and support our economy. This will take pressure off the \nborder and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us \nharm. We must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people \nhere illegally. Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be \nresolved. And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws \nand our highest ideals.\n  This is the business of our Nation here at home. Yet building a \nprosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies \nabroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world.\n  Our foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people, \nwhen given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace. In \nthe last 7 years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of \nliberty. We have seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for \ntheir right to free and fair elections. We have seen people in Lebanon \ntake to the streets to demand their independence. We have seen Afghans \nemerge from the tyranny of the Taliban to choose a new president and a \nnew parliament. We have seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink-stained \nfingers and celebrating their freedom. And these images of liberty have \ninspired us.\n  In the past 7 years, we have also seen images that have sobered us. \nWe have watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying \nthe caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin's hand. We have \nseen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in \nJordan, Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\nmarkets, and trains in London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs. And on \na clear September day, we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken \nfrom us in an instant. These horrific images serve as a grim reminder: \nThe advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists--evil \nmen who despise freedom, despise America, and aim to subject millions \nto their violent rule.\n  Since September 11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and \nextremists. We will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, \nand we will deliver justice to the enemies of America.\n  We are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st \ncentury. The terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency \nthat we hold dear. Yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and \nour enemies agree on: In the long run, men and women who are free to \ndetermine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in \ntyranny. That is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to \npeople in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian \nTerritories. And that is why, for the security of America and the peace \nof the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom.\n  In Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations \nare helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their \ncountry. Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian \npersonnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for al Qaida is now a \nyoung democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and \nhospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with \nnew hope. These successes must continue, so we are adding 3,200 Marines \nto our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and \ntrain the Afghan Army and police. Defeating the Taliban and al Qaida is \ncritical to our security, and I thank the Congress for supporting \nAmerica's vital mission in Afghanistan.\n  In Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud \npeople their liberty and to establish safe havens for attacks across \nthe world. One year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts \nto plunge Iraq into chaos. So we reviewed our strategy and changed \ncourse. We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq. And we gave \nour troops a new mission: Work with Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi \npeople, pursue the enemy in its strongholds, and deny the terrorists \nsanctuary anywhere in the country.\n  The Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had \nhappened. Those who had worried that America was preparing to abandon \nthem instead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into \ntheir country. They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, clearing \nout the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not \nreturn. And they saw our troops, along with Provincial Reconstruction \nTeams that include Foreign Service Officers and other skilled public \nservants, coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by \nimprovements in daily life. Our military and civilians in Iraq are \nperforming with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of \nour whole Nation.\n\n  The Iraqis launched a surge of their own. In the fall of 2006, Sunni \ntribal leaders grew tired of al Qaida's brutality and started a popular \nuprising called ``The Anbar Awakening.'' Over the past year, similar \nmovements have spread across the country. And today, this grassroots \nsurge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the \nterrorists. The government in Baghdad has stepped forward as well--\nadding more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past \nyear.\n  While the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the \nAmerican and Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have \nimagined just 1 year ago:\n  When we met last year, many said containing the violence was \nimpossible. A year later, high profile terrorist attacks are down, \ncivilian deaths are down, and sectarian killings are down.\n  When we met last year, militia extremists--some armed and trained by \nIran--were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq. A year later, \nCoalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia \nfighters. And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that \ndefeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their \ncountry.\n  When we met last year, al Qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of \nIraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage \nout of the country. Today, it is al Qaida that is searching for safe \npassage. They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once \nheld, and over the past year, we have captured or killed thousands of \nextremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key al Qaida leaders and \noperatives. Last month, Osama bin Laden released a tape in which he \nrailed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on al Qaida and \nadmitted that Coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq. Ladies and \ngentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists \nthere is no doubt. Al Qaida is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will \nbe defeated.\n  When we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise. \nToday, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a \npolicy of ``return on success,'' and the surge forces we sent to Iraq \nare beginning to come home.\n  This progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the \nbrilliance of their commanders. This evening, I want to speak directly \nto our men and women on the front lines. Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, \nMarines, and Coast Guardsmen: In the past year, you have done \neverything we have asked of you, and more. Our Nation is grateful for \nyour courage. We are proud of your accomplishments. And tonight in this \nhallowed chamber, with the American people as our witness, we make you \na solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need to \nprotect our Nation. And I ask the Congress to meet its responsibilities \nto these brave men and women by fully funding our troops.\n  Our enemies in Iraq have been hit hard. They are not yet defeated, \nand we can still expect tough fighting ahead. Our objective in the \ncoming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007, while \ntransitioning to the next phase of our strategy. American troops are \nshifting from leading operations, to partnering with Iraqi forces, and, \neventually, to a protective overwatch mission. As part of this \ntransition, one Army brigade combat team and one Marine Expeditionary \nUnit have already come home and will not be replaced. In the coming \nmonths, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow \nsuit. Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are \ncoming home.\n  Any further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in \nIraq and the recommendations of our commanders. General Petraeus has \nwarned that too fast a drawdown could result in the ``disintegration of \nthe Iraqi Security Forces, al Qaida-Iraq regaining lost ground, [and] a \nmarked increase in violence.'' Members of Congress: Having come so far \nand achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen.\n  In the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on \nthe progress they are making toward political reconciliation. At the \nlocal level, Sunnis, Shia, and Kurds are beginning to come together to \nreclaim their communities and rebuild their lives. Progress in the \nprovinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad. And we are seeing \nsome encouraging signs. The national government is sharing oil revenues \nwith the provinces. The parliament recently passed both a pension law \nand de-Ba'athification reform. Now they are debating a provincial \npowers law. The Iraqis still have a distance to travel. But after \ndecades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, \nreconciliation is taking place--and the Iraqi people are taking control \nof their future.\n  The mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our Nation. But \nit is in the vital interest of the United States that we succeed. A \nfree Iraq will deny al Qaida a safe haven. A free Iraq will show \nmillions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible. \nAnd a free Iraq will be a friend of America, a partner in fighting \nterror, and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world.\n  By contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden extremists, strengthen \nIran, and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on \nour friends, our allies, and our homeland. The enemy has made its \nintentions clear. At a\n\n[[Page S394]]\n\ntime when the momentum seemed to favor them, al Qaida's top commander \nin Iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us \nhere in Washington. My fellow Americans: We will not rest either. We \nwill not rest until this enemy has been defeated. We must do the \ndifficult work today, so that years from now people will look back and \nsay that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough \nfight, and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer America.\n  We are also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy \nLand, where we have new cause for hope. Palestinians have elected a \npresident who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to \nachieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace \nwith Israel. Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, \ndemocratic Palestinian state will be a source of lasting security. This \nmonth in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from both sides that \nAmerica will do, and I will do, everything we can to help them achieve \na peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this \nyear. The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a \ndemocratic Palestine live side-by-side in peace.\n  We are also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the \nregime in Tehran. Iran's rulers oppress a good and talented people. And \nwherever freedom advances in the Middle East, it seems the Iranian \nregime is there to oppose it. Iran is funding and training militia \ngroups in Iraq, supporting Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon, and backing \nHamas' efforts to undermine peace in the Holy Land. Tehran is also \ndeveloping ballistic missiles of increasing range and continues to \ndevelop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used to create \na nuclear weapon. Our message to the people of Iran is clear: We have \nno quarrel with you, we respect your traditions and your history, and \nwe look forward to the day when you have your freedom. Our message to \nthe leaders of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear \nenrichment, so negotiations can begin. And to rejoin the community of \nnations, come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, \nstop your oppression at home, and cease your support for terror abroad. \nBut above all, know this: America will confront those who threaten our \ntroops, we will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital \ninterests in the Persian Gulf.\n  On the homefront, we will continue to take every lawful and effective \nmeasure to protect our country. This is our most solemn duty. We are \ngrateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since \nSeptember 11. This is not for a lack of desire or effort on the part of \nthe enemy. In the past 6 years, we have stopped numerous attacks, \nincluding a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los \nAngeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for America over \nthe Atlantic. Dedicated men and women in our Government toil day and \nnight to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans. These good \ncitizens are saving American lives, and everyone in this chamber owes \nthem our thanks. And we owe them something more: We owe them the tools \nthey need to keep our people safe.\n  One of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to \nmonitor terrorist communications. To protect America, we need to know \nwho the terrorists are talking to, what they are saying, and what they \nare planning. Last year, the Congress passed legislation to help us do \nthat. Unfortunately, the Congress set the legislation to expire on \nFebruary 1. This means that if you do not act by Friday, our ability to \ntrack terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in \ngreater danger. The Congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence \nis not disrupted. The Congress must pass liability protection for \ncompanies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America. \nWe have had ample time for debate. The time to act is now.\n  Protecting our Nation from the dangers of a new century requires more \nthan good intelligence and a strong military. It also requires changing \nthe conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on \ndespair. So America is using its influence to build a freer, more \nhopeful, and more compassionate world. This is a reflection of our \nnational interest and the calling of our conscience.\n  America is opposing genocide in Sudan and supporting freedom in \ncountries from Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma.\n  America is leading the fight against global poverty, with strong \neducation initiatives and humanitarian assistance. We have also changed \nthe way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account. \nThis program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law \nin developing nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important \ninitiative.\n  America is leading the fight against global hunger. Today, more than \nhalf the world's food aid comes from the United States. And tonight, I \nask the Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food \nassistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing \nworld, so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of \nfamine.\n  America is leading the fight against disease. With your help, we are \nworking to cut by half the number of malaria-related deaths in 15 \nAfrican nations. And our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4 \nmillion people. We can bring healing and hope to many more. So I ask \nyou to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this \nprogram a success. And I call on you to double our initial commitment \nto fighting HIV/AIDS by approving an additional $30 billion over the \nnext 5 years.\n\n  America is a force for hope in the world because we are a \ncompassionate people, and some of the most compassionate Americans are \nthose who have stepped forward to protect us. We must keep faith with \nall who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and \npeace. Over the past 7 years, we have increased funding for veterans by \nmore than 95 percent. As we increase funding, we must also reform our \nveterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation. I \ncall on the Congress to enact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob \nDole and Secretary Donna Shalala, so we can improve the system of care \nfor our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope, promise, \nand dignity.\n  Our military families also sacrifice for America. They endure \nsleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while \na loved one is serving far from home. We have a responsibility to \nprovide for them. So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to \nchildcare, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across \nthe Federal Government, and allowing our troops to transfer their \nunused education benefits to their spouses or children. Our military \nfamilies serve our Nation, they inspire our Nation, and tonight our \nNation honors them.\n  The secret of our strength, the miracle of America, is that our \ngreatness lies not in our Government, but in the spirit and \ndetermination of our people. When the Federal Convention met in \nPhiladelphia in 1787, our Nation was bound by the Articles of \nConfederation, which began with the words, ``We the undersigned \ndelegates.'' When Gouverneur Morris was asked to draft the preamble to \nour new Constitution, he offered an important revision and opened with \nwords that changed the course of our Nation and the history of the \nworld: ``We the people.''\n  By trusting the people, our Founders wagered that a great and noble \nNation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all \nmen and women. By trusting the people, succeeding generations \ntransformed our fragile young democracy into the most powerful Nation \non earth and a beacon of hope for millions. And so long as we continue \nto trust the people, our Nation will prosper, our liberty will be \nsecure, and the State of our Union will remain strong. So tonight, with \nconfidence in freedom's power, and trust in the people, let us set \nforth to do their business.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \ntheme study to identify sites and resources to commemorate and \ninterpret the Cold War; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 75 years ago yesterday, the U.S. conducted \nthe first nuclear test on American soil--the detonation of a one-\nkiloton nuclear device in an area known as Frenchman Flat at the Nevada \nTest Site.\n  Conducted in extraordinary secrecy, this first nuclear testing \nprogram, known as Project Nutmeg, was representative of the efforts of \ncountless Americans in the 50 year struggle we know as the Cold War.\n  Lasting half a century, the Cold War was the longest sustained \nconflict in U.S. history. The nuclear capabilities of our enemy posed \nliterally an existential threat to our Nation. The threat of mass \ndestruction left a permanent mark on American life.\n  The U.S. prevailed over this grave threat, through the technological \nachievement, patriotism, and sacrifice of the people of the great State \nof Nevada, and of others throughout the Nation.\n  It has been 18 years since the Malta Conference that marked the end \nof the Cold War, yet the contributions and sacrifices of generations of \nAmericans have largely gone unrecognized.\n  The time has come to recognize and honor those Americans who toiled \nin relative obscurity to bring us victory during this most dangerous \nconflict in our Nation's history.\n  Today I introduce a bill that requires the Department of the Interior \nto conduct a study to identify sites and resources to commemorate \nheroes of the Cold War, and to interpret the Cold War for future \ngenerations.\n  My legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a \n``Cold War Advisory Committee'' to oversee the inventory of Cold War \nsites and resources; for potential inclusion in the National Park \nSystem; as national historic landmarks; or other appropriate \ndesignations.\n  The Advisory Committee will work closely with State and local \ngovernments and local historical organizations. The Committee's \nstarting point will be a Cold War study completed by the Secretary of \nDefense under the 1991 Defense Appropriations Act. Obvious Cold War \nsites of significance include: intercontinental ballistic missile \nlaunch sites; flight training centers; communications and command \ncenters, such as Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; nuclear weapons test \nsites, such as the Nevada Test Site; and sites of other strategic and \ntactical significance.\n\n  Perhaps no state in the union played a more sigificant role than \nNevada in winning the Cold War.\n  The Nevada Test Site is a high-technology engineering marvel where \nthe U.S. developed, tested, and perfected a nuclear deterrent that \nformed the cornerstone of America's security and leadership among \nnations. Of the 1,149 nuclear detonations conducted by U.S. as part of \nits nuclear testing program, 1,021 were performed at the Nevada Test \nSite.\n  The Naval Air Station at Fallon, NV, home of the Navy's preeminent \ntactical air warfare training center, was also the site of Cold War-era \nnuclear testing.\n  Hawthorne Army Depot, formerly known as the Hawthorne Army Ammunition \nPlant, likewise played an important role throughout the Cold War, \nserving as a staging area for conventional bombs, rockets, and \nammunition as it had done since World War II.\n  Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas, home of the first dedicated \nair warfare and later air/ground training facility, provided to Cold \nWar aviators and continues to provide advanced air combat training for \nU.S. and Allied forces.\n  Generations of Nevadans bore and continue to bear extraordinary costs \nas a result of these critical contributions to the Cold War effort.\n  The Advisory Committee established under this legislation will \ndevelop an interpretive handbook telling the story of the Cold War and \nits heroes.\n  I'd like to take a moment to relate a story of one group of Cold War \nheroes.\n  On a snowy evening, November 17, 1955, a U.S. Air Force C-54 cargo \nplane crashed near the summit of Mount Charleston in rural Nevada.\n  Kept secret for years, we now know that the four aircrew and ten \nscientists aboard the doomed aircraft were bound for the secret Air \nForce Flight Test Center, where they were developing a top-secret spy \nplane that would become known as the U-2.\n  These men who gave their lives that day helped build the plane that \nmany critics said could never be built. Owing to the efforts of men \nlike these, the critics were proved wrong: the U-2 remains a vital \ncomponent of our reconnaissance forces to this day.\n  As a result of the absolute secrecy surrounding their work, the \nfamilies of the men who perished on Mount Charleston only recently \nlearned the true circumstances of the crash that\n\n[[Page S397]]\n\ntook the lives of their loved ones and the nature of their vital work.\n  This legislation will provide $500,000 to identify historic \nlandmarks, like the Mount Charleston crash site, to recognize and pay \ntribute to the sacrifices of these men and others.\n  I would like to reiterate my thanks for Mr. Steve Ririe of Las Vegas, \nwhose tireless efforts brought to light the events surrounding the \ndeath of these fourteen men on Mount Charleston over fifty years ago, \nand for the efforts of State Senator Raymond Rawson, who shepherded \nthrough the Nevada legislature a resolution honoring these heroes.\n  A grateful Nation owes a debt of supreme gratitude to the silent \nheroes of the Cold War. I urge my colleagues to support this long-\noverdue tribute to the contribution and sacrifice of these Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 2561\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 432\n\n       Whereas, on August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security \n     Council approved United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1706, providing that the existing United Nations Mission in \n     Sudan (UNMIS) ``shall take over from [the African Mission in \n     Sudan (AMIS)] responsibility for supporting the \n     implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement upon the \n     expiration of AMIS' mandate but in any event no later than 31 \n     December 2006'';\n       Whereas, on July 31, 2007, the United Nations Security \n     Council approved United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1769 reaffirming Resolution 1706 and stating that the \n     Security Council ``[d]ecides . . . to authorise and mandate \n     the establishment . . . of an AU/UN Hybrid operation in \n     Darfur (UNAMID) . . . [and] [d]ecides that UNAMID, which \n     shall incorporate AMIS personnel and the UN Heavy and Light \n     Support Packages to AMIS, shall consist of up to 19,555 \n     military personnel, including 360 military observers and \n     liaison officers, and an appropriate civilian component \n     including up to 3,772 police personnel and 19 formed police \n     units comprising up to 140 personnel each'';\n       Whereas, on December 31, 2007, the United Nations-African \n     Union hybrid mission formally assumed control of peacekeeping \n     operations in Darfur, but did so with only approximately \n     9,000 troops and police on the ground, far short of both the \n     authorized and necessary levels;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan continues to obstruct \n     implementation of Security Council Resolutions 1706 and 1769 \n     in several respects, including by refusing to conclude a \n     Status of Forces Agreement or to cooperate on issues such as \n     the force composition, the authorization of night flights, \n     customs clearance, land access, and visas for staff;\n       Whereas, on January 7, 2008, uniformed elements of the army \n     of Sudan attacked a clearly marked UNAMID supply convoy, \n     severely wounding a Sudanese civilian driver;\n       Whereas rebels, militias, government forces, bandits, and \n     others continue to prey upon the people of Darfur and upon \n     humanitarian workers, increasing the urgency of both \n     deploying the full complement of peacekeepers and police and \n     of reaching a lasting political settlement;\n       Whereas the preliminary results of a United Nations \n     assessment entitled the ``Food Security and Nutrition \n     Assessment of the Conflict-Affected Population of Darfur \n     (August/September 2007)'' reveal that global acute \n     malnutrition in Darfur increased in 2007, exceeding emergency \n     levels in some regions;\n       Whereas the United Nations-African Union Mission in Sudan \n     has been hampered not only by obstruction by the Government \n     of Sudan and other obstacles to peace in the region, but by \n     the failure of the international community to commit the \n     resources, equipment, and personnel needed to carry out the \n     peacekeeping mission, most notably the failure to provide \n     critically needed aviation and transportation assets;\n       Whereas the United Nations-African Union Mission in Sudan \n     needs, among other critical mobility capabilities that have \n     not been met, 18 utility helicopters and 6 tactical \n     helicopters and crews;\n       Whereas, in a report to the Security Council dated December \n     24, 2007, the Secretary-General termed these helicopters \n     indispensable and stated that ``UNAMID must be capable of \n     rapid mobility over large distances, especially over terrain \n     where roads are the exception. Without the missing \n     helicopters, this mobility--a fundamental requirement for the \n     implementation of the UNAMID mandate--will not be \n     possible.'';\n       Whereas a large number of countries possess the military \n     assets that could help to fulfill this requirement;\n\n[[Page S398]]\n\n       Whereas the United States continues to lead the world in \n     its contributions to efforts to end the genocide in Darfur, \n     including by providing more than $4,500,000,000 since 2004 in \n     response to the Darfur crisis;\n       Whereas continued failure on the part of the international \n     community to take all steps necessary to generate, deploy, \n     and maintain an effective United Nations-African Union hybrid \n     peacekeeping force will result in the continued loss of life \n     and further degradation of humanitarian infrastructure in \n     Darfur; and\n       Whereas it would be inexcusable for the international \n     community to allow an authorized peacekeeping mission \n     intended to help bring an end to genocide and its effects to \n     founder or be compromised because of a failure to commit \n     critical elements, such as the 24 helicopters needed to meet \n     the critical mobility capabilities of the United Nations-\n     African Union Mission in Sudan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the members of the international community, \n     including the United States, that possess the capability to \n     provide the tactical and utility helicopters needed for the \n     United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur \n     to do so as soon as possible; and\n       (2) urges the President to intervene personally by \n     contacting other heads of state and asking them to contribute \n     the aircraft and crews for the Darfur mission.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on December 31, the United Nations and the \nAfrican Union jointly assumed control of the peacekeeping mission in \nDarfur. But, sadly, little has changed for the people of Darfur.\n  The United Nations Security Council has authorized over 26,000 \npeacekeepers, but just over 9,000 are on the ground in Darfur.\n  The government of Sudan had promised to abide by the United Nations \nresolution, but it continues to obstruct it at almost every turn.\n  Some of the rebel leaders have begun to join in coalitions with one \nanother, an important step for the peace process, but others continue \nto prey on civilians and humanitarian aid workers and to threaten \npeacekeepers.\n  And the nations of the world had pledged to help end the genocide, \nbut they are falling short where it counts.\n  U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon reports that no one has stepped up \nto provide the 24 helicopters that are needed to transport and protect \nthe peacekeepers and to give them the mobility that they need to do \ntheir jobs.\n  That is inexcusable. We cannot allow genocide and suffering to \ncontinue because the combined nations of the world cannot find 24 \nhelicopters to help stop it.\n  That is why today, joined by Senator Lugar and a number of other \ncolleagues, I have introduced a resolution expressing the Sense of the \nSenate that the world must not allow this peacekeeping mission to \nfounder because we cannot find 24 suitable aircraft within our vast \narsenals.\n  I recognize that helicopters are expensive vehicles that are in short \nsupply, with wars raging in Afghanistan and Iraq and with peacekeeping \nmissions in the Congo and now being deployed to Chad as well.\n  But a considerable number of nations possess aerial vehicles with the \ncapabilities that are needed for this mission. Together, we could fill \nthis gap.\n  The United Nations is seeking 18 utility and 6 tactical helicopters. \nAccording to a piece in the Washington Post, the member nations of NATO \nalone possess over 18,000 helicopters.\n  Not all of these 18,000 aircraft would be suitable for this mission. \nNATO reserves are taxed in Afghanistan and elsewhere, but the potential \nvehicles certainly exist. NATO is not alone in this capability. Other \ncountries could also step up to fill this need.\n  Secretary General Ban has stated that these vehicles are \nindispensable. He reports that the United Nations-African Union mission \nmust ``be capable of rapid mobility over large distances, especially \nover terrain where roads are the exception.'' Ban also said that \n``Without the missing helicopters, this mobility--a fundamental \nrequirement for the implementation of the [Security Council's] \nmandate--will not be possible.''\n  Helicopters alone will not save Darfur. The needs there are immense \nand growing. The United Nations revealed last month that acute \nmalnutrition in the region is rising and surpassing emergency levels in \nsome areas. To make matters worse, the Government of Khartoum is \ncontinuing to obstruct deployment of U.N. peacekeepers. They have \nobjected to non-African peacekeepers, such as a team of Norwegian \nengineers, and they are slowing deployment by denying visas and land \npermits and denying night flights. Most seriously of all, earlier this \nmonth, Sudanese troops opened fire on a clearly marked U.N. convoy, \nbadly injuring a driver.\n  The world must not allow the Khartoum government to dictate terms to \nthe UN mission. The European Union and United Nations Security Council \nshould, I believe, join the United States in imposing strong economic \nsanctions on the Sudanese government.\n  We should also continue to pressure the rebel groups to cease all \nattacks on civilians and humanitarian workers and engage in a peace \nprocess to bring a real solution for the people of Darfur.\n  We should do all these things and more, but, first and foremost, we \nshould ensure that the United Nations and African Union have the tools \nthat they need to carry out their mission.\n  The United States has already provided more than $4.5 billion since \n2004 in response to the Darfur crisis. That is an enormous contribution \nand it should not fall on our shoulders to fill this particular gap in \nthe peacekeeping mission.\n  That is why I have repeatedly written President Bush asking him to \nuse the powers of persuasion of his office to personally contact other \nheads of state to ask them to commit the needed vehicles and crews. I \nhave also written the Secretary General of NATO and President Hu of \nChina, asking them to help fill this gap.\n  Our resolution urges the members of the international community with \nthe necessary assets to contribute the needed vehicles and crews.\n  Preventing genocide is a global responsibility. Too often the world \nhas failed to keep this commitment, and it has failed Darfur for too \nlong.\n  We cannot allow the government of Khartoum to block deployment of the \n26,000 peacekeepers, but it would perhaps be even more unforgivable if \nthe international community refuses to provide the peacekeepers with \nthe equipment and vehicles that they need. Then we will have done \nKhartoum's job for them by obstructing ourselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/28/senate-section/article/S398-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3951.
