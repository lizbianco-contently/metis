Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10:30 shall be equally divided and controlled by the two leaders \nor their designees.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n\n\n                      U.S. Attorney Investigation\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today I was shocked to read in the \nWashington Post that Tom Heffelfinger, the former U.S. attorney for the \nDistrict of Minnesota, was among those recommended for removal by the \nJustice Department under Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Tom \nHeffelfinger had previously been appointed U.S. attorney for Minnesota \nby the first Bush administration in 1991 and had the distinction of \nbeing appointed again in 2001 by George W. Bush.\n  During his second term as U.S. attorney, I had the privilege of \nworking with Tom as a district attorney and chief prosecutor for \nMinnesota's largest county. The relationship between the U.S. attorney \nand the district attorney for a large metropolitan county is a very \nimportant one but also a difficult one. I can tell my colleagues this: \nIt has been my experience that the people of this country don't care \nwho prosecutes a case. They don't care if it is a local attorney or a \nState attorney or a Federal attorney. They just want us to get the job \ndone. That was the spirit in which I worked with Tom Heffelfinger and \nhis predecessor, B. Todd Jones, who was appointed by President Clinton.\n  When I was first elected in 1998, B. Todd Jones had been appointed by \nPresident Clinton. Todd Jones and I forged an excellent relationship. \nWe spoke often about the various cases in our jurisdiction and the \nsurrounding area, and we worked together when jurisdictional lines were \nblurred, deciding if a case would be prosecuted federally or locally. \nIt is not a small thing. In other jurisdictions there are often \ndisputes that are not in the best interests of the citizens, but we \nwere able to forge that relationship.\n  I remember we made a plan early on, and that is that we were going to \nwork together. I remember when Mr. Jones and I decided we would have a \nparty for our joint offices, and he invited the county attorney's \nprosecutors over to the U.S. attorneys, and I have to tell you, there \nis traditionally a little bit of jealousy that goes on. The county \nattorneys always look at the U.S. attorneys and figure they can have \nless cases and fewer resources to do those fewer cases, and the U.S. \nattorneys may look at the county attorneys and say, oh, why can't they \nspend more time on a case.\n  So we decided we would bring the people together. I still remember \nwhen we had the party at their beautiful offices. I got there first, \nand I never told my office, but U.S. attorney Todd Jones got on the \nintercom, and before my office came over, he said: Nail down the \nfurniture; The cousins are coming over.\n  Since then, we forged an amazing relationship. So when George W. Bush \nappointed Tom Heffelfinger as U.S. attorney--Tom Heffelfinger, of \ncourse, was a Republican; I was a Democrat--you might think there would \nbe problems. Well, there weren't. Tom Heffelfinger basically ran the \noffice the same way Todd Jones did, in a professional manner. Many of \nthe same people continued to work there and, in fact, the chief deputy \nremained the same under both the Republican-appointed U.S. attorney and \nthe Democrat-appointed U.S. attorney.\n  An example of Tom's professionalism comes to mind. When there was an \narmored truck robbery in the southern suburbs in our metropolitan area, \nthe victim was killed execution style, kneeling next to a truck. It was \na Brink's truck driver. The case had gone unsolved for a number of \nyears. Tom came to my office. I want my colleagues to know he didn't \nhave to do this. He could have had just a press conference and \nannounced the charges, and that would be the end of it. But he came to \nmy office weeks before the case was charged to tell me he thought they \nwere closing in on the suspect; to tell me he knew in most cases \nmurders were handled by our office, but that this case was going to be \ndifferent. It was different because the Feds had been investigating it \nfor a number of years, and it was different because it involved an \narmored truck. It was also different because it could potentially be \neligible for the death penalty, and he knew I was personally opposed to \nthe death penalty and Minnesota didn't have a death penalty. Nothing \nrequired him to come and talk to me about that case, but Tom \nHeffelfinger did because he had the respect for me and he had the \nrespect for our office that you don't always see with people in \ngovernment service.\n  Our office jointly prosecuted many cases, and when there was a \njurisdictional issue, Tom and I would always talk about it. We did a \nnumber of criminally focused initiatives together. We saw our offices \nas partners, not as rivals, and as time went on, as the years went on, \nthe respect between both our offices grew. As I said, each came to see \neach other, the people in our office, not as rivals, but as partners in \njustice.\n  This is why I am so appalled that Tom Heffelfinger was targeted for \nfiring. I take Tom at his word--and we have talked many times in the \nlast few months--that he had made a decision to leave the office, that \nhe never knew he was on such a list, and he made the decision based on \nthe fact that his wife was going to retire. But the issue is not that \nhe made the decision on his own, the issue is that someone of such \nintegrity as Tom Heffelfinger was ever targeted by this Justice \nDepartment for firing.\n\n  I have always believed, as a prosecutor, you do your job without fear \nof favor. It may not be easy, but whatever your decisions--and you know \nthey are not going to make everyone happy, but whatever your decisions, \nyou want to know at the end of the day that you did the right thing and \nthat you had no regrets.\n  We have learned these past few months that our Nation's chief law \nenforcement officer, our leading guardian of the rule of law in this \ncountry, has allowed politics to creep too close to the core of our \nlegal system. This administration has determined that Washington \npoliticians--not prosecutors out in the field, and even perhaps in some \ncases not the facts themselves--would dictate how prosecutions should \nproceed. The consequences are simply unacceptable. Good prosecutors \nlike Tom Heffelfinger who, by all accounts, were just doing their \njobs--upholding their oaths, following the principles of their \nprofessions--we find out were targeted for firing. The new information \nwe also received this week is while this administration repeatedly said \nwe were only focusing on these eight prosecutors, it turned out to be \n26 people who they were considering.\n  This is why I am asking the Justice Department today to tell us why \nTom Heffelfinger, someone of such integrity, would even be on this \nlist. I am asking our Judiciary Committee to look into the fact that \nthis man--this good man--was even on this list.\n  We have seen cases all over the country now where prosecutors were \npressured, where they were fired, where they were unfairly slandered by \nthis administration. All of this, it would seem, was motivated by rank \npolitics.\n  This week was Law Enforcement Week. It made me a little melancholy \nfor my previous job. I had many police officers come in and talk to me, \nso many I had known and worked with, and we talked about cases. I also \ntreasured the work that I did with prosecutors throughout our State, \nfrom the smallest counties to the U.S. Attorney's Office. This is what \nour justice system is about in America. It is about putting justice \nfirst. It is about doing our jobs without fear of favor.\n  That is why I believe this Attorney General must resign. I have been \nsaying it for months. You simply cannot have a cloud over the Justice \nDepartment, where they can't do their jobs because they are constantly \nplagued by investigations and by everything that has been going on \nbecause of the brute political decisions made by this administration.\n  This is just wrong. I call for the resignation of this Attorney \nGeneral, and I ask that the country understand what a great man Tom \nHeffelfinger is, that he should never have been on this list. And I \nwill stand tall to tell the people of my State how this is a man of \nintegrity and that I respect him very much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6217]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, here we are once again--deja vu--debating \nsupplemental funding for the President's disastrous misadventure in \nIraq. Now in its fifth year of occupation, the U.S. death toll in Iraq \nis over 3,380. What a shame, shame, shame. The death toll of innocent \nIraqis is largely unknown, but it probably numbers in the tens of \nthousands.\n  The United States of America has spent over $378 billion in Iraq. Do \nyou know how much a billion dollars is? That is $1 for every minute \nsince Jesus Christ was born. So the United States has spent over $378 \nbillion in Iraq, and we are all familiar with the horrendous tales of \nwaste and abuse by U.S. contractors in Iraq. The taxpayer--that is you \nout there--has been ravaged by the profiteering in Iraq. But even \nworse, despite the billions, our brave troops have been shortchanged \nwith inadequate equipment to protect their lives and shoddy medical \ncare, if they make it back home, to treat wounds of the body and of the \nmind.\n  Now the President has threatened to veto the House bill, which is \nbefore the Senate, because it sets a date to withdraw, provides funding \nuntil late July and ``could unreasonably burden the President's \nexercise of his constitutional authorities, including his authority as \nCommander in Chief.''\n  President Bush has also objected to funding for rebuilding the Gulf \nCoast States after Hurricane Katrina, funding to improve health care \nfor our troops and our veterans, funding for the shortfall in the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, funding for Low-Income Heating \nAssistance Program, and more funding for Homeland Security.\n  Mr. President, this President--our President--has a single-minded \nobsession with Iraq, and he appears to see no value in anything except \ncontinuing his chaotic ``mission impossible.'' While tilting at \nwindmills may have been a harmless procedure for Don Quixote, Mr. \nBush's war is turning the sands of Iraq blood red.\n  Mr. Bush raises constitutional concerns in his latest veto threat. I \ndon't know whether to laugh or to cry. I don't no whether to laugh or \nto cry. I suppose one could be encouraged that constitutional concerns \nexist in the Bush kingdom. After setting aside the Constitution \nwhenever convenient to justify preemptive attacks, illegal searches, \nsecret wiretapping, clandestine military tribunals, treaty violations, \nkidnapping, torture, and a rejection of habeas corpus, one has to \nwonder about the nature of these purported ``constitutional concerns.'' \nIf the Constitution is finally to be read, let us read it in its \nentirety, including the articles which give the people's \nrepresentatives--that is us--the power over the purse--yes, the power \nover the purse; don't ever forget it. That is the real power. It gives \nthe people's representatives the power over the purse and the power to \ndeclare war.\n  In its statement of administrative policy, the administration claims \nthat the House bill before us `` . . . is likely to unleash chaos in \nIraq. . . .'' Mr. President, what do we have now if not chaos in Iraq? \nSecuring Iraq has unaccountably morphed into securing Baghdad, and even \nthat goal eludes us. I doubt if building a wall around the green zone \nis going to be of much consequence in securing Baghdad, not to mention \nthe very strange message such a wall conveys concerning our purported \nliberation of Iraq.\n  The President--our President--continues to miss the point. Iraq is at \nwar with itself. America cannot create a stable democracy in Iraq at \nthe point of a gun. While our troops succeeded in toppling Saddam \nHussein, it is the President's profound misunderstanding of the \ndynamics in Iraq that have led to the failure of his Iraq policies. Why \nin the world should we now believe the claims that he makes in his veto \nthreat?\n  There must be an end to this occupation of Iraq. Yes, I say \noccupation for it is no longer a war in which U.S. troops should be \ninvolved. Our troops won the war they were sent to fight, and they \nshould not now be asked to serve as targets in a religious conflict \nbetween Sunni and Shiites that has raged for thousands of years. It is \nreported that even a majority in the Iraqi Parliament now supports \nlegislation which demands a scheduled withdrawal and an immediate \nfreeze on the number of foreign soldiers in Iraq.\n  In April, Congress set a new course for the war in Iraq. Sadly, the \nPresident--our stubborn, uncompromising President--chose to veto that \nbill. As we prepare to go to conference again, the President \ncontinues--our President--to close his eyes and cover his ears to the \nreality in Iraq, and the urgent need for a new direction. Whatever \ndecision is made in conference will not be the last chapter in this sad \nstory. God willing, this Senator will not close his eyes, nor will he \ncover his ears, nor will I stand by in silence. Hear me.\n  We need to conclude this terrible, awful mistake that we have made in \nIraq. I said in the beginning that we ought not go into Iraq. But we \nare there. Anti-Americanism is more robust now than in any period in \nour history because of Iraq. Do you hear that? The international \ncommunity is skeptical--why should they not be? They are skeptical of \nU.S. intentions because of Iraq. Our Constitution has been trampled--\nhear that. Our Constitution has been trampled because of Iraq. \nThousands of U.S. troops and Iraqi citizens have lost their lives \nbecause of Iraq. Thousands more are maimed physically or mentally \nbecause of Iraq. Billions of U.S. dollars have been wasted because of \nIraq.\n  President Bush has lost all credibility. President Bush, our \nPresident, has lost all--all--credibility because of Iraq.\n  Terrorism is on the rise worldwide because of Iraq. May God grant \nthis Congress--that is, us--may God grant this Congress the courage to \ncome together and answer the cries of a majority of the people who sent \nus here. Find a way to end this horrible catastrophe, this \nunspeakable--unspeakable--ongoing calamity called Iraq. May God help us \nin the United States.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I cannot support the procedure that the \nmajority and minority leaders have concocted to speed a supplemental \nspending bill to conference without debate or amendments--and without \neven writing the actual bill. I share the desire of my colleagues to \npass this important bill as soon as possible. But that is no excuse for \nus avoiding our responsibilities as legislators. Passing a symbolic \nresolution is not an acceptable alternative to writing, considering and \nworking to improve legislation that provides tens of billions of \ndollars for a broad range of programs and that addresses the most \npressing issue facing the country--the President's disastrous policies \nin Iraq.\n  When it comes to legislation as important as this, we need full \ndebate and votes. We can do this quickly--I am prepared to have this \ndebate and consider amendments right away, and to stay as long as it \ntakes to get it done. But we should do it openly and on the record. The \nvotes we had yesterday on Iraq amendments to an unrelated bill are no \nexcuse for bypassing the regular legislative process today.\n  I admit, it is easier and quicker if we just send a placeholder bill \nto conference, so that the real work can be done there. But we do a \ndisservice to our constituents, and to this institution, by passing the \nbuck like that. The American people are calling on us to end the war in \nIraq. They deserve to see this debate, even if it slows us down by a \nfew hours. They deserve to know where their Senators stand, and which \namendments they support. A decision about whether to continue our \ninvolvement in this misguided war should be made in open debate, not \nbehind closed doors--particularly since neither house will have the \nopportunity to amend whatever final legislation emerges from \nconference.\n  The first supplemental that Congress recently passed was a step \nforward toward ending this war. I am concerned that the bill that \nemerges from the upcoming conference, thanks to this expedited \nprocedure, will be a step back. Passing a weak supplemental bill that \nexpresses disapproval of the President's policies but doesn't do \nanything to fix them may make some of us feel better. But this debate \nshould not be about providing political comfort for folks here in \nWashington. It is about responding to the wishes of the American people \nand the needs of our national security. And it should take place on the \nSenate floor, before the American people, right here, right now.\n\n[[Page S6218]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate held two important \nvotes: one on the Feingold amendment, which called for transitioning \nthe mission; and on the Warner amendment, which would require the \nPresident to certify the Iraqi Government is meeting benchmarks in \norder to receive United States aid.\n  I supported the Feingold amendment, which provides a real change of \ndirection and course out of the war. I opposed the Warner amendment \nbecause, after more than 4 years of war, 3,400 American deaths, almost \n30,000 wounded, and more than $500 billion--almost arriving at $1 \ntrillion dollars in taxpayer dollars spent--we need action, not more \nreports, especially those without consequences.\n  Yet, while I supported one vote and opposed the other, I am \nencouraged by both. They show real and growing momentum on both sides \nof the aisle to move away from this tragic, endless war. As the Los \nAngeles Times reported this morning:\n\n       The votes illustrated Congress' dramatic response to public \n     dismay with the war.\n\n  As CNN's Dana Bash said:\n\n       It was a milestone in the Iraq war debate. For the first \n     time, the vast majority of the President's fellow Republicans \n     voted to directly challenge his Iraq policy.\n\n  It is no wonder a broad bipartisan consensus for change is emerging. \nWe are well into the fourth surge of U.S. forces since the start of the \nwar, yet April was one of the deadliest months in the entire war, and \nattacks on our troops show no sign of decreasing. The Iraqi Government \nhas failed to adopt an oil law, a law on de-Baathification, or any \nfurther constitutional amendments they are required to implement.\n  Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki is accused of sabotaging efforts of peace \nand stability by firing some of the top law enforcement officials for \ndoing too good a job of combating violent Shiite militias.\n  Conditions are so chaotic, according to a report this morning by the \nChatham House Research Institute--which is a respected institute in \nEngland--they say the Iraqi Government is:\n\n        . . . on the verge of becoming a failed state with \n     internecine fighting and a continual struggle for power \n     threatening the nation's very existence.\n\n  The U.S. mission grows further and further disconnected from our \nstrategic national interests. Instead of focusing on force protection, \nhunting down al-Qaida and other terrorists, and training the Iraqi \nmilitary--missions that will make us more secure, help the Iraqi \npeople, and reduce our troops' exposure to sectarian violence--United \nStates forces, as we speak, are patrolling Baghdad streets, extremely \nvulnerable to snipers, kidnappers, and these explosive devices which \nhave become so well-known over there.\n  Our brave fighting forces have done everything we have asked of them, \nand even more. Every day we debate the war, our troops remain in harm's \nway. The overwhelming veto-proof bipartisan majority of the Senate is \nnow on record saying the status quo is unacceptable.\n  With that reality as a backdrop, this morning we will vote for \ncloture on Senator Murray's sense-of-the-Senate resolution that will \nmove us to conference on the emergency supplemental bill and the \nimportant negotiations that will take place in the near future on the \nIraq situation.\n  Last evening, I spoke to the father of one of the hostages in Iraq. \nHe lives in Reno, NV. We talked, and it was difficult. He loves his \nson, he prays for his son's return, as we all do. We talked about how \nwe have hope that he is alive.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the resolution we are going to \nvote on. We can all agree we need to move swiftly to the supplemental \nbill that fully funds our troops. We all agree we can't ``stay the \ncourse.'' That is not an option, as President Bush has done for more \nthan 4 years.\n  As we move this debate to conference, the American people deserve to \nknow that the Democrats' commitment to bring this war to a responsible \nend has never been stronger. If enough of our Republican colleagues \ndecide to join with us, even the President will have to listen.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding the parliamentary issue before \nthis body is a vote that will occur at 10:30; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 10:35.\n  Mr. REID. At 10:35. And at 10:35, because the leaders used some of \ntheir time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think it would be in the best interest of \nthe Senate if we go ahead and start the vote. I have not had an \nopportunity to check with the minority, so I don't want to move to do \nthat before I do so. We will know that in a minute. But it would \nprobably be better if we got the vote started, if there is no one here \nto speak in the next 5 minutes.\n  I think we will go ahead and start the vote, and if somebody is \nconcerned about the extra 5 minutes, then we will extend the time an \nextra 5 minutes. I ask that we proceed with the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Reid-McConnell \n     amendment No. 1123 relating to Iraq to H.R. 2206, the \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n         Harry Reid, Debbie Stabenow, Daniel K.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the pending efforts to structure a comprehensive immigration \nreform bill. There are many questions which are being asked today in \nthe corridors by members of the media as to what is happening on the \nefforts to structure a bill to come before the Senate next week, where \na cloture vote is scheduled for Monday afternoon to proceed. The \nefforts to structure legislation have been in process now for 3 months. \nThere have been approximately 30 meetings held for durations \ncustomarily of 2 hours or longer, customarily attended by 8, 10, or 12 \nSenators. It is unusual to have a dozen Senators sit still in a room \nfor 2 hours, but that has happened repeatedly as we have struggled \nthrough the very complex issues while trying for comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  We have bypassed the Judiciary Committee in this effort. Perhaps it \nwas a mistake. In the 109th Congress, we laboriously worked through and \nproduced a bill which came to the Senate floor and which was ultimately \npassed. There is a great deal to be said for regular order, where we \nhave a text, amendments are proposed, there is debate, there are votes, \nand we move ahead through the committee system. The decision was made \nearly on not to utilize regular order in the traditional committee \nsystem, and it may well have been an error, as we have been struggling \nto come to terms with a consensus.\n  First, there were extensive meetings with Republicans alone. \nDemocrats met separately. Then there have been the bipartisan meetings, \nas we have struggled to come to terms. The meetings have virtually gone \nround the clock. The staff has literally worked round the clock, the \npast weekend, both Saturday and Sunday, and the previous weekend. The \nadministration has been dedicated; the President has been personally \ninvolved in the discussions. A group of us met with the President \nyesterday. Immigration was discussed. The administration has devoted \nthe time of the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of \nCommerce, who have been parties to these lengthy meetings, always \npresent for the duration of the session. We think we are coming very \nclose, but as we move through the analysis and discussion, it has been \napparent that no matter what legislation is produced, it will be \nunsatisfactory to both ends of the political spectrum.\n  The bill has already been criticized for being too lenient on \nundocumented immigrants and providing amnesty at one end of the \npolitical spectrum. It has been criticized at the other end of the \npolitical spectrum for not being sufficiently humanitarian and \ncompassionate to the immigrants. Even though we have yet to produce a \nbill, it has been subjected to criticism. We have found that around the \ncountry some 90 cities have been engaged in legislative efforts with \neither passed or rejected laws trying to deal with immigrants' \nlandlords. In my State, the city of Hazleton is trying to deal with the \nissue. Recently, we had a conspiracy by six men charged with a \nterrorist plot to attack the soldiers at Fort Dix. Three of those who \nhave been charged are undocumented immigrants from Yugoslavia, illegal \nimmigrants. There has been a virtual breakdown of law and order, as we \nhave in this country an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants.\n  We have the criticism expressed at one end of the political spectrum \nthat there is amnesty here. That is factually wrong. Those who will be \nplaced at the end of the citizenship line will be those who do not have \ncriminal records. Where we can identify those with criminal records, \nthey should be deported. You can't deport 12 million undocumented \nimmigrants who are here illegally, but you can deport those who have \ncriminal records. Those who will be placed at the end of the line for \ncitizenship will be those who have paid their taxes, those who have \nestablished a good work record, those who were contributing in a \nconstructive way to the American way of life.\n  When objections are raised as to amnesty, the question is returned: \nWhat more can be done with these 12 million undocumented immigrants? \nWhat more hurdles can be placed to be sure we do the maximum to avoid \nthe charge of amnesty? We are still open for suggestions. But the \nconsequence of not moving to a solution on this issue is that we have \nanarchy. We have uncontrolled borders.\n  The legislation we are working on goes a long way. It increases the \nnumber of Border Patrol officers from 12,000 to 18,000. It will have \n200 miles of vehicle barriers and 370 miles of fencing, 70 ground-based \nradar and camera towers, unmanned aerial vehicles, and detention space \nto hold some 27,500 daily on an annual basis. We have interior security \nprovisions. We have tough employer sanctions because we are structuring \na system where we can make a positive identification as to who is legal \nand who is illegal. This is an appropriate basis for imposing tough \nsanctions on employers if they hire illegal immigrants, because they \nare in a position to make a determination as to who is legal or who is \nillegal.\n  At the other end of the political spectrum, there are objections that \nthe\n\n[[Page S6220]]\n\nprogram is not sufficiently humanitarian, not sufficiently \ncompassionate, and does not sufficiently provide for family \nunification. If we are to handle the backlog of people who have been \nwaiting to come into this country with the existing requirements to \ngain citizenship, and if we are to deal with the millions of \nundocumented immigrants, we will have to have additional green cards. \nBut there will have to be limitations so we do not have what is \neuphemistically referred to as chain immigration.\n  We are working on a points system which we are trying to balance. It \nis very hard to satisfy all competing interests, to balance the demand \nfor Ph.D.s and highly skilled people with the desire to provide \nopportunities for people who are not highly skilled. Certain points are \nbeing given to recognize the family, to have as many family members and \nas much on family reunification as we can, within a balanced system.\n\n  The old adage that the devil is in the details is obviously present \nhere. This morning one group of Senators met at a little after 9; \nanother group of Senators met at 10:15. We are continuing the meetings \nas we try to come to grips and resolve these issues.\n  The whole immigration issue is another third rail in politics. Social \nSecurity has been described as the third rail of our political system. \nThere is no doubt that immigration is another third rail. It may \nsupplant Social Security as the third rail of the political system \nbecause, no matter what we do here, both ends of the political spectrum \nwill criticize us--criticize us for amnesty on one hand, criticize us \non the other end of the political spectrum for not being sufficiently \ncompassionate. Politically, it is a loser for those who are engaged in \nit. But we have a public duty to come to grips with this issue and to \nhave comprehensive immigration reform. We can do that and insist on \nhaving border patrols and employer sanctions before we work through the \nguest worker program. It is truly, as we are structuring it, a \ntemporary worker program, where people come to the United States for a \nperiod of time and go back to their native countries. It is a system \nwhere we are giving as much support and as much preference for families \nas we can on a balanced system, and as much to the high-skilled workers \nto balance off against the low-skilled workers.\n  The most important thing, as I see it, is to move ahead and \npersevere, to try to structure a bill which is now 380 pages long--it \nis in text, thanks to the dedicated work of the staff--and to present \nit on the floor of the Senate and have the Senate work its will. Aside \nfrom the political perils, the object is to restore the rule of law and \nto bring these 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants out of the \nshadows. The advantage to society generally is to eliminate this \nmassive underclass, this massive number of individuals who are in the \nshadows, and to structure a system where they will, at the outset, have \nvisas to stay here for as long as they like, so long as they comply \nwith our laws and get into the citizenship line at the rear. We are \nlooking to reestablish the rule of law and to avoid the anarchy which \nnow characterizes our immigration system.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6220-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6220-S6253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nbegin debate on the conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 21.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 3 p.m. shall be equally \ndivided between the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, and the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, or their designees.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all quorum \ncalls be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we bring to the floor the conference \nreport on the budget. It is a conference report that I believe is \nworthy of our support. Let me say why.\n  Under this budget plan, we will balance the budget in 5 years. In the \nfifth year, 2012, we will have, according to the projections, a $41 \nbillion surplus. This is after 6 years of deficit, and in an additional \n4 years, we will finally be returning to balance.\n  The budget resolution we bring to the floor will reduce spending as a \nshare of gross domestic product each and every year, from 20.5 percent \nin 2008 down to 18.9 percent in 2012. It is that spending discipline \nthat helps us reach balance in the fifth year. It also has the positive \neffect of bringing down the debt as a share of our gross domestic \nproduct in every year after 2010. This is gross debt. If we looked at \npublicly held debt, it will actually be bringing it down every year \nfrom 2009 on. So I believe this is a responsible budget that returns us \nto a fiscally responsible approach to our Nation's spending.\n  Some have said there is a big difference in spending between this \nbudget and the President's budget. We have put it on a chart to \nvisually compare over the 5 years the difference in spending in this \nproposal and what the President proposed.\n  As you can see, there is virtually no difference--virtually no \ndifference--in spending between this proposal and the President's \nspending proposal. Yes, it is slightly more spending, but this slight \naddition is going for veterans health care, to expand children's health \ncare, and to provide further investment in education. Those are the \nfundamental places where we have modest additions to spending.\n  As you can see, on a fair comparison basis, when you put the two \nspending lines together on the same axis, comparing apples to apples, \nyou see the difference in spending is quite modest.\n  On the revenue side, we have included a 1-year fix to the alternative \nminimum tax, the old millionaire's tax. It is rapidly becoming a \nmiddle-class tax trap. If we had not acted, over 23 million people \nwould be caught up by the alternative minimum tax in this next year. We \nhave avoided that, providing dramatic tax relief to those people.\n  We also extend the middle-class tax cuts in this proposal. That \nincludes continuation of marriage penalty relief, the child tax credit, \nand the 10-percent bracket. These provisions will benefit tens of \nmillions of the American taxpayers.\n  We also include estate tax reform. It is well known under the current \nestate tax law, we will go to a $3.5 million exemption per person in \n2009. Then there is no estate tax in 2010. Then we go back to an estate \ntax in 2011 that provides only $1 million of exemption per person or $2 \nmillion for a couple. Instead of having that anomalous situation, we \nwill continue providing a $3.5 million exemption per person or $7 \nmillion for a couple indexed for inflation. I think that makes common \nsense.\n  Now, we have heard from some there is a big tax increase in this \nbudget. There is no tax increase in this budget. Let me reemphasize \nthat. There is no assumption of a tax increase in this budget. I do not \nknow what I could say to be more clear.\n  Here, shown on this chart, is what the President said his budget \nwould produce in revenue over the 5 years. This is the President's own \nestimate of what his budget would produce. He said his 5-year budget \nwould produce $14.826 trillion of revenue over the 5 years. That is \naccording to the scoring by his own Office of Management and Budget.\n  Our budget produces $14.828 trillion of revenue over the 5-year \nperiod. There is virtually no difference between what the President \nclaimed his budget would produce in revenue and what our budget \nproduces in revenue.\n  Now, our friends on the other side will be swift to say: Wait a \nminute, Senator, you are using Office of Management and Budget \nestimates and CBO estimates, two different estimates. That is true. The \npoint I am making is the President said it was entirely reasonable to \nexpect to raise $14.826 trillion of revenue over this 5 years. That is \nhis own estimate of what his budget would produce. CBO says our budget \nwould produce $14.828 trillion--a $2 billion difference on a $15\n\n[[Page S6221]]\n\ntrillion base. That is statistically the same. If you put them both on \na CBO baseline--in other words, have estimates done for both the \nPresident's revenue and our revenue by the CBO--we have 2 percent more \nrevenue than the President--2 percent. We believe 2 percent can be \nachieved with no tax increase of any kind.\n  Let me reemphasize that. We believe, if you look at the CBO scoring \nthat says we have 2 percent more revenue than the President, that can \nbe achieved without any tax increase of any kind. I will explain why in \na moment. If you look at what is shown on this chart, this is a 5-year \nbudget. But all of us know we are going to write another budget next \nyear, so what matters is next year.\n  Here shown on the chart is the revenue line in our budget and the \nPresident's revenue line. You will notice they are identical. There is \nno difference--none--not a penny, not a dime. In 2009, there is \nvirtually no difference in the two.\n  So let's be serious. When somebody jumps up here and says this is the \nbiggest tax increase in history, the only way that is possibly true is \nif the President has proposed the biggest tax increase in history. \nBecause there is, for next year--and we will write another budget next \nyear--for next year, there is no difference in the revenue in our \nproposals.\n  How can it be we could get 2 percent more revenue under the CBO \nscoring than the President proposes without a tax increase? How is that \npossible? Well, first of all, we have the tax gap, which back in 2001 \nwas estimated to be $345 billion a year. I believe that tax gap now is \nin the range of $400 billion a year. That is the difference between \nwhat is owed and what is paid. I believe that is now $400 billion a \nyear or thereabouts. Over 5 years that would be more than $2 trillion--\nmoney that is owed that is not being paid. But that is not the only \nsource of revenue without a tax increase.\n\n  The second area of opportunity to get revenue with no tax increase is \nthe explosion and the abuse of offshore tax havens. I have shown this \nbuilding down in the Cayman Islands many times on the floor. This 5-\nstory building is the home to 12,748 companies. It is remarkable that \nall of those companies--12,748--are doing business in this little 5-\nstory building, but that is what they claim. Are they really doing \nbusiness down there? The only business being done out of this building \nis monkey business because what they are doing is engaging in an \nenormous tax scam. They claim they are doing business down there \nbecause they don't have any taxes down there. So how does it work? It \nis a giant shell game.\n  They have entities in the United States that they say are making no \nprofits, because they move the money offshore into these Cayman Islands \nsubsidiaries where there are no taxes, and all of a sudden they show \nenormous profits. Who is being fooled by this? Shame on us if we are \nbeing fooled. But currently, we are. I would suggest we close down this \nscam.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has said we are losing \n$100 billion a year through these offshore tax havens. Let me quote \nfrom their report from earlier this year:\n\n       Experts have estimated the total loss to the Treasury from \n     offshore tax havens alone approaches $100 billion a year, \n     including $40 to $70 billion from individuals and another $30 \n     billion from corporations engaging in offshore tax evasion. \n     Abusive tax shelters add tens of billions of dollars more.\n\n  Mr. President, $100 billion a year in tax havens, and tens of \nbillions more----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was listening to the description of \nthese offshore tax havens. Senator Conrad and I have worked on these \nissues for some while. It is interesting, with respect to the revenue \nstream into this country, that if we close down some of these tax \nshelters, the result would be increased revenues for the Federal \nGovernment and a requirement that those who benefit from the \nopportunities of being an American company, that they would start \npaying taxes.\n  Now, we have had example after example--the Senator used a chart \nshowing a building called the Ugland House, a quiet little 4-story \nbuilding on Church Street in the Cayman Islands which 12,748 \ncorporations call home. Of course none of them are home there. If you \ngo there--there is an enterprising reporter named David Evans who \nworked on that particular issue. He went there, and there is nobody \nthere. There are just some windows in a building, and it is quiet in \nthe lobby. Nothing is going on. This is a legal fiction created by \nlawyers for the purposes of allowing companies to avoid paying their \nU.S. taxes. It is not just that building, though. That building is an \nexample of the unbelievable abuse of the creation of massive offshore \ntax shelters. There are hundreds and hundreds of tax shelters.\n  I asked the Senator to yield to make a point. When I chaired the \nhearings on the Enron scandal, when I had Ken Lay come by and raise his \nhand and take an oath and then refuse to testify, and then Jeffrey \nSkilling, whom you couldn't hardly get to stop talking--he is now in \nprison. But the fact is, the Enron Corporation, in addition to all of \nthe other things--and part of that we understand now is a criminal \nenterprise; the evidence exists for that--in addition, they have \nhundreds of offshore entities. Why? For the purpose of avoiding taxes. \nThat is the purpose of offshore entities and tax havens.\n  No one runs to these countries like the Cayman Islands for the \npurposes of creating a big manufacturing plant and saying: That is \nwhere we want to move our business. It seems to me what they do is they \nhire a lawyer to create a legal fiction saying: We now want to be a \nresident of a tax-haven country because we don't like the obligation of \npaying taxes to the Federal Government.\n  I would just ask the Senator, isn't it the case that the Senator's \nproposition, and mine, the one I have introduced with legislation, is \nvery simple? It says: If you are going to be an American company, why \ndon't you simply decide to pay taxes to this country? If you move your \noperation somewhere else, we understand that. We don't support that--\nthere ought not be a tax incentive for it--but if you are creating a \nlegal fiction through lawyers telling us you are moving, we are going \nto treat you for tax purposes as if you were right here, an American \ncompany that is required to pay its appropriate taxes.\n  I know the Senator is probably also going to talk about the sale and \nleaseback of sewer systems and trolley cars and all the nonsense that \nis going on. I would just commend Senator Conrad for doing this, for \nfinally saying in this budget that we are going to shut all this down. \nThose of you who want to get the revenue in order to move us toward \nfiscal sanity here, if you really want to help us get the revenue, then \njoin us in shutting these tax scams down, shutting down these tax \nhavens.\n  I am sorry I took more time for this lengthy question, which turns \nout not to be much of a question after all, but I did want to point out \nthat I believe this is a very important part of this budget agreement, \nand I commend Senator Conrad and those who have put this together \nbecause this significantly benefits our country.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, in answering the question of \nthe Senator, I would say what you find is quite stunning. We went on \nthe Internet, I would say to my colleague--first of all, I thank him \nbecause the picture of this building down in the Cayman Islands came \nfrom him. I have used it repeatedly because it tells such a powerful \nstory: 12,748 companies that call this little building home. We know \nwhat is going on. It is a giant scam.\n  I would say to the Senator, we went on the Internet and we entered in \n``offshore tax planning.'' Do you know how many hits you get if you \nenter in that phrase? You get 1.2 million hits. Here is my favorite. If \nyou go online and you look at what is on the Internet----\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question at \nthis point in relationship to the Senator's question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the New York Times today was reviewing the \nfinancial statements of the candidates for President, and I noticed \nthat the former Senator from North Carolina who is running for \nPresident, John Edwards, received half a million dollars\n\n[[Page S6222]]\n\nin payments last year for his work with Fortress, a hedge fund. I also \nnoticed that the New York Times represents that the Fortress hedge fund \nis incorporated in the Cayman Islands, probably in that building to \nwhich you are referring.\n  I am just wondering, because the Senator asked who is being fooled \nhere, is it the position of the Senator from North Dakota that Senator \nEdwards has been fooled here or that he is fooling the American people?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Look, I do not know what the status of that particular \nhedge fund is. What I do know is these offshore tax havens are being \nabused by lots of different entities, not only corporations but wealthy \nindividuals. I don't have any evidence which would suggest that \nparticular hedge fund did anything improper, and certainly you can be \nengaged in business in the Cayman Islands and not be engaged in \nanything improper.\n  The point we are making is that in this particular building, there \nare 12,700 companies calling it home. But more than that, when you go \non the Internet--and by the way, we have yet to see the financial \nreports of some of the Republican candidates for President, some of \nwhom report they have net worth over $100 million. It will be \ninteresting to see their financial arrangements, and I hope the Senator \nwill be just as focused on any abuse that might be in their portfolios. \nThat will be very interesting.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that was a clever question from our \ncolleague from New Hampshire. I would observe that the discussion I \njust had about the Enron Corporation--I think the largest financial \nsupporter of the current occupant of the White House for his first run \nfor the Presidency--it was a corporation that had hundreds of offshore \ntax-haven subsidiaries. It is also the case that it is not new for us \nto try to shut these down. As we have tried to shut these down, it is \nnot new, either, to find that the current White House by and large \nopposes the legislation on the floor of the Senate to shut down these \ntax scams.\n  I hope that perhaps we can get some support to do what Senator Conrad \nand I and others believe ought to be done, to shut down these kinds of \ntax scams.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for a further \nquestion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I will be happy, when \nI have completed my presentation--the Senator has half the time, and I \nknow he will use it well. I hope he will give me the opportunity to \ncomplete my presentation, and then I am happy to answer all of his \nquestions.\n  Mr. President, when you look on the Internet--this is my favorite \none:\n\n       Live tax free and worldwide on a luxury yacht. Moving \n     offshore and living tax free just got easier.\n\n  That is the kind of scam which is going on that is costing the \nTreasury of the United States, according to our own Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, over $100 billion a year.\n  It doesn't stop there. This is a picture of a sewer system in Europe. \nWhat does a sewer system in Europe have to do with the budget of the \nUnited States? Well, as it turns out, it has a lot to do with it \nbecause this sewer system in Europe was actually purchased by wealthy \nU.S. investors, depreciated on their books for U.S. tax purposes, and \nthen leased back to the European city in which it is actually located. \nIt has no business purpose. There is only one purpose, and that purpose \nis to operate as a scam. This is the kind of thing which should be shut \ndown. Nobody can justify this. Nobody can defend this. That is what is \ngoing on.\n  So I believe the combination of closing the tax gap, just a tiny \nportion of it, combined with shutting down these offshore tax havens, \ncombined with shutting down these abusive tax shelters, could easily \nprovide the 2 percent of revenue we have that is over and above the \nPresident, according to a Congressional Budget Office score, with no \ntax increase to anyone.\n  The budget conference report we bring to the floor also funds a \nnumber of critically important priorities for the American people, \nincluding expanding health care coverage for children. When you look at \nthe comparison, the President has provided $2 billion for this purpose \nover the 5 years. We provide $50 billion so that there is the prospect \nof covering every child in America who is not otherwise covered with \nhealth insurance. That is good policy, it is a good investment, and it \nis morally right. We ought to ensure that every child in America has \nhealth care coverage. It is good policy because if you solve a health \ncare problem for a child, you get a return on that investment for their \nlifetime.\n  Another area that has been a priority in this budget is education. \nUnder this budget, we provide some $6 billion in this next year over \nand above what the President provided because we think education is the \nfuture. If we are not world class in education, we are not going to be \na world-class power. So we have provided that additional investment in \neducation.\n  The third area of initiative is in veterans health care. If there is \nany scandal that I think has troubled the American people more than \nwhat we saw at Walter Reed where heroes returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan have been subjected to subpar medical treatment, I don't \nknow what it is. I don't know of anything that has so angered so many \npeople, at least in my constituency. So we have adopted a budget here \nthat closely follows the independent budget which is put forward by the \nveterans organizations themselves which provides for $43.1 billion in \nfunding in the next fiscal year, compared to the President's $39.6 \nbillion.\n  To recap, the budget resolution we bring to the floor, the conference \nreport, puts the Nation back on a sound fiscal path. It balances by \n2012 with a $41 billion surplus in 2012. It reduces spending as a share \nof gross domestic product each and every year of the 5 years of the \nbudget. It reduces debt as a share of gross domestic product from 2010 \non. It adopts spending caps and restores a strong pay-go rule. What is \npay-go? Pay-go simply says that if you want to have more mandatory \nspending or more tax cuts, you can have them, but you have to pay for \nthem, and if you don't pay for them, you have to get a super-majority \nvote.\n  This budget also meets the Nation's priorities. It fully funds the \nPresident's defense and war cost requests. It rejects the President's \ncuts in certain key priority areas. It provides increases for \nchildren's health, for education, and for our veterans health care, an \narea in which the American people overwhelmingly want us to invest.\n  In addition, this budget resolution keeps taxes low. It extends \nspecifically the middle-class tax relief provisions, including marriage \npenalty relief, the child credit, and the 10-percent bracket. It \nprovides alternative minimum tax relief so that more and more middle-\nclass people don't get swept up in that tax. It provides for \nfundamental estate tax reform. It includes the deficit-neutral reserve \nfunds for additional tax relief and for the extension of other expiring \nprovisions. It includes no assumption of a tax increase.\n  This budget also prepares for the long term. It provides for program \nintegrity initiatives to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse in both \nMedicare and Social Security. It includes health information technology \nand comparative effectiveness reserve funds to address rising health \ncare costs. According to the Rand Corporation, widespread health \ninformation technology alone could save $81 billion a year. It also \nadopts a new budget point of order against long-term deficit increases.\n  I will conclude by saying this budget has specific proposals \naddressing our long-term fiscal challenge. It provides program \nintegrity initiatives to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse. It \nprovides new mandatory spending, and tax cuts must be paid for in the \npay-go provision. It provides that long-term deficit increase face a \npoint of order, a super-majority hurdle on the floor of the Senate. It \nprovides for the health information technology reserve fund. I have \nalready indicated that the Rand Corporation indicates that health \ninformation technology could save $81 billion a year. Finally, it \nincludes the comparative effectiveness reserve fund, so that we look at \nthe technologies and approaches being used across this country on how \nwe could save money by using the best practices in health care.\n\n[[Page S6223]]\n\n  We think this is a responsible budget, one that meets the needs of \nthe American people. We believe it merits our colleagues' support.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to thank my colleague, Senator \nGregg. I acknowledge that we have differences about this budget. That \nis healthy. That is the strength of our democracy, that we have a \ndebate and differences. But I wish to say that Senator Gregg has always \nconducted himself as a professional and has been extremely helpful as \nwe have gone through the process. He and his staff have cooperated with \nus closely, while they have disagreed very strongly with respect to \nsome of the conclusions we reached. I wish to acknowledge the way in \nwhich he and his staff have conducted themselves as we have gone \nthrough this difficult process. I thank him for the many courtesies he \nhas extended to us as we have gone through the budget resolution this \nyear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin by returning that appreciation \nto the Senator. Obviously, there are strong disagreements on philosophy \nand policy, the differences between the parties. The Senator from North \nDakota represents the party of tax-and-spend, and we represent the \nparty of fiscal responsibility. Those differences are clear. \nIndependent of those differences, the relationship is friendly, \ncourteous, and generally cooperative. I believe that if the entire \ninstitution functioned the way the Budget Committee functions, we would \nget a lot more done around here.\n  That being said, I must point out some differences. I am inclined to \nalmost use the--to paraphrase a quip made by, I think, Mark Twain, but \nit might have been Bill Buckley, who said:\n\n       I do not wish to insult the Senator's intelligence by \n     suggesting that he actually believes most of what he just \n     said.\n\n  The fact is that this budget, as proposed, is not a good one. It has \nin it the largest tax increase in history. It is a tax increase that is \nespecially unfortunate because it is going to take place in the context \nof a tax law that we finally got right around here, as shown by the \nrevenues flowing into the Federal Government, and the fact that present \ntax law is generating more revenues than, historically, the Federal \nGovernment has received and is doing it in a more progressive way than \nhas historically been done. High-income people are paying more than \nthey have historically paid, and low-income people are getting more \nback in the way of tax benefits than they have historically gotten.\n  This bill will basically repeal most of the major tax proposals put \nin place in the early part of this administration which generated this \neconomic recovery which has gone on for 22 months and has caused us to \nhave 7.4 million jobs created. In fact, the report just came out that \nthe jobs number fell another 5,000, so that we are literally under \n300,000 in jobs claims, which is a number that shows we are even \nessentially at full employment. As a nation, we are under 4.4 percent \nunemployment. The jobs being created are good jobs, and they are \ngenerating revenues to this Government, which has caused us to have a \nhuge burst in revenues, which has caused the deficit to come down. That \nis all going to be put at risk by the tax increases in this bill.\n  The tax increases in this bill are going to dramatically affect the \ncapital gains rate, the dividends rate, the child tax credit, the \neducation tax credit, the marriage tax penalty relief, and the middle-\nclass income tax rates. All of those things are in serious jeopardy \nand, in fact, will probably end up being repealed under this budget if \nit goes forward under the present structure. We will get into that in a \nsecond.\n  They have created this extremely complex trigger mechanism, which can \nbe and will be undermined by their own budget, should it go forward, \nand will make it impossible for the tax cuts to survive in this \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, $725 billion of tax increases are in this budget over \n5 years. That will be the largest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry, no question about that. In addition, the discretionary \nspending in the budget is huge--$205 billion of new discretionary \nspending over the President's request, which was very generous, with a \nsignificant increase in spending. It is ironic that, as this left the \nSenate, there was less spending than this--still a significant increase \nof $140 billion, I think, in spending above the President's request in \nthe discretionary spending. As it left the House, it was less than \nthis. I don't even think it was $200 billion. It comes back at $205 \nbillion. That is sort of like a microwave popcorn cooker, where you put \nit in the stove and put the House Democrats and the Senate Democrats in \ntogether, and it blows up into a great big huge spending package and a \ngreat big huge deficit--and tax package, too.\n\n  The debt goes up under this bill: $2.5 trillion of debt will be added \nto the famous ``wall of debt.'' For those of you who haven't seen the \nwall of debt, you will see it sometime, somewhere. It is coming. So \nthere is $2.5 trillion of new debt added.\n  Remember, on top of that, they are raiding the Social Security fund \nto the tune of a trillion dollars. Originally, when the budget left the \nSenate, at least the Social Security fund--under their projections, \nwhich are rosy scenarios, to say the least--wasn't going to be raided. \nThere was going to be an on-balance budget. But now, as it comes back \nagain from this tax-and-spend microwave called the Senate Democrat/\nHouse Democrat budget conference, which we were not included in, there \nis no on-budget surplus. Everything comes out of the Social Security \nfund. All this debt is added to our children's backs, and it is going \nto have to be paid for by our children.\n  In addition, there is absolutely no attempt to address the \nentitlement crisis we are facing. The fact that our children and our \nchildren's children are going to have to pay a cost they simply will \nnot be able to afford, in the area of maintaining the benefit \nstructure, because of the retirement of the baby boom generation and \nthe fact that costs will actually exceed 20 to 25 percent of gross \nnational product, just for the programs of Social Security, Medicare, \nand Medicaid--and there is no attempt to rein that coming fiscal \nmeltdown in or to address it--that is totally irresponsible.\n  In fact, not only is there no attempt to address the coming fiscal \nmeltdown as a result of the entitlement spending, there is actually a \nhuge exercise in gamesmanship in this budget, which will allow the HELP \nCommittee, under the leadership of Senator Kennedy, to dramatically \nexpand entitlement spending. Instead of reining in entitlement \nspending, under this budget there is a proposal to use reconciliation, \nwhich is supposed to reduce the deficit on the spending side of the \nledger, to expand spending and the size of the Federal Government, grow \nthe Government.\n  Why do they do that? Because they only need 51 votes under \nreconciliation. They could not get that proposal through here. It would \nbe subject to a filibuster under the regular order. So they used \nreconciliation, which should limit the size of government, to expand \ngovernment dramatically. That is a very cynical act, in my opinion, \nbecause that was never the purpose of the budget. In fact, there are \nsome very good quotes from the chairman of the committee reflecting \nthat exact position--the position I just related.\n  That brings me back to that statement of Mark Twain--or it could have \nbeen Bill Buckley--who said, ``I will not insult the Senator's \nintelligence by suggesting that he actually believes everything he just \nsaid,'' because he didn't believe it, because what he said was the \nopposite, that reconciliation should not be used the way it is being \nused in this bill.\n  The Senator from North Dakota made a couple other statements. I think \nthey were on point when made, but the budget does not reflect these \nstatements. He said we need to be tough on spending. Yet, in this \nbudget, there are zero cuts in spending. In fact, this $205 billion \nexpansion in discretionary spending, entitlement spending, will expand \nunder the reconciliation instruction also, and under the reserve funds, \nthe Government will grow dramatically as a percentage of gross national \nproduct. We will bear that burden.\n  The Senator said:\n\n       I am prepared to get savings out of long-term entitlement \n     programs.\n\n\n[[Page S6224]]\n\n\n  But there are no savings. There was a representation that they were \ngoing to do $15 billion in savings, but that representation was a \nlittle incomplete because the rest of that should have said: But we are \ngoing to spend $50 billion. So there are actually no savings. I think \nit ended up being $30 billion, but it is a net loss in the entitlement \naccounts, coupled with this reconciliation exercise, which could be as \nhigh as a $30 billion to $40 billion increase.\n  He also said:\n\n       Here is where we are headed: Debt is up, up, and away.\n\n  Yes, it is, under this budget. That was a correct statement. It is \nup, up, and away by $2.5 trillion of new debt, which our generation \npasses on to the next generation, which is totally inappropriate and \nunfair.\n  He said:\n\n       I believe, first of all, we need more revenue.\n\n  He at least stuck to that statement. There is $736 billion of new \ntaxes in this bill. What is the practical effect of a $736 billion tax \nincrease? Remember, as I outlined before, we have now had 22 \nconsecutive quarters of economic growth--actually, 23 now. That is \npretty darn good. We have added 7.8 million new jobs. That is people \nbeing put to work. How did that happen? It happened, in large part, \nbecause we had an economy that was growing as a result of a tax policy \nthat said to people in America: Go out, invest, take risks, be \nentrepreneurs, create jobs, and we are going to give you a reasonable \nreturn on the money you have invested. This is just called common sense \nin human nature. If you tax people at a rate that they appreciate and \nis fair, they are going to be willing to take a risk with their money, \ngo out and invest it and create jobs. If you tax them at a rate they \ndon't think is fair, they invest in tax shelters and inefficiently use \ntheir money, and as a result, the Government gets less and the economy \ndoesn't grow as much. In fact, the growth in Federal revenues over the \nlast few years has exceeded projections and has been dramatically \nhigher.\n  The growth in Federal revenues has been in the last 3 years the \nhighest rate of growth in the history of our country and has \nrepresented huge amounts of revenue coming into the Federal \nGovernment--huge amounts of revenue.\n  This revenue, of course, has allowed us to reduce the deficit from \nwhat was projected to be $450 billion a couple of years ago, to now \nprobably falling below $200 billion or probably less than 1 percent of \nthe gross national product, or somewhere in that range. It is, in large \npart, a function of two events: One, the fact these revenues have \njumped so high and, two, this administration has been very aggressive \nin controlling nondefense discretionary spending.\n  But under this proposal that has been brought forward today by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, the tax policies which have \ngenerated this economic expansion are targeted for extinction. The \ncapital gains rate will jump back to almost 30 percent, 35 percent \npotentially; dividend rates will jump to 25, 32, 35 percent.\n  The bottom rate for most taxpayers who are in the low-income end of \nthe economic scale will be increased, and there will be created a huge \ndisincentive for people to be productive in our society. We will go \nback to the days when it didn't make a whole lot of sense to go out \nthere and take that risk because the Government was going to take so \nmuch of your money.\n  We hear a lot on the other side of the aisle: These tax cuts \ndisproportionately benefit the wealthy in America. I think it is \nimportant to remember this: That under the new tax law, or the tax law \nunder which we are now functioning, which is generating all these huge \nrevenues, high-income people pay a larger percentage of the general \nburden of income taxes than they did under the Clinton years. The top \n20 percent of people paying income taxes is paying 85 percent. Eighty-\nfive percent of the income tax burden is borne by the top 20 percent. \nUnder the Clinton years, that same income bracket bore 81 percent of \nthe tax burden, and the lower end of our economy, people who don't make \nquite so much money or don't make a great deal of money, the bottom 40 \npercent does not pay any income taxes actually on balance. They \nactually get money back under the earned-income tax credit, and today \nthey are getting twice as much back as they did under the Clinton \nyears.\n  It is interesting to note, in fact, that in that group, the low-\nincome household receives far more in Government benefits than they \never pay in taxes. That is an interesting fact which should be pointed \nout, as well as the fact that on the tax side of the ledger, they get \nmore money back; whereas, the higher income individual, of course, pays \na lot more into the Federal Government than they ever get back from the \nFederal Government, and that is what this chart shows.\n  If your income is up to $23,000, you are going to get about $31,000. \nIf your income is over $65,000, you are going to pay about $50,000. It \nis a very interesting fact that when you take not only the tax burden \nto Americans but the benefits which Americans receive, low-income \nAmericans are, under this Government, under the Bush administration, \ngetting a huge benefit from the Government in the area of tax benefits \nand also benefits which are structured on the basis of income, and \nhigh-income Americans are paying a significant amount more for the cost \nof the Government.\n  So we have a tax structure which is extremely progressive and which \nis much more progressive than under the Clinton years. In addition, \nthis budget, which has such antipathy toward productive Americans, \nwhich essentially says to productive Americans, we don't like you, we \nwant to tax you some more, in trying to get at those folks who the \nother side of the aisle thinks are such scofflaws because they make \nmoney and have income and actually pay 85 percent of the burden of \nincome taxes in this country, in trying to get at those folks by \nraising the dividend tax and raising the capital gains tax, which is \nthe primary target of the other side of the aisle, they are actually \nsignificantly impacting low-income seniors, or seniors generally, and \nthis should be common sense because most seniors receive income, other \nthan Social Security, that is dividend based because they are not \nworking any longer.\n  So when the other side of the aisle decides they want to get people \nwho have dividend income, which is exactly what this budget proposes--\nthey are going to get those folks because they are the enemy--whom they \nare getting, for the most part, are senior citizens. Fifty-one percent \nof American seniors have dividend income. So when they decide to double \nor triple the dividend tax or 2\\1/2\\ times increase it, which is what \nthis bill will do, the people who are going to be impacted are 50 \npercent of the seniors.\n  In the area of capital gains, it is also interesting that the same is \ntrue: When they decide to get people who make money by selling assets, \nall those wealthy small businessmen, you know, the guy who all his life \nworked to build a restaurant, a small company or maybe a gas \nstation, spent his whole life working to get that business up to a \nlevel where it had some asset value, and then when he or she retires, \nthey are not going to run it any longer, they are going to sell it, \ntake those revenues and they are going to use it to live on in their \nretirement years or maybe to help their children out, that evil person \nwho has done that in our society, as the other side of the aisle views \nthat person, they are going to get them by doubling the capital gains \nrate.\n\n  Whom do they get? They get people who are 65 to 74 years old. Thirty \npercent of those people have capital gains income. People, as they \nstart to age into the retirement years, start to generate capital gains \nincome, and it is logical, when you get to that age, you are going to \nwant to sell those assets which you probably built with the hard sweat \nof yourself and your family--a farm or a restaurant or a small \ncompany--so that you can take those assets and live on them in \nretirement and live a good retirement life or simply help out your \nchildren as they move forward in their life.\n  So when they get those people, whom are they getting? They are \ngetting retirement people with this proposal. They are raising their \ntaxes.\n  We are going to hear some of this ``Wizard of Oz'' language about, \nwell, we really don't raise those taxes, we really don't. There is $180 \nbillion of adjustment that we are going to be able to put toward \ncapital gains or something else.\n\n[[Page S6225]]\n\n  It is a fraudulent statement that it is almost not worth responding \nto. But let me move to the factual response, which is this: There is no \ncapacity in this budget to institute any significant attempt to \ncontinue or to make permanent dividends and capital gains rates. None. \nIn fact, that $180 billion, were it even to appear, which it will not \nunder this budget--a point I will get to in a second--would benefit \nmiscellaneous deductions which are good and right and appropriate but \nactually don't help the economy all that much because mostly they are \nsocially driven. They involve the marriage tax penalty. They involve \nchildren's tax credits, tuition tax credits. They are not like economic \ndrivers, such as dividend rates and capital gains rates which translate \nimmediately into better investment of funds. What they have said is: We \nwill give you that $180 billion if certain events occur in the third \nand fourth year of this budget.\n  This is a real Rube Goldberg exercise. It is one of those things \nwhere you have 16 different moving parts, and you know none of them are \ngoing to work, but you claim they are going to work so you can claim \nyou are actually going to do something you know is never going to \noccur. That is exactly what this is all about.\n  For this $180 billion to kick in, the Democratic tax trigger requires \nthe following: A budget resolution--we have the Rube Goldberg chart hot \noff the press. That is one of our better charts. It took a little bit \nof thought on this one. In order to get this tax cut or any part of it, \nthe following has to happen: There has to be a budget resolution \npromising middle-class tax cuts. That is here. We have that. We are \ngoing to give you the promise; we are just not going to give them to \nyou. The tax-writing committee marks up the legislation, but it stalls. \nWhy does it stall? Because the way this thing works is there have to be \noffsets that can be found to satisfy the tax cuts, but if the Congress \ncontinues to spend money, that undermines the capacity to reach the \nfactual obligation which would create the tax cuts.\n  So you can basically spend your way out of doing the tax cuts, which \nis exactly what the budget proposes. It says it promises the tax cuts \nand then it proposes $205 billion of new spending in the discretionary \naccounts and proposes a huge expansion of spending in the entitlement \naccounts. So it essentially guarantees that the trigger, which \nallegedly is in place, can't occur to generate the tax cuts because the \nspending eats away at the outyear surpluses and, of course, that leads \nto the business community getting a little skittish. It leads to the \ninvestors getting a little skittish. It leads to the economy starting \nto contract, which leads to a slower rate of growth, which leads to \nless tax revenues, which leads to--surprise--they are not going to give \nyou the tax cuts. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is a trigger \nthat is guaranteed that when it is pulled, nothing happens. It is \nsimilar to a Rube Goldberg event.\n  There was some language which I loved--I have to see if I can find \nit--that describes this in the budget resolution. It is fascinating. It \nis so good it can't be not mentioned here. It defines how we get to \nthis tax cut. I will find it or my crack staff will. They so want to \ndestroy the ability to do this tax cut that even in the language of the \nbudget itself they put in obfuscating language that is filled with \nobfuscation, that you know on the basis of it no one takes seriously \nthe idea of doing the tax cuts. That is reasonable because let's face \nit, that is not the philosophy of the party of the other side of the \naisle. The party of the other side of the aisle has shown itself \nhistorically to be a party to believe that it is not your money. It \nisn't your money. It is their money. You haven't figured out yet that \nyou earned it, and you think you should be able to spend it. You \nhaven't figured out yet that they think you earned it for them and that \nthe Government should be able to spend it. That has been the philosophy \nof this party for a long time. It doesn't change over the years very \nmuch.\n  Now that they are back in a position of some responsibility--\nconsiderable responsibility; they are the party of both the Senate and \nthe House--they have the capacity to execute that strategy which is: We \nwill take your money and we will spend it on what we think is important \nbecause we are smarter than you, we know better what you need and, \ntherefore, it shouldn't be your money in the first place because you \nearned it, the Government has a right to it, and the Government should \nmake a decision as to how best to handle it.\n  So it should not come as a surprise to anyone that this budget is \nreplete with new spending and dramatic expansions in taxes.\n  I did find--or my crack staff found it, as they always do--the \nlanguage which I had seen in the conference report, which is so \ninteresting it has to be read for the record. This is how this trigger \nworks. It is written similar to a reserve trust fund, which is, on its \nface, a shell event. Almost all these trust funds are shell events. By \nthe way, these trust funds are structured so that we start out with 5 \nor 6, now we have 23 of them.\n  I am sorry, reserve, not a trust fund. A reserve fund, not a trust \nfund. I used the wrong term. A very inappropriate term. A reverse \nreserve fund.\n  This is the way it works. In the House, the chairman of the House \nBudget Committee will increase the revenue aggregate--in other words, \nwill take away tax cut revenue--if he determines the future tax relief \nlegislation--and this is the language I love--does not contain a \nprovision consistent with the provisions set forth in the joint \nstatement of the managers.\n  What does the joint statement of the managers say? The statement of \nthe managers says that the future tax relief legislation must contain a \nprovision that makes the tax relief contingent on OMB's projection of a \nsurplus. The second trigger would turn off the tax cuts unless a \nminimum surplus materialized, and the tax cuts can be $179.8 billion or \n80 percent of the projected surplus, whichever is less.\n  Rube Goldberg couldn't have written this language any better. I mean, \nthis language is designed to fail. It is designed to make sure the \nGovernment gets that money; that you don't get to keep it, and the \nGovernment makes the decision as to where it is spent. It is \nunfortunate.\n  We also have in this budget, regrettably, a total failure to address \nthe entitlement accounts. Entitlement accounts are by far the most \nserious issue we have as a government and as a people, beyond the \nthreat of being attacked by Islamic extremists with weapons of mass \ndestruction. Why do I say that? That sounds like a statement that is a \nlittle over the top. Well, it is not. The simple fact is that as the \nbaby boom generation retires, and it is going to retire--we exist; \nthere are 80 million of us--we are going to double the size of the \nnumber of retirees in this country.\n  As I have said before on this floor, and I know the Senator from \nNorth Dakota agrees with me, this system is not structured to handle \nthe retirement of a generation that is that large. The whole concept of \nour system of retirement benefits was that there would be a pyramid. \nThere would always be many more people who paid into it than took out \nof it. That was the genius of Franklin Roosevelt when he created the \nSocial Security System. In fact, when it started, there were 12 people \npaying in for every person taking out in 1950. Today, there are three \nand a half people paying in for every one taking out. By the time the \nbaby boom generation is in full retirement, we will have two people \npaying in for every one person taking out.\n  The practical effect of that will be a meltdown of our system, and \nthis chart reflects that. I have shown this before because I think this \nis probably the most serious issue which we face, beyond the issue of \nthe threat of Islamic fundamentalism and the terrorist threat they \nrepresent.\n  Three accounts--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--by the \nmiddle of the period 2020, when the full force of the baby boom \nretirement is in place, those three programs will absorb 20 percent of \ngross national product. Twenty percent of gross national product is \nwhat the Federal Government spends today. Another way to state this is \nthat at that time the Federal Government will have no money left over \nfor national defense, education, laying out roads or environmental \nprotection. All the money will have to go to pay for those three \nprograms.\n  But it doesn't stop there. The number continues to go up at a rate \nwhich is\n\n[[Page S6226]]\n\nincredible, and which is totally unsustainable, until it hits about 27, \n28 percent of gross national product for those three programs by about \n2035. Now, this is a situation which will mean--and it is going to \noccur--which will mean, because it is going to occur, that our children \nand our children's children--these pages down here, who do such a great \njob and who are so personable and put up with our foolishness around \nhere sometimes--they are going to have to pay a burden in taxes in \norder to support our generation. That will make it virtually impossible \nfor them to have as high a quality of life as we have had in our \ngeneration. They would not be able to buy that home or put their \nchildren through college or have the enjoyment of a lifestyle that \ncontains discretionary funds because those funds will have to be spent, \nthrough taxes, to support these programs. These three programs.\n  Regrettably, this budget does nothing--zero--to address this looming \ncrisis. It is an act that I think fails our obligations as a \ngeneration. We are the governance party now. In the sense that most of \nus in this room who serve here today are baby boom members--there are \nsome who aren't--it is inappropriate for us as a generation not to try \nto solve a problem which we are going to create for our children and \nour grandchildren. Yet this budget does nothing to do that. In fact, it \naggravates it by suddenly creating this new concept that you can use \nreconciliation to expand and grow the size of Government dramatically, \nwhich is exactly what it does, which is unfortunate, and which is a \nterrible precedent for us as a government to pursue.\n\n  There was a proposal that came from the administration which I \nthought was reasonable and which would have reduced the outyear \nMedicare liability--the unfunded liability--by almost 25 percent. It \nwould not have affected recipients except for those at the high end \nbecause all it did was that it impacted recipients, as was suggested, \nsuch as Warren Buffett or retired Senators, for example, who could and \nshould pay a fair share of the burden of their cost of Medicare Part D.\n  Under Medicare Part D today, which is the drug program, if you are \nretired, it doesn't matter how wealthy you are, you still get the \nbenefit fully subsidized by working Americans. So that a person who is \nworking as a waitress or on an industrial line somewhere, or in a gas \nstation, that person's taxes are subsidizing Warren Buffett's drug \nbenefit, assuming he takes advantage of Part D, which being a \nconservative individual, I think he probably does, although I don't \nknow whether he does. A retired Senator's drug benefit is subsidized by \na working American today.\n  Well, that is wrong. I mean, obviously, if you have that type of \nincome--and what the President suggested was that people who have over \n$80,000 of individual income or $160,000 of joint income, which is a \nlot of money--you should have to pay the full cost of your drug \nbenefit, or at least a high percentage of the cost of your drug \nbenefit. That was rejected. It was rejected by the other side of the \naisle.\n  What a small step. That would have translated into a very significant \nsavings in the long run, which was totally reasonable, but which was \nsimply not pursued or brought to the table by the other side of the \naisle. I mean, if they are going to do reconciliation instructions, \nwhich expands programs in this country dramatically, which is what this \nbill does, they ought to at least, on reconciliation, say to the \nFinance Committee, make former Senators pay the full cost of the drug \nbenefit and people with incomes of over $160,000, or a large percentage \nof the cost of the drug benefit. But they didn't. They passed \ncompletely on that opportunity, even though it was a totally reasonable \nopportunity and something that should be done.\n  It should be done soon because the problem is--and it reminds me of \nthat Fram oil filter ad of 10 years ago or so, which said: You can pay \nme now or you can pay me later. Well, the ``later'' is going to \nbankrupt our children and our children's children. Paying today, fixing \nthis problem today, translates into long-term huge savings, and it is \ncertainly something that should be done. But it was passed on in this \nbudget.\n  So what is the practical effect of this budget? It is pretty simple. \nIt is a big-spending, big-taxing, classic budget that comes from the \nleft. It increases taxes by $730 billion, it increases discretionary \nspending by $205 billion, it raises the Social Security fund to the \ntune of a $1 trillion, it increases the debt of the Federal Government \nby $2.5 trillion, it dramatically expands the obligation which we are \npassing on to our children and which our children will have to pay, it \neliminates some tax cuts which have caused this economy to grow and be \nvibrant and which have created jobs and generated huge revenues to the \nFederal Government, and it fails to even a little bit--by asking former \nSenators and wealthy Americans to pay the cost of their drug benefit--\nto address the looming crisis which we face as a nation, which is the \nMedicare, Social Security burden which we are going to pass on to our \nchildren.\n  It is not a budget which I would recommend, though I do appreciate \nthe Senator from North Dakota and his energy in pursuing it.\n  There is one other small point, in the area of fiscal discipline, \nwhere we hear all this talk of pay-go. They shouldn't call this pay-go. \nThey should call this ``Swiss cheese go'' because it is targeted to \npick up the things they do not like, such as tax cuts. But the things \nthey like, they basically exempt from it, such as agricultural \nentitlement spending. So it is a choose-the-things-you-like pay-go, or \nchoose-the-things-you-don't-like pay-go. That enforcement mechanism is \na nice term--it is a term of motherhood--but it is not going to have \nmuch discipline on the spending side of the ledger.\n  In addition, there are no caps in the outyears. For some reason, even \nat these very high spending numbers, which are egregious in their \nexcess, they have put no caps in for 2009 or 2010. They have them in \nthere for 2008 but not beyond that. They have expanded advanced \nappropriations, which is a way to basically get around caps to begin \nwith, over what they have traditionally been.\n  I understand the President has sent up a letter, or his OMB Director \nhas, and it says they are going to try to discipline the fiscal process \nthrough using the veto on appropriations bills. But we know the \nPresident can also be put in an untenable position because they can \nroll all these appropriations into the Defense bill and make it \nvirtually impossible for the President to aggressively and effectively \nuse the veto. It shouldn't be up to the President to discipline this \nplace. We should do it.\n  There also should be effective points of order retained and carried \nout. In fact, the pay-go point of order is so neutralized they decided \nthey wouldn't do it year by year. They decided to do a 5-year \ncalculation of pay-go. This is all inside politics around here, or \ninside substance, but the practical effect of that is you can take \ncredit for something you think is going to take effect in the outyears, \nwhen you know that 5-year scoring is sometimes a little sketchy. So you \ndo spending this year with the claim that you are going to save in 5 \nyears, and you can claim you have avoided pay-go. It is a way to game \npay-go on the spending side of the ledger.\n  They basically have eviscerated a whole series of what are important \nspending restraints around here, or at least they have skewed them in a \nway that makes spending more capable of occurring and, of course, tax \ncuts will be aggressively disciplined so they can't occur. Because, \nafter all, it is not your money. It is their money. You have to always \nremember that.\n  This budget is based on the basic theme that it is not your money, it \nis the Government's money, and we deign, we deign as a Congress, to \nallow you to keep some percentage of what you earn. But most of what \nyou earn we want, and we are going to spend it. This budget does it \nvery well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I detect the Senator was blushing a bit \nwhen he suggested at the beginning of his statement that his party is \nthe party of fiscal responsibility. Wow. That is breathtaking. Their \nparty is the party of fiscal responsibility?\n  Let us look at what has happened on their watch when they controlled \neverything. They controlled the House, they controlled the Senate, they \ncontrolled the White House. Here is what happened to the debt on their \nwatch.\n\n[[Page S6227]]\n\n  They have built a wall of debt that is going to take us a generation \nto recover from. When this President came to office, at the end of his \nfirst year--we won't hold him responsible for the first year, although \nhe inherited balanced budgets--the gross debt of the United States \nstood at $5.8 trillion. At the end of this year, it is going to be $9 \ntrillion. So they have run up the debt $3 trillion in 5 years. If the \nPresident's plan is followed, in the next 5 years they are going to run \nit up to $12 trillion.\n  Their claim that they have been fiscally responsible is unfortunately \ncontradicted by the facts. They talk about the performance of the \neconomy. Let's look at the performance of the economy.\n  We have looked at what happened in this recovery compared to the nine \nprevious recoveries, major recoveries since World War II. Here is what \nyou find. Under this recovery we are running, on revenues, $127 billion \nshort of the typical recovery since World War II.\n  On job creation, in the first 75 months, the previous administration, \nthe Clinton administration, created 18.7 million jobs. In this \nadministration for the same period, 5.2 million. The Clinton \nadministration produced three times as many jobs.\n  On job creation compared to the nine previous recoveries since World \nWar II, they are 7 million private sector jobs short of what has \nhappened in the typical recovery.\n  On business investment, again, compared to the nine recoveries since \nWorld War II, they are 69 percent below the typical recovery since \nWorld War II.\n  When he talks about this burst of revenue under their fiscal \nmanagement, you will notice that all his charts start in the year 2004. \nThey forgot about 2001, when they were in charge; 2002, when they were \nin charge; 2003, when they were in charge. In fact, if you look back on \nthe revenue of the United States, here is what you see. Tell the \nAmerican people the whole story, not just the bits and pieces they talk \nabout. Back in 2000, the revenue base of the United States was just \nover 2 trillion dollars. It has taken us until last year, it has taken \nus 6 years to get back to the real revenue base this country had in \n2000.\n  Let's look at their record. The simple fact is, they increased \nspending--and they controlled every dime that was spent here. They \nincreased spending by more than 40 percent. They stagnated the revenue \nbase. The result was an explosion of debt. That is their record, and it \nis indelibly etched in the history of the country. Unfortunately, we \nare going to pay a long time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, regarding the first chart the Senator \nused, which showed the steps of additional debt, I was intrigued, as I \nwas walking through the Chamber, to hear our colleague from New \nHampshire say, ``This is your money.'' I understand the origin of that \ncomment. The implication is we don't have to fund schools and roads and \nlaw enforcement and defense, and so on.\n  We all have some responsibility to the country, so part of the money \nhas to go to the Federal Government or State governments to pay for \nthat. But when he says, ``This is your money,'' should he not also, \nwhen you hold up that chart, say to the American people: This is your \ndebt? Isn't it the case that in the years in which they ratcheted up \nthat debt by spending money and not asking for the revenue for it, they \nare saying to the American people: We will load you up with some debt, \nand by the way, this is your debt. You pay it later. We will probably \nbe done, but you pay it later. Shouldn't that be the second verse to \nthat song?\n  Mr. CONRAD. What they should say is they have become the party of \nborrow and spend--because they spent the money. They increased spending \nmore than 40 percent, but they didn't pay for their spending. Instead, \nthey put it on the charge card, and they have run up the debt in a way \nthat is unprecedented in American history.\n  They will have doubled the debt of the country and doubled foreign \nholdings of our debt. I have another chart that shows it took 224 years \nand 42 Presidents to run up $1 trillion of U.S. debt held abroad. This \nPresident has more than doubled that amount in 6 years.\n  That is the record. They can't run away from it because they own it.\n  When they say there is this huge tax increase--please. This is what \nthe President said he was going to raise in taxes, $14.826 trillion. \nHere is what we raise, $14.828 trillion--virtually no difference.\n  That is what the President said his budget would raise. CBO has a \nlittle different take on it, the Congressional Budget Office. They show \na difference, over the 5 years, of 2 percent; that we have 2 percent \nmore money than they are proposing. The important thing about this \nbudget--we all know we are going to write another budget next year--is \nwhat is the difference for revenue this year between our budget and the \nPresident's budget. Do you know what it is? Zero--nothing. No \ndifference.\n  Where is this big world-class tax increase they are talking about? \nYou certainly can't find it in the budget.\n  When he talks about spending, here is what has happened to the \nspending under our budget. They are the ones who ran up the spending, \nincreased it 40 percent. We are talking about spending as a share of \ngross domestic product, down each and every year under this budget; \nfrom 20.5 percent of GDP in 2008 down to 18.9 percent of GDP in 2012.\n  We are turning the corner on debt. They have had it explode on their \nwatch. We are turning the corner and starting to take debt down as a \nshare of GDP.\n  I heard a lot of talk about this big increase in spending. Where are \nthe increases that are in our budget? First of all, we increase the \nfunding for veterans health care by $6.7 billion over last year. I am \nproud of it because we are going to keep the promise that was made to \nour Nation's veterans that they were going to receive quality health \ncare. We have seen the scandal of the veterans being mistreated at \nWalter Reed under this administration, on their watch, when they were \nin charge. We are going to fix the problems in veterans health care by \nputting money where the speeches are.\n\n  On education and training, we increase by $3.6 billion because we \nunderstand that investment in our kids' education ought to be a top \npriority.\n  On justice and law enforcement, we add $3 billion because we are not \ngoing to cut the COPS program 94 percent and take police off the street \nwhen those additional 100,000 cops all across America have helped us \nreduce rates of crime. The President inexplicably says cut the COPS \nprogram 94 percent. We have rejected that proposal. We say keep the \npolice on the street. Let's keep our streets safe.\n  On health care, we can begin to ensure the children of America, \nprovide them with health insurance.\n  When we look at the reasons for the increases in spending under the \nbudget resolution, 34 percent is because of defense and war cost; 25 \npercent is because of Social Security and Medicare. That is no change \nthat we have made. It is simply the increased cost of those programs.\n  We also have a 7-percent increase in veterans' benefits and services, \nto take care of veterans health care.\n  Net interest up 10 percent. That is nothing we did. That is the debt \nthat this President has run up. We have to pay the bill.\n  When they talk about this big increase in spending, do you know what \nit is? It is 2.6 percent. We have added 2.6 percent over the baseline \nto address veterans health care, to address the Nation's needs in \neducation and health care of our kids. That is exactly what the \nAmerican people expect and want us to do.\n  He says the tax cut will never come about. We have the middle-class \ntax cuts and estate tax reform in this proposal. He says none of it \nwill ever happen because of the trigger. The way the trigger works, the \nOffice of Management and Budget, controlled by the President, tells us \nwhat they expect the surplus to be in 2012. We can only use 80 percent \nof it for tax cuts. That is the way the trigger works.\n  Under the current scoring by OMB, there is sufficient room, as this \nchart shows, to fund all the tax cuts that are in this budget, all the \nmiddle-class tax cuts and the estate tax reform. Under current Office \nof Management and\n\n[[Page S6228]]\n\nBudget scoring, if you take 80 percent of their projected surplus in \n2012, their projected surplus, or 80 percent of it, in 2012 is $232 \nbillion. The cost of the tax cuts is $180 billion. We can fund the tax \ncuts that are provided here, that go to hard-working, middle-class \nfamilies, exactly where they ought to go.\n  He says we are raiding Social Security. He forgot how we got into \nthis position. We got into this position because this President chose \nto provide tax cuts to the wealthiest among us instead of protecting \nSocial Security. Under the President's plan, he is going to take, from \n2008 to 2017, $2.5 trillion of Social Security funds to use it to pay \nother bills.\n  Let me say this. If anybody tried this in the private sector, what \nthe President is doing, they would be on their way to a Federal \ninstitution, but it would not be the Congress of the United States, it \nwould not be the White House, they would be on their way to the ``big \nhouse.'' That is a violation of Federal law.\n  But, unfortunately, they have dug the hole so deep it is going to \ntake us time to dig out of it. That is exactly what we have done under \nthis budget because, unlike them, we have balanced the budget by 2012. \nUnlike the President, who even now has not balanced the budget by \n2012--under his proposal, we would still be $30 billion in the red by \n2012. We balance the budget by 2012 and have a $41 billion surplus. \nThat is a real American value, paying your bills.\n  When they say their tax relief has somehow magically benefitted the \nmiddle class at the expense of the most wealthy among us--whoa, there \nis a whopper. Here is what happened. The millionaires of our society--\nand I have respect for those who have succeeded. I applaud them. I am \ndelighted at their success. I hope everybody is financially successful.\n  But when they somehow say the middle class has been the ones who have \ngained by their tax policy and not those at the highest end of the \nincome ladder, come on. I don't know whom they think they are fooling \nwith that one. Here are the facts. This is according to the Urban-\nBrookings Tax Policy Center. Those earning more than $1 million in \n2006--this is not a projection, this is what happened in 2006--those \nearning over $1 million a year got, on average, a tax cut of $118,000. \nThose earning between $100,000 to $200,000 got $3,700 dollars. Those \nearning less than $100,000 got less than $700. Please. There is no \nquestion who are the primary beneficiaries of these tax cuts. It has \noverwhelmingly gone to the wealthiest among us.\n  I am not being critical of the wealthy. I absolutely applaud their \nsuccess. One of the great things about America is if you work hard and \nyou are inventive and entrepreneurial, you can succeed. That is a great \nthing about America. We want to preserve it. One of the ways we \npreserve it is to pay our bills and quit running up the debt and quit \nrunning these massive deficits. That is why we worked hard to balance \nthis budget by 2012. The President, even now, has not presented a plan \nthat balances by 2012.\n  I have already talked about the things that are done within the long \nterm. We have these reserve funds that were in our budget. But let's \nreflect--our friends on the other side, they criticize reserve funds. \nHere are all the reserve funds they had in their budget, reserve fund \nafter reserve fund, and they criticize the ones that are in our budget? \nPlease. That is the pot calling the kettle black.\n  Finally, with respect to the long term, I have said repeatedly, this \nis one place where Senator Gregg and I entirely agree. We have to \ntackle the long-term entitlement challenges--absolutely. The only way \nthat is going to happen is bipartisan agreement. Neither party can \ntackle the long-term challenges on their own.\n  This is a 5-year budget resolution. Our long-term entitlement plan \nproblems are 10- and 15-year problems.\n  The sooner we deal with it the better. But the budget resolution is \nnot going to be the place because only one party is carrying the burden \nthere. It has got to be a joint agreement between the two parties. That \nis why, along with Senator Gregg, he and I have proposed a plan to \ngive, to empower, 16 Members--8 Democrats, 8 Republicans--the \nresponsibility to come up with a long-term plan that would be dealt \nwith separate from a budget resolution.\n  With that, Mr. President, I notice the Senator from Washington is \nhere. I do not know whether the Senator----\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to have an opportunity to \nmake some comments, if I might. Traditionally, we have always \nalternated this back and forth.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator require?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Probably about 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If I can have about 5 minutes before the Senator goes, I \nwould appreciate it. If not, I will come back.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We can then go to two people on that side.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Fine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I just wanted to come to the floor for a \nfew minutes today and talk about the budget that is before us now. It \nreflects a lot of work. It reflects the priorities of families across \nthis country. Importantly, it returns fiscal responsibility to \nWashington, DC. It invests in critical needs of all Americans.\n  I am very proud to be able to say I support it. It is tough and it is \nstrong, which is exactly what we need to be doing today in the United \nStates.\n  First and foremost, I do want to thank our chairman, Senator Conrad, \non his work on this most difficult task. I have served with him through \nthis process time and time again. I am always amazed and impressed by \nhis thoughtfulness, his attention to detail, and, of course, his \namazing charts. He always works well, along with his partner from the \nHouse, Congressman Spratt, to help us establish priorities of which all \nAmericans can be proud.\n  Writing a budget of this size and scope is not easy, but Senator \nConrad has again proven this year he is up to the task. I am proud to \ncall him a colleague and a friend.\n  Mr. President, Senator Conrad and all of us as Democrats want a \nbudget that reflects the priorities of American families. We do that in \nthis budget by investing here at home--in our schools, in our \ninfrastructure, and in our communities. We still provide every dollar \nthe President asks for defense spending over the next 5 years.\n  At the same time, Americans want us to return to fiscal \nresponsibility in Washington, DC. Every family knows the importance of \nbalancing their own checkbooks and paying their own bills. They expect \nus, the Federal Government, to be responsible with their money as well.\n  Unfortunately, as Senator Conrad pointed out, for too many years \nunder Republican control we have seen a failure to manage those \ntaxpayer dollars. Year after year, they have produced some of the \nlargest debts this country has ever seen. This budget, our budget, says \n``no more.''\n  Our plan does include strong pay-as-you-go rules, and that means we \nare being responsible for today and not burdening our grandchildren \nwith future debt. In fact, this budget produces a $41 billion surplus \nby 2012. I really want to say we owe Senator Conrad a debt for keeping \nus fiscally responsible yet investing in the right priorities, and \nstill producing a surplus by 2012.\n  We recognize in this budget that American families want relief from \ntaxes as well. This budget supports middle-class tax relief. It extends \nmarriage penalty relief, child tax credit, and supports reform of the \nestate tax just to make sure that we protect small business and family \nfarms, and, importantly, provides relief from the alternative minimum \ntax for 1 year, a tax that increasingly is a burden on middle-class \nfamilies.\n  I am especially proud of what we have done in this budget that pays \nattention, finally, to our veterans when they come home. From stories \nwe have heard of veterans who have been struggling to get mental health \ncare for post-traumatic stress disorder, to some who had to wait months \nif not years to get the benefit checks they so need, or the lack of \nfocus on traumatic brain injury, the signature issue of this war that \nis affecting thousands and thousands of our soldiers who have returned \nhome.\n  What we have seen clearly is the President has not adequately funded \nveterans care. This budget reverses\n\n[[Page S6229]]\n\nthat terrible trend and provides $43.1 billion for addressing those \nproblems. That is a critical component of this budget that every Member \nof this Senate ought to vote for.\n  Importantly, our budget rejects the President's proposal to impose \nnew fees and higher copayments on veterans. The President's budget that \ncame to us said that he wanted to impose fees and copays on the \nveterans themselves to pay for veterans health care. We say no. We say \nthese men and women have paid the price by serving us. We are not going \nto charge them again.\n  Very importantly, we keep the promise to our Nation's heroes and \nrestore that by saying we will not impose fees on our veterans to \nbalance this Nation's budget.\n  This budget also invests in critical port security needs. I was very \nproud to work last year on a bipartisan basis to pass the Safe Ports \nAct. But that bill did not adequately fund the critical infrastructure \nwe need to keep our ports safe. This bill begins that process.\n  We have increased funding for the Safe Ports Act, which means more \nradiation detection centers at our Nation's ports, more partners in \nsafe trade, and importantly, the personnel, custom officials to make \nsure this bill actually works.\n  On education, our budget reverses the painful cuts that we have seen \nyear after year to education and provides the largest increase in \nfunding for elementary and secondary education programs in 5 years.\n  Like all of my colleagues, I have been home. I have listened to my \nteachers, my administrators, my parents, and students at home who tell \nus the lack of funding in the promise to No Child Left Behind has \nhindered them from being able to do the right thing, to make sure our \nchildren get a good education.\n\n  Our budget, this budget that is before us, increases Department of \nEducation funding by $9.5 billion above the President's request and \nkeeps the promise we made when No Child Left Behind was enacted.\n  As a parent, a former teacher, I know the importance of investing in \nour children's education. I am very proud this budget does just that.\n  This budget also provides very important funding for SCHIP; that is \nthe program that Senator Conrad talked about which is the children's \nhealth insurance program. Everyone talks about the incredible burden of \nhealth care in this country and who it is impacting most, our Nation's \nchildren. This budget expands health care coverage to nearly 6 million \nchildren.\n  Certainly, in this country today that ought to be our top priority. \nThat is what Democrats are saying in the budget before us. We provided \na very important step forward for American children with the investment \nin this budget.\n  I think it is important to note that in 3 of the last 5 years, the \nRepublican majority failed to pass a budget. They had a much larger \nmajority than we do here in the Senate today, and we saw what happened \nwhen a budget did not happen: historic debts that were passed on to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Well, last November, in the election, Americans demanded a change. I \nbelieve this budget reflects that call. It returns fiscal \nresponsibility to Washington, DC and, importantly, ensures our Nation's \npriorities are addressed. I am very proud to support this bill. I \nencourage all of our colleagues to do so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murray for the \nextraordinary contributions she has made to this budget resolution. \nThere is no more valuable member of the Senate Budget Committee than \nSenator Murray. She was a conferee. She has participated throughout the \ncommittee's deliberations on this budget.\n  Again, there is no one who played a more constructive role than \nSenator Murray. She has been a fierce advocate for education, for \nexpansion of children's health care coverage, and for the \ntransportation needs of the United States. So I thank Senator Murray \nfor her very thoughtful participation in the deliberations of the \nBudget Committee.\n  I also want to take this moment to thank my colleague, Senator \nAllard, again for his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the chairman for his \nleadership on the Budget Committee and willingness to work with \nRepublicans, to a certain degree, and I do appreciate his leadership.\n  We have a difference of opinion. I think these are reflected in the \nbudget. I also recognize the ranking Republican, Judd Gregg. I think he \nhas it just right. I would like to associate myself with many of the \ncomments he made on the Senate floor because I agree with him.\n  If you have been listening to this debate and what the Democrats on \nthe other side of the aisle have been saying, you may be getting as \nconfused as I am. You know, I listened to this debate, and it seems as \nthough they want the argument all ways--at least four ways.\n  They want to argue that they are not increasing taxes but yet are \nincreasing taxes. They want to argue that they are holding down \nspending, but yet they want to take credit for all of this spending \nthey put in the budget. So I think that is confusing.\n  I think we are missing an opportunity to do more for future \ngenerations than what is reflected in this budget. In fact, I think \nthis is a budget that is a disaster in the making for future \ngenerations. It took the majority Democrats only 4 months and 15 days \nto figure out how to raise taxes. Now, they say they are not raising \ntaxes. But taxes are going to go up because of inaction on their part, \nbecause they make the rules and the procedures around here in the \nSenate so complicated that there is not going to be an opportunity for \nthose of us who want to see taxes held down to make that effort without \nthese very high hurdles.\n  They want to ignore the fact that the U.S. economy has done well; it \nhas grown and prospered over the past several years with the creation \nof 7.9 million new jobs and tax revenues that have outpaced projections \nby $300 billion.\n  The economy has experienced smooth sailing, frankly. Now Democrats \nare about to pass a huge, bloated budget that will act as a heavy \nanchor weighing down our economy.\n  The Democrats do not want to recognize the fact that after we reduced \ntaxes the economy grew. We have had this argument over the years in the \nBudget Committee, and with the now majority leader on the Budget \nCommittee who does not want to recognize that when you are reducing \ntaxes you actually have an opportunity to increase revenues, \nparticularly when we start with a high tax rate.\n  If we look at what has happened with taxes before, the President came \nthrough with his economic growth packages, he had two growth packages, \nour economy was struggling, and we just finished, in 2001, what we \ncall--the high-tech bubble had burst, the economy was regressing, and \nwe had the 9/11 catastrophe. We had the war on terrorism. We moved into \na time when we had a record hurricane year.\n  But despite all of those negative impacts, the economy did well. I \ncan recall during the last part of the 1970s when we had high energy \nprices and we had a struggling economy. Remember, we got into double-\ndigit inflation, double-digit unemployment. We referred to all of this \nas the misery index because our economy wasn't doing too well.\n  Most of that was attributed to the fact that energy prices were so \nhigh. But look at today and look where energy prices are and look at \nhow the economy continues to grow, which I think speaks to the strength \nof the economic package that the President has put in place with the \nhelp of a Republican Congress.\n  What we did was reduce taxes in those areas where we thought we could \nreally focus, particularly targeting the small business sector of our \neconomy. That is where innovation occurs. That is where you can expect \nthe greatest economic growth when you have right tax policy.\n  One of the things we did that really targeted the small businesses \nwas we increased the amount of expenditures that they could write off \nso that small businesses make investments in their\n\n[[Page S6230]]\n\nbusiness, maybe it was computers, maybe it was--if they were in \nconstruction maybe it was a Bobcat. But it impacted all segments of \nsmall business.\n  The economy responded, and it is still responding. But this \nparticular plan we have before us--and that is what this budget is, it \nis a plan. It is a plan that is put together by the House and the \nSenate. It is not anything that is signed by the President. It is an \nagreement.\n  So, now, in 4 months and 15 days, they have had this plan that lays \nout a pact to increase taxes.\n  It increases discretionary spending at least $205 billion over the \nPresident's request over 5 years. The debt increases $2.5 trillion over \n5 years, and we don't do anything on mandatory spending. We had several \nhearings in the Budget Committee about the problem with entitlements, \nwhich is mandatory spending--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--\nand how we needed to control future obligations in those programs \nbecause they are getting ready to bankrupt the country. We had \ntestimony in front of the Budget Committee that said the way those \nprograms are currently designed is unsustainable. It is completely \nignored in this 5-year plan that has been put out on how they are going \nto grow the economy. I think it is headed in the wrong direction. It is \ngoing to be a disaster for future generations.\n  The Democratic budget contemplates a huge tax increase. The argument \nwas made from the other side, as always, if you want to increase taxes, \nyou blame the rich because they are making too much money. But \neverybody ignores the fact that the top 20 percent of taxpayers are \npaying 85 percent of the taxes. The bottom 40 percent is actually \ngetting a refund, a handout from the Government. It is easy to point to \nthe wealthy and say: They are not paying enough. But in reality, they \nare already paying a lot. If we allow the Republican tax plan to expire \nwithout taking any future action, the result is going to be a negative \nimpact on our economy. I believe that.\n  This budget spends $23 billion over what the President suggested as \nfar as discretionary spending for 2008, totaling about $82 billion over \n2007. The budget spends $205 billion over the President's discretionary \nspending over 5 years. Entitlement spending grows unchecked by $416 \nbillion over 5 years. It creates reserve funds. We did create a few \nreserve funds, but we didn't create 23 reserve funds, which is an \nopportunity to build a shield of smoke and mirrors, which allows \nspending to go on unchecked. I am concerned about the opportunity we \nare giving various committees to spend.\n  If we do this right, we can do a lot of things that will restrain \nspending, will hold down taxes, and actually provide for future \ngenerations of Americans. I am disappointed we haven't done more in \nthose areas. In fact, we haven't done anything but move in the wrong \ndirection.\n  I had an amendment I offered in the committee and on the floor that \nsaid: Let's look at the ineffective programs. This President, to his \ncredit, has put together what they call the PART Program. PART goes \ninto the various agencies and evaluates their programs. Then they rate \nthem. Was it effective? Was it moderately effective? Is it ineffective, \nor have they made no effort at all? You can easily look into these \nprograms where they didn't make an effort at all to try and establish a \nprocess where there is accountability in the way they spend tax \ndollars, or they can go into a program that was rated ineffective. I \nsaid: You know, if we go ahead and reduce spending by 25 percent on \nsome of those ineffective programs, in the first year of this budget we \ncould save about $4 billion, which is minimal, when you think about it, \nout of a total budget of $2.9 trillion. Over 5 years, that would amount \nto about a $17 billion reduction in debt, a relatively easy thing we \ncould have done. We ignored that opportunity, as we ignored the \nopportunity to do something about entitlement spending. We talked about \nit and talked about it. This could have been a budget that actually \ncalled for some action. We have ignored all the recommendations of the \nhearings and gone ahead with business as usual--increasing taxes, \nincreasing spending.\n  The Democratic budget literally ignored the entitlement crisis. They \nhave done some manipulation so they can talk four ways about how they \nare not increasing taxes but in reality they are, about how they are \nholding down spending but in reality they are increasing spending much \nmore than what Republicans are supporting. It would have been \ninteresting to have seen how they would have created a budget during \nthose 3 years the chairman of the Budget Committee criticized \nRepublicans, when we had 9/11, we had the Internet bubble break, and we \nhad record hurricanes. We had a lot of pressure on our budget. As \nRepublicans, we did a good job. Those were tough times. This budget and \nthese economic times are much better. This was an opportunity for us to \ndo something to hold down spending. We could have done something to \nhold down the taxes so we could sustain our phenomenal economic growth.\n  Let me talk about one other issue. If you notice, when the Democrats \ntalked about spending, they talked about it as a percent of gross \ndomestic product. That is an easy argument to make. This economy has \ndone so well that the gross domestic product is growing at a phenomenal \nrate. So you can increase spending at a phenomenal rate, and your \nfigures can still look good. When you talk about spending as a \npercentage of gross domestic product, you are not talking about what is \nhappening in the budget. You need to talk about it in terms of real \nfigures from year to year and within the 5-year window of this budget. \nWhen you do, we have a tax increase of $736 billion. You have increased \ndiscretionary spending by $205 billion, debt by $2.5 trillion, and done \nnothing as far as entitlement spending is concerned.\n  I will not vote for this budget. I encourage my colleagues to join \nme. We can do better. This budget forgets about future generations, and \nwe should do better on their behalf. That is the reason I came to the \nCongress, because I believed it was important that we eliminate deficit \nspending.\n  By the way, he talks about eliminating deficit spending by 2012. If \nwe worked on it, I think we could have gotten rid of deficit spending \nin 2 years, with the current rate of growth and current incoming \nrevenue, if we had only made the effort. But this budget ignores that \neffort. We continue to spend and tax as usual.\n\n  I am disappointed in this particular budget. We could have done much \nbetter. I think it is a disaster for future young Americans. Hopefully, \nthis budget will not pass, and we can have another budget that deals \nmore seriously with the future of this country and the future of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the conference report on the fiscal year \n2008 budget resolution isn't only about a bunch of numbers; it is about \nour priorities for America. It is about our vision for America. A \nbudget in a lot of ways is like a checkbook. A checkbook tells us about \nan individual's priorities. This is our national checkbook. It tells us \nwhere we are and where we want to go as a nation.\n  The proponents of this budget are proud of their budget, claiming it \nis fiscally responsible, it reduces the deficit, it makes hard choices, \nand leads to a balanced budget. Opponents of the budget resolution say \nit is nothing of the sort. It adds spending, raises taxes, does nothing \nabout long-term entitlement programs and the crisis America faces \nthere. They say it is a tax-and-spend budget doomed to fail because it \ngrows the Government, slows the economy, and will fail to balance the \nbudget. The question for the American people is, who is right. This is \nno trivial matter. It is not just about our Government's finances and \nthe Nation's prosperity; it is about our jobs and paychecks. It is \nabout our family's budget. It is about our hopes and dreams. So who is \nright? Is this a tax-and-spend budget or a fiscally responsible budget? \nIn America, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not everyone \nis entitled to their own facts.\n  Fortunately, we have plenty of facts by which to judge this budget. \nWe have the facts of the budget, the facts of history, and the hard \nfacts of the IRS form 1040 to determine exactly what this budget is and \nexactly what this budget does for American taxpayers and families.\n\n[[Page S6231]]\n\n  I believe a reasonable review of those facts will, sadly, conclude \nthis is, in fact, a tax-and-spend budget, that it is based upon \nhundreds of billions of new spending, and almost a trillion dollars of \nnew taxes, that it will grow the Government and slow the economy, and \nthat it will fail to balance the budget because no tax-and-spend budget \never has, that it is diametrically opposed to the only solution we \nfactually know to successfully balance the budget, and that is to cut \nspending and reduce taxes.\n  How do I reach that conclusion? It begins with two facts of any \nbudget: What does the Government spend? What does the Government tax? \nFrom this budget we can tell three things about spending. First, we \nknow every dime the Government is spending today. This budget says what \nthe Government will spend tomorrow plus more to account for inflation \nand population and whatever other factors come into play. This budget \ndoes not require a single program termination, not a single program \nreduction, not a single program freeze. So we know spending doesn't go \ndown. It goes up in a business-as-usual approach.\n  Next we also know new spending is added, over $200 billion in new \nspending over the next 5 years with no offset. Finally, we know there \nare some 24 reserve funds added where billions of new spending can be \nadded. Some of them allow for tax relief, but mostly they add new \nspending programs or expand existing ones.\n  The authors of the budget will tell us that any of these new \ninitiatives have to be offset with either spending cuts or new taxes. \nGiven the fact that not one penny of spending is cut in this budget and \nthat billions of new spending is added, I don't think we can expect to \nsee any future spending cuts. That only leaves one thing to pay for it, \nand that is taxes.\n  Thus we see every penny of existing Government kept, we see billions \nof new spending, and we see promises of even more new spending beyond \nthat. However, to be fair, the Democrats do point to one spending cut \nthey may do. They point to provisions, so-called reconciliation \ninstructions, to cut education spending by $750 million over a 5-year \nperiod. They want to use the reconciliation process so the provision \ncannot be filibustered. So to get this straight, out of a budget of \n$2.542 trillion this year, out of CBO estimated spending of $12 \ntrillion, $37 billion over the next 5 years, the Democrats are going to \ntry and squeeze $750 million out of savings. That is six one hundred \nthousandths of 1 percent.\n  This may turn out to become a spending cut, but consider two facts: \nFirst, the $750 million cut that might occur is dwarfed by $205 billion \nin new spending that is scheduled to occur. Second, that $750 million \ncut is a spending cut not to shrink Government but to actually grow \nGovernment.\n\n  The education reconciliation instruction is part of an effort to \ntransfer subsidies that private lenders give to student loans and put \nthe Government back in control of student loans. It is a cut not to \nshrink Government but a cut to shrink the private sector and expand the \nGovernment.\n  So in this budget, what do we have on the spending side? Well, as I \nsaid before, we have no spending cuts, no terminations, no freezes. We \nhave $204 billion, $205 billion in new spending. We have numerous new \nspending initiatives promised, and the single, potential cut is \ninfinitesimally small, is a fraction of new spending and is designed to \nuse a special process to shrink private lenders and expand Government \nlending.\n  On the basis of no spending cuts, billions of new spending, promises \nof even more spending, and a miniscule cut that is actually a \nGovernment expansion--from all that--I think any reasonable person \ncould conclude this budget spends more and more.\n  But what about taxes, the second part of our equation? Does this \nbudget raise taxes? Does it help or harm taxpayers? Democrats insist \nthere are no tax hikes in this budget. No one's taxes are going to go \nup, they assure us. But is that true?\n  If you are kind of boring and you care about budget numbers, you \nmight come up with a different answer. If you are a taxpayer and know \nwhat it means to fill out your IRS Form 1040, you definitely will not \nagree with that assessment.\n  For those who care about the budget, here are the facts. Every budget \npassed since 2001 has excluded from its future revenue levels the tax \ncuts that were passed in 2001. In fact, each budget has excluded the \nrevenue reductions from the 2001 tax relief, the 2003 tax relief, and \nthe 2005 tax relief.\n  These budgets did not count as Federal tax revenue any of those \nrevenues transferred back to taxpayers by those three tax cuts. \nInstead, every budget said the tax cuts are in your family's budget and \nnot in the Government's budget; that is, until now.\n  This budget says those tax cuts are no longer part of your family's \nbudget, but they are now part of the Federal Government's budget. Money \ncannot have two masters, and this budget says the money going to your \ntax cut has a new master, and it is not you, it is the Government.\n  In fact, over the next 5 years, some $736 billion in tax relief that \nAmericans enjoyed yesterday and today to pay their bills, to feed their \nfamilies, to invest in their dreams, will not be in their families' \nbudgets tomorrow but in the Federal Treasury's coffers.\n  By transferring $736 billion of tax relief you enjoy today out of \nyour families' budgets into the Government budget, the Federal \nGovernment revenue baseline makes a huge leap, and from that a deficit \nprojected at $229 billion in 2012 suddenly becomes a surplus.\n  Do tax hikes account for that swing in the deficit? We know spending \nhas not been cut. In fact, we know spending is going up. So the only \nreason the budget could swing from a deficit to a surplus in 2012 is \nbecause something has happened on the revenue side. Judging how big the \ndeficit swings to surplus, something big must have happened on the \nrevenue side in this budget, and the facts bear that out.\n  At $736 billion, that tax hike in this budget is not only the biggest \ntax hike in history, but it is more than double the largest tax hike in \nhistory. In fact, this tax hike is two times the record tax hike of \n$293 billion that was enacted back in 1993 by President Clinton and a \nDemocratic Congress.\n  In fact, it is interesting to note, because we are talking about $736 \nbillion in the conference report, if you look at the House-passed \nbudget resolution when it left the House and went into conference, the \ntax increase was $917 billion. At that level, that would exceed and be \ngreater than all the revenues collected to run all the Federal \nGovernment budgets for 156 years--from 1789 to 1957, from Washington to \nEisenhower. It is a huge tax hike. So from a budgetary perspective, we \nknow that spending goes up, and we know taxes go up. It is not the \nGovernment that will be spending less. The only folks spending less \nunder this budget will be the American taxpayers.\n  That leads to the next tax hike test: the view of the taxpayer. This \none is easier, but it is also more painful, as we look at the IRS Form \n1040 that most of us filled out a month ago. We can ask the hard \nquestion--those of us who filled out the Form 1040 in the last few \nweeks or months--if losing various tax changes constitutes a tax hike \nin the mind of the average taxpayer.\n  So let's take a look at the Form 1040 and the tax changes this budget \nis specifically based upon and would include.\n  Now, obviously, as I said earlier, the House-passed version was a \n$917 billion level. The report that has come out of conference is at a \n$736 billion increase in taxes. But if you look at it on a Form 1040, \nyou can see--when we started this process, when the budget was passed \nearlier this year--it eliminated the marriage penalty relief that was \nenacted a few years back.\n  It took the dividend income and capital gains income a lot of people \nhave realized when they have sold stocks, or perhaps seniors in \nparticular who have dividend income, and it takes the increase, or the \nrate on dividend income, from 15 percent--boom--up to 39.6 percent.\n  Capital gains as well--as shown right down here on the form--if you \nlook at capital gains, which currently is taxed at a 15-percent rate, \nthat is going up. Your tax rate, right there, is also going up to 20 \npercent. So you have dividend income and capital gains income tax rates \ngoing up in both those areas in this budget.\n  Now, if you turn to the next page of the tax form, you can see other \nareas in the budget where taxpayers are also going to see increases.\n\n[[Page S6232]]\n\n  The Senate Democrats in the conference have restored a few of the \nSenate-passed items in the Tax Code, which I will get back to in a \nmoment. But where we started out in this whole thing was we saw the \nstandard deduction, itemized deduction, mortgage interest deduction, \ncharitable contribution deduction--all those sorts of things that \nnormally taxpayers are able to take--those went down. If you look at \nthe credit for childcare, which is $1,000 today, and in the original \nbudget, that would have gone down to $500, so you would have seen a \ndecrease in that area of the Tax Code.\n  If you look down to the earned-income tax credit, which a lot of our \nmen and women in uniform, our soldiers, are able to take advantage of, \nthat, too, would have been slashed and gone down.\n\n  You can go up and down this Tax Code, and you can pretty much see \nevery area in the Tax Code that was addressed in 2001, 2003, 2005--the \ntax relief that has been provided to the American taxpayer--those tax \ncuts are all going to expire and tax rates and everything else is going \nto go back up.\n  Now, the last chart I wish to show you is the tax rate schedule, \nwhich I think is also important. I am going to come back to this in a \nminute because, in fairness to my colleagues on the other side, they \nattempted, in the Senate resolution, to restore, put back, some of this \ntax relief.\n  But if you look at the original proposal, as it came forward from the \nHouse, the 10-percent lowest tax rate in the rate schedule, which \nbenefits the lowest income taxpayers in this country, would have been \nslashed all the way through, completely cut, gone--no 10-percent rate.\n  Now, as I said, in fairness to the Democrats in the Senate, they put \nthat back in, in an amendment, or at least they have alleged to have \nput it back in at some point, so some of these tax relief items that \nwere knocked out in the House budget resolution get restored.\n  But the one thing that is clear--they may have done something that, \nas I said, only time will tell if we are actually going to realize that \nbenefit and have the 10-percent rate restored--the one thing that is \nclear is that in the tax rate schedule, every other tax rate is going \nto go up.\n  So today, if you are paying at the 25-percent rate, your taxes are \ngoing to go up to the 28-percent rate. If you are paying at the 28-\npercent rate, your taxes are going to go up to the 31-percent rate. If \ntoday you are paying at the 33-percent rate, your taxes are going to go \nup to 36 percent--from 33 percent up to 36 percent. If you are paying \nat the high rate--the 35-percent tax rate--today, when this is all said \nand done, your tax rate is going to go up to 39.6 percent.\n  So as you can see throughout the entire rate schedule--this is even \nassuming the 10-percent rate gets restored for low-income taxpayers--\nfor every other taxpayer in this country, every other rate in the rate \nschedule will go up.\n  What does that mean? That means higher taxes for a lot of Americans \nacross this country. On this basis, I think it is fair to say that \ntypical taxpayers are going to say, yes, these changes constitute a tax \nhike on them.\n  Senate Democrats insist there is no tax hike in this budget. So who \nis right, the taxpayers or the Senate Democrats in their budget? Well, \nmy colleague from North Dakota sees the Democratic budget probably less \nlike a taxpayer, maybe more like a Budget Committee chairman. But this \nbudget, as it was originally proposed, as I said, got rid of the 1,000 \ntax credit, the 10-percent rate. It got rid of the death tax relief we \nwere going to experience. Their claim now is they put an amendment in \nthe Senate budget, which was adopted in conference, that will restore \n$180 billion of tax relief that this budget assumed would expire.\n  Now, if, in fact, there is no tax increase in this budget, why was it \nnecessary to go through the exercise of having an amendment to extend \nthe existing tax relief, such as the 10-percent tax bracket or the \nchild tax credit, or some of the death tax relief that was enacted a \nfew years ago and that will expire in a few years? I think the Senate \nDemocrats saw billions of tax hikes in this budget, such as the \ntaxpayers did, and decided to extend some but not all the tax relief \nthis budget would allow to expire.\n  Now, by the action of the Baucus amendment that was adopted here, \nthere was an admission, I believe, by the Democrats that billions and \nbillions of dollars of what average taxpayers would call tax hikes \nactually are in the Democratic budget. If that were not true, we would \nnot have needed an amendment, the Baucus amendment, to attempt to \nrestore some of the tax relief that is set to expire in a few years \nconstituting, as I said earlier, the largest tax increase in American \nhistory.\n  So it looks to me like what happened was an attempt to try and \ncamouflage or disguise what clearly is a very large tax increase on the \nAmerican people. No matter how they try--we will put this other chart \nup here--this budget cannot camouflage or disguise the extent to which \ntaxes are going to go up on the American people.\n  The purpose of this whole exercise in having an amendment that \nallegedly would, as I said, restore some of the tax relief, was to \nprovide a figleaf, not for the taxpayers in this country but for the \ntax raisers right here in the Congress.\n  Again, I wish to illustrate this was the $916 billion in new taxes \nthat came out of the House budget resolution. The bill that left here, \nthe Senate, and which is in the conference report we have before us \ntoday, as I said earlier, attempts to restore some of that tax relief.\n  So what did our colleagues on the other side do? They took a figleaf \nand said: We want to provide some cover for people here in the Congress \nwho want to see taxes go up. Yet with the American people, what the \nAmerican people see is a figleaf because this is a figleaf for the tax \nraisers and provides no cover whatsoever for the taxpayers; that is, \nthe American people.\n  So even if you say we are going to restore the 10-percent tax rate, \nsome of the death tax benefit that would accrue--and if not extended \nwould expire--even if we do some of these other things they say they \nhave done in their budget, you cannot address all the additional tax \nincreases that are going to happen in this budget.\n  Let's say you cover some of the child tax credit, let's say you do \nsome of the death tax repeal, let's say you even provide some of the \nmarriage penalty relief that was enacted in 2001 and 2003 and allow \nthat to be restored, you still just make a small dent in the overall \ntax increase of $900 billion.\n  So what do we have? We have $180 billion basically put back, \nrestored, to try to provide a cover or some figleaf for over $900 \nbillion in tax increases. So what we have ended up with is a $736 \nbillion increase as opposed to a $900 billion increase.\n  So the bottom line in all this is, the amendment that passed the \nSenate--the $180 billion in the conference report--provides some level \nof coverage. It provides a little cover. There is a little figleaf of \ncoverage there. But in the end, for the American taxpayer, it is about \none-fifth of the expected tax hike, and it looks pretty doubtful we \nwill even realize that.\n  So let me, if I might, say--looking at the other chart on the Form \n1040--even if you assume the Democratic amendment puts that $180 \nbillion of figleaf coverage back in there and does something about the \nchild tax credit--which was $1,000 and went down to $500, but they say \nit goes back to up to $1,000--you are still going to pay more taxes \nbecause you are going to lose some of your mortgage interest deduction \nin the area of itemized deductions. Let's say they did something on the \nalternative minimum tax which they say they help correct in their $180 \nbillion fig leaf amendment, but you still are going to pay higher taxes \non line 43 because your tax rates are going up.\n\n  So the point of this whole thing is that in the Tax Code, if you look \nat a typical 1040 and you are a taxpayer, it is very clear what is \nhappening here. If you are a tax-raiser in Washington, DC, obviously \nyou come to a very different conclusion. But if you are someone who is \nout there and you are looking at the Tax Code and you are looking at \nyour 1040--and let's just pop up this other chart for these purposes \none last time--and you are going through this exercise and you say: OK, \ngee whiz, they gave us the marriage penalty relief back, well, you are \nstill going to see, if you have dividend income, that\n\n[[Page S6233]]\n\ngoing from the 15-percent rate up to the 39.6-percent rate. You are \nalso going to see capital gains rates--if you have any kind of a mutual \nfund or anything like that which shows a capital gain, your tax rate is \ngoing to go from 15 percent up to 20 percent. You can't deny what is \nthe reality of this whole exercise.\n  The other thing I will point out is that if you look at what works in \nterms of balancing a budget, it is pretty clear this formula isn't the \none that works.\n  Back in 1997, I was a Member of the House of Representatives, and at \nthat time, as we went through the process of balancing the budget, we \nhad a Republican Congress, a Democratic President, and they agreed to a \nbalanced budget plan that actually got the job done. In fact, the \nRepublican budget plan President Clinton signed into law had two \nprimary features: It had spending cuts of $263 billion, and it had $95 \nbillion in tax cuts. So what did it do? It cut spending and it cut \ntaxes. What was the result of that? Well, we saw the economy grow, we \nsaw Government revenues grow, and pretty soon we were running \nsurpluses.\n  This budget is very different from that one. This budget has $205 \nbillion of new spending and, as I said earlier, $736 billion in new \ntaxes.\n  So in 1997 when we had record spending cuts--$263 billion over a 5-\nyear period, and tax cuts of $95 billion over a 5-year period--we saw a \ngood result. We saw an economy that started to grow, we saw the \nGovernment start generating surpluses, and that is the exact opposite \nmodel of what we are talking about here today. We are talking about a \nbudget today that increases spending by $200 billion a year, that \nincreases taxes by $736 billion a year, and I think that ends up being \na formula for higher spending, higher taxes, and a slower growing \neconomy.\n  This budget is the mirror opposite of what was done in 1997 and \nyielded the good results that came as a result of a Republican Congress \nworking with President Clinton at that time to get a balanced budget \nwhich actually cut taxes, which cut spending. Spending went down, taxes \nwent down, the economy grew, we saw more Government revenue, and that \nis exactly what we would like to see out of this budget. But, as I said \nearlier, this budget is the mirror opposite of that budget. This budget \nincreases taxes, it increases spending, and my fear is we are going to \nsee the Government grow--which it will--and we are going to see the \neconomy slow. I hope that doesn't happen, but I don't think, when you \nincrease spending in Washington, DC, and grow the Government and \nincrease and raise taxes, you are going to see the kind of effect on \nthe economy we saw in 1997 when we cut Government spending and cut \ntaxes.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to come speak to this budget resolution. \nI will join with many of my colleagues in opposing this because I \nbelieve it is the wrong formula for America's future. Higher spending, \nhigher taxes, and more government is not what this economy needs, and \nit is not what the taxpayers of America need--the people who fill out \nthose 1040s every single year. We ought to keep them in mind because \nthey are the ones who are paying the bills.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator has a vivid imagination. I \ndon't know what these charts refer to, but they certainly don't refer \nto the conference report that is before the body now. He has mixed up \nso many different proposals that have been before various bodies, but \nhe has not referenced the matter that is before this body.\n  What is before the body is the conference report on the budget. The \nconference report on the budget does not increase spending; the \nconference report on the budget takes spending down as a share of gross \ndomestic product, which all the economists say is the right way to \nmeasure because it takes out the effect of inflation. We are taking \nspending down from 20.5 percent, which is where they took it when they \nhad control; they ran up the spending when they ran everything here. \nThey controlled the House. They controlled the Senate. They controlled \nthe White House. On their watch, they ran up the spending. We are \ntaking it down, from 20.5 percent of GDP down to 18.9 percent of GDP. \nThat is one of the key reasons we are able to actually balance the \nbudget--something they have never done and something they still have no \nproposal to do. That is the fact. This is not increasing spending; this \nis taking spending down as a share of the gross domestic product.\n  Now, the Senator puts up charts that are people's tax returns and \ntalks about this rate going up and that rate going up. There are no \nrate increases here. There just aren't. I know the Republicans have \ngiven this speech so many times, it is habit. So it doesn't really \nmatter what the budget is; they just trot out the same speech they gave \n5 years ago. The problem is it doesn't fit the facts.\n  The President said in his budget, by his own estimate, that he would \nraise $14,826 billion over the 5-year life of the budget. Our budget \nraises $14,828 billion--virtually no difference. Now, this is using his \nown agency's estimates, the Office of Management and Budget. We use the \nCongressional Budget Office on ours because they are the official \nscorekeeper for the Congress. If you put them on the same basis, the \nCongressional Budget Office basis, we do have 2 percent more revenue \nthan the President's, but our revenue doesn't show up until beyond \n2010. We are going to write another budget before then. This budget \ncontrols next year. There is no difference in revenue next year. There \nis no difference in revenue.\n\n  I don't know what speech you are going to give next year when there \nhas been no tax increase. I know you will be terribly disappointed, \nbecause you believe that there has to be a tax increase. We are going \nto be here next year, and then we are going to have to trot out all of \nthese speeches that have been given here. I am afraid some of those who \nhave given these speeches are going to be terribly embarrassed.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for about 3 \nminutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I would like to ask the Senator a question. Let me begin \nby thanking him as the chairman of the Budget Committee for his \nexcellent work on the budget resolution. This conference report, \ndespite what some may have heard, is a major achievement for our \nNation's veterans, for children without health insurance, for the \nmiddle class, and for millions of Americans struggling to make ends \nmeet. None of these achievements would have been possible without the \nstrong work of Senator Conrad, and I commend him as a member of the \nBudget Committee for all of his efforts.\n  As my colleagues know, one of the major issues I have been working on \nhas been to expand federally qualified health centers in this country, \nand on that subject I would just like to ask the chairman the following \nquestion: Does the conference report accompanying the budget resolution \nassume that $2.6 billion in Federal funding would be provided for \nfederally qualified health centers in fiscal year 2008--$536 million \nmore than the 2007 level adjusted for inflation and $575 million more \nthan the President's request?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would say in response to the Senator \nthat it does. This conference report includes the amendment that was \noffered by the Senator to increase funding for community health \ncenters. As the Senator knows, this is one area of spending the \nPresident has supported. More than that, this is an area I think almost \nall of us believe has had remarkable success.\n  I have visited community health centers in my own State, and I have \nseen the remarkable work they are doing. In Fargo, ND, we have a \ncommunity health center that is serving thousands of people and doing \nit in an extraordinarily cost-effective way. It is getting very good \nhealth care results for its clients.\n  So I was pleased to support the amendment of the Senator from \nVermont. I think this is one of the most cost-effective things we can \ndo to expand health care coverage for the people of our country and the \npeople of our individual States, and I salute the Senator for offering \nthat amendment. We vigorously defended that approach in the conference \ncommittee, and the conference agreed to support that level of funding.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I just want to thank the chairman very \nmuch, and I concur with everything he\n\n[[Page S6234]]\n\nhas said. For 40 years, federally qualified health centers have \nprovided high quality primary health care for millions of Americans, \nregardless of their income, and as the chairman just indicated, they do \nthat in a very cost-effective way. If the Appropriations Committee \nprovides this funding, at least 4 million more Americans would gain \naccess to the high-quality, affordable primary care available in our \nNation's health centers in a very short period of time, with millions \nmore getting access as the new centers get up and running. I thank the \nchairman again, and I look forward to working with him and my \ncolleagues to make this a reality.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator from \nVermont, who is an extremely constructive member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee and a fierce advocate for those things he believes in. He is \nsomebody who has done his homework, and we appreciate that very much on \nthe Senate Budget Committee. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the colloquy that just occurred part of the increased \nspending that doesn't occur in this budget?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just say that the spending in this \nbudget, as I have said over and over--and I will be happy to put up the \nchart again--spending as a share of gross domestic product goes down \nunder this budget each and every year. It goes down from 20.5 percent \nof GDP to 18.9 percent of GDP.\n  The Senator will recall it was on their watch that, not only did the \nspending go up dramatically, but the revenue stagnated. The result was \nto explode the debt of the country. That is the record of the other \nparty. Unfortunately, it falls on our watch to begin to clean it up, \nand this budget does so.\n  Mr. President, is the Senator from Texas prepared?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, with the permission of the bill managers, \nI would like to yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, was the Senator from North Dakota yielding \ntime to the Senator from Texas?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No.\n  Mr. GREGG. I just got that impression, so I was willing to remain \nsilent as the Senator from North Dakota yielded the Senator from Texas \ntime.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Since I didn't hear any objection, I was assuming we were \nproceeding.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate that. Listening to the comments of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, just trying to \nsummarize it, reminds me of a saying in my part of the country--and I \nwill bet it is the same in his part of the country--the most feared \nwords in the English language are ``I am from the Federal Government, \nand I am here to help.'' That is basically how he summarizes this \nbudget: We are just here to help the American people.\n  The problem is that this budget puts us on a tax-and-spend budget, \nwhich is really the worst of both worlds. It dramatically grows the \nsize of Government over the next 5 years. This is not just 1 year, this \nis a 5-year budget, and it contemplates a record increase in taxes and \nexplodes the debt. It contemplates the largest tax hike on the middle-\nclass families and farmers and entrepreneurs in our Nation's history--\nabout $736 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Unfortunately, this tax increase will take place without a vote of \nthe Congress because what it will do is take advantage of expiring \ntemporary tax relief we passed back in 2003 which has produced an \neconomic explosion in this country and the creation of about 7.8 \nmillion new jobs just over the last 4 years. We all know this tax \nrelief has helped the economy grow and create jobs.\n  On this point, I am especially disappointed that this conference \nreport does not include an amendment I authored which passed the Senate \non a bipartisan vote by 63 to 35. That amendment, which is not included \nin this conference report, created a 60-vote budget point of order \nagainst any legislation that raised income tax rates on taxpayers, \nincluding middle-class families, college students, and entrepreneurs. \nIn addition, the Senate unanimously voted to instruct its conferees to \ninclude the point of order in the conference report. But, once again, I \nguess we are asked to suspend our disbelief because here in Washington, \ninside the beltway, things happen differently.\n  We pass amendments by a vote of 63 Senators, we unanimously vote to \ninstruct conferees to include that point of order in the conference \nreport, and that prohibits an increase in tax rates unless at least 60 \nSenators agree; and, miraculously, it doesn't appear in the conference \nreport.\n  While I am aware of the procedural ramifications, I think it would \nhave been a powerful message for the Senate to make taxpayers across \nthe country, to make this point to them that, as the chairman of the \nBudget Committee has said, there will not be an increase in taxes, to \nreassure them that there won't be. But, frankly, I think the numbers \nbelie some of the statements being made, to the extent that we are not \ncontemplating tax increases over the next 5 years, when in fact this \nbudget contemplates a historic increase in taxes, just to be able to \nkeep up.\n  The fact is this amendment highlights an essential point--that 63 \nMembers of the Senate, a bipartisan majority, believe tax rates should \nnot be raised. Unfortunately, the way I read this budget, it does \ncontemplate dramatic increases in taxes, and I don't see anything else \nat the end of the day happening.\n  Finally, a few comments on the spending side of the ledger. While the \nchairman said there will not be higher rates next year under this \nbudget, there will be, with no question, higher Government spending--\napproximately $23 billion above what the President requested, which I \nmay add is not paid for, which goes directly to the debt. In other \nwords, it is an IOU we hand down to our children and grandchildren. In \nfact, this budget contains billions of dollars in new spending on \nWashington programs--$205 billion over the President's request over the \nnext 5 years.\n  When it comes to entitlement reform, this budget does absolutely \nnothing to address the $69 trillion long-term entitlement crisis we are \nfacing. I wonder when things are going to change around here, when our \nrhetoric is matched by action. We on this side of the aisle have said \nwe are determined to work with our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to deal with this growing mountain of entitlement spending and \ndebt. Yet we are told, no, not this year, maybe some time in the \nfuture.\n  My question is: If not now, then when? We need the answer to that \nquestion. The American people need an answer to that question because \nthe debt continues to pile up through uncontrolled spending on \nentitlement programs that are on auto pilot, and the bill is being sent \nto our children and grandchildren. That is wrong and we need to fix it. \nIf not now, I wish to know when.\n  In fact, if we do nothing over the next 30 years, we won't have a \ndime to pay for anything else, except four things: Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, and a part of the interest on the debt. We will not \nhave the resources necessary for other important priorities such as \nnational security, fighting the global war on terror, securing our \nborders, veterans health care, or education.\n  For these reasons, I cannot support this budget, which would \ndramatically increase spending and return us to an era of big \nGovernment, known as tax and spend. It passes the IOU down to our \nchildren and grandchildren and, at the same time, increases the debt by \n$2.5 trillion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan, who, by the way, is an extremely valuable member of the \nBudget Committee and has played a very constructive role in this \nprocess. I thank the Senator for her assistance at every step in the \nbudget process.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S6235]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words of the \nchairman. It has been a pleasure working with him and knowing that, \ngiven what he has had to deal with, in terms of the lack of budget \nresolutions and the deficit that has been created, he has done an \nextraordinary job of putting the fiscal ship of state back in order. It \nhas been a pleasure to work with somebody who is grounded in what is \nimportant to the American people.\n  I find it so interesting; first, there is all of the rhetoric that is \nthrown around about Government, about tax and spend. What we have seen \nin the last few years has been a borrow-and-spend mentality--basically \nnot paying for what we are spending. We had a $5.6 trillion surplus \nwhen I came into the Budget Committee in 2001, with President Bush \ncoming into office. He was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus--a pretty \nnice gift for somebody coming into office. We debated what ought to be \ndone with that. Unfortunately, a more balanced approach to focus on \nmiddle-class tax cuts, to grow the economy, investments in science, \nhealth care, education, and jobs, and putting some money aside for \nSocial Security, for the long term, was rejected. That was our plan, \nbut it was rejected by the majority at the time. Instead, a plan was \nput into place that has borrowed and spent us into the largest deficits \nin the history of the country.\n  When you look at the total debt right now, we are looking at a debt \nthat is estimated to be $9 trillion by the end of this year. What \nconcerns me as well about that is, who is buying that debt? Half of our \nforeign debt is owned by two countries, China and Japan. They turn \naround and don't follow the rules on trade. They manipulate their \ncurrency, which means their products come in with big discounts and \ncompete unfairly against American workers and businesses. When we ask \nthe administration to get tough, they don't do it. Why? Because it is \npretty tough to try to enforce it.\n  This huge deficit that has been created is not only something we need \nto be concerned about from a fiscal standpoint, but jobs and what is \nhappening in the global economy and our ability to fully enforce our \ntrade laws--that is also impacted. That is why I am so pleased at what \nwe are seeing with this budget resolution.\n  We have not had a budget resolution for a few years. When our \ncolleagues were in charge, there wasn't one put together for a number \nof years. But now we have made a commitment to put together a budget \nresolution that is based on a couple of very important principles: \nfirst, a return to fiscal discipline. We are going to stop digging that \nhole that has put us into a deficit, and now we are going to work our \nway back out to fiscal responsibility. In fact, our budget comes into \nbalance within 5 years. I am proud of that.\n  Secondly, we are putting middle-class families first. Throughout this \nbudget, whether it be tax cuts or investments in education, or whether \nit be health care for our children, or making sure we fund law \nenforcement, or whether we are fully funding the military or homeland \nsecurity, we are focusing on Americans and middle-class families--the \nfolks who are working hard every day, who have been saying, hey, what \nabout us? We have seen jobs go offshore and more and more dollars going \nto fewer and fewer people, in terms of spending. We have turned that \naround.\n  This is a new direction. I am very proud of the work that has been \ndone with the House and the Senate. I am proud of our leader, Senator \nReid, and our leader on the budget, Senator Conrad, who has done such \nan extraordinary job.\n  What are the elements we have put together relating to the budget? \nThere are many pieces. We basically reversed what the President has \ndone in terms of cuts in investments in Medicare and Medicaid and the \nCOPS Program and a variety of others. Start with this. Basically, there \nare six areas we have focused on:\n  First, a return to fiscal responsibility. We put into place something \ncalled pay-as-you-go. At my house, it was called common sense, paying \nthe bills and not spending more than you had coming in. That process \nhas been put back into play so we can, in fact, balance the budget and \nreturn to fiscal responsibility.\n  We also have made investing in education and innovation a top \npriority. We know we are in a global economy and we are in a time and \nplace where it is harder and harder for families to be able to afford \ncollege. Yet college is needed more than ever for advanced skills, for \npeople who are going back to work, or for those who need to train for \nanother type of job; and education from preschool and Head Start all \nthe way up to college is a critical part of investing in the future of \nour country. America's young people are competing with students from \naround the world. We are competing in a global economy. Higher skills \nand focusing on education and opportunity are essential. So is \ninnovation, because we know we have been the engine of great ideas. We \nhave to keep that up, whether it is the National Institutes of Health \nor whether it is the advanced technology program relating to \nmanufacturing technology--all kinds of ways in which America has been \nthe leader. To maintain that, we have to make an investment, as any \nindividual business makes an investment in the future, in innovation \nand ideas to be able to create more jobs. Our budget says we are going \nto return to fiscal responsibility and put education and innovation at \nthe top for our families and for our future.\n  Then we are making a major commitment to cover health care for \nchildren. In fact, this budget puts a major commitment forward for the \nnext 5 years of this budget resolution to cover every child with health \ninsurance. We are talking about children of parents who are working. \nThey may be working one or two jobs or three jobs, and we know the \naverage single parent--the average mom today, to make ends meet, has to \nfigure out how to work three different minimum wage jobs, and they \nprobably don't have health care. We don't think it is right that in the \ngreatest country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, \nmoms and dads are going to bed at night saying, please, God, don't let \nthe kids get sick. Please help our son not break his arm and have to go \nto the hospital because he has been playing sports or don't let our \ndaughter get sick or hurt playing in sports and break a leg.\n  We want to make sure every child in America has health insurance. We \nmake that commitment in this budget to fully fund SCHIP, the children's \nhealth care program. That is a downpayment on making sure we provide \nhealth care for everybody.\n  In this budget, we start with children, making sure every child in \nAmerica has access to health care. Then I hope we take the next step \nwithin the next couple of years to do what needs to happen, which is to \nfundamentally say health care is a right and not a privilege in the \ngreatest country in the world, and fully provide access to health care \nfor every American. So we have education and health care as an \ninvestment.\n  Then we do something incredibly important, which I think every \nAmerican agrees with and, frankly, is shocked hasn't been done in \nprevious budgets in the last 6 years under the previous majority and \nthis President, and that is we are going to keep our promises to our \nveterans. We have 50 different veterans organizations, service \norganizations, supporting what we are doing because we are taking their \nnumbers about what is needed. They put together a budget called the \nindependent budget, and they estimate how many new veterans are coming \nhome from the war and how many current veterans are going to need help. \nFor the first time, we are meeting that number on health care and in \nother areas, which is critical. We are saying we are going to keep our \npromises to our veterans, and the American people want us to keep our \npromises.\n  By the way, all of these things are not ``Washington'' or \n``Government.'' It is all of us together. It is what we do in a \ncivilized society, the greatest democracy in the world. We come \ntogether and decide how to allocate the precious resources. That is \nwhat we are doing. How do we invest these in a way that keeps our \npromises to veterans and creates opportunity for the future, for the \nAmerican dream and for people in this country? We have a very important \nprovision; we have middle-class tax cuts. We make sure the middle-class \ntax cuts that have been passed and are in place under the child credit \nand the marriage penalty and the tax cuts that\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\naffect middle-class families are extended.\n  We make sure that we put our focus where it ought to be--on middle-\nincome families--because those are the folks being squeezed, those are \nthe folks who are seeing their college costs go up, their health care \ncosts go up, if they have it at all; their wages go down, if they have \na job; their gas prices go up, and Lord knows they are going up and up \nand up. So it is our working families, our middle-class families, those \nwho are barely scrimping by who are seeing all these costs descend on \nthem.\n  When we look at that, we say we ought to make sure they are the ones \nwho get the break. That is what our budget does.\n  Finally, we make sure we reverse the President's continual assault on \nthe COPS Program and on other key investments in health care and \ntechnology, areas where every year the President has tried to \neliminate, cut back. We have now in Michigan, since 2001, 1,600 fewer \npolice officers on the streets. People can't believe that since 9/11 we \nactually have fewer police officers--and that number has been going \nup--on our streets in our communities than we had before 9/11.\n  We reject the President's further cuts in law enforcement. We restore \nthose dollars. We put back dollars, we increase dollars for homeland \nsecurity.\n  That is the picture. This is a picture of responsibility. We want to \nbe fiscally responsible and, at the same time, we want to focus on \nputting middle-class families first. That is what our budget is all \nabout.\n  Also, it is true there are some areas of the budget where we are \nraising revenue, and that comes in the category of closing outrageous \ntax loopholes for businesses and individuals who owe taxes, which is \nestimated anywhere up to $345 billion, folks who decided to take the \nmoney offshore, take the jobs offshore.\n  Our chairman has shown so many times the picture of the building in \nthe Cayman Islands with over 12,000 businesses saying that is their \nbusiness location. Obviously, it is not. We don't think they ought to \nget away with that.\n  Middle-class families, the majority of the people in this country, \nhave a right to know if they are following the law, if they are paying \ntheir taxes, that we are making sure everybody is following the law and \npaying their taxes.\n  So, it is true, we do take some dollars from those folks who cheat, \nwho leave the country, who too many times take jobs with them, and we \nsay: You know what. You need to follow the law like everybody else. We \ntake those dollars, and we put them back into making sure that \neducation is available, health care for every child, police officers, \nfirefighters in our communities, paying for our armed services, keeping \nour promises to our veterans. I call that setting the record straight, \nturning things around, and creating the right kind of priorities for \nour country. The budget is always about values and priorities. That is \nwhat it is, it is about values and priorities.\n  I am very proud of the values and priorities reflected in this \nbudget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator has used 15 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to join with us \nin this new direction set by this budget for the families of America.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the \nconference agreement on the budget resolution that was just passed by \nthe House of Representatives this afternoon.\n  This budget makes an important departure from the irresponsible \nbudgets of the recent past and begins to restore balance. Instead of \ngutting programs that help our most vulnerable citizens and \ncommunities, this budget enables these programs--like the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, Medicare, COPS and others--to keep serving those \nwho rely on the commitments our Nation has made to help all its \ncitizens. Instead of gimmicks and passing the buck to others, this \nbudget brings greater transparency and responsibility back to \nWashington.\n  I am supporting this agreement as an important step in getting \nAmerica's budget back on track. A large part of getting back on track \nis reinstating the pay-go rule in the Senate. Under pay-go, Congress \nwill not be able simply to pass along the debt to future generations \nfor the choices we make today. We will have to be accountable for \npaying our own bills and collecting our own revenue. Pay-go by itself \nwill not bring our budget back to balance, but it will help those of us \ncommitted to fiscal responsibility to keep budget deficits from getting \nworse.\n  When I talk to families in Illinois and across the country, I hear \nthe same sets of concerns and aspirations. The people I meet want \naffordable health care for themselves and their children. They want a \nquality education for their children. They are concerned about our \nnational security and our domestic security. They want to retire with \ndignity. They are concerned about the costs of this war in the \nthousands of sacrificed lives and the hundreds of billions of dollars \nborrowed from abroad. They are concerned about their own credit card \ndebts and our rising national debt.\n  The failure of our nation to guarantee access to affordable health \ncare for children is shameful. This budget rejects the President's \nproposed cuts to the State Children's Health Insurance Program and \nmakes children's healthcare a priority for Congress.\n  The security of our Nation is a critical priority, and honoring our \nveterans is our moral obligation. This budget fully funds our Defense \nand Homeland Security funding needs and makes it possible to provide \nthe quality health care and services that our veterans deserve.\n  This budget calls for strong new measures to close the tax gap, shut \ndown tax scams, and address offshore tax havens. I am particularly \npleased to see the strong support for improved mandatory reporting by \nbrokerage firms of the adjusted cost basis of their clients' stock, \nbond, and mutual fund investments.\n  During the Senate debate on the Budget Resolution, two of my \namendments were adopted to increase summer-term education funding and \nto promote carbon sequestration technology. I am pleased that the \nconference agreement has laid the foundation to accommodate legislation \nthat I have introduced in these important fields.\n  This budget fully funds the President's request for defense spending \nwhile prioritizing improvements in veterans health care, children's \nhealth coverage, and education. It eliminates the deficit by 2012 and \nreduces spending as a share of GDP. And it does this without raising \ntaxes or requiring deep cuts to critical government services.\n  This budget demonstrates that we can rise above ideology and gimmicks \nand begin tackling the serious challenges we face as a nation. I \ncommend the outstanding leadership of Chairman Conrad and the good work \nof the House and Senate conferees.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for this conference \nagreement.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I would like to talk today about the \nHouse-Senate budget resolution, S. Con. Res. 21, and the many reasons I \noppose it. Overall, the budget resolution contemplates a staggering \namount of spending: $15.5 trillion of total budget authority from \nfiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2012. In fiscal year 2008 alone, \nthe resolution provides for nearly $3 trillion in spending, yet a \nsignificant part of that spending is unfunded, or it comes from the \nSocial Security surplus.\n  On its face, the budget resolution increases the gross debt by $2.5 \ntrillion over 5 years, but this figure understates the true impact of \nthis misguided decision on our economy. In order to fund $2.5 trillion \nin additional national debt, the Treasury Department will have to sell \nGovernment bonds. Its demand for credit will drive up interest rates, \nmaking homes more expensive and curtailing economic activity that \ncreates jobs. There is no restraint. The resolution calls for $205 \nbillion more in discretionary spending than called for in the \nPresident's fiscal year 2008 budget.\n  Not content to ``tax'' Americans with the higher interest rates that \nwill result from deficit spending, the authors of this resolution are \nendorsing real tax increases as well. The budget resolution's failure \nto provide for extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will result\n\n[[Page S6237]]\n\nin an enormous $736 billion tax hike on families, seniors, and \nbusinesses.\n  True, the resolution provides for the extension of certain popular \ntax cuts that Congress enacted, such as the child tax credit, but it \nalso places a substantial new obstacle in the way of enacting even \nthese cuts. This is the so-called trigger mechanism that Chairman Gregg \nand others have discussed in detail.\n  Finally, even with the higher interest rates, tax increases, and \nprocedural barriers to tax cuts this resolution contains, it still \nrelies on raiding the Social Security surplus to achieve the appearance \nof budget balance at the end of the day. I tried to stop this by \nincluding language in the Senate passed version of this resolution, but \nunfortunately, the conferees took this provision out of the final bill.\n  Get ready, America. Your taxes are about to go up.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, assuming this budget resolution \nconference report passes today, it will be only the second time in 5 \nyears that Congress has finalized a budget. The annual budget \nresolution sets forth the necessary blueprint for the Government's \nspending and revenues, and I am pleased that we have an agreement to \nvote on this year. I am also pleased that it is a plan that can help \nput us back on a fiscally responsible path.\n  For too long now we have been digging deeper and deeper into a ditch \nof debt. President Bush's budget submitted to Congress in February \nwould continue that trend by increasing the gross federal debt by \nnearly $3 trillion to $11.5 trillion by 2012. That's $38,000 per \nperson. The budget resolution we are considering today can help reverse \nthat trend.\n  The resolution reestablishes a strong pay-go rule, which would \nrequire any new spending or tax cuts to be paid for elsewhere in the \nbudget or receive a supermajority of at least 60 votes in the Senate. \nWhile I know that balancing our many priorities will not become easier \nunder this pay-go regime, I welcome its return. I am also pleased that \nthis budget establishes a new 60-vote point of order against long-term \ndeficit increases.\n  This budget also sets a blueprint for going after our country's \nmassive $350 billion tax gap, which is the difference between the \namount of taxes owed by taxpayers and the amount collected. One of the \nprimary tax gap areas I hope Congress will focus on this year is the \noffshore tax haven and tax shelter abuses that are undermining the \nintegrity of our tax system. I commend Chairman Conrad and the Budget \nCommittee members for their willingness to take on and push Congress to \naddress these complicated areas. There are many ways Congress can go \nabout tackling these problems, and I hope that one of them will be to \nenact the Stop Tax Haven Abuses Act of 2007 that I introduced earlier \nthis year with Senators Coleman and Obama. Our bill would crack down on \na number of the offshore abuses that shift the tax burden onto ordinary \ntaxpayers, and would be a big step toward achieving fairness in our tax \nsystem.\n  This budget resolution also works toward fairness in our tax system \nby assuming an extension of middle class tax cuts, including extensions \nof marriage penalty relief, the child tax credit and the 10 percent \nbracket. It also assumes a year of alternative minimum tax relief and \nestate tax reform for small businesses and family farms. While the bulk \nof the President's unaffordable tax cuts since 2001 have benefited only \nthe wealthiest among us, the tax cuts assumed in this budget are aimed \nat helping working families. I believe they are an important part of \nany economic plan and should be continued.\n  On the spending side of the ledger, I am pleased that this budget \nresolution supports our men and women in uniform both in the national \ndefense program and the additional costs of operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  I am also pleased that this resolution includes the resources needed \nto ensure that our veterans get the health care they deserve. In total, \nthe resolution provides more than $43 billion for the Veterans Affairs \nhealthcare system--$3.6 billion more than President Bush's budget.\n  I am also pleased that this budget provides a $50 billion increase \nover 5 years for the Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, to \nexpand children's health care and make sure states can maintain current \ncaseloads. Making sure children have adequate health care should be one \nof our nation's top priorities. Unfortunately, President Bush's SCHIP \nbudget proposal would have lead to the loss of critical coverage in \nmany states. The Secretary of the Department of Heath and Human \nServices has even admitted that the intent of the President's proposal \nis to decrease the number of children enrolled in SCHIP. It is \nimperative that we reject that inadequate proposal, and this budget \nresolution does that.\n  This budget also represents a significant improvement over the \nPresident's budget for education. For 2008 alone, it provides an \nincrease in discretionary funding for the education and training \nfunction of $9.5 billion above the President's request. That means more \nfunds for Pell grants, IDEA, and No Child Left Behind Act than the \nPresident requested. It would be shameful to fail in our responsibility \nto our children by adopting a spending blueprint that does not provide \nour schools the resources they need.\n  It is a welcome change to be voting for a budget resolution that can \nchange the failed fiscal policies and irresponsible tax cuts pushed by \nthis administration. This resolution can help pave the way for \nimportant investments in America's future to put our country back on \ntrack and to begin the long process of climbing out of the ditch of \ndebt.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, as the Senate debates the fiscal year 2008 \nbudget resolution conference agreement, I want to first acknowledge the \nhard work of Chairman Conrad and Senator Gregg throughout this fiscal \nyear 2008 budget cycle. While I do not always agree with the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, I do appreciate the hard work it takes to get \na budget through Congress.\n  I also want to acknowledge the importance of writing and passing a \nbudget resolution. This document is a vital part of the operation of \nCongress. It sets a fiscal blueprint that Congress will follow for the \nyear and establishes procedural hurdles when these guidelines are not \nadhered to. Because this is such an important document, I am even more \ndisappointed with the fact that this was not a bipartisan process.\n  Not being included in the crafting of this budget is far less \nimportant than the fact that this budget does little to help our \neconomy. From the day we marked up this budget in committee, this \ndocument has been a tax-and-spend, big-government budget. It also fails \nto make meaningful reductions in mandatory spending--even though our \nNation's mandatory health programs are growing each year by more than 6 \npercent, an unsustainable level.\n  It is not right to overspend now--and pass the bill on to our \nchildren and grandchildren to pay later. It is regrettable that during \nthis budget debate, the Senate was unable to work across party lines \nand do more to shore up our economic future.\n  As my colleagues may know, this conference report contains a \nreconciliation instruction for the HELP Committee, where I serve as the \nsenior Republican senator. This reconciliation instruction directs the \nHELP Committee to produce $750 million in deficit reduction over 6 \nyears. The Senate-passed resolution did not contain any reconciliation \ninstructions. However, the House-passed budget did contain such an \ninstruction that called for $75 million in savings. Reconciliation \nbecame a ``conferencable'' item because the differences between the two \nChambers needed to be resolved.\n  Recall that during Senate consideration of the budget resolution this \nyear, we never debated reconciliation. Chairman Conrad chose not to \ninclude it in his budget. That was his choice. He held hearings earlier \nthis year relating to our Nation's long-term fiscal challenges, and I \ncommend him for that. Health and Human Services Secretary \nLeavitt testified before the Budget Committee in March that the demand \non Federal general revenues for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security \nexceeds $50 trillion--that is trillion with a ``t''--over the next 75 \nyears based on current law and program operations. But the Senate-\npassed budget, which I voted against, failed to address these \nchallenges.\n\n[[Page S6238]]\n\n  Now today we are debating a conference agreement that directs the \nHELP Committee to reduce the deficit by just $750 million over 6 years. \nMr. President, I said million, with an ``m.'' I would like to explain \nto my colleagues what is really going on in this budget.\n  In his fiscal year 2008 budget request, the President proposed nearly \n$18 billion in savings related to higher education. Most of these \nsavings are achieved by cutting subsidies the banks are currently \nreceiving. Democratic leadership is also looking at reducing many of \nthese same subsidies in the $20 billion range and possibly even larger.\n  This conference agreement allows for these mandatory higher education \nproposals to be advanced through the reconciliation process. That means \nlimited debate, strict germaneness requirements on amendments, and a \nsimple majority vote to pass the bill. But with just a $750 million \nsavings requirement, the process will be used to fast-track massive new \nentitlement spending. A more honest reconciliation and deficit \nreduction debate would be to limit the new spending in a reconciliation \nbill to 30 or even 40 percent of the total savings. But right now this \nbudget is teed up to allow $20 billion or more in new spending, with \nthe deficit reduction component amounting to merely a rounding error in \na gigantic spending proposal.\n  I wrote a reconciliation bill in 2005 when I had the privilege of \nchairing the HELP Committee. The title that I authored reduced the \ndeficit by $15.5 billion over 5 years. In addition to the deficit \nreduction, the bill created new mandatory grant aid proposals, academic \ncompetitiveness and SMART grants. It also increased loan limits so \nstudents could better finance their education. That reconciliation bill \nspent roughly $9 billion on brand-new student benefits, all fully paid \nfor. About 40 percent of my total savings was spent on new programs, \nand the remaining funds paid down the deficit.\n  But this budget we are debating today says if the majority party can \nfind $20 billion or even $30 or more billion in savings, they can fast-\ntrack and spend 95 percent of those savings. This is an offensive use \nof the reconciliation process. This year, if just one-half of the \nSenate authorizing committees could equal the level of deficit \nreduction that the HELP Committee achieved in 2005, the deficit would \nbe reduced by an additional $100 billion.\n  During the Budget Committee and floor consideration of the \nresolution, I also spent a great deal of time on health-related issues. \nI am greatly disappointed that this conference agreement contains a \ndeficit neutral reserve fund that encourages repealing the ``non-\ninterference'' clause from the Medicare law. This is an issue that came \nbefore the Senate a few weeks ago and failed. It failed because it is \nbad policy. The ``non-interference'' language in the Medicare law \nprevents the Federal Government from fixing prices on Medicare drugs or \nplacing nationwide limits on the drugs that will be available to \nseniors and the disabled. I support this language 100 percent, but this \nconference agreement supports striking this language that protects \npatients. Decisions on what drugs should be available should be made by \nseniors and their doctors, not by politicians.\n  I am happy to see, however, that this conference agreement retains \nthe reserve fund for health information technology legislation that I \nworked to get into the Senate budget resolution. The HELP Committee is \ncurrently working on a bill to increase the widespread adoption of \nhealth IT. What does that mean? That means we are working on a bill \nthat will eventually do away with clipboards in doctors' offices. Every \ntime I go to the doctor, someone hands me a clipboard to fill out \neverything I can remember about myself. This is no easy task, and as I \nget older, this task gets even harder. Wouldn't it be great if, \ninstead, doctors had electronic medical records that could keep track \nof this information for me, if my doctor's computer in Wyoming could \ntalk to my doctor's computer in Washington? Well, the bill I am about \nto introduce is the first step in making that happen. And if that does \nhappen and most of the doctors and hospitals in this country start \nusing health IT, the RAND Corporation estimates we could save between \n$80 and $162 billion a year. That is amazing savings, and I am happy to \nsee that this language was included in this conference agreement.\n  I am also pleased to see that the conference agreement includes a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund for improvements in health insurance \ncoverage. This spring, I have been talking to my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle about writing legislation that reduces the number of \nuninsured, improves health care quality and access, and reduces the \ngrowth in the cost of private health insurance by facilitating market-\nbased pooling across State lines. My hope is that a commonsense \nproposal similar to this would meet the criteria established in this \nreserve fund.\n  As we move forward and complete this resolution and start working on \nthe fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills, I wanted to mention a few \nprograms that are important to Wyoming.\n  As our Nation's most abundant energy source, coal must play a central \nrole in electrical generation for years to come. In order for that to \nhappen, we need to continue finding ways to make coal generation \ncleaner. Programs like the Clean Coal Power Initiative will play a \nmajor role in making that happen, and so I support increased funding of \nthis program.\n  We also need to see proper funding of the Federal loan guarantee \nprogram. Federal loan guarantees can play an important role in \ndeveloping new energy projects. It is my hope that we can provide \nenough funding to get some of these projects off the drawing board, and \nmost specifically, I hope that we provide funding to the Department of \nEnergy to move forward with loan guarantees for coal-to-liquids \nprojects. Coal-to-liquids technology has the potential to help reduce \nour Nation's dependence on foreign energy barons and should be \nexplored.\n  In addition, funding for rural air service and maintenance is \nessential for States such as Wyoming. Without Federal support through \nessential air service and airport improvement programs, many rural \ncommunities would have no commercial air service and extremely limited \ngeneral aviation. I hope this issue will be part of the debate on the \nreauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration this year. I \nencourage my colleagues to recognize the importance of this funding, \nnot only as a matter of dependability but also as a public safety \nissue.\n  I want to mention two additional issues of great importance to \nWyoming and other rural States: housing and homelessness. The McKinney \nVento Homelessness Assistance Act is the primary law through which \nCongress funds homelessness programs in the United States. \nUnfortunately, rural States have historically received very little of \nthis money. Yet rural States must confront homelessness too, and the \ngeographic size of our States further complicates our efforts. In \nresponse to this, Congress authorized the Rural Homelessness Grant \nProgram in 1992 under the McKinney-Vento Act. This program provides \nfunding for transitional housing and education services in rural \nStates, as well as rental or downpayment assistance. The intent of this \nprogram is to level the playing field between rural and urban States. \nUnfortunately, this program has never been appropriated funds since its \ncreation, so the purpose of this program has never been fulfilled and \nrural States continue to suffer. This can be a valuable program for \nrural States like Wyoming.\n  I would like to briefly call attention to the Small Business \nAdministration. I serve on the Small Business Committee and enjoy using \nmy small business experience to help make a difference in the lives of \nmany people in Wyoming and throughout the country. We are working in \nWyoming to stabilize and steadily grow our small businesses through the \nutilization of the Small Business Innovation Research, SBIR, Program. \nThe risk and expense of conducting serious research and development \nefforts are often beyond the means of many small businesses, especially \nrural small businesses. By reserving a specific percentage of Federal \nR funds for small business, SBIR enables small businesses to compete \non the same level as larger businesses and stimulate high-tech \ninnovation in their rural States.\n  The FAST and Rural Outreach programs are congressionally authorized\n\n[[Page S6239]]\n\nprograms that provide technical assistance that helps Wyoming's small \nbusinesses utilize the SBIR Program.\n  Finally, the Agriculture Committee has a big task in reauthorizing \nthe farm bill this year. Writing a tight budget that will help us reach \nour long-term fiscal goals is a priority for me. Though you cannot tell \nby the name, the farm bill affects the lives of many unsuspecting \nAmericans. Policies and projects for distance learning, conservation, \nfood assistance, renewable fuels, and our forests are provided for in \nthe farm bill, in addition to the well-known commodity programs.\n  So in closing, I want to inform my colleagues that this is not a \ncourageous budget. It fails to make the tough choices and it passes the \ndebts we carry today on to our children and grandchildren. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this budget and vote no on the conference \nagreement.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I express my strong support for the \nconference report on the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. I also \ntake this opportunity to congratulate Chairman Conrad and the other \nconferees for their hard work on this resolution. This resolution \nreflects our commitment to fully fund veterans' health care and \nbenefits.\n  This budget resolution would provide $43.1 billion in fiscal year \n2008 for the VA discretionary account--$3.6 billion more than the \nPresident requested. I am very pleased that the conference report \nfollows the recommendations of the Democratic and Independent members \nof the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to provide $2.9 billion over the \nPresident's request for veterans' medical care alone. This includes an \nadditional $303 million for treatment of traumatic brain injuries, and \n$693 million for VA mental health programs--two areas of vital \nimportance to servicemembers returning from Operations Iraqi and \nEnduring Freedom.\n  I also thank the Budget Committees for rejecting the President's \nproposals to impose an annual enrollment fee for VA health care and to \nincrease the prescription drug copayment. These proposals would have \nunduly burdened thousands of veterans who cannot afford higher costs \nfor the health care they have earned and deserve.\n  I again commend Chairman Conrad and the other conferees for their \nwork on the budget resolution, and for sending the right message to our \nNation's veterans. We have made a commitment to their care, and this \nresolution honors that commitment. I urge my colleagues to support \nswift passage of the resolution before us today.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to offer my support for \nthe fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.\n  Last year, under the leadership of the President and his party, \nCongress failed to pass a budget resolution. The result was a failed \nbudget process from start to finish, and Congress adjourned without \npassing 10 of 12 appropriations bills for fiscal year 2007.\n  Under Democratic leadership, the Senate passed a continuing \nresolution that funded fiscal year 2007 Government programs and sent an \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill to the President to give our \ntroops over $95 billion in vital support.\n  I was disappointed that the President chose to veto the \nAppropriations bill, which called for benchmarks for the Iraqi \ngovernment and funded our troops at a level higher than his initial \nrequest. But the Democratic majority signaled its willingness to fund \nthe troops and fill the gaps left by the Republican Congress.\n  Now the Senate has taken the next step toward fiscal responsibility. \nWe have a sensible fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. The $2.9 billion \nbudget in fiscal year 2008 projects revenues expected to total $14.828 \ntrillion over 5 years, only 2.1 percent above the President's expected \nrevenues of $14.826 trillion.\n  This resolution corrects many of the misplaced priorities of the Bush \nadministration and the Republican Congress.\n  These misplaced priorities include over $1 trillion in tax cuts, tax \ncuts that will cost $3 trillion more if extended over the next 10 \nyears.\n  When President Clinton left office, the national debt was projected \nto be eliminated by 2010. These misplaced priorities created a $248 \nbillion deficit this year, and an $8.9 trillion debt.\n  This budget resolution restores funding for over 141 programs slated \nfor cuts or elimination by the President in his budget proposal. These \nwere painful cuts that we have seen year after year under the \nRepublican majority.\n  The proposed cuts were to programs vital to Californians and the \nAmerican people. Programs like the Community Development Block Grant, \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services, and the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program. These do not sound to me like frivolous programs.\n  Unlike the President's budget proposal, this budget will create a \nsurplus in 2012 and is near balance a year before that. This budget \nrefocuses our priorities, extending the middle class tax-cuts and \nalternative minimum tax relief, and increasing veterans' and children's \nhealth care funding.\n  In fact, this budget provides over $43 billion for veterans' \nprograms, $3.6 billion more than the President requested for 2008 and \nthe largest increase ever provided for veterans. This is in accordance \nwith a request of four leading veterans groups and a recommendation \nfrom the American Legion.\n  It also provides up to $50 billion to expand SCHIP coverage for \nchildren eligible for the program. Both of these increases help the \npeople most vulnerable and most in need.\n  This budget restores a fiscally responsible pay-go rule that requires \noffsets for new spending or expensive tax cuts.\n  This budget adds $9.5 billion to help fund education, including \nhigher education, to help increase the competitiveness of our students \nin an increasingly globalized world. We know there is a problem with \neducation in the United States, and this budget looks to address it.\n  This budget allows for the committees to secure increased funding for \nprograms like the State Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicare, \nMedicaid, middle-class tax relief, education, alternative energies, and \nother important priorities.\n  It also allows for a deficit-neutral reserve fund for the San Joaquin \nRiver Restoration Settlement Act, a provision I and my colleague \nSenator Boxer requested. This broadly supported bill will help bring \nabout tremendous progress in the restoration of a waterway vital to the \nstate of California, and the reserve fund will help ensure that we fund \nthe restoration in the correct manner.\n  This budget is not perfect, and I am deeply concerned about the long-\nterm fiscal implications of irresponsible tax cuts and a seemingly \nendless war. We are faced with a tremendous wall of debt, created by \nmisplaced priorities and poor planning.\n  We must now turn to reversing the damage. This problem will not fix \nitself. We need to act now to reduce our budget deficit and pay down \nthe debt.\n  The elimination of the deficit will not happen in one year, but will \ntake years of careful planning and prioritization to ensure the best \nreturn for our Federal dollars. But I am encouraged that this budget \nwill both fund the most beneficial programs and start us on the path of \nfiscal recovery.\n  Congress faced many tough choices in crafting this budget, and we \nhave a long and difficult road ahead.\n  The budget resolution cannot provide permanent alternative minimum \ntax relief or even fully fund the most critical programs.\n  But it is a start. It refocuses our priorities. And it begins to \nreverse the years of damage.\n  I encourage my Democratic and Republican colleagues to consider the \nresponsibility that the American public has given us. A responsibility \nto act in the best interest of this Nation. To pass a sensible and \nreasonable budget, and to use that budget as we craft and pass the \nappropriations bills in a reasonable amount of time. This budget fits \nthat charge, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the \nfiscal year 2008 budget resolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to express my deep disappointment \nin the budget resolution conference report. It is a deceptive and \ndefective declaration of flawed priorities that ignores this country's \nbiggest challenges. If we follow this budget through to its natural \nconclusion, it will lead us from our current path of economic growth \nand prosperity onto a treacherous road to tax increases, economic \nrecession, and needless pain for millions.\n\n[[Page S6240]]\n\n  While there are many things to lament about this budget, I will \nconcentrate my remarks on just three aspects of it--three features that \nI believe will hurt the families of my home State of Utah.\n  First, this budget opens the door to large increases in spending in \nboth discretionary and in mandatory programs. On the discretionary \nside--these are the funds that must be appropriated each year--the \nbudget resolution calls for an increase of $205 billion over what the \nPresident has requested over the next 5 years. And keep in mind, the \nPresident's budget represents an increase over spending in the current \nyear. In fact, President Bush requested a 2-percent increase in \ndiscretionary spending for fiscal year 2008, but resolution before us \nrepresents an increase of 8 percent. This type of large spending \nincrease hurts Utahns for years to come.\n  Mr. President, the national debt of the United States of America now \nexceeds $8,500 billion. Each U.S. citizen's share of this debt exceeds \n$29,000. Every cent that the U.S. Government borrows and adds to this \ndebt is money stolen from future generations of Americans and from \nimportant programs, including Social Security and Medicare on which our \nsenior citizens depend for their retirement security. Large increases \nin discretionary spending only add to this growing multigenerational \nproblem and I am disappointed to see such a large increase in this \nbudget.\n  Second, the budget resolution before us is woefully inadequate in the \narea of dealing with the tax problems facing America. Of most immediate \nconcern, the alternative minimum tax, AMT, hangs over middle-income \nearners like a giant sword. Unless we, at the very least, continue to \ntemporarily increase the AMT thresholds, we will see about a five-fold \nincrease in the number of taxpayers subjected this unfair and complex \ntax. However, the budget resolution, as it does with almost every \nproblem, punts this issue into the future instead of making the tough \ndecision to fix this problem.\n  It is common speculation that the only way Congress can deal with \nthis problem is to waive the pay-as-you-go rules that also feature so \nprominently in this budget. The speculation that Congress will easily \nwaive pay-as-you-go rules is a joke, and we all know it. But millions \nof American taxpayers will not be laughing when this budget kicks in \nand leaves them paying the enormous price associated with the AMT tax, \nI am afraid.\n  This budget resolution also falls far short when it comes to dealing \nwith the tax cuts that are due to expire over the next few years, \nincluding the so-called ``extenders'' that come to an end this \nDecember. The proponents of this resolution glibly state that the \nbudget provides for the tax cuts to be extended. But it does so only if \nthey are paid for with revenue from another source.\n  I cannot understand why some in this body do not see that the surges \nin revenue we have enjoyed over the past few years have come as a \ndirect result of the tax cuts we passed in the early part of this \ndecade. These have also kept the economy and job growth humming along. \nDoes it not make sense to my colleagues that if we reverse these \npolicies, this economic growth and job growth and revenue growth will \nall come to a screeching halt?\n  This budget actually contains the Cliff Notes version of Democratic \neconomic policy--tax, spend, deny reality, and repeat. When the economy \ntanks, blame the Republicans and tax some more.\n  The third and ultimately fatal flaw of the budget resolution before \nus is also its most serious flaw. It totally ignores the entitlement \ncrisis we have waiting for us just around the corner. Practically all \nMembers of this body know and regularly acknowledge the profound \nchallenges presented to this Nation as a result of the retiring baby \nboom generation, along with the corresponding growth in Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid. We regularly reference it here on the \nSenate Chamber, as well in outside speeches and in letters to our \nconstituents. We all know it is a colossal problem that is not going to \ngo away by itself. Yet, instead of even the slightest recognition of \nthis problem or even the tiniest movement toward a solution, both of \nwhich would be a start, this budget completely ignores it.\n  This is a travesty. I hear regularly from my Utahns that they want us \nto deal with these problems, and right away. Utahns are a thrifty and \ncareful people who like to face problems head-on and solve them, rather \nthan pawning them off on the next generation. I believe that it is \nsimply inexcusable that Congress would shun this opportunity to deal \nwith entitlement challenges at this time and I know my fellow Utahns \nagree.\n  Do my colleagues think that it is going to be easier in the future to \nbegin to resolve our Social Security or health care system problems? We \nall know the answer to that. We all know that we should have started \nsolving these problems already and that it would have been far less \npainful to deal with them a few years ago than it would be now. We also \nknow that this pain will be greatly compounded as we wait to deal with \nthese issues in the future.\n  When President Bush tried to get Congress to work on Social Security \n2 years ago, my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \npretty much to a person, decided that they would rather turn it into a \npartisan political issue than join hands in trying to find a solution. \nI recognize that not everyone liked the concepts the President put \nforth. I didn't like all of them myself. But, instead of meeting him \neven a tenth of the way, the other side saw a huge potential advantage \nby shunning his overtures. Some say it paid off for them, but at what \nprice the next generation of Americans will have to pay because of this \ndecision.\n  Yes, we can keep passing budgets like this every year and keep \nburying our heads in the sand about the need to confront our impending \nentitlement problems. But we are rapidly approaching the time when we \ncan no longer solve these challenges without a huge amount of pain and \nsuffering and perhaps without losing our preeminent place on the world \neconomic scale.\n  Mr. President, there are many more things I could say about the \nshortcomings of this resolution, but I will withhold and simply urge my \ncolleagues to defeat this resolution. We deserve better, and our \nchildren and grandchildren certainly deserve better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 33 minutes remaining on the side of \nthe Senator from North Dakota, and on the minority side there is 23 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I wish to take 2 minutes to respond to \nSenator Cornyn, and then is it the intention on the other side to go to \nSenator Vitter?\n  Mr. GREGG. At the completion of the Senator's time, I suggest Senator \nVitter be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Why don't we lock that in right now? Senator Vitter has \nbeen waiting here patiently. I will consume such time as I might use, \nand then we will go to Senator Vitter for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, Senator Cornyn of Texas raised a concern \nabout an amendment he offered that was adopted both in committee and on \nthe floor with respect to creating a 60-vote hurdle for any increase in \nrates. He raised a concern about that being dropped in conference. I \nadvised the Senator it was going to have to be dropped in conference \nbecause the Parliamentarian advised us that if it came back from \nconference, the whole privileged nature of a budget resolution would be \neliminated. That is the reason it was dropped. It is a simple \nprocedural matter that we could not include it.\n  Why couldn't we? The Budget Committee does not have the authority to \ntell the committees of jurisdiction how to raise money or how to spend \nit. I know that seems odd, but the reality is the Budget Committee is \nable to tell the Finance Committee how much money it can raise and the \nAppropriations Committee how much money it can spend. We do not have \nthe authority to tell the Finance Committee how to raise it. We do not \nhave the authority to tell the Appropriations Committee how to spend \nit. If we exceed our authority, then the whole privileged nature of the \nbudget resolution--\n\n[[Page S6241]]\n\nthat is, that a budget resolution comes to the floor under special \nrules; there are 50 hours dedicated to the budget resolution and other \nspecial rules that apply--all of those would be out the window if we \nhad allowed the amendment of the Senator from Texas to be included in \nthe conference report.\n  That is just a simple fact. We could not do that. Nobody would want \nto eliminate the whole budget process. That is what would have happened \nbecause the Budget Committee would have exceeded its authority.\n  On the question of spending, the Senator from Texas raised that \nissue. This is spending as a percentage of GDP under this \nadministration. When they came in, spending was 18.4 percent of GDP. \nThey have raised it to 20.3 percent of GDP. That is their record.\n  Under this budget, we are taking spending down--20.5 percent GDP in \n2008, and we are taking it down each and every year until we get to \n18.9 percent of GDP in 2012.\n  Again, the Senator said we got a big tax increase here. There is no \ntax increase here. There just isn't. The President, in his budget, said \nhe was going to raise $14.826 trillion over the next 5 years. Our \nbudget, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which is \nnonpartisan and professional, says our budget raises $14.828 trillion. \nThere is virtually no difference. That is what they said their budget \nwould raise.\n  I see the Senator from New Mexico is in the Chamber. We have an order \nthat the Senator from Louisiana would have the next 5 minutes. Then we \nare supposed to go back to our side to Senator Wyden. It is Senator \nVitter's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Nomination of Robert L. Van Antwerp, Jr.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise very briefly to turn away from \nthe budget for just a few minutes and focus on a matter of extreme \nimportance for Louisiana and, indeed, the country, and announce a very \nimportant and positive resolution to this matter to give us the right \nleadership we need in place at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in time \nfor this upcoming hurricane season which is due to begin this June 1.\n  Today LTG Carl Strock is ending his tenure as the Chief of Engineers \nand Commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He served the Army \nhonorably for 36 years, and for the last 2 years of his career, I would \nsay he has gone under intense work and pressure as he led the Corps \nthrough the extraordinary events of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and \nthose recovery efforts.\n  I join everyone here, Republicans and Democrats, in thanking General \nStrock for his service and wishing him all the best in the next phase \nof his life.\n  This comes, as I mentioned, right as our next hurricane season is due \nto begin on June 1. As we go into that threat and into that battle, as \nit were, it is very important we have a new commander in place to lead \nus. The President nominated LTG Robert Van Antwerp to replace General \nStrock.\n  I came to this floor literally just a half an hour ago very concerned \nthat his nomination was being held up by a Democratic hold, and that \nthreatened that we would not have our new commander in place for this \nnew hurricane season.\n  One does not go into battle without a leader, and that battle, as I \nsaid, is just a few weeks away.\n  It is important to acknowledge that nobody wanted to rush into this \nnomination. We all wanted to make sure this nominee, General Van \nAntwerp, is the right person for the job. Indeed, we have. I spent \nweeks looking very carefully at the nomination, as did my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Landrieu. We held hearings on this nomination \nin the committee of jurisdiction for the Corps, on which I serve, the \nSenate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Everyone over that \nperiod of time got comfortable and very supportive of this nomination. \nThat is why it is very appropriate that we move forward and make sure \nthis nominee, this leader, is in place before the start of the next \nhurricane season.\n  As I mentioned, I literally came to the floor a half an hour ago, and \nthis was very much uncertain because there was a Democratic hold on the \nnomination. I am very relieved and very happy to say that in that short \nperiod of time, that has been cleared up. That hold on this particular \nnomination has been lifted, and the nomination of the new head of the \nCorps, GEN Robert Van Antwerp, will be cleared through the Senate later \ntoday.\n  This is very positive. I thank Majority Leader Reid for agreeing to \nthis literally in the last hour in light of the crucial nature of this \nposition and the impending start of this next hurricane season, June 1.\n  I, again, thank everyone for working toward this important goal. It \nis important that we have the right leader at the helm in time for the \nbattle, in time for the start of the new hurricane season, June 1. \nClearly, our work in overseeing the Corps, and our work in funding key \nwork of the Corps in the gulf coast region continues. I will certainly \nredouble my efforts in that regard. But at least we have our general in \nplace, our leader in place for the hurricane season, which is very \nappropriate and very necessary.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I don't see Senator Domenici on the \nfloor. How much time does the Senator require?\n  Here is Senator Domenici. We had previously thought that he might go \nnext, if that is acceptable to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If I can ask the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, \nhow long does the senior Senator from New Mexico anticipate talking?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't want to go ahead of Senator Wyden. I will take \n15 to 20 minutes. Senator Wyden ought to go, if it is his turn, and I \nwill come after him.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time does the Senator require?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I was going to take 10 minutes. I would enjoy listening to \nthe Senator from New Mexico. Whatever his pleasure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's take that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Oregon. Not only is he an \nextremely important member of the Budget Committee, he is one of the \nconferees. He is somebody who has been incredibly important for these \ndeliberations. I thank him for his cooperation and leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I thank the chairman for his comments and \nwould just say I think the Conrad budget goes a long way to restoring \nfiscal sanity in the Federal Government, but also allows for an \nopportunity for the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, to get behind two \nfixes to the critical domestic issues of our time, and those are health \ncare and taxes.\n  I think if you listen to the technical lingo over the course of the \ndebate--and the Senator from Missouri, now the Presiding Officer of the \nSenate, comes from the campaign trail, and we are glad to have her \nbecause she has just been through the debate in her State--the people \nin Missouri or in my State of Oregon do not talk about pay-go and fire \nwalls and reserve funds and that kind of technical Washington lingo. \nThey do talk an awful lot about what is going to be done to fix health \ncare and what is going to be done to fix taxes.\n  One of the reasons I am so supportive of this Conrad budget is, it \nreally does lay the foundation for the Congress to get serious about \ntax reform and serious about health reform. One of the areas Chairman \nConrad has zeroed in on as it relates to taxes, for example, has been \nthis problem of tax havens and tax scams. There is an opportunity as a \nresult of this budget to come together in a bipartisan way and fix the \ntaxes. If you are serious about closing the tax gap, the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars that we can't collect--and Chairman Conrad and \nChairman Baucus have been working hard to try to approve measures to \nmake it easier to collect that money--you have to fix the tax system \nand simplify it.\n  I have offered a proposal, the fair flat tax, that would allow for \njust that kind of effort. Others here in the Senate have ideas as it \nrelates to tax reform. The point is, the Conrad budget makes it \npossible for the Senate to come together on the tax issue and fix this \ncode.\n  Chairman Conrad has talked about the scams. He has talked about the \ntax\n\n[[Page S6242]]\n\nhavens and about the hundreds of billions of dollars we are losing. I \nhave a proposal, the Fair Flat Tax Act, that would deal with it. There \nare other proposals in the Senate that would beef up the collection of \nthese billions of dollars that are lost in the tax gap. The Conrad \nbudget lays the foundation for tax reform.\n  I would say to my colleagues, we have had more than 14,000 changes in \nthe Tax Code in recent years. It comes out to three changes in the Tax \nCode for every working day, three for every single working day. The tax \nsystem is broken in this country. We are laying the foundation in this \nproposal for a tax system based on simplicity: a one-page 1040 form and \nprogressivity, where we are fair to those who are vulnerable in our \nsociety, but also reform that is sensitive to the question of holding \ndown rates for all so that everyone would have a chance to get ahead.\n  In addition to taxes, which I think the Conrad budget deals with in a \nresponsible fashion, the legislation allows for a bipartisan effort in \nthis Congress to fix American health care, with a reserve fund that is \nestablished and would allow for bipartisan health reform efforts. \nSenator Bennett of Utah and I are offering the first bipartisan effort \nin 13 years to fix American health care. Everybody would be covered, \nwhich is essential, because if you don't cover everybody, those who are \nuninsured shift their bills to those who are insured. We also fix the \nbroken private marketplace.\n  Right now, we have an awful lot of insurance companies that cherry-\npick, that take just healthy people and send sick people over to \ngovernment programs more fragile than they are. We spend hundreds of \nbillions of dollars through the Federal Tax Code disproportionately \nrewarding the most affluent in our country and also promoting \ninefficiency. Senator Bennett and I are very hopeful that this year, \nnot in 2009, not after the next Presidential election but this year, \nthe Senate will come together on a bipartisan basis. We have the \nHealthy Americans Act, other Senators have other proposals, but the \nConrad budget lays the foundation for fixing health care in this \nsession of Congress.\n  I also believe as a result of the letter that 10 Senators sent--5 \nDemocrats and 5 Republicans--to the President, indicating that we want \nto work in a bipartisan way, that if this budget passes, and if the \nWhite House will join the effort that Senator Bennett and I are \nadvocating in the Healthy Americans Act and the 10 Senators have \noutlined in their letter to the President--which very much mirrors what \nSenator Bennett and I are talking about--we can get action on health \ncare in 2007.\n  Finally--and I appreciate the thoughtfulness of the Senator from New \nMexico in allowing me to speak before him--let me mention that Senator \nConrad has included in his budget a provision that is critical to the \nsurvival of timber-dependent communities in my State and around the \ncountry. His budget includes a reserve fund to provide for extension of \nthe Secure Rural Schools Act, also known as the county payments \nprogram. This law provides funding for schools, roads, and other \nessential services in hundreds of resource-dependent communities around \nthe country. This is a survival issue for many in rural America. \nWithout county payments, rural communities around this country are \ntelling us they are going to vanish from the map. These communities, in \nmy view, should not be turned into sacrifice zones.\n  I am hopeful the extension of the county payments law will be \naddressed during the conference on the emergency supplemental spending \nbill. Earlier this year, 74 Senators voted to include an extension of \nthe county payments program, and we were very pleased to have the \nsupport of Senator Domenici, who has been involved in this discussion \nand also the additional program, the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program, \nwhich we have included in this legislation.\n  We have spoken to the majority leader, Senator Reid, who has assured \nme he will do everything in his power to include county payments when \nthe new version of the supplemental spending bill comes out of \nconference. If that doesn't happen, we are going to make this an effort \non every single vehicle in this Congress. Our bipartisan group is going \nto try to get this support for county payments legislation done as soon \nas possible.\n  We believe it ought to be done along the lines of what 74 Senators \nhave already voted for, and it ought to be done in the supplemental \nspending bill that is going into conference. But if it doesn't happen, \nwe are going to try to make it happen on every single vehicle that \ncomes before the Senate because of its extraordinary importance to our \ncommunities.\n  I thank Chairman Conrad for making the inclusion of a county payments \nreserve fund in the budget so as to provide a backstop so that there \nwould be another option to extend county payments quickly, if for some \nreason it doesn't happen in the budget.\n  In closing, I would urge colleagues to support this budget, \nespecially because of the foundation it lays to tackle the two biggest \ndomestic issues of our time, health care and taxes. There are certainly \nmajor issues that come before us, with Iraq obviously being the issue \nof paramount importance as it relates to the international front, but \nthe big issues at home are fixing health care and taxes. The Conrad \nbudget allows Democrats and Republicans to come together on both of \nthose.\n  This is a budget that responsibly allows the Senate to address the \ncritical issues, do so in a responsible way, and I urge the passage of \nthis budget.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I gather that I am next under the time \nagreement, and that I have up to 15 minutes; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is correct, Madam President, but might I ask \nthe Senator to yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Indeed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I want to just say this--and I fully \nanticipate the Senator may be critical of this budget, so I certainly \nrespect his views. But I just want to say, after going through this \nbudget process, that the Senator from New Mexico has been involved in \nthe writing of 20 budgets, more than 20 budgets here, and my respect \nfor him has grown geometrically after going through this one. I really \ndo want to commend the Senator for what is truly an extraordinary \nthing, to be involved in more than 20 budgets for the United States.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank the chairman very much, and \nlet me say to the distinguished chairman that some of those budgets had \nsome extraordinarily good things in them, some were just--well, you \njust had to do what you had to do.\n  I can remember how long and hard we worked and worried about giving \ndrugs to our senior citizens as part of Medicare. Anybody that is \ninterested in whether a budget act has any force should go back and \nlook at how that happened. We did it with a reconciliation instruction. \nWe started with $400 million--I think we ended up with about $500 \nmillion or $600 million before we finished it--and that is where we \nreconciled and said you can only use it for this. It was an experiment \nas to whether it would work because there is nothing in the law that \nsays you can do that. When you do the right thing--things that people \nare otherwise frightened to do--they will let a budget act do things \nthey would not otherwise let happen. It wouldn't be part of the \nexpectation when you read the fine lines in the Budget Act.\n  The Senator has done some of that here. He has extended it, and I \ncommend him for it. I don't like it, but that is what we are here for, \nto agree and disagree. I don't like the budget as the Senator has \nprepared it, but I give him great credit for getting it done. It is a \nmost difficult job. Senator Conrad also had a House that had just \nchanged, and that was very hard for him to figure out with whom he was \nworking and what they wanted and how they wanted to negotiate. So I \nreally think it was probably as onerous and difficult as any, but the \nSenator is here, and you are a hero when you can finish a budget.\n  People don't stay here and applaud afterward, but it is something \nvery extraordinary to get it done and be able to say we are through \ntonight. So I commend him for that.\n  Having said that, Madam President, I want to start with a little \neditorial piece that was found in the Wall Street Journal a couple of \ndays ago. It is called ``April Revenue Shower,'' and in it, it says:\n\n\n[[Page S6243]]\n\n\n       Here's the ``surge'' you aren't reading about: The \n     continuing flood of tax revenue into the Federal Treasury. \n     Tax receipts for April were $70 billion above the same month \n     in 2006, and April 24 marked the single biggest day of tax \n     collections in U.S. history, at $48,700 billion, according to \n     the latest Treasury report.\n\n  It goes on to compare other months and to further document the \nvalidity of the April shower of revenue coming to the Government.\n  If I were on the other side and writing a budget, I would be very \nfrightened to read about April showers and see how much April showers, \nif continued into the next 2 or 3 years, would do to correct and \nrectify the deficit of the United States and take care of the biggest \nproblem we have, which is deficit spending each year. In just a few \nyears, 2 years, if these April shower rates of revenue continue, we \nwill be approaching a balanced budget in the United States. I, for one, \nwould like to have seen us stay closer to the budget that brought us \nthose April showers than to change dramatically away from those budget \nconcepts that got us those April showers for so many months.\n  We all know it wasn't just 1 month, it was many months. If you look \nback, we have had many months of strong economic performance in this \neconomy, and that strong performance brought with it showers of \nrevenues to the Treasury of the United States beyond anything we \nexpected. We never put down as an estimate during the last two or three \nbudgets anything close to the revenues that came spewing into the \nTreasury because things were going right.\n  That leads me to the conclusion that we ought to be careful when \nthings are going right. We ought to be careful about changing big \nconcepts within that budget for fear that it may stop going right and \nApril showers may turn into something far different. Instead of \nshowers, it may turn into hailstorms. It may turn into blizzards, \ninstead of nice, friendly showers that are yielding tax dollars and \nrevenues to the American Treasury.\n\n  From my standpoint, this budget goes the wrong way. This budget I \nhave seen, the estimates I have been shown, say this budget before us \nwould increase taxes by $736 billion. These tax increases include all \nmarginal rates except the 10-percent bracket, capital gains rates, \ndividend rates, and the alternative minimum tax and education tax \nrelief.\n  As we understand from those who do the estimating, in my State--so it \nmust be in all States--93,000 New Mexico investors, including senior \ncitizens, would pay more because of an increase in capital gains rates \nand dividend rates in this budget. Right off, I believe we ought to be \ncareful with that. Maybe it is the capital gains and the dividends, \nwhich were major changes in policies, that might have had more to do \nwith sustaining the budget and bringing those April showers that didn't \njust occur in April but occurred in May, June, July, and August, those \nlarge revenue chunks that were coming to the Federal Government which \nwere not expected.\n  I submit it is extremely easy to balance a budget and show a surplus \nwhen you utilize one of the largest tax increases in our country's \nhistory. Obviously, when you have a budget such as we had, where you \nhad tax cuts and they were multiyear, and then you stop them, you can \nsay you didn't increase any taxes. But the impact on the taxpayer will \nbe felt as a tax increase because if they were expecting what they had \nlast year, and it goes up because you did not continue with the cut, \nthen they obviously look around to see who raised their taxes. \nObviously, if you stop the tax cuts, then you get increases and the \npublic should know where they come from. It is obvious they will come \nfrom this budget, carrying it out.\n  Once again, let me call to the attention of the Senate that according \nto this Wall Street Journal editorial, in April alone the U.S. \nGovernment collected $70 billion in tax receipts more than the same \nmonth last year for the current fiscal year taxes. Tax receipts are \n11.3 percent, or $153 billion from last year. I am not sure if most \npeople are aware of the fact that on April 24, 2007, the United States \ncollected a record-setting $48 billion in taxes. I am sure the people \ndo not know. There is no reason they should. But we ought to tell them \non a day like this that they did. Tax receipts went up enormously, as I \nhave indicated, and as this editorial indicates. That means if changes \nin policies in this budget are such that they change the winds that \nbrought these showers the Wall Street Journal is talking about, then \nyou will stop getting the showers of dollars that are there and you \nwill get something that will be bad for the American people: The \neconomy will go down instead of up and the kinds of things that yield \ngood April showers filled with revenues will stop being the order of \nthe day.\n  I think we should worry and look long and hard at these numbers \nbefore we consider making changes to the budget policy. Because of \nthese record tax revenues, the budget deficit could be slashed in more \nthan half from this year to the same time next year. The deficit could \nbe reduced to $150 billion this year, which equates to approximately 1 \npercent of gross domestic product.\n  I believe our current budget policy is paying off. The next 18 to 24 \nmonths the deficit could be caused to disappear if we do not vary off \nthe course. This is one point in time where the status quo may be the \nbetter alternative.\n  However, under the budget we are considering if budget surpluses do \nnot materialize, the so-called ``trigger'' will stop the extension of \nany tax relief and we will see firsthand the largest tax hike in \nAmerican history.\n  We are not doing enough to ensure economic stability to the bulk of \nthe Nation.\n  This budget will result in the expiration of the tax breaks that we \ngave to the middle class, causing an enormous tax burden to be placed \non these families.\n  One can clearly see that on a national level, the middle class stands \nto lose the most under this proposal.\n  In my home state of New Mexico, the impact of repealing the current \ntax relief would be felt widely by the middle class.\n  Added to these concerns is that fact that this budget does not \nthoroughly address the alternative minimum tax.\n  Providing a patch for the AMT only leaves us in the position of \ncorrecting this problem in the future.\n  Absent legislative action, the middle class will bear the brunt of \nthe AMT, which will affect significantly more taxpayers.\n  The reverberations of this inaction will be seen all over the country \nand will be especially evident in a state like New Mexico.\n  Coupled with the nonexistent tax relief, this budget fails to address \nthe 800 pound gorilla in the room, otherwise known as entitlement \nspending.\n  After 2010, spending related to the aging of the baby-boom generation \nwill begin to raise the growth rate of total outlays.\n  The annual growth rate of Social Security spending is expected to \nincrease from about 4.5 percent in 2008 to 6.5 percent by 2017.\n  In addition, because the cost of health care is likely to continue \nrising rapidly, spending for Medicare and Medicaid is projected to grow \neven faster--in the range of 7 or 8 percent annually. Total outlays for \nMedicare and Medicaid are projected to more than double by 2017, \nincreasing by 124 percent, while nominal GDP is projected to grow only \n63 percent.\n  The budget currently under consideration does not offer solutions, \nmuch less even address, entitlement spending or reform.\n  I do not support this budget in its current form because it increases \ntaxes and it does not offer any meaningful solution for entitlement \nspending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the debate \ntime with respect to the conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 21 \nbe extended until 3:30, and that time be equally divided and controlled \nbetween the Chair and the ranking member, and all other provisions of \nthe previous order remain in effect.\n\n[[Page S6244]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, how much time now remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With the additional time requested under the \nunanimous consent request, the Senator has 32 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is 22\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I say to the manager on the other side, \nI might take a few minutes. Senator Dorgan is our next speaker. Would \nthat be acceptable?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I recommend the Senator take 32 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is an interesting endorsement of the persuasiveness \nof my appeal.\n  Let me say in response, I want to speak of my respect for the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. The thought of being the person who produced over 20 \nbudgets through the Budget Committee is a stunning concept to me, after \ngoing through this budget.\n  I want to go back to the question he raised about the tax increase. I \nmust say there has been a certain consistency on the other side with \nrespect to tax increases. They have said over and over there is a $700 \nbillion tax increase here. There is only that big a tax increase if the \nPresident's budget also had a big tax increase. Do the math. There is \nonly a 2-percent difference between what our budget raises and the \nPresident's budget raises on a Congressional Budget Office score, and 2 \npercent of $15 trillion is $300 billion. They are talking about $736 \nbillion, so they are saying the President had a $436 billion tax \nincrease. I don't think the President would agree with that math. So if \nthat math is wrong, their assertions about our budget are wrong.\n  It is very simple, at least in the math I learned in Bismarck, ND. I \ngo back to what the President said about his own budget. A previous \nPresident said facts are stubborn things. Indeed they are. The \nPresident's budget, estimated by his own Office of Management and \nBudget, which he controls, said they would produce $14.826 trillion in \nrevenue over the next 5 years. That is the President's estimate of what \nhis budget would do. Our budget, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, will raise $14.828 trillion of revenue over 5 years. That is \nvirtually identical. The President said it was reasonable to raise this \namount of revenue. Guess what. That is what we are doing.\n  Some will say, wait a minute, you are using OMB numbers for the \nPresident and CBO numbers for Congress. Yes, because the President \ncontrols OMB. That is his own estimate of what his budget would do.\n  Let's use CBO numbers for both. Then you get that our budget will \nraise 2 percent more money than the President's; 2 percent on $15 \ntrillion, which is the amount over 5 years, which is $300 billion.\n  I believe you can easily get 2 percent more revenue by going after \nthe tax gap, the difference between what is owed and what is paid; \ngoing after these tax havens, which the Permanent Committee on \nInvestigations says is costing the Treasury $100 billion a year, and \nthese egregious tax shelters, which I have shown repeatedly. We have \nthe remarkable circumstance where wealthy investors in this country are \nbuying European sewer systems, European metro systems, European city \nhalls, depreciating them on the books in the United States to lower \ntheir tax obligation here, and then leasing them back to the cities in \nEurope that built them in the first place. Come on. The vast majority \nof us do not engage in that kind of charade.\n  This is a budget for 5 years, but we all know we are going to write \nanother budget next year. Let's look at the revenue for next year in \nour budget and the President's budget. These two lines represent the \nPresident's budget request for next year, and ours. Do you see any \ndifference? Do you see any daylight? No, because they are identical. \nThere is no tax increase in this budget. I don't know what our \ncolleagues are going to say next year when there has been no tax \nincrease. I don't know what they are going to say.\n  With respect to spending, I want to go back to that question because \nthe spending under our budget is going to go down as a share of GDP. \nHere it is. We are going to go from a spending of 20.5 percent in 2008, \nand each and every year we are going to bring it down until in the \nfifth year we have spending at 18.9 percent of GDP.\n  Let's look at the record on the other side. Let's look at what our \nfriends did when they controlled the budget. They took spending from \n18.4 percent of GDP and ran it up to 20.3 percent of GDP. That is the \ndifference in the spending records.\n  We go back even further to the previous Democratic administration. \nLet's look at what they did. When President Clinton was in office, he \ninherited a spending level of 22.1 percent of GDP. Look at what \nhappened under his administration. Each and every year, spending as a \nshare of GDP--which is what the economists say should be the measure \nbecause that corrects for inflation--under the Clinton administration \nit took spending from 22.1 percent of GDP, which is what they inherited \nfrom the previous Bush administration, and they took it down to 18.4 \npercent of GDP.\n  Again, I know this is painful for my colleagues, but it is the \nrecord. This is no projection. This is what actually happened. They \ntook that 18.4 percent of GDP they inherited in spending from the \nClinton administration, and they ran it up to 20.3 percent of GDP.\n  So when we are talking about who is spending around here, the record \nshows it has been the other side that increased the spending. At the \nsame time they increased the spending, they basically froze the revenue \nof the United States. Maybe we could put that chart up for a minute \nbecause it is good to look at history and look at facts and not use \nthese tired, old nostrums.\n  Here is what has happened to the revenue while the other side has \nbeen in charge. In 2000, the revenue of the United States was just over \n$2 trillion. The Bush administration came in and real revenue went \ndown. In 2001, they had tax cuts; in 2002, revenue went down further; \nin 2003, real revenue went down further; 2004, it stayed down; in 2005, \nit stayed down. Only in 2006 did we get back to the revenue base we had \nin 2000, in real terms.\n  We had this combination, under our colleagues, of a stagnant revenue \nbase for 6 years combined with a 40-percent increase in spending during \ntheir period of control.\n  In dollar terms, 2002 spending was $2 trillion. They have run it up \nto $2.8 trillion on their watch, or a 40-percent increase. With a \nstagnant revenue base, what is the result? The result is that debt has \nexploded. If we can put up the chart that shows what happened to the \ndebt of the United States on their watch, the debt exploded.\n  The word you will never hear leave the lips of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle is ``debt.'' They will never mention it. Here \nis what has happened to the debt while they have been in charge. It has \ngone from $5.8 trillion at the end of the President's first year--we \nwill not hold him responsible for the first year--it has gone to $9 \ntrillion on his watch, and if his budget is followed over the next 5 \nyears, it goes to $12 trillion.\n  Even worse, foreign holdings of U.S. debt have more than doubled \nunder this President, putting us deep in hock to the Japanese, the \nChinese, the British, the oil-exporting countries. Sometimes I get \nconfused because we are borrowing money from so many different entities \nright around the world under this President, putting us deeper and \ndeeper in debt.\n  Mr. President, I see that my colleague, Senator Dorgan, has come. The \nprevious agreement we had was that he would go. But Senator Grassley is \nalso here. Perhaps you could inform us of the time remaining. Perhaps \nwe could work it out so Senator Grassley can go next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama.) The Senator from New Hampshire has \n22\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The Senator from North Dakota has 21\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think the fair thing would be, if I can \nsay to the manager on the other side, Senator Grassley has been here, \nand we really intended him to go next.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time will Senator Dorgan take?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Twelve or fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if we could----\n\n[[Page S6245]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we go to Senator Grassley for 15 minutes, then \nSenator Dorgan for 15 minutes? But before we do that, I wish to respond \nquickly--no more than 2 minutes--to some of the comments made by the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The first point is this: It truly is a budget from the land of Oz \nwhen you make representations that you are not increasing spending \nwhen, by your own terms, you are increasing discretionary spending $205 \nbillion over the President's number.\n  It is equally a budget from the land of Oz when you say you are not \nraising taxes when, in fact, you are raising taxes not $726 billion but \n$916 billion because you have put in place a phony trigger mechanism to \nallege that $180 billion of tax increases will not go into effect when \nit is absolutely clear that they will.\n  It is equally disingenuous and from the land of Oz to claim that you \nare not increasing the debt of the Federal Government when the debt of \nthe Federal Government is going to go up $2.5 trillion and almost all \nthe surplus that you allege to have reached is going to be borrowed \nfrom the Social Security fund, debt borrowed from the Social Security \nfund, and all of the deficit over this period is going to be debt \nborrowed from the Social Security fund.\n  So it is an attack on the Social Security fund, it is an attack on \nthe taxpayers of America with the largest increase in history, and it \nis a dramatic expansion of spending of this Government and growth in \nthe great size of this Government.\n  I would note that the Senator's charts conveniently ignore the fact \nthat we had an Internet bubble which melted and caused a significant \nrecession which was increased dramatically by the attacks on 9/11, and \nthat is why your GDP numbers are skewed during that period, because the \ngross national product did not grow in the face of a recession and what \nhappened as a result of 9/11; and that your outyear numbers are equally \nskewed because you basically presume we are not at war, which hopefully \nwe won't be, and hopefully we can all take credit for that, but the \nfact is you don't even account for the cost of the war should the war \nextend beyond 2009, and so that creates different projections on costs.\n  Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I might just for 30 seconds say that \nwhen the Senator calls this the Wizard of Oz budget, I would accept \nthat characterization of courage, brains, and heart. That is this \nbudget.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, that was not the Wizard of Oz, that was the \nlion--that was the scarecrow, and clearly, if Dorothy looked at this \nbudget, she would find the Wizard of Oz still behind the curtain.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Courage, brains, and heart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the last 26 years, the budget \nresolution provided the necessary resources to allow the committee that \nI used to chair and now am ranking member on, the Finance Committee, \njurisdiction over taxes. It provided us the necessary resources, \nusually in a bipartisan manner, to realistically address the demands of \ntax, trade, health and welfare policies--all things within the \njurisdiction of our committee. So reading this budget compromise, I am \nvery disappointed to say that this year is very much different than \nover the last few years.\n  Now, I know the people spoke in November, and for the first time in \n12 years the Democrats are in the majority and in control of the \ncongressional budget process. As ranking Republican on the Finance \nCommittee, I was not consulted at any point by our distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee on this year's budget resolution. \nUnfortunately, after reviewing the resolution conference agreement, the \nagreement that is before us now, it is clear it does not realistically \naddress the needs of the very important work of the Finance Committee.\n  Despite claims to the contrary, this budget does not provide for even \n1 year, not even 1 year of alternative minimum tax relief, the tax that \nis going to hit 23 million Americans this very year, right now, who \nwere not paying that AMT last year. Now, that is even for 1 year, let \nalone 2 years or even a 1-year extension of the provisions that will \nexpire this year. So this budget puts the burden on the Finance \nCommittee, the tax-writing committee, to come up with the offsets to \npay for the alternative minimum tax relief and for other extenders that \nit is necessary for us to pass.\n  On these immediate needs, on the AMT and other extenders, the \nDemocratic Budget Committee's press release says:\n\n       AMT relief. The conference agreement prevents the spread of \n     the alternative minimum tax so that it does not impose a \n     higher tax on middle income families. It ensures that the \n     number of taxpayers subject to the AMT will not be allowed to \n     increase in 2007, protecting some 20 million middle class \n     taxpayers from being subject to that tax.\n\n  Now, if that were really happening, I would applaud it. I have looked \nover the resolution, I have looked over the statement of managers, and \nI cannot find the basis for what is in the press release. If you look \nat the numbers, unlike the past 6 years of Republican budgets, you will \nnot find tax relief room to accommodate the alternative minimum tax. \nYou will not find any tax relief room for anything, including very \nimportant extenders which are popular around here which everyone wants \nto extend from year to year.\n  The chairman, I am sure, will respond that the Finance Committee tax \ntab will find revenue-raising offsets. More on that in a few minutes. \nWithout question, however, this resolution does not provide the tax-\nwriting committees of both Houses with the resources to prevent the \nspread of the alternative minimum tax for this year or next year to \nthose more than 23 million middle-income taxpayers who were never \nsupposed to be paying the alternative minimum tax. It is simply not in \nthe black-and-white print of this resolution, regardless of what the \npress releases say.\n  Let's turn to the offset point. As a farmer, I would like to think we \ncountry folks can teach people in the city a lesson or two. The first \nchart involves the method a lot of us farmers use to get water. It is a \nwell. Here is the top of the well. I am pointing to the top of the \nwell. You can see it is a long well, and there is some water way down \nat the bottom of the well, but you will see the well is almost dry.\n  Now, as I indicated a few months ago, the budget resolution does not \ncontain tax relief room sufficient to cover the revenue loss of the \nalternative minimum tax and other time-sensitive tax extenders. What we \nare told by those who drew up this budget is that the tax-writing \ncommittees will find the money.\n  The offset well shows about $44 billion in known, identified, and \nscored revenue-raisers which the Senate Democratic caucus has supported \nin the past. I used this chart about 2 months ago. Now I have updated \nit to account for $2 billion in new revenue-raisers developed by the \nFinance Committee tax tab. That figure of $1 billion a month is in line \nwith historical averaging. How reliable is that average, and can we \ncount on it?\n  As a farmer, I know something about the predictability of well water. \nYou hope you will get rain and it will give you a decent level of well \nwater. As a former chairman and now ranking member of the committee, I \nknow something about revenue-raisers. I have been here, done that, been \nthrough all of that. When I was chairman, I aggressively led efforts to \nidentify and enact sensible revenue-raisers aimed at closing the tax \ngap and shutting down tax shelters. As ranking member, I continue to \nlook for ways to shut off unintended tax benefits. So I consider myself \nto be credible on what is realistic when it comes to revenue-raisers.\n  From 2001 through 2006, Congress extended over 100 offsets with \ncombined revenue scores of $1.7 billion over 1 year, $51 billion over 5 \nyears, and $157 billion over 10 years. That figure is reflected in this \nchart. It is reflected in that $51 billion figure you have up there at \nthe top. So if you look at the recent history, we can realistically \nfigure the tax tab will find about $1 billion a month.\n  Right now, all we can find that is specified, drafted and scored by \nthe scorers of the Joint Tax Committee is a big amount of money, but \ncompared to what is needed, a mere $44 billion. The revenue-raising \nwell shows about\n\n[[Page S6246]]\n\n$44 billion in available, defined, and scored offsets at the waterline \nthere.\n  The defenders of this resolution now will say a virtual cornucopia of \nrevenue-raisers is there in this well from the tax gap and shutting \ndown offshore tax scams. I take a backseat to no one on reducing the \ntax gap and shutting down offshore tax shelters. I have the scars to \nshow for those efforts over the past few years. But the defined and \nscored tax gap proposals are already included. That is that figure of \n$6 billion up there on the chart. Likewise, a proposal targeting tax-\nhaven countries and other offshore activities is included at $2 \nbillion.\n  The well has, then, about $44 billion of offset water. This budget \nanticipates a Congress which will be thirsty for this limited group of \noffsets. On the thirst or demand side, you will see the bucket will be \nvery busy.\n  On the demand side, I have talked about the alternative minimum tax \nfix. There is $115 billion for that fix for this year and next year. \nThat is what it is going to take to get that job done, the $115 billion \nthere. That is the biggest sum of money which is going to be demanded.\n  There is $20 billion for other extenders that run out at the end of \nthe year. Then there is $15 billion for Children's Health Insurance \nProgram expansion, and there is another $30 billion for the rest of the \nso-called reserve funds. Here is a chart that lists the other 20-some-\nodd reserve funds. You can see there is a massive demand for revenue \nout there. Each of these reserve funds are an arena for popular new \nspending and maybe new taxes. I will not take the time to read them \nall, but veterans, affordable housing, Indian claims settlement, \nchildcare--all have a basis in this budget. Every one of those would be \npopular expenditures. Since we know from almost a decade of fiscal \nhistory that the Democratic leadership can't propose spending cuts, we \nknow the new reserve fund spending will be paid for with tax increases.\n  These figures reflect only the demands of the first year of a 5-year \nbudget. If you add them up, they add up to $180 billion in demand on \nthe spending and tax side. As you can see, there is about $44 billion \nin revenue offsets. If you assume the tax staff will follow the \nhistorical average of $1 billion per month, then figure about $15 \nbillion more at best. So if we assume, in a manner most favorable to \nthe proponents of the resolution, that there will be $59 billion, then \nthis budget is short by $121 billion for the first year of the 5-year \nbudget. The demands on the tax-and-spending side then exceed projected \noffsets by $121 billion for the first year of the resolution.\n  It is time for all of us to get real about what the proposed spending \nis in this budget, the needs for tax policy that is promised in this \nbudget, and the small amount of offsets that are available.\n  So what is going to happen? How do we bridge that $121 billion gap? \nEither the tax relief and new spending is not going to happen or we \nwill add that to the deficit. That is a frightening proposition, adding \nit to the deficit.\n  Let's take a look at the rest of the agenda to those numbers. Over \nthe 5-year budget, going out to the year 2012, keeping existing \npolicies in place will have a revenue effect of $916 billion. This \nincludes AMT relief, if they are serious about not having those 23 \nmillion middle-income people paying taxes that they were never supposed \nto pay in the first place, and extending other broadly supported \nexpiring positions. In the aggregate, this budget appears to provide \n$180 billion in new resources for extending these policies over the 5-\nyear window. Look further and you will find a trigger. It is the very \ntrigger I talked about last week. Senator Gregg described in great \ndetail how the trigger will work. Suffice it to say the trigger \nconditions the $180 billion in tax relief targeted for 2011 on no \nfuture spending.\n  Is that the real world, no future spending? Does anyone believe this \nDemocratic majority will not spend future tax increases if given a \nchance? If your answer is yes, then you are buying a pig in a poke. A \npig in a poke is what you are going to get, if you believe that. If you \nthink you are going to get a pig, you are going to get cheated. And I \nhave grown a few pigs in my day, so I know the difference between a pig \nand a pig in a poke. This trigger mechanism is a pig in a poke. Don't \nbuy it. You will regret it.\n  So we have a situation where we have $736 billion that we have to \nfigure out what to do about. It is not done about in this budget. You \nhave to deal with tax realities, if you are going to give this sort of \ntax relief. The answer is that we are going to have to find this money, \nand it is not here. So it is not a real budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, first of all, I wish to say the Senator \nfrom Iowa, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, has been a true \ngentleman during consideration of the budget resolution. Obviously, we \nhave strong differences with respect to some of the policies here. I \nwish to say that this man has been a gentleman. I also wish to say, on \nour side, we will not forget his courtesy during consideration of the \nbudget.\n  I do want to say with respect to one of the charts he had up here, he \nhad 2 years of AMT relief. It is true in the Senate budget we had 2 \nyears of AMT relief. In the conference report, we have 1 year. That \nwould change the numbers in his chart from $115 billion to $52 billion. \nSecond, in what passed in the Senate, we had $15 billion of SCHIP \nfunding within the budget and up to another $35 billion in a reserve \nfund. Now all of the funding in what has come out of the conference \ncommittee is in the reserve fund. So the Senator's chart, which I know \nwas prepared some months ago, is not consistent with what the \nconference report is.\n  I wanted to make those two points. I again would say to others who \nare listening, we don't believe there is any requirement for a tax \nincrease in this budget. We only have a 2-percent difference in revenue \nbetween the President's budget and our budget and the CBO score. If you \nlook at what the President said his budget would produce in revenue, it \nis virtually identical to what our budget produces.\n  With that, I yield 11 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota, my \ncolleague, Mr. Dorgan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank my colleague for his leadership. I don't know \nwhere to start with the issues of the pig in the poke and the hog rules \nand all these issues. But I will talk a little about issues that are \nprobably close to something I called the hog rule.\n  First, let me say this: Mark Twain once said, when asked if he would \nengage in a debate, he said: Sure, as long as I can take the negative \nside. They said: We haven't told you what the subject is. He said: It \ndoesn't matter. The negative side will take no preparation. It is easy \nto oppose. That takes no preparation.\n  We have brought a budget to the floor of the Senate and have kind of \nbroken tradition. We haven't had a budget on the floor that got passed \nfor a year. Under the leadership of Senator Conrad, we are going to \nhave a budget today. That is a pretty big step forward.\n  Let me say that with all the budget talk, we went to war a few years \nago and we sent soldiers halfway around the world to go to war. The \ncountry didn't go to war. This Congress didn't go to war. Every single \ndollar we have used to fight that war has been borrowed. We say to the \nsoldiers: Go, fight, put on America's uniform, go represent your \ncountry. But the fact is, the President says: I want emergency \nsupplemental appropriations for it all, and we will add it all to the \ndebt. It is an unbelievable fiscal policy. Send the soldiers to war; \nAmericans, go shopping. That is what we were told to do by the \nPresident. By the way, let's not ask anybody to sacrifice.\n  We see significant fiscal policy problems. This budget begins to \nstart to try to deal with them. They have been growing now for about 6 \nor 7 years. This administration inherited a surplus and very quickly \nturned it into a large budget deficit.\n  This is a budget. Someone once asked the question, if you were asked \nto write an obituary about someone and knew nothing about the person, \nhad never met the person but only had their checkbook registry as a \nframe of reference, what kind of obituary would you write? You would \nprobably be able to take a look at what they spent their money on and \ntell a little something about their value system, what did they think \nwas important, what did\n\n[[Page S6247]]\n\nthey treasure, what did they value. You can do the same thing with this \ncountry's budget.\n  It is true that 100 years from now we will all be dead. But history \nwill record what we have done. They can look at the budget we passed, \nand they can see what we believed were the priorities for this Nation.\n  The President sends us a proposal and says: Here are my priorities. \nLet's propose spending in a way that loses ground on the issue of \nfunding the National Institutes of Health and making the investments in \nneeded cancer research and research into other dread diseases. Let's \ncut back on Head Start relative to the money that is needed to continue \nHead Start for young children. Let's decide that energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy are not as important. These are priorities from the \nPresident. I could go on at some great length.\n  I disagree with that. I think many of these things represent \ninvestments in the country's future. My colleague and those who work \nwith him on the Budget Committee have put together a different set of \npriorities. It is a better set of priorities that says: Yes, there are \nsome areas that are just spending money. There are other areas that \nrepresent an investment in the future. That is why I think this budget \nis a good document. I am pleased today to support it.\n  Let me go to one other piece because I feel so strongly about it. I \nhave offered amendment after amendment on this subject. My colleague \nhas included proposed revenues in this budget from those who are not \nnow paying their fair share. Some say that is a mirage, that is a shell \ngame. You know what is happening. We have a pernicious tax break that \nsays: Shut down your manufacturing plants in America, fire your \nworkers, move your jobs overseas, and we will give you a big tax cut. I \ncan't believe anything quite as foolish as that, but we have it. We \nhave voted on it four times here. I am going to offer an amendment this \nyear again that says: Let's not subsidize moving jobs overseas with a \ntax cut for those who do it.\n  Even more than that, I have used this on many occasions for 2 years \nnow. This is the Ugland House. It sits on a quiet little street in the \nCayman Islands called Church Street. It is a 5-story building, home to \n12,748 corporations. Thanks to some enterprising reporting by David \nEvans from Bloomberg----\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I regret I don't have the time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will use my time. I will take the question off my time, \nnot the answer.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me finish my comments. If I have time, I will be \nhappy to engage. This represents a legal fiction, 12,748 corporations \nsay that this is their home. No, it is not. This is a playhouse for tax \navoidance. That is what this is about. They get to run their income \nthrough here so they don't to have pay taxes to the U.S. Government. \nThey want all the opportunities that come with being an American except \nthe responsibility to pay taxes.\n  Thousands of companies take up residence in tax haven countries for \nthe purpose of avoiding taxes. Many other companies use entirely \ndifferent, yet legal, tax avoidance schemes. One example is the sale of \na German sewage system in Bochum, Germany, that nets Wachovia Bank $175 \nmillion in tax savings. I don't even understand how the transaction \nworks. Does someone walk into an investment banking firm and say: Do \nyou have a sewer section here, or do you have a sewer specialist I \ncould talk to? Because I would like to avoid taxes by investing in a \nGerman sewer system. Maybe the receptionist says: We have a section \nover here in our investment banking firm that actually specializes in \nforeign sewers. Wachovia apparently found one. They saved $175 million. \nDoes that mean they used the sewage system? No. Does it mean they \nactually have a need for it? Does it actually change hands? No, it is \nstill underground in Germany. What it does is, it allows this company \nto avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  How about an American company leasing a city hall in Germany? This is \na town hall in Germany, leased by an American company. For what \npurpose? To avoid paying U.S. taxes. Wouldn't it be great if folks down \nthe block or up the street or out on the farm who have to pay taxes in \nthis country could say: You know what, I have a new idea. You and I are \ngoing to buy a sewage system in England. People would say: Are you \nnuts? That is what is happening in corporate boardrooms.\n  Another example is leasing transaction involving streetcars in \nGermany. An American corporation wants to operate German streetcars. \nWhy? Because they enjoy riding in streetcars? No. They will never get \nin them. It is because they particularly want to avoid paying U.S. \ntaxes.\n  In Chicago, they put together something called a 911 emergency call \nsystem. They put that together. Guess what: When Chicago shoppers \nhunted for bargains a few days after Christmas last year, two big \nfinancial firms landed their own sweet deal. FleetBoston Financial and \nSumitomo Mitsui Banking bought Chicago's 911 emergency call system. No, \nChicago was not in the throes of privatization, the story says from the \nWall Street Journal. This was companies again deciding: We would like \nto buy assets we have no need for that belong to the public, and what \nwe would like to do is use them to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  That is unbelievable to me. I would think every single Member of the \nSenate would look at this and say: That makes me sick, and it has to \nstop--not tomorrow; no, we are not going to begin to wean off this \nsystem--but, right now, we are going to say that nobody is going to be \nable to buy a foreign sewer system in order to decide they are not \ngoing to pay U.S. taxes.\n  Go to any restaurant in this country, any small town cafe in this \ncountry, and sit around and order a cup of coffee and ask the folks you \nare sitting with: Do you think this should be allowed? They would look \nat you and say: Are you out of your mind?\n  Well, the reason I talk about this is because this is in this budget \nto be shut down. Senator Conrad has said--and I have offered amendments \non the floor of the Senate--we are going to shut this kind of thing \ndown. The other side kind of laughs and scoffs at this and says: Well, \nyou can't shut that down.\n  I know, in fact, no one will stand up, if I ask: Will someone today \ncome over to the floor of the Senate and stand up and say: Do you know \nwhat? Count me in. I am a big fan of having U.S. companies buy foreign \nsewer systems. Sign my name to it. Give me credit for it. Nobody will \ndo that. It is kind of in the dark of the night that all this tax \npolicy gets made.\n  That is what my colleague says in this budget: Let's begin to shut \nthat down. Let's begin to collect the revenues, reduce the Federal \ndeficits.\n  These deficits--at some point somebody is going to have to pay them. \nThis administration inherited a very large budget surplus. I stood on \nthe floor of the Senate and said maybe we ought to be a little \nconservative here, and the President and his minions said: No, no, no. \nLet's decide that we want to give it all back, despite the fact we did \nnot have it yet. It was 10 years of projected surplus.\n  Guess what. In a matter of months, we found out we were in a \nrecession. Then we had 9/11. Then we had a war in Afghanistan. Then we \nhad a war in Iraq. Huge surpluses were turned into huge deficits and \nmuch more spending for a war, for which the President said: Oh, by the \nway, we are not going to pay for that. We are going to ask that all of \nit be funded with zero requests in the budget because we are going to \nsend you emergency requests, and you can add it to the deficit. So we \nsend soldiers to war, and when they come back, they can help pay the \ncost of the war because we are not going to do it.\n  That is what is wrong with this fiscal policy. We were on a road to \nnowhere and a road to real trouble, and finally we have a budget that \nbegins to force change. Is it going to happen overnight? No. It is \ngoing to take some time. But this budget is a budget that moves us \nfinally in the right direction.\n  I commend Senator Conrad and all those who worked on it. I am proud \nto be part of it and will be proud to vote for it.\n  Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S6248]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I was struck by the exchange between \nthe Senators from North Dakota regarding abusive leasing transactions \ncalled SILOs and so-called corporate inversion transactions. They \nseemed to express dismay that this body can't shut down these deals. \nListening to them, it seemed like they had no idea that:\n  No. 1, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 stopped the SILO deals \non a prospective basis--no new deals can be done after March 12, 2004. \nAs enacted, JCT scored this provision as raising $7 billion over 5 \nyears and $27 billion over 10 years.\n  No. 2, the Senate-passed version of the JOBS bill, which received the \nvote of 92 Senators, would have shut off future tax benefits from \nforeign SILO deals, like the deals for European sewer systems and \ntownhalls, that were entered into before March 12, 2004, but the \nRepublican House conferees blocked it.\n  No. 3, the American Jobs Creation Act also stopped corporate \ninversion transactions for deals done after March 4, 2003, raising $830 \nmillion over 10 years, according to JCT.\n  No. 4, the Senate-passed JOBS bill would have applied the anti-\ninversion legislation back to March 20, 2002, when I put companies on \nnotice that legislation would shut these deals down.\n  No. 5, just this year, the Senate passed a minimum wage/small \nbusiness bill, which had the vote of 94 Senators. One provision in that \nbill would shut off future tax benefits for foreign SILOs. That \nprovision would raise about $4 billion over 5 and 10 years. Another \nprovision would have denied prospective tax benefits for inversions \nentered into after March 20, 2002. That provision would have raised \nover $1 billion.\n\n  But the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee refuses \nto agree with the Senate on these points. In fact, he held a hearing \nearlier this year to sympathize with lobbyists wanting to preserve \nthese illicit tax benefits.\n  So, in this body, there is near unanimous agreement that Congress \nshould act to stop the future tax benefits from foreign SILOs no matter \nwhen they were entered into. So I am not sure what the Senators from \nNorth Dakota are complaining about. They should be complaining to their \nbrethren across the Capitol, not this body.\n  The North Dakota Senators are preaching to the choir when it comes to \nshutting down tax shelters. Look at my track record. Nobody has been \nmore of a tax shelter hawk than me when it comes to Senate-passed and \nenacted legislation. I want to close the tax gap. I want to shut down \ntax shelters. My track record proves that. But we need to be realistic \nin looking at the amount of JCT scored revenue we can expect to get \nwith sensible, effective legislation. But the assumptions in this \nbudget are just not realistic.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished chairman made a couple of comments \non the charts I used a short time ago.\n  The senior Senator from North Dakota stated first the chart \nincorrectly reflected the SCHIP number. The number used in the chart \nreflects an estimate of the first year, fiscal year 2008, of the \nDemocratic SCHIP proposal. In addition, the senior Senator from North \nDakota said the chart reflected 2 years of the AMT patch. He was \ncorrect. These are, however, 2 years of the patch, tax years 2007 and \n2008, to consider with respect to fiscal year 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez. I thank him for his very \nimportant leadership in the Budget Committee. He has been an extremely \nvaluable member on the Budget Committee and has helped us write this \nbudget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, let me say, as a member of the Senate \nBudget Committee, I am extremely proud of the budget resolution \nconference report before us. I commend the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee for his leadership and for succeeding in the daunting \ngoal of putting together a final budget resolution. It would not have \nhappened without him. I appreciate his depth of experience in changing \nthe direction of our values in this budget.\n  This budget accomplishes what we set out to achieve at the outset of \nthis Congress. It fulfills our responsibilities in key priorities, such \nas children's health care, education, and veterans services. It sets us \non a strong fiscal path, balancing in 5 years, and achieving a surplus \nin 2012. It allows for key tax relief for middle-class families.\n  Now, I have heard a lot of claims being made today about what the \nbudget does and does not do. So let's be clear. I think Americans \nshould know the choices that are at stake because this budget makes \nsome clear choices and sets a very different set of priorities than the \nbudget the President sent to us.\n  Our budget allows for up to $50 billion to be spent on reauthorizing \nSCHIP, so we can ensure that America's neediest children get the care \nand health coverage they need. Now, making the health coverage of our \nNation's most vulnerable children a top priority would seem like a no-\nbrainer for Members of Congress who have access to some of the best \nhealth coverage in the world, but that was not the case in the \nPresident's budget. His budget fell far short of what is needed to \ncontinue coverage for children who are already enrolled, let alone \nenough to expand coverage moving forward.\n  Our budget provides more than $9 billion--$9 billion more than the \nPresident for education. Now, why such a high increase? Well, look back \nat the past few years of education funding under the President, and you \nwill see how much damage we are trying to repair.\n  For the next year alone, the President would have slashed $1.5 \nbillion in Federal education funds, stifled student aid, deepened the \nhole in No Child Left Behind funding, and eliminated 44 programs, from \neducation technology, to dropout prevention, to low-cost Perkins loans.\n  This budget rejects that long list of cuts to education. We increase \nfunding by $3.5 billion over last year, so we can start to reverse the \ndownward spiral that has plagued education under this President and the \nRepublican majorities of the past and provide students the \nopportunities they deserve.\n  Our budget will increase funding for veterans' benefits and health \nservices by $6.7 billion. It meets the request of the independent \nveterans groups and would increase veterans funding by $3.5 billion \nover the President's request. For far too long, under this \nadministration's watch, our veterans have been held hostage to a subpar \nsystem that has failed to provide the care they deserve. Our budget \nputs an end to the funding deficiencies that have set that system up \nfor failure. It also rejects the President's proposal to raise fees and \ncopays for veterans.\n  Our budget shows our first responders that we will put our money \nwhere our mouth is. We will not tell our fire fighters, police \nofficers, and emergency responders that we support them day in and day \nout but then provide them a fraction of the resources they need to do \ntheir jobs. So in addition to rejecting the President's mind-boggling \nproposal to cut first responder grants by more than $1 billion, we \nprovide key increases for homeland security programs, including enough \nto double grants for port, rail, transit, and chemical security. We \nalso restore funds that would have decimated the COPS Program--to put \npolice officers on the streets of our communities--and the SAFER fire \ngrants.\n  Despite all the rhetoric from the other side of the aisle about our \nbudget plan, the fact is, we extend tax cuts that we all agree are \npivotal for middle-class families. Our budget would continue marriage \ntax relief, extend the child tax credit, and lower tax brackets \ntargeted to help the middle class. It would ensure that no new \ntaxpayers would fall subject to higher taxes because of the alternative \nminimum tax next year.\n  Madam President, does the chairman have an additional minute?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield an additional minute to the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Senator.\n  But what is key in our budget is how we achieve this tax relief. The \ndifference is, we pay for it. Under our\n\n[[Page S6249]]\n\nstrong pay-go rule, we will end the days of promising tax cuts now and \npaying for them 10 years down the road.\n  Madam President, I think our plan is clear. This budget is a \nsignificant departure from the debt-drenched plans we have seen from \nthe President and Republicans year after year. This budget ends an era \nof dumping the fiscal burden on our children, our schools, and our \nveterans. Instead of undermining education, abdicating our \nresponsibilities in health care, and neglecting our veterans, this \nbudget restores a commonsense balance to our values that we should \nexpect from the greatest Nation in the world.\n  We have a long road to digging ourselves out of the holes this \nPresident has created. But this budget is a first and sound step toward \nbuilding a stronger nation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, will the Senator entertain a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I say to the Senator, if you have \ntime, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator listed a whole series of accounts where \nspending has been increased. I was wondering if the Senator has added \nup that list he listed there. Is there a total? The Senator listed a \nspecific set of numbers.\n  I added it up to be about $14 billion. Is that incorrect?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I do not have that listing before me \nright now. But the bottom line is, in this budget, whatever are those \nincreases I cited, they are paid for and ultimately meet the challenges \nwe have as a country.\n\n  Does the Senator disagree with any of those priorities we have?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I am trying to get to the bottom of the \nquestion of whether this budget increases spending over the President's \nnumber.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has represented it does not. Yet \nSenator after Senator from the other side of the aisle has come to the \nfloor and told us how much spending has increased.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I think it is a reprioritization of \nthose values within the context of the budget.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, of course it is not. It is a $205 billion \nincrease over the President's number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I make no assertion--I make no \nassertion--that we have not increased spending over the President's \nproposal. Certainly, we do because we have more spending for this \nNation's veterans and for health care for our veterans. We have more \nspending for children's health care. We have more spending for \neducation. We have more money for law enforcement. Why? Because the \nPresident cut the COPS Program 94 percent--the COPS Program to put \n100,000 police officers on the streets. The President says: Cut it 94 \npercent. We do not agree with that. The President says we are not going \nto have the funding for our Nation's veterans, which the Nation's \nveterans say is essential.\n  Madam President, I ask for the time circumstance on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 5 seconds. \nThe Republican side has 4 minutes 1 second.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we now \nextend the time until 3:45 and equally divided between the two \nmanagers.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, that is presuming after this time has \nexpired, so we would not be equally dividing my 4 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Absolutely. I am extending the time past 3:30.\n  Mr. GREGG. The additional time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, there is a consistent inconsistency about \nthe presentation from the other side of the aisle about this budget. \nThe representation it does not raise taxes, on its face, is not \nconsistent with the language in this budget.\n  Why would we have had to have the Baucus amendment, which extended \ntax cuts and reduced taxes--or represented it did--by $180 billion, if \nthere had not been a tax increase in the bill?\n  There is a tax increase in the bill. In fact, the trigger language in \nthis bill, which is now placed on top of the Baucus language, means the \nBaucus tax cuts--which were the original tax cuts of the President and \nthey are being extended--will not come into fruition. They cannot \npossibly come into fruition because of the complexity of the trigger \nmechanism. They are subject to 60 votes. It is a Pyrrhic statement that \nthose tax cuts exist. So this budget has a $916 billion tax increase in \nit.\n  Then, the representation that it does not increase spending--it \nincreases spending dramatically. This is a budget that does what \nDemocrats do: It raises taxes and it spends a lot of money. That is the \ngame plan.\n  Then, there is the representation on the other side that they do not \nwant to impact Social Security. Yet the budget takes $1 billion out of \nthe Social Security trust fund in order to spend on their initiatives. \nThey have a $200 billion domestic spending proposal on the \ndiscretionary side over what the President has. That spending comes \ndirectly out of the Social Security trust fund. It is a direct attack \non the Social Security trust fund.\n  There is, of course, no effort on the entitlement side at all to \ncontrol spending. The debt goes up by about $2.5 trillion.\n  But one of the key elements is this question of the trigger. I asked \nmy staff to try to explain in layman's terms what this mechanism is \nthat will allow the Baucus language to go forward, which would extend \nthe tax cuts of the President of the United States. Well, in layman's \nterms, it is an alleged $180 billion extension of those tax cuts, which \nis subject to conditions only Rube Goldberg could appreciate. So we \ntook a Rube Goldberg chart and we showed the different numbers that \nreflect what is happening. Essentially, the way this works is the tax \nlegislation must include the following contingent provisions:\n\n       None of the tax relief in this act shall have legal force \n     and effect unless the Secretary of the Treasury and the \n     Director of OMB project a surplus in 2012.\n\n  So these tax cuts do not get extended if there is no surplus, and we \nalready know the capacity to spend money on the other side of the aisle \nwill wipe out that surplus because the surplus is such a close number. \nSecondly, the tax relief can cost $180 billion or 20 percent of the \nprojected surplus, whichever is smaller. So not only do they probably \nnot have a surplus so they can't have the tax cut they allege they \nhave--and it is not a tax cut; it is an extension of the tax policies \nwhich are in place today--but they create a mechanism which says you \nare not going to get all of that, you are only going to get 20 percent \nof it, and you know it is not going to be $20 billion.\n  What if the tax writing committees in their wisdom do not include the \ncontingency clause? Well, then we switch to an entirely whole new set \nof miscellaneous conditions on the trigger. The House Budget Committee \nthen has the following authority, the chairman: He will increase \nrevenue numbers in the budget resolution to take away the tax cut if \nthe Finance Committee doesn't include the contingency, and so instead \nof a budget increasing taxes to $736 billion, it actually ends up \nincreasing taxes $916 billion.\n  There were a number of people who were wandering around this Senate \nafter the last budget left here saying: Oh, hey, we included the Baucus \nlanguage which extends those tax cuts which we agreed with the \nPresident on, which are things such as the child tax credit, protection \nof married people from the spousal tax, the tuition tax credit, credits \nfor teachers who use money from their own personal accounts to help out \nin their schoolroom. We extended all those. But now we find out they \ndidn't, and they don't, because they have created this trigger \nmechanism which came from the House which had none of those extensions, \nwhich makes it virtually impossible to presume these extensions are \ngoing to occur.\n  There are a lot of folks around here who are going to walk away with \negg on their face, I believe. They are going to say they voted for a \nbudget last time through where they extended those tax cuts, and this \ntime they are going to try to claim they are doing it again when, in \nfact, what they are doing is setting up a clear action that\n\n[[Page S6250]]\n\ncan't be accomplished. It is another example of a consistent \ninconsistency of this budget.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  I have concluded from the Senator's remarks today he remains \nundecided on the budget. No. I know the Senator is opposed. He has done \na very good job, I might say, of making his side of the case. The great \nthing about our country and about this institution is we have the right \nto come here and debate openly and even passionately our different \nviews, and we have the right at the end of the day here to vote, and \nthe majority rules. For 3 of the last 5 years, this country has had no \nbudget. Hopefully, at the end of today, we will have put in place a \nbudget for our country. That is our obligation and our responsibility, \nand I believe at the end of the day we will have accomplished this.\n  Even though the Senator from New Hampshire and I disagree with \nrespect to the specifics of this budget, we agree on certain very \nimportant things. No. 1, we agree on the importance of having a budget. \nNo. 2, the Senator and I happen to agree--and you would certainly miss \nthis if you were listening to the debate today--but the Senator from \nNew Hampshire and I have strong agreement on the unsustainability of \nour long-term budget situation. The Senator has talked about where we \nare headed in the long term, and I entirely agree with him, that in the \nlong term we have a budget circumstance that is unsustainable, and it \nis going to be important for us to discipline the long-term \nentitlements. It is also going to be important to address these fiscal \nimbalances we face as a nation. We have begun the process by writing a \nbudget that does balance by 2012, with a $41 billion surplus in 2012. \nThe President still has not presented a budget that balances.\n  The Senator has questioned this whole trigger mechanism. It is true \nwe did not have one in the Senate. The House insisted on a trigger \nmechanism in the conference. Let me indicate where we are with respect \nto the way the trigger works.\n  Under Office of Management and Budget numbers, the surplus in 2012 \nwill currently exceed the amount needed to fully implement the Baucus \namendment. The budget resolution surplus, excluding the Baucus \namendment in 2012, is $290 billion. The trigger says you can only use \n80 percent of that amount for tax relief. That would be $232 billion. \nThe Baucus amendment costs $180 billion. So under the current OMB \nprojections, the full middle-class tax relief that was provided for in \nthe budget in the Senate will still be eligible, and that includes the \nrelief for the estate tax reform as well.\n  In terms of how the trigger actually works, under current scoring by \nthe Office of Management and Budget, there is sufficient room to have \nall of the middle-class tax reductions extended and to provide for \nestate tax relief.\n  What happens if this changes? What happens is we go through the year. \nFor example, what happens when we pass a supplemental appropriations \nbill? That will certainly change the outyear forecast. There will be \nother things that may change the outyear forecast. Hopefully, revenue \nwill come in above forecast. Other things will occur. None of us know. \nWhat happens if there is a future military conflict? What happens if \nthere is a horrible natural disaster? We don't know.\n  What we do know is if there are not sufficient resources to permit \nthe middle-class tax cuts being extended, that will not preclude us \nfrom providing the middle-class tax cuts; it would simply mean to \nwhatever extent there is not budget room, we would have to find \noffsets. We would have to find a way to pay for it, or we would have to \nhave a supermajority vote in the Senate. We would have to have at least \n60 votes. Does anyone doubt this Chamber would produce a super-majority \nvote for middle-class tax relief?\n  Let's revisit the Baucus amendment that passed here on the floor of \nthe Senate to provide middle-class tax relief and to provide estate tax \nreform. What was the vote? It was 97 to 1. That was the vote, 97 to 1. \nIn the House, the vote was 364 to 57. Let's not be scaring people out \nacross the country suggesting that the middle class will see their \ntaxes go up. That is not what this budget provides. This budget \nprovides all the money necessary to extend the middle-class tax relief \nand to provide for estate tax reform. Those provisions passed the \nSenate on a vote of 97 to 1 and passed the House of Representatives on \na vote of 364 to 57. So even if we get to the point where the trigger \nis pulled because there are not sufficient resources in 2012, Congress \nretains the flexibility to extend the middle-class tax cuts and to \nreform the estate tax, and the evidence is pretty clear, the vote is \ngoing to be overwhelming to do it.\n  I thank the Chair. I ask at this point the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 seconds remaining on the \nDemocratic side and 4 minutes 50 seconds remaining on the Republican \nside.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest we extend the time until 3:50 and that the \nadditional time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Make it 3:55.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, we heard the Senator represent that the \nadministration doesn't have a surplus projected, and yet he used \nadministration numbers to project a surplus, so more consistent \ninconsistency.\n  But I think a more substantive issue here is the irony of the fact \nthat the other side has such an aversion to letting people keep their \nown money through having reasonable tax rates, such as the spousal--not \nhaving penalties for people who are married, not having a child tax \ncredit, having a tuition tax credit, paying teachers a credit for when \nthey buy extra supplies for their classroom. They have such an aversion \nto those types of initiatives which let people keep their own money \nthat they put in place a trigger mechanism to try to stop those things \nfrom occurring should they want to spend money to basically absorb that \ntax relief. The irony is they don't put in any trigger mechanism for \nthe new spending they are proposing. There is a trigger mechanism here \nthat says: Well, you can't keep your own tax dollars, you can't keep \nyour own money; we are going to take it away from you in taxes, but \nthere is no trigger mechanism that says when we spend a lot more money, \nwhich this proposal does, there should be some second-look mechanism to \nsee if we can afford it. If we are running a deficit, why should we be \nadding new spending? There should be a trigger mechanism.\n  Well, I think it is because there is a philosophical difference here, \nobviously. On our side of the aisle, we believe it is the people's \nmoney and it shouldn't be taken from them unless you absolutely have to \ntake it, and that the Government doesn't spend the money better than \npeople spend their own money. On the other side of the aisle, it is the \nopposite view.\n  The additional irony or the additional inconsistency is those tax \nrates which have most benefited this economy and caused it to grow \ndramatically, and which have most benefited the Federal Treasury in \nthat they have generated a huge amount of revenue we didn't expect, \ncapital gains rates and the dividend rates are not included under any \ncircumstances in this trigger exercise. The people who benefit the most \nfrom those are seniors, because seniors are the ones on fixed incomes \nand have dividend incomes. Seniors are the ones, when they get to that \npoint in their life where they try to sell that asset which they have \nbuilt up over the years--maybe a restaurant or a small business or \ntheir home--and they now are going to, under this proposal, get hit \nwith a doubling of the capital gains tax, or almost a doubling, and a \ndoubling to a 2\\1/2\\ times increase in dividend tax rates. No trigger \nmechanism, no matter how fallacious or fraudulent it is--which this one \nis--is even put in to try to protect them.\n  This is a budget which is truly in the tradition and which is the \nphilosophy of the other side of the aisle, which is that you raise \ntaxes, you spend money, and we in Washington know a heck of lot better \nhow to spend your money than you do, the American wage-earner, the \nAmerican individual.\n  We have been over this ground a lot, and you may think we are going \nover it again and again, and that is because we\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\nare stalling for time, actually. We are waiting for the House to take \naction, and we are hoping they take it fairly soon so we can move to a \nvote.\n  Pending that, however, I do want to take a couple of minutes and \nthank my staff, led by Scott Gudes, who has done such an extraordinary \njob. They work ridiculous hours for low pay and they do it \nextraordinarily well. I want to thank the Democratic staff, led by Mary \nNaylor, who do an equal amount of hard work and probably get paid a lot \nmore, I don't know. But they are special people, these folks who make \nthis place run and work well, and we appreciate all they do. I also \nwant to thank the chairman for his unrelenting courtesy and \nprofessionalism in running this committee. He is always fair with the \nminority.\n  We appreciate that. We try to run a committee that has comity, with a \n``t''; although there is a fair amount of comedy, with a ``d.'' As a \nresult, I think of the personality of the chairman, and we are able to \ndo that. I appreciate his efforts in that arena.\n  He made the point that the country needs a budget. A bad budget we \ndon't need. This is a bad budget. The fact is, the institution \nsubstantively does need a budget. We should not be running a government \nof this size--or any government--without something that gives you a \nblueprint. This blueprint is, obviously, a very poor one, a detrimental \none, because it will grow the size of government and increase the \nburden of taxes, the deficit, and it raids the Social Security trust \nfund. Other than that, it is excellent. The fact is, a budget is \nimportant. So I am obviously of the view that should the Senator from \nNorth Dakota succeed in passing this budget, and we actually have a \nbudget this year, to some degree that is an effort that he should be \ncongratulated for, and it is something the Congress needed to do.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the Senator talks about a philosophical \ndifference, that this is the people's money. I agree with that \nentirely. It is the people's money. It is also the people's debt, and I \ndeeply believe we have an obligation to pay the bills around here. The \neasiest thing in the world is to come to Washington and be for every \nspending program and every tax cut. The problem is, that has led to our \ncurrent circumstance--a debt that is running away from us.\n  Now, this budget does not solve all of our problems. I make no \nassertion that it does. But it begins the process of balancing the \nbudget by 2012, and it begins the process of controlling the growth of \nthe debt, and that is critically important to us as a country.\n  Let me just say that the House vote is underway. I will take a few \nminutes but, first, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side has 3 minutes 49 seconds. \nThe Republican side has 3 minutes 33 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me indicate this is the estimate of \nwhat this budget would do. It would take the deficit from $252 billion \nto a balance of $41 billion in 2012--a surplus in 2012 of $41 billion. \nIt would reduce spending as a share of gross domestic product from 20.5 \npercent in 2008 down to 18.9 percent in 2012. It would begin to control \nthe growth of the debt after 2010. It would bring down gross debt as a \nshare of gross domestic product from 67.7 percent to 66.5 percent in \n2012.\n  On the question of revenue, I go back to this point because it is \ninescapable. The President, when he produced his budget, said he was \ngoing to produce $14.826 trillion of revenue over the next 5 years. \nOurs produces $14.828 trillion. There is virtually no difference. The \nPresident said, when he put out his budget proposal, that was a \nresponsible amount of revenue to raise, $14.826 trillion. Our budget \nraises virtually the identical amount that he said was the responsible \namount to raise for this 5-year period.\n  Now, it is true CBO later came back and said: Mr. President, your \nbudget doesn't raise as much as you said it would. That doesn't take \naway from the fact that the President, when he proposed his budget, \nthought that the amount of revenue that should be raised over this 5-\nyear period is $14.826 trillion. It doesn't take away from the fact \nthat our budget raises virtually the identical amount.\n  Not only do we deal with the revenue question that has been raised, \nwe also provide alternative minimum tax relief so that tens of millions \nof people are not caught up in that tax. We extend the middle-class tax \ncuts. We fully provide for, in the numbers, marriage penalty relief, \nthe child tax credit, the 10-percent bracket, and estate tax reform. At \nthe same time, we move to fund the priorities of this country, \nexpanding health care coverage for children because, not only is it a \ngood investment, but it is the right thing to do. We have up to $50 \nbillion over the next 5 years dedicated to that purpose. We have \nincreased what the President called for in education funding because we \nthink it is critical to help parents who have their kids in college or \nother higher education. So we have increased the President's budget by \nsome 10 percent for education.\n  Also, our third major priority is veterans health care. Goodness \nknows, I think every Member of this body believes we need more \nresources than are provided for in the President's budget to meet the \npromises that have been made to this Nation's veterans. We closely \nfollowed the independent budget advocated by the Nation's veterans \norganizations.\n  We think this is a responsible budget worthy of our support.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 33 seconds on the \nRepublican side. No time remains on the majority side.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, we were summarizing the budget. I think \nthis is important. I think the Senator makes my case because he holds \nup the chart about all the new spending they are doing, which is my \npoint. They do $205 billion in discretionary spending. There is this \ntax increase issue. He holds up a chart that says we are doing the same \ntax as the President, but he doesn't allude to the fact that one of \nthose bars is calculated under OMB and the other under CBO. If you used \nthe same scoring mechanism, it would show a significant difference in \ntaxes. The facts establish that they do not extend the tax cuts that \nthe President was going to extend. They don't extend them.\n  Then they have this phony trigger mechanism, which is a totally false \npresentation, which alleges they are going to extend some tax cuts when \nthere is no way that triggering mechanism can work. If you were to \naccurately put this number down, it would be $916 billion because the \ntrigger mechanism is clearly not going to be exercised, and the true \ntax increase in this budget is the same as the House tax increase as it \nleft the House, which was $916 billion.\n  I think people of fairness would look at the House budget and say, \nyes, the House won the debate, but there was this fig leaf put on to \nmake it look as if there was some tax relief in here from the initial \nproposal. Clearly, the House number is the one that survived this \nprocess--the $916 billion in tax increases, which is the biggest in \nhistory, no two ways about it.\n  Then you add to the debt. Yes, the debt will go up no matter whose \nbudget you follow--the President's budget or the Democratic budget. The \ndebt will grow. I take that as a given. But the fact is, the debt is \ngoing to grow significantly--$2.5 trillion--and it is the growth in \ndebt that is going to be passed on to our children. A lot of it doesn't \nhave to occur. At least $205 billion of it doesn't have to occur. That \nis the debt that will be incurred by spending which exceeds what the \nPresident proposed in the discretionary accounts.\n  Then, of course, is this issue of mandatory savings, which I happen \nto think is the core failure of this budget, besides the tax increases \nand spending increases because it is the outyear when our children are \ngoing to have to start paying these bills, when their lifestyle is \ngoing to be contracted dramatically because of the cost burdens of the \nbaby boom generation, and nothing is done in this budget to try to \naddress that.\n  The proposals out there are not radical. They don't even impact most \nbeneficiaries--the reasonable proposals. We could have saved one-third \nof the outyear unfunded liability in the Medicare accounts by simply \ndoing a couple of things which would not have impacted beneficiaries, \nother than\n\n[[Page S6252]]\n\nreally high-income beneficiaries, people who make more than $80,000 or \n$160,000, retired Senators for example, asking them to pay a fair share \nof their cost of Medicare Part D, the drug program.\n\n  I see that my time is up. I am not sure we are ready to vote yet. I \nhope we are. I am not sure what the status in the House is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I so appreciate the work these two fine \nmen have done on this bill. This was so difficult to get from that \npoint to where we are now. It could not have been done but for the fact \nthat these are two of our most experienced legislators, who work well \ntogether. They have political differences, but they understand the \nimportance of getting a budget resolution.\n  Having said that, and recognizing some urgency in getting the vote \ndone, I ask unanimous consent that the next 5 minutes be equally \ndivided between the two managers of the bill, and if the House vote is \ncompleted at that time--and we believe it will be--the vote occur \nwithin 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the majority leader. He has been \nan enormous and able leader going through this process. I can tell you \non our side that we would not be here today without his absolute \ncommitment to getting this job done, and getting it done right. My \nadmiration for this leader has grown dramatically, and it was already \nhigh. Let me just say what an important leadership role he has played.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I wish to join the chairman \nin expressing my appreciation to the majority leader and to our leader \non this side, Senator McConnell. This was a complicated exercise, and \nthe majority leader has been very cooperative with the Republican side \nof the aisle. We very much appreciate his courtesy to us.\n  Am I to understand that the request was that we would now have 5 \nminutes--well, now we are down to 4 minutes equally divided, which \ngives the Senator from North Dakota 2 more minutes to make my case; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side has 2 minutes. The \nmajority party has 1 minute 57 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I will conclude by saying I think the \ndebate has been vigorous on both sides. I have made my points.\n  At this moment, I thank, first of all, my own staff. Mary Naylor, my \nstaff director. Each and every member of this staff has worked \nextraordinary hours. I cannot even begin to say what it has been like--\nweekend after weekend, night after night. The other night, they were \nhere until 3:30 in the morning. I deeply appreciate the sacrifice and \nthe commitment this staff has made.\n  I also thank very much Senator Gregg, the Republican manager, the \nRepublican ranking member. He is absolutely committed to dealing with \nour long-term fiscal imbalances in a responsible way. While we may have \ndisagreements with respect to this budget agreement, the truth is, our \nlarger agreement about the need to take on these long-term fiscal \nchallenges, to me, overshadows the disagreements we might have on a 5-\nyear budget resolution.\n  I also appreciate the professionalism of his staff, including Scott \nGudes and his entire organization. I thank them. Although I don't like \nsome of the charts they produce, they are really in the best traditions \nof the Senate. They are serious about public service, and we owe them a \ndeep debt of gratitude as well.\n  Finally, I will conclude by again thanking my staff. My goodness, I \nwill never forget the extraordinary effort they put in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I reiterate what I said earlier about the \nwork of the staff, which was extraordinary and exceptional on both \nsides of the aisle. It was fair and very professional.\n  These staff are truly outstanding public servants who work long hours \nand bring a commanding knowledge of policy, program, and, as one might \nexpect, financial analysis. These are professionals who possess the \nskills to dig into the specifics of Federal programs and budgetary \ndata, and they are just as comfortable dealing with ``the big picture'' \nand policy context of spending, revenues, and the overall budget of the \nUnited States.\n  The Budget Committee staff members are truly an integral part of the \nGregg team, which also includes my personal office staff in Washington \nand New Hampshire and my appropriations staff.\n  Our Budget Committee staff is led by Scott Gudes and Denzel McGuire. \nThe core of the Committee is our budget review group, professionals who \nare among the Nation's top budget experts: Jim Hearn, Cheri Reidy, \nDavid Pappone and Jason Delisle. Allison Parent provides our legal \nexpertise as general counsel, assisted by Seema Mittal. Dan Brandt is \nour chief economist. Our health policy unit is headed by David Fisher \nand includes Jay Khosla, Liz Wroe, Melissa Pfaff, and until very \nrecently Conwell Smith and Richie Weiblinger. Our team has a number of \ntalented analysts who handle various, what we call ``budget functions'' \nor programmatic areas and various departments and agencies. This \nincludes Vanessa Green, Winnie Chang, Mike Lofgren, Kevin Bargo, \nJennifer Pollom and Matt Giroux. Along with some of the previously \nnamed staff, these analysts are experts on programs ranging from \nDepartment of Defense weapons systems to agricultural subsidies to FAA \nfees and modernization.\n  Our communications office is headed by Betsy Holahan and also \nincludes Jeff Turcotte and David Myers. Senator Conrad has mentioned \nour charts a number of times today. This office, and especially our \nwebmaster David Myers, has worked tirelessly producing these--sometimes \nmost creative--visual aids.\n  Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not recognize the \noutstanding nonpartisan staff that keeps the committee operating. This \nincludes Lynne Seymour, one of the most professional and decent staff \nmembers ever to work in this institution of the Senate. Lynne, Andrew \nKermick, George Woodall and Leticia Fletcher serve Democratic and \nRepublican staff with dedication.\n  Finally, I would like to reiterate our appreciation to Senator Conrad \nand the majority staff. They are a pleasure to work with. Mary Naylor \nand her staff, people like John Righter, Lisa Konwinski, Joel Friedman, \nJoan Huffer, Jamie Morin, David Vandivier, Ann Page, Sarah Kuehl, Cliff \nIsenberg, Jim Klupner, Stu Nagurka--just to name a few--they are hard-\nworking professionals who give Senator Conrad and the Democratic \nmembership on the committee 100 percent.\n  Of course, the Senator and I have great respect for each other. I \nreiterate my praise of him and the majority leader's efforts in trying \nto get this conference report going and doing it in a fair and honest \nway.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this will be the last vote this week. Our \nfirst vote next week will be a 5:30 p.m. cloture vote on the \nimmigration matter. It appears the Democrats and Republicans have \nreached an agreement on immigration, so we will spend a lot of time on \nthat legislation next week, along with the supplemental.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the House to the concurrent \n     resolution (S. Con. Res. 21), revising the congressional \n     budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2008, \n     and setting\n\n[[Page S6253]]\n\n     forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year 2009 \n     through 2012, having met, have agreed that the Senate recede \n     from its disagreement to the amendment of the House to the \n     text of the concurrent resolution, and agree to the same with \n     an amendment, signed by a majority of the conferees on the \n     part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of Wednesday, May 16, 2007, on page H5071 (Vol. 153, No. \n81).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, we have seen recently where it is the \nintention of the President to designate Lieutenant General Lute to take \na position in the administration as an Assistant to the President and \nDeputy National Security Advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as \nworking with the National Security Council. I have known this fine \nofficer for some time. I have done an overseas trip with him to Africa. \nWe went down to Liberia at a time of great trouble down there with a \nchange in the administration. I have seen him working on the Joint \nStaff. I have had the opportunity to be briefed by him. I want to lend \nmy strongest endorsement for this nomination.\n\n  I also wish to have printed in the Record the history of how active-\nduty military officers have been assistants to Presidents. I point out, \nfrom 1969 to 1970, General Haig was Military Assistant to the \nPresidential Assistant for National Security Affairs. General Haig then \nmoved up in 1970 to be Deputy National Security Advisor. Then in 1973-\n1974, he was White House Chief of Staff and, following that, he had \nother important positions.\n  General Scowcroft, while on active duty, was Deputy National Security \nAdvisor from 1973 to 1975. Admiral John Poindexter was National \nSecurity Advisor from 1983 to 1985, National Security Advisor from 1985 \nto 1986. Lieutenant General Colin Powell was Deputy National Security \nAdvisor in 1987 and then Colin Powell moved up to National Security \nAdvisor from 1987 to 1989.\n  I will have printed in the Record a list of those individuals who \nserved our Presidents in the past in a comparable way.\n  I think it would be advisable if the President were to determine that \nGeneral Lute would have an exemption, a security exemption granted by \nthe President, such that he does not have to respond to the committees \nof the Congress, to come up as a witness. Otherwise, he should get an \nannex office up on Capitol Hill to respond to the many inquiries that \nwill be generated here on the Hill and focused on General Lute to make \na response. I think he can be more effective to the President if he is \ngiven that waiver authority.\n  I urge my colleagues to look with an open mind at this nomination. I \nspoke to Chairman Levin today. He indicated as soon as the papers were \nforwarded, our committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, would \nreview it in the context of our authority to review the change of \nposition and assignments of general and flag officers. It is in that \ncontext that we would have a hearing on this nomination. I hope \nthereafter we can report it to the floor and that the Senate will act \nfavorably upon it.\n  I thank the Chair for its customary indulgence on this, and thank my \ncolleague from Connecticut. I ask unanimous consent that list be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           Rank/name                   Position          From       To\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGEN Alexander Haig............

We have to do something about the 10-percent level for \nthe lower income group. We have to do something about the child tax \ncredit. Since all of them are tax cuts, it is going to cost revenue. We \neven have to tackle the issue of the estate tax, trying to craft a \ncompromise which in this bill allows for then the Finance Committee to \napproach an exemption of $3.5 million per person of the estate tax and \nthen reduce the tax rate from 55 to 45 percent that the balance of the \nestate would be taxed. That would protect the family farms, the family \nbusinesses, the vast majority of them in the country.\n  I compliment the Senator from North Dakota, who has had to be so \ndextrous and so insightful.

Mr. President, over the coming week the Senate has a \nhistoric opportunity to move forward with tough, smart, and fair \ncomprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders, that ensures \nour economy continues to thrive, that protects American workers, and \nthat at the same time undoes the process of committing millions of \npeople to languish in the darkness and be exploited, or we can choose \nto abdicate our responsibilities and tacitly maintain the status quo of \nfailed laws and a broken immigration system that is weak enforcement, \nthat leaves our borders and our citizens unsecured and at the same time \npermits human exploitation to continue.\n  As a group, several Senators, including myself, have been meeting and \nnegotiating on comprehensive immigration reform over the past couple of \nmonths. I appreciate the President making Secretary Chertoff and \nSecretary Gutierrez available to try to reach an agreement that would \ndo those things.\n  I have come, during the course of that process with other colleagues, \nto a better understanding of my colleagues and their thoughts on this \nissue through the many hours we have spent talking together about \nsolving the immigration problems, though I have not always agreed with \nthem. I would like to believe our discussions were serious, thorough, \nand in good faith. At times they were productive, at other times they \nhit obstacles, but when one considers the enormity of the task at hand, \nalong with what is at stake, one would have to be naive in thinking \nthis would be an easy process.\n  One thing we know for sure is that beginning next week, if cloture is \ninvoked, an immigrating bill, in some form, will be considered on the \nfloor of the Senate. I sincerely appreciate the commitment in regard to \nthe time spent and the thought invested on this issue from all sides \ninvolved. The amount of work that has been put into this effort \nrepresents the interest level, not to mention the stakes.\n  I will say, however, that in large part, part of the problem in \ngetting agreement this year was where the administration started off in \ntheir proposal, which acted as a marker in these negotiations. From the \nminute I saw that proposal, it was clear to me we were no longer where \nwe were last year on this issue.\n  Last year, we passed a bipartisan bill, one that a majority of \nAmericans could get behind. It was a historic effort that joined 23 \nRepublicans with 39 Democrats to address an issue of urgent national \nimportance. The bill is the basis of what Majority Leader Reid has \nscheduled a cloture vote for next Monday afternoon. I do hope we will \nbe able to get a vote to be able to continue to proceed. I appreciate \nthe majority leader making this issue a priority, having given us 2 \nmonths of lead time, telling us a very significant part of the Senate's \ncalendar was being reserved for this debate. I appreciate his \nleadership in that regard.\n  However, unfortunately, the administration, along with several of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, decided to radically alter \ntheir views and began the process this year with a far more \nimpractical, in my mind, far more partisan proposal. Evidently, the \nWhite House convinced itself that it must have the support of some \nRepublican Senators who opposed and worked to defeat last year's bill \nin order to pass something this year. Therefore, the White House has \nproposed an immigration reform plan that is far to the right of the \nSenate's passed bill of a year ago.\n  Let me tell you what I believe the principles should be as to how the \nSenate should guide itself as it debates next week. I believe any \nimmigration reform we pass must be tough in terms of the security of \nour country, it must be fair, it must be workable, it must be \ncomprehensive in nature; that preserves, among other things, family \nvalues, keeps us safe as a country, rewards hard work and sacrifice, \nbenefits all Americans, and promotes safe, legal, and orderly \nimmigration. Now, I could not sign on to the agreement announced in \nprinciple earlier today because, in my mind, it does not meet the \nprinciples I just described.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to just state that very \nbriefly in Spanish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. (Speaking in Spanish.)\n  Mr. President, what I just said is I could not sign on to the \nagreement announced in principle because it tears families apart, and \nit says to many that they are only good enough to work here but not \ngood enough to stay. Depending upon the category of individuals, it \nlevies rather high penalties and fines, and it does not provide the \nconfidentiality or judicial review necessary to bring those people who \nare undocumented in the country out of the shadows and into the light.\n  Now, I have serious concerns about the workability and the fairness \nof the\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\nagreement announced earlier because, first and foremost, it tears at \nthe fabric of family reunification by limiting and eliminating the \nability of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to petition for \ntheir children, their parents, and siblings to join them in this \ncountry.\n\n  I took it very much to heart when President Bush said family values \ndon't stop at the Rio Grande, that we all share those family values. \nYet here we are with a piece of legislation which I gather is largely \nsupported by the White House which undermines the very essence of that. \nEven under a new point structure that is envisioned under this bill, it \nseems to me the essence of family could get much more weighty within \nthe context of a whole new process of how we are going to move our \nimmigration system forward. Family is a critical value--I thought--in \nour country.\n  It calls for a truly temporary and, I am concerned, potentially \nBracero-style worker program that labor ultimately will not support and \nthat could repeat the same problem all over, having us face this \nchallenge in the years ahead by the way it is devised.\n  It does not have confidentiality and judicial review, at least not of \nthe standard I have seen to date; it is still one of those floating \nthings out there. The reality is, if we want people to come out of the \nshadows into the light, to know who is here to pursue the American \ndream versus who is here to destroy it, then we need to be able to have \nthose individuals understand that they will, in fact, and should come \nforth so that, in fact, they can go through the process envisioned by \nthe framework agreement but that they will have confidentiality and \njudicial review in the process. Without addressing those issues, the \nsystem that would be created under the proposal would do little to fix \nour broken immigration system in the long term.\n  Now, I support fines for those who have broken the law. But the fines \nthat are proposed are prohibitive, and they make a pathway to \nlegalization a path in name only. A family of four would have to pay \n$10,000 in fines and fees, which is more than last year's bill even \nafter it was amended twice on the floor to increase those fines. That \ndoes not even include the cost of their trip to ``touch back'' when \nthey seek to become a permanent resident. Unable to pay these fines and \nfees, some of the undocumented workers will be unable to come out of \nthe shadows and into the light of American's progress and promise.\n  Giving people the opportunity to come out of the shadows is an \nessential and necessary component of immigration reform because it will \nallow us to recognize who is here to seek the American dream versus who \nis here to destroy it through criminal or terrorist acts such as those \nwhich were recently almost carried out at Fort Dix in my home State of \nNew Jersey.\n  If we had the right set of standards, which I envision us having in \nour bill, and people would come forward, we would have caught those \nindividuals by the background checks we would have conducted. But for \nthose people to come forth, obviously, there has to be some sense that \nin fact there is a real opportunity; otherwise, no one will come \nforward.\n  They also propose virtually doing away with provision for family \nreunification which has been the bedrock of our immigration policy \nthroughout our history. This idea not only changes the spirit of our \nimmigration policy, it also emphasizes the family structure. If this \nsystem had been in place when my mother and father attempted to come to \nthis country, they certainly would not have qualified.\n  As I have listened to the stories of so many of our fellow colleagues \nin the Senate and in the House of Representatives, I know many of their \nparents would never have qualified to come to this country. I would \nlike to think that they made, and continue to make, some very \nsignificant contributions to our Nation. It seems to me a new paradigm \ncould have been structured where family values and reunification have \nmore of a fighting chance than under the framework agreement.\n  As for the temporary worker program, we are inviting in temporary \nworkers but, of course, we expect them to leave. Yes, temporary is \ntemporary, and we are going to rotate them through, but how we do that \nand what pathway at the end of the day we might provide for saying you \nare human capital is incredibly important to this country. As if you \nperform enough of it, there may be an opportunity for you to adjust \nyour status. But the way that the framework document envisions, it can \nsimply create another undocumented workforce. It also sends the message \nthat there are some people good enough to work here but not good enough \nto stay here; there are others good enough to work here and to stay \nhere. If one didn't know what year it was, one might think we were \ndiscussing the National Origins Act of 1924. These and other problems \nwith the proposed deal have to be improved to be able to support the \ntype of reform that will meet the principles I have outlined.\n  Generally speaking, it seems to me we have taken a radical departure \nfrom what we were able to collectively achieve last year. We need to \ntake a hard look at it as we open the debate next week. For the sake of \nmuch needed reform, many Democrats, including myself, showed a \nwillingness, even more than I would have envisioned, to make strides \ntoward the White House's proposal. Even so there are certain issues \nwhere too much bend ultimately creates an impractical and ineffective \nimmigration system.\n  Unfortunately, that is what I believe will occur under the agreement \nannounced earlier this afternoon.\n  I, for one, cannot settle for something that isn't sufficiently \nresponsible in terms of meeting these values--security of the country, \nmaking sure we deal with our economy in a way that doesn't depress \nwages but at the same time realizes certain economic sectors need help \nand preserves family values, and at the same time makes sure we end the \nexploitation that often takes place when those people are languishing \nin the darkness. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it does have to be \nfair, humane, and practical.\n  Part of the magic of our Constitution is that it eventually allows \nthe better parts of our nature to prevail. The better part of our \nnational character is found in the strength we have achieved through \nour diversity. But that better nature must be fought for and fostered; \nin my mind, one of the greatest parts of America's experiment that has \nmade it the great country that it is. I look forward to leading efforts \non the floor of the Senate that will strengthen our security, protect \nAmerican workers, deal with the necessities of our economy, while at \nthe same time upholding the promise and the value of the American story \nthat we hold so dear. We need to improve the framework document that \nhas been announced through the legislative process next week. This is \ntoo important an issue to allow partisan politics to play a role. It is \ntoo important an issue to only be concerned about appeasing a \nrelatively small part of a political base that is unrepresentative of \nthe American public at large.\n  We must come together not as Democrats and Republicans, or liberals \nand conservatives, but as statesmen and, in doing so, honor the \ntraditions of the Senate as a body that values reasoning, honest \ndebate, and compromise over sound bites, talking points, fear, and \nsmear tactics.\n  I know in my heart this is possible. I pray that it is practical and \nthat we can end up with a bill next week that does these things: \nsecures our country in a meaningful way and at the same time makes sure \nthat we can preserve the economic interests of our country in all of \nthe different aspects of our economy; that can say that the promise of \nfamily values we hold so dear and that has been at the core for over \nfour decades of our immigration system can continue to be a reality; \nthat we can end the human exploitation of people within our country, \nand in doing so, we actually make our country safer, more secure, and \nmore robust in its economy. That is where I hope to lead efforts on the \nSenate floor next week.\n\n  I appreciate the work that has been done by the Senators who have \nagreed to the framework agreement. I just believe it falls too short in \nsome of the key principles for me to be supportive.\n  I am looking forward to a bill on which we can join together and say: \nWe did the best for the Nation. We did what is humanely right. We did \nwhat is right for the Nation in terms of its security and its economy, \nand we have\n\n[[Page S6256]]\n\npreserved the very essence of what this Nation has been about.\n  From my home State of New Jersey, which was a gateway to millions of \npeople across this country, particularly during the period of Ellis \nIsland, we can almost touch Lady Liberty. Ellis Island is a short \nbridge walk across. The reality is that because of those people who \nhave contributed so dramatically to our country, we all have a \nrelationship to immigration--whether you can trace your history to the \nMayflower and the voyage of that first opportunity, whether you are \npart of the Daughters of the American Revolution, whether you came with \nthe millions in the European experience that crossed a great ocean \nthrough Ellis Island and then throughout our country, whether you came, \nas my parents did, in search of freedom, the reality is, we all have a \nconnection. Let's honor that connection in a way that meets these \nvalues. Let' meet that challenge.\n  I hope we can do so next week as the Senate convenes on this historic \ndebate. I look forward to that opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wanted to have an opportunity to speak \nfor a moment on this very timely issue of immigration. I heard my \ncolleague from New Jersey speaking. I know how hard he has worked with \nus to try to achieve a solution to this very difficult problem the \ncountry has faced for now over 20 years. I am disappointed that what we \ndid fell short of his hopes. I thought I would take a moment and \nrespond to some of his comments, but also in the hopes of inviting him \nback into the process where his support would be so welcome and so \nvital.\n  First, I should say there is nothing easy about this issue. There is \nnothing easy about the solution that we crafted, nor does it claim any \nsort of perfection associated with it because it is an imperfect bill. \nBut it is a compromise. So what it implies by a compromise is that \nthere are some things in it that I wholeheartedly support. There are \nsome things that I might have liked to have seen differently. At the \nend of the day, that is how legislation is made. That is how it \nhappens. We all give a little, and we end up someplace where we can \nmove the country forward and provide the country with a way to resolve \nthis very difficult issue that we call immigration.\n  One of the notions I would appreciate dispelling is the fact that \nthis is a White House bill. It is not. This is just as much a Senator \nKennedy bill as it is a Senator Kyl bill, and a Senator Martinez bill \nas it is a Senator Salazar bill. I could name others: Senator Graham, \nSenator McCain, Senator Isakson. This bill has a great deal of balance \nbecause it not only enforces our borders first and foremost, which is \nwhat all Americans want at a time when our shores are threatened by \npotential terrorists, but it, secondly, does not do any of the other \nthings that will be done in the bill until certain triggers are met, \nthose triggers to have been in place as far as border security is \nconcerned, the hiring of border agents, building the fencing, building \nof other physical and electronic barriers.\n  Then we move into another phase which is to provide a tamper-proof \nID. This will ensure that those who are working will work legally. It \nthen moves into other areas such as a guest worker program. This is a \nguest worker program which is a temporary worker program. It is not \nintended as a vehicle to immigration. It is to provide the labor that \nAmerica needs in certain places and also to provide a good-paying job \nto certain people in other parts of the world who want to work here, \nbut with a clear understanding before ever coming that they are coming \nto work for a limited period of time, much as a student visa holder \ncomes for 2 years to go to school, coming for 2 years to go to work. \nThen they go home. They can renew that visa a couple of times.\n  Then a number of them will, if they acquire certain prerequisites, \napply for permanent status here. Obviously, if they learned English, \nthat would help them. If they learn a trade, that would help them. If \ntheir employer says they are a good worker, that would help them. That \nwill be the basis for future immigration.\n  There still is a family component to immigration. Husband, wife, \nchildren, can come, grandparents--40,000 a year of parents can come. \nWhat we are going to do is change the paradigm to one where more merit \nis included in the equation. There will be a point system. Family will \noften be a tiebreaker. That will be maintained. But the paradigm of \nimmigration will shift to a different one. It will then give the 12 \nmillion people who are here today living in the shadows an opportunity \nto come out of the shadows.\n  I don't know how anyone can overlook the significance of that act, \nthe fact that this country of immigrants and this country of laws will \nbe generous enough to say to those 12 million that are here, having \ncome illegally to our country but who have worked, as long as they pay \nfines, as long as they obey the law and have not gotten in trouble, and \nas long as they are willing to learn the English language, they can \nhave a path forward to stay here and continue to work. If they go back \nto their home country, they also can apply for permanent residence and \nget in back of the line as any fairness would dictate.\n  Fines, of course there will be fines. They can be paid over a period \nof years. They are not exorbitant, and they are only to the head of \nhousehold. In this bill is the DREAM Act, an incredible achievement for \nthe dream of education. The 12 million people living in the shadows in \nthis country today find oftentimes their future dreams of a college \neducation truncated by the inability to pay the tuition and the out-of-\nState fees. The DREAM Act is in this bill. That is an important \nconsideration.\n  Part of this bill is going to take care of the agricultural needs of \nthe country which is significant. I know in Florida, whether it is \nagricultural or hotel workers, whether it is theme park workers, in the \ntourism industry we desperately need workers. There are not enough \nthere today. So the temporary worker program will help our economy \nwhile it helps people to have a good and decent job.\n  I think there are some things here that are tremendously positive. It \nis a very exciting day, and I am delighted to be a part of the \ncompromise. Obviously, there will be politics all over the place. The \nright and the left will be criticizing many of us for having taken what \nI think is a very strong bipartisan step forward.\n  This is a coalition of many Senators working to pull something \ntogether that has been difficult, that is never going to be easy to do. \nI look forward to the debate in the Senate next week as we try to craft \na solution for America going forward.\n  I thank the President for his leadership on this issue, and Secretary \nChertoff and Secretary Gutierrez, who have been here countless hours, \nand my other colleagues who have been in the room--Senator Menendez, \nwho was finding it difficult to support the bill today but who has been \nthere time and time again--and the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, who \nhas tried, also, and may not be completely satisfied, but they have \nbeen in the very dynamics of seeing good, dedicated servants, such as \nthese two Senators who are finding it difficult. We see the difficulty \nof this bill.\n  What I would hope is that a good nucleus of us will pull together, \nwill come together. My hope is Senators Cornyn and Salazar and \nMenendez, and many others, will find it possible to support this bill \nas we go into the debate next week. There will be opportunities to \noffer amendments. There may be ways of making it better. There could \nalso be ways to make it a lot worse. My hope is we can hang together on \nthis nucleus of a compromise that will make America stronger, that will \ngive some charity to people who are here, while at the same time giving \nAmerica the assurance that our borders are going to be secured.\n  It is not perfect. It is the best solution we could find today \nworking together in good faith, in a bipartisan way. I hope the Senate \nwill pass it. I hope it moves swiftly through the House, and we get it \nto the President's desk as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I appreciate the President making Secretary Chertoff and \nSecretary Gutierrez available to try to reach an agreement that would \ndo those things.\n  I have come, during the course of that process with other colleagues, \nto a better understanding of my colleagues and their thoughts on this \nissue through the many hours we have spent talking together about \nsolving the immigration problems, though I have not always agreed with \nthem. I would like to believe our discussions were serious, thorough, \nand in good faith. At times they were productive, at other times they \nhit obstacles, but when one considers the enormity of the task at hand, \nalong with what is at stake, one would have to be naive in thinking \nthis would be an easy process.\n  One thing we know for sure is that beginning next week, if cloture is \ninvoked, an immigrating bill, in some form, will be considered on the \nfloor of the Senate. I sincerely appreciate the commitment in regard to \nthe time spent and the thought invested on this issue from all sides \ninvolved. The amount of work that has been put into this effort \nrepresents the interest level, not to mention the stakes.\n  I will say, however, that in large part, part of the problem in \ngetting agreement this year was where the administration started off in \ntheir proposal, which acted as a marker in these negotiations. From the \nminute I saw that proposal, it was clear to me we were no longer where \nwe were last year on this issue.\n  Last year, we passed a bipartisan bill, one that a majority of \nAmericans could get behind. It was a historic effort that joined 23 \nRepublicans with 39 Democrats to address an issue of urgent national \nimportance. The bill is the basis of what Majority Leader Reid has \nscheduled a cloture vote for next Monday afternoon. I do hope we will \nbe able to get a vote to be able to continue to proceed. I appreciate \nthe majority leader making this issue a priority, having given us 2 \nmonths of lead time, telling us a very significant part of the Senate's \ncalendar was being reserved for this debate. I appreciate his \nleadership in that regard.\n  However, unfortunately, the administration, along with several of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, decided to radically alter \ntheir views and began the process this year with a far more \nimpractical, in my mind, far more partisan proposal. Evidently, the \nWhite House convinced itself that it must have the support of some \nRepublican Senators who opposed and worked to defeat last year's bill \nin order to pass something this year. Therefore, the White House has \nproposed an immigration reform plan that is far to the right of the \nSenate's passed bill of a year ago.\n  Let me tell you what I believe the principles should be as to how the \nSenate should guide itself as it debates next week. I believe any \nimmigration reform we pass must be tough in terms of the security of \nour country, it must be fair, it must be workable, it must be \ncomprehensive in nature; that preserves, among other things, family \nvalues, keeps us safe as a country, rewards hard work and sacrifice, \nbenefits all Americans, and promotes safe, legal, and orderly \nimmigration. Now, I could not sign on to the agreement announced in \nprinciple earlier today because, in my mind, it does not meet the \nprinciples I just described.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to just state that very \nbriefly in Spanish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. (Speaking in Spanish.)\n  Mr. President, what I just said is I could not sign on to the \nagreement announced in principle because it tears families apart, and \nit says to many that they are only good enough to work here but not \ngood enough to stay. Depending upon the category of individuals, it \nlevies rather high penalties and fines, and it does not provide the \nconfidentiality or judicial review necessary to bring those people who \nare undocumented in the country out of the shadows and into the light.\n  Now, I have serious concerns about the workability and the fairness \nof the\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\nagreement announced earlier because, first and foremost, it tears at \nthe fabric of family reunification by limiting and eliminating the \nability of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to petition for \ntheir children, their parents, and siblings to join them in this \ncountry.\n\n  I took it very much to heart when President Bush said family values \ndon't stop at the Rio Grande, that we all share those family values. \nYet here we are with a piece of legislation which I gather is largely \nsupported by the White House which undermines the very essence of that. \nEven under a new point structure that is envisioned under this bill, it \nseems to me the essence of family could get much more weighty within \nthe context of a whole new process of how we are going to move our \nimmigration system forward. Family is a critical value--I thought--in \nour country.\n  It calls for a truly temporary and, I am concerned, potentially \nBracero-style worker program that labor ultimately will not support and \nthat could repeat the same problem all over, having us face this \nchallenge in the years ahead by the way it is devised.\n  It does not have confidentiality and judicial review, at least not of \nthe standard I have seen to date; it is still one of those floating \nthings out there. The reality is, if we want people to come out of the \nshadows into the light, to know who is here to pursue the American \ndream versus who is here to destroy it, then we need to be able to have \nthose individuals understand that they will, in fact, and should come \nforth so that, in fact, they can go through the process envisioned by \nthe framework agreement but that they will have confidentiality and \njudicial review in the process. Without addressing those issues, the \nsystem that would be created under the proposal would do little to fix \nour broken immigration system in the long term.\n  Now, I support fines for those who have broken the law. But the fines \nthat are proposed are prohibitive, and they make a pathway to \nlegalization a path in name only. A family of four would have to pay \n$10,000 in fines and fees, which is more than last year's bill even \nafter it was amended twice on the floor to increase those fines. That \ndoes not even include the cost of their trip to ``touch back'' when \nthey seek to become a permanent resident. Unable to pay these fines and \nfees, some of the undocumented workers will be unable to come out of \nthe shadows and into the light of American's progress and promise.\n  Giving people the opportunity to come out of the shadows is an \nessential and necessary component of immigration reform because it will \nallow us to recognize who is here to seek the American dream versus who \nis here to destroy it through criminal or terrorist acts such as those \nwhich were recently almost carried out at Fort Dix in my home State of \nNew Jersey.\n  If we had the right set of standards, which I envision us having in \nour bill, and people would come forward, we would have caught those \nindividuals by the background checks we would have conducted. But for \nthose people to come forth, obviously, there has to be some sense that \nin fact there is a real opportunity; otherwise, no one will come \nforward.\n  They also propose virtually doing away with provision for family \nreunification which has been the bedrock of our immigration policy \nthroughout our history. This idea not only changes the spirit of our \nimmigration policy, it also emphasizes the family structure. If this \nsystem had been in place when my mother and father attempted to come to \nthis country, they certainly would not have qualified.\n  As I have listened to the stories of so many of our fellow colleagues \nin the Senate and in the House of Representatives, I know many of their \nparents would never have qualified to come to this country. I would \nlike to think that they made, and continue to make, some very \nsignificant contributions to our Nation. It seems to me a new paradigm \ncould have been structured where family values and reunification have \nmore of a fighting chance than under the framework agreement.\n  As for the temporary worker program, we are inviting in temporary \nworkers but, of course, we expect them to leave. Yes, temporary is \ntemporary, and we are going to rotate them through, but how we do that \nand what pathway at the end of the day we might provide for saying you \nare human capital is incredibly important to this country. As if you \nperform enough of it, there may be an opportunity for you to adjust \nyour status. But the way that the framework document envisions, it can \nsimply create another undocumented workforce. It also sends the message \nthat there are some people good enough to work here but not good enough \nto stay here; there are others good enough to work here and to stay \nhere. If one didn't know what year it was, one might think we were \ndiscussing the National Origins Act of 1924. These and other problems \nwith the proposed deal have to be improved to be able to support the \ntype of reform that will meet the principles I have outlined.\n  Generally speaking, it seems to me we have taken a radical departure \nfrom what we were able to collectively achieve last year. We need to \ntake a hard look at it as we open the debate next week. For the sake of \nmuch needed reform, many Democrats, including myself, showed a \nwillingness, even more than I would have envisioned, to make strides \ntoward the White House's proposal. Even so there are certain issues \nwhere too much bend ultimately creates an impractical and ineffective \nimmigration system.\n  Unfortunately, that is what I believe will occur under the agreement \nannounced earlier this afternoon.\n  I, for one, cannot settle for something that isn't sufficiently \nresponsible in terms of meeting these values--security of the country, \nmaking sure we deal with our economy in a way that doesn't depress \nwages but at the same time realizes certain economic sectors need help \nand preserves family values, and at the same time makes sure we end the \nexploitation that often takes place when those people are languishing \nin the darkness. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it does have to be \nfair, humane, and practical.\n  Part of the magic of our Constitution is that it eventually allows \nthe better parts of our nature to prevail. The better part of our \nnational character is found in the strength we have achieved through \nour diversity. But that better nature must be fought for and fostered; \nin my mind, one of the greatest parts of America's experiment that has \nmade it the great country that it is. I look forward to leading efforts \non the floor of the Senate that will strengthen our security, protect \nAmerican workers, deal with the necessities of our economy, while at \nthe same time upholding the promise and the value of the American story \nthat we hold so dear. We need to improve the framework document that \nhas been announced through the legislative process next week. This is \ntoo important an issue to allow partisan politics to play a role. It is \ntoo important an issue to only be concerned about appeasing a \nrelatively small part of a political base that is unrepresentative of \nthe American public at large.\n  We must come together not as Democrats and Republicans, or liberals \nand conservatives, but as statesmen and, in doing so, honor the \ntraditions of the Senate as a body that values reasoning, honest \ndebate, and compromise over sound bites, talking points, fear, and \nsmear tactics.\n  I know in my heart this is possible. I pray that it is practical and \nthat we can end up with a bill next week that does these things: \nsecures our country in a meaningful way and at the same time makes sure \nthat we can preserve the economic interests of our country in all of \nthe different aspects of our economy; that can say that the promise of \nfamily values we hold so dear and that has been at the core for over \nfour decades of our immigration system can continue to be a reality; \nthat we can end the human exploitation of people within our country, \nand in doing so, we actually make our country safer, more secure, and \nmore robust in its economy. That is where I hope to lead efforts on the \nSenate floor next week.\n\n  I appreciate the work that has been done by the Senators who have \nagreed to the framework agreement. I just believe it falls too short in \nsome of the key principles for me to be supportive.\n  I am looking forward to a bill on which we can join together and say: \nWe did the best for the Nation. We did what is humanely right. We did \nwhat is right for the Nation in terms of its security and its economy, \nand we have\n\n[[Page S6256]]\n\npreserved the very essence of what this Nation has been about.\n  From my home State of New Jersey, which was a gateway to millions of \npeople across this country, particularly during the period of Ellis \nIsland, we can almost touch Lady Liberty. Ellis Island is a short \nbridge walk across. The reality is that because of those people who \nhave contributed so dramatically to our country, we all have a \nrelationship to immigration--whether you can trace your history to the \nMayflower and the voyage of that first opportunity, whether you are \npart of the Daughters of the American Revolution, whether you came with \nthe millions in the European experience that crossed a great ocean \nthrough Ellis Island and then throughout our country, whether you came, \nas my parents did, in search of freedom, the reality is, we all have a \nconnection. Let's honor that connection in a way that meets these \nvalues. Let' meet that challenge.\n  I hope we can do so next week as the Senate convenes on this historic \ndebate. I look forward to that opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wanted to have an opportunity to speak \nfor a moment on this very timely issue of immigration. I heard my \ncolleague from New Jersey speaking. I know how hard he has worked with \nus to try to achieve a solution to this very difficult problem the \ncountry has faced for now over 20 years. I am disappointed that what we \ndid fell short of his hopes. I thought I would take a moment and \nrespond to some of his comments, but also in the hopes of inviting him \nback into the process where his support would be so welcome and so \nvital.\n  First, I should say there is nothing easy about this issue. There is \nnothing easy about the solution that we crafted, nor does it claim any \nsort of perfection associated with it because it is an imperfect bill. \nBut it is a compromise. So what it implies by a compromise is that \nthere are some things in it that I wholeheartedly support. There are \nsome things that I might have liked to have seen differently. At the \nend of the day, that is how legislation is made. That is how it \nhappens. We all give a little, and we end up someplace where we can \nmove the country forward and provide the country with a way to resolve \nthis very difficult issue that we call immigration.\n  One of the notions I would appreciate dispelling is the fact that \nthis is a White House bill. It is not. This is just as much a Senator \nKennedy bill as it is a Senator Kyl bill, and a Senator Martinez bill \nas it is a Senator Salazar bill. I could name others: Senator Graham, \nSenator McCain, Senator Isakson. This bill has a great deal of balance \nbecause it not only enforces our borders first and foremost, which is \nwhat all Americans want at a time when our shores are threatened by \npotential terrorists, but it, secondly, does not do any of the other \nthings that will be done in the bill until certain triggers are met, \nthose triggers to have been in place as far as border security is \nconcerned, the hiring of border agents, building the fencing, building \nof other physical and electronic barriers.\n  Then we move into another phase which is to provide a tamper-proof \nID. This will ensure that those who are working will work legally. It \nthen moves into other areas such as a guest worker program. This is a \nguest worker program which is a temporary worker program. It is not \nintended as a vehicle to immigration. It is to provide the labor that \nAmerica needs in certain places and also to provide a good-paying job \nto certain people in other parts of the world who want to work here, \nbut with a clear understanding before ever coming that they are coming \nto work for a limited period of time, much as a student visa holder \ncomes for 2 years to go to school, coming for 2 years to go to work. \nThen they go home. They can renew that visa a couple of times.\n  Then a number of them will, if they acquire certain prerequisites, \napply for permanent status here. Obviously, if they learned English, \nthat would help them. If they learn a trade, that would help them. If \ntheir employer says they are a good worker, that would help them. That \nwill be the basis for future immigration.\n  There still is a family component to immigration. Husband, wife, \nchildren, can come, grandparents--40,000 a year of parents can come. \nWhat we are going to do is change the paradigm to one where more merit \nis included in the equation. There will be a point system. Family will \noften be a tiebreaker. That will be maintained. But the paradigm of \nimmigration will shift to a different one. It will then give the 12 \nmillion people who are here today living in the shadows an opportunity \nto come out of the shadows.\n  I don't know how anyone can overlook the significance of that act, \nthe fact that this country of immigrants and this country of laws will \nbe generous enough to say to those 12 million that are here, having \ncome illegally to our country but who have worked, as long as they pay \nfines, as long as they obey the law and have not gotten in trouble, and \nas long as they are willing to learn the English language, they can \nhave a path forward to stay here and continue to work. If they go back \nto their home country, they also can apply for permanent residence and \nget in back of the line as any fairness would dictate.\n  Fines, of course there will be fines. They can be paid over a period \nof years. They are not exorbitant, and they are only to the head of \nhousehold. In this bill is the DREAM Act, an incredible achievement for \nthe dream of education. The 12 million people living in the shadows in \nthis country today find oftentimes their future dreams of a college \neducation truncated by the inability to pay the tuition and the out-of-\nState fees. The DREAM Act is in this bill. That is an important \nconsideration.\n  Part of this bill is going to take care of the agricultural needs of \nthe country which is significant. I know in Florida, whether it is \nagricultural or hotel workers, whether it is theme park workers, in the \ntourism industry we desperately need workers. There are not enough \nthere today. So the temporary worker program will help our economy \nwhile it helps people to have a good and decent job.\n  I think there are some things here that are tremendously positive. It \nis a very exciting day, and I am delighted to be a part of the \ncompromise. Obviously, there will be politics all over the place. The \nright and the left will be criticizing many of us for having taken what \nI think is a very strong bipartisan step forward.\n  This is a coalition of many Senators working to pull something \ntogether that has been difficult, that is never going to be easy to do. \nI look forward to the debate in the Senate next week as we try to craft \na solution for America going forward.\n  I thank the President for his leadership on this issue, and Secretary \nChertoff and Secretary Gutierrez, who have been here countless hours, \nand my other colleagues who have been in the room--Senator Menendez, \nwho was finding it difficult to support the bill today but who has been \nthere time and time again--and the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, who \nhas tried, also, and may not be completely satisfied, but they have \nbeen in the very dynamics of seeing good, dedicated servants, such as \nthese two Senators who are finding it difficult. We see the difficulty \nof this bill.\n  What I would hope is that a good nucleus of us will pull together, \nwill come together. My hope is Senators Cornyn and Salazar and \nMenendez, and many others, will find it possible to support this bill \nas we go into the debate next week. There will be opportunities to \noffer amendments. There may be ways of making it better. There could \nalso be ways to make it a lot worse. My hope is we can hang together on \nthis nucleus of a compromise that will make America stronger, that will \ngive some charity to people who are here, while at the same time giving \nAmerica the assurance that our borders are going to be secured.\n  It is not perfect. It is the best solution we could find today \nworking together in good faith, in a bipartisan way. I hope the Senate \nwill pass it. I hope it moves swiftly through the House, and we get it \nto the President's desk as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S6257]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6257-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6257-S6258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier this week, I spoke to my \ncolleagues on fleshing out some of the options that may be circulating \namong the current Democratic majority in the other body, meaning the \nHouse of Representatives, for resolving the crescendo of the \nalternative minimum tax crisis that faces us right now in May of 2007, \nand for all the months before--and if we do not do something, all the \nmonths for the rest of this year, in which 23 million taxpayers who do \nnot pay the alternative minimum tax, will be hit by it. These are 23 \nmillion people who were never intended to pay the alternative minimum \ntax because they are not considered the superwealthy.\n  As I said earlier this week, I do not like what I am hearing about \nwhat is going on in the other body, what they may put on the table in \nterms of paying for the alternative minimum tax, and the solution for \nthat problem that is a fact of tax law right now.\n  However, I want to make perfectly clear a point on which I agree with \nthe other party and the other body. I completely agree that dealing \nwith the AMT is a priority issue and that Congress needs to address it.\n  The alternative minimum tax is an absolutely maddening tax that has \ninsidiously crept into the homes of more and more families each year. I \nhave spoken on this floor about its repeal--about its repeal--because, \nNo. 1, it is hitting people it was not intended to hit, and also there \nare thousands it was intended to hit who have found ways out of paying \nthe alternative minimum tax. So then you get into the ridiculous \nsituation of people paying it who are not superrich, and you have \nsuperrich people it was intended to hit in 1969, when it was first put \nin place, who have found ways around it. So if it ``ain't'' working, \nthen it is obviously broken, and you need to fix it.\n  The numbers of families paying the alternative minimum tax will rise \nfrom 4 million families, last year, to 23 million families in 2007--\nunless we take legislative action.\n  Chairman Baucus, my Democratic leader in our committee, and I \nintroduced legislation on the first day of the 110th Congress to repeal \nthe individual alternative minimum tax beginning in the 2007 tax year. \nBut, of course, it does not appear that the Democratic leadership is \neager to take up that legislation.\n  In each of the past 6 years, Congress has, in fact, passed \nlegislation which at least for a temporary period of time successfully \nkept more people from paying the alternative minimum tax by increasing \nthe amount of income that is exempt from the alternative minimum tax. \nIn other words, by increasing the exempt amount, additional people were \nnot hit by the alternative minimum tax.\n  These temporary exemptions that have happened over the last 6 years \nhave prevented the alternative minimum tax from harming more and more \nmiddle-class Americans. Most recently, Congress acted to prevent \nmillions of taxpayers from receiving a surprise on their 2006 tax \nreturns by including an extension of this temporary AMT exemption \nincrease in what is called the Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act of 2005.\n  In that 2005 bill, the exemption for married couples filing jointly \nwas increased from $58,000 to $62,550 for the 2006 tax year.\n  This week marks the 1-year anniversary of the enactment of that bill \nin 2005--well, actually, it was not signed by the President until 2006. \nNearly 20 million American families who were exempt from the AMT \nbecause of the temporary exemption increase in 2006 knew at this time \nlast year Congress was moving to not tax many more millions of people \nby the alternative minimum tax in last year's tax earnings season.\n  This year, those families have no such assurance because the \nDemocratic leadership--now in the majority as a result of the last \nelection--in this Congress does not appear to be moving any legislation \nto address the alternative minimum tax.\n  Some of you may wonder why this is a pressing issue. Maybe you take \nthe view that you need not address this because the AMT is such a \nstealth tax that millions of Americans who are going to owe AMT for \n2007 have not even thought of that issue yet. It is something for which \nyou might get the rude awakening after the first of next year as you \nprepare your income tax, and all of a sudden--boom--23 million more \nAmericans are hit by this tax. So you do not worry about it during this \n12 months. But do not play the American people for a fool.\n  I can understand why the taxpayers may not be thinking about it \nbecause for the past 6 years, as a second point, the Congress has \naddressed the issue on a timely basis, and the taxpayers did not miss a \nbeat. When the Republicans were in the majority, American families \ncould count on Congress to make sure this AMT issue was taken care of.\n  Now, it is nearing the summertime under Democratic leadership, and \nthere is no clear path to a credible temporary or permanent solution. \nWe need to address this now for the folks who do not even know what is \nabout to hit them in the year 2007. And some were hit in April already. \nI will explain that. That is why it cannot wait. It is here and now for \nsome taxpayers.\n  I hope, however, my colleagues have heard, then, from some of these \nconstituents who are being hit by it. That happened through the \nestimated tax payment in April 2007, when at least some Americans were \nhit with paying this when they prepared that estimated tax payment you \ndo four times a year. Those families have made that first payment and \nare painfully aware, then, of Congress's failure to act on the AMT this \nyear, whereas 12 months ago we had already acted.\n  Until recently, I had hoped the Senate was unified in not wanting to \ncollect the AMT for this year or any year in the future. On March 23--\nalmost 2 months ago--I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 2008 \nSenate budget resolution that would have required Congress to stop \nspending amounts that are scheduled to come into Federal coffers \nthrough the alternative minimum tax. The legitimacy of that amendment \nwas based on the proposition that the budget, which we just adopted \ntoday, the conference report--assumes these 23 million Americans are \ngoing to pay this tax they were never intended to pay. So get it out of \nthe budget if you are taxing people who are not superrich and who were \nnot supposed to pay it in the first place, and particularly when a few \nthousand of the superrich have even found ways to get legally around \nnot paying a tax that was intended for them to pay. My amendment was \nnot adopted because I think if my amendment had been adopted, we would \nhave some honesty in the budgeting process. However, not a single one \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted in its favor.\n  On the House side, we hear the Ways and Means Committee is doing a \nlot of talking about the alternative minimum tax, but they have yet to \nmove to action. It has been reported that House Democrats plan to \nexempt everyone who earns less than $250,000 from the AMT. Now, that is \nnot eliminating it like I want to do, but it sounds to me as if that is \na step in the right direction.\n  However, the new Democratic majority has pledged to offset any tax \ncuts. Some staggering proposals are bouncing around to offset a \n$250,000 exemption from the AMT. I outlined two of them on Monday when \nI spoke to my colleagues. One option would raise the top marginal \nincome tax rate to over 46 percent--a rate that we have not seen since \nit was 50 percent between 1963 and 1981. Now, that 46 percent is up \nfrom the 35-percent marginal tax rate under current law.\n  There is another option the House may be considering, and that is to \nraise the top alternative minimum tax rate to 37 percent, up from 28 \npercent under current law.\n  I have to believe that anyone would shy away from actually proposing \na double-digit tax rate increase. So let's take a minute to explore \nanother approach we have heard floated for alternative minimum tax \nrelief--paying for it by raising marginal tax rates on the top three \nincome tax brackets.\n  Except for that 35 percent bracket, you are definitely talking about \nraising the tax on middle-income people to pay for or to offset the \nalternative minimum tax, now hitting those same middle-income people \nwho were not intended to pay it in the first place.\n  Raising the top three income tax brackets--I do not know why Congress \nwould want to raise taxes on top income tax brackets, let alone on the \ntop\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\nthree brackets. However, if that idea is getting serious attention, \nthen we need to look behind the lipstick and examine the pig. So I have \na chart in the Chamber to show you how many taxpayers would be \nimpacted.\n  In 2004, there were nearly 6 million individuals and families in the \ntop three tax brackets. If you go through an analysis to show what the \ngrim scenario of raising taxes on the top three income tax brackets \nmight look like, it is not a very good picture.\n  There is another chart which lays out the numbers on an option \nprepared by the Tax Policy Center. I do not want you to think I am \nhighlighting a partisan Republican analysis. The Tax Policy Center has \nundertaken an extensive analysis of multiple options on the alternative \nminimum tax. I think it would be more than fair to say they are a group \nthat my colleagues on the other side of the aisle often look to for \nreasoned analysis of policy issues. In fact, I believe they recently \ntestified at the Ways and Means Committee in the other body on \nprecisely this point. They outlined many options in their study, and \nthis is just one that I want to walk through for illustration purposes.\n  This option--they call it the ``broad reform and increase top income \ntax rates'' option--would reduce the number of AMT taxpayers by almost \n90 percent in the year 2007. So that would mean you would have 300,000 \npeople paying the alternative minimum tax instead of the 23 million \nmiddle-income taxpayers who are being hit with it right now, as I \nspeak. Only 100,000 taxpayers with incomes below $200,000 would owe the \nalternative minimum tax under their plan.\n  Again, I think this is a step in the right direction, until you take \na look at their plan to offset it, to offset this AMT relief. The plan \nwould raise income tax rates on 6 million families in the top three \nincome tax brackets. This chart shows then where the ordinary tax rates \nwould go as a result of this suggestion.\n  For taxpayers in the current 28 percent bracket, and that includes \nsingle taxpayers earning $74,000 and married families earning $124,000, \ntheir tax rates would increase from 28 percent to 35.4 percent. That is \nhigher than the current tax rate for the wealthiest Americans under \npresent law. The current 33-percent bracket would go up to 41 percent, \nand the top tax bracket would go from the current 35 percent up to 45 \npercent. So again we would be facing another option that requires a \ndouble-digit, marginal tax rate increase.\n  So while I applaud the efforts of many to analyze potential AMT \nsolutions, I urge my colleagues to be aware of anyone bearing marginal \ntax rate increases in their basket of goodies to solve this horrendous \nproblem of 23 million middle-income taxpayers paying the alternative \nminimum tax. It was never supposed to be paid by middle-income people \nbecause it was a tax reserved for the superwealthy in 1969, numbering \nabout 155 people. So how do you get from 155 people to 23 million \npeople, if the tax policies are working the way they were intended to \nwork?\n  Now, there is another alternative, and that is something Congress \nisn't apt to do and something in the budget that was adopted shows that \nthe majority is not inclined to do. But Congress should control \nspending and stop budgeting with revenues flowing in on the ledger from \nthe AMT instead of increasing taxes to solve the problem. AMT tax \nrelief that relies on increases in ordinary tax rates to move the ball \nturns out to be no tax relief at all. I think we have the issue of \nwhether we want to keep this economy going, and I speak of Chairman \nGreenspan. Maybe he was beyond his chairmanship when he said that the \ntax policies of 2001 and 2003 were responsible for the 7.8 million \njobs, the growth in the economy that we have now, and bringing in \nthree-quarters of a trillion dollars of revenue that nobody anticipated \nwould be coming in when we gave those tax reductions. So why would you \nwant to raise the marginal tax rates when Chairman Greenspan says the \nlower rates are responsible for the revitalization of the economy and \nkill the goose that laid the golden egg? It doesn't make sense.\n  Those are the ideas that are floating around this Hill to solve the \nproblem of 23 million Americans being hit by a tax they were never \nintended to pay, counting revenue coming in from people who were never \nintended to pay it to show that the budget is balanced. Intellectually \ndishonest? Yes. Fraudulent? Yes. It is something that is unexplainable. \nYet we are stuck with it and it ought to end. It is not going to end \nuntil we repeal a tax that shouldn't be on the books in the first place \nbecause it isn't hitting all of the superwealthy the way it was \nintended to, and it is beginning to hit 23 million middle-income \npeople, and in the process, when you start raising taxes like that on \nthat group of people, pretty soon you are going to ruin the middle \nclass. The middle class is the stability of any society in the world, \nbut particularly in the last 150 years, it has been the stability of \nAmerica's society.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me say we have had some really good work \nthis week in the Senate. When I came here on Monday and indicated we \nwould have to work into the weekend, that wasn't just for fluff. I \nreally thought we would have to do that because we had so much to do. \nWe were heavily involved in WRDA, a bill that was so important to be \ndone, but a lot of hiccups come in complex legislation like that. We \nwere able to finish that in a few days. I was concerned about the \nbudget and the time limits that are statutory in that regard. We \ncompleted that. I was concerned about the supplemental, getting \nsomething to the House, which was a tremendously difficult job. We were \nable to get that done. Finally, there has been an agreement in \nprinciple on immigration, which we will take up, I hope, Monday \nevening.\n  Any one of these things gives no bragging rights to Democrats or \nRepublicans, but it gives bragging rights to Democrats and Republicans \nbecause none of this could have been done but for the recognition that \nyou have to work together to get things done. There is no better \nexample of that--and I said it briefly on the floor yesterday--than \nSenator Boxer and Senator Inhofe. They are really two political \nopposites in most everything. But they are also experienced \nlegislators, both having served in the House and in the Senate. Senator \nBoxer is chairman of the committee now, and Senator Inhofe was chairman \nof the committee. Senator Inhofe knew how important WRDA is. He worked \ntogether with Senator Boxer, and vice versa, and they got that done. \nThat is tremendously good work.\n  On the budget, I boast about the managers all the time because I \nthink they work well together--Senators Conrad and Gregg. What they \nwere able to piece together with this budget was very difficult. It \nwasn't mechanical, but it was difficult.\n  On the supplemental, I give a little credit to me, a little credit to \nSenator McConnell, and the rest of the credit to the Senate because we \nwere able to get that done and get a bill to conference with the House. \nWe have had a number of meetings with the President's chief of staff--\nSenator McConnell and I, Speaker Pelosi, and other representatives of \nthe President. We hope to be able to complete that very important \nconference report by next week at this time.\n  Finally, on the immigration issue, at this stage, I have kept this to \nmyself, but Senator McConnell was one of those who urged me to stick to \nmy timeline, stick to the 2 weeks. He said, ``If we are going to get \nanything done, you have to set a time limit.'' We did that. I don't \nknow if the immigration legislation will bear fruit and we will be able \nto pass it. At least we have something to talk about as a legislative \nvehicle on the floor that is bipartisan in nature. You may not agree on \nthe respective parts, but that can be debated. We are going to start \nMonday night.\n  The reason I mention that this evening is all Senators and all staffs\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\nare watching. The players on that--Senators Specter, Leahy, Kennedy, \nKyl, and others--have recognized they are going to have to work into \nthe night. If we are going to finish this bill next week, we are going \nto have to work nights, and that doesn't mean 6:30 at night. We have \none Senate event that we are locked into Tuesday evening, but that \ndoesn't mean the managers cannot work while we do that. It is an event \nat the Botanical Gardens for Senators. So we are going to work long, \nhard hours to complete that most important legislation.\n  In short, this was a very good week for the Senate and for the \nAmerican people.\n  We need a lot more weeks like this, and we hope to do that in the \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I can add briefly, I commend the \nmajority leader for this week. I think we did have a good week. I am \nparticularly pleased that we seem to be on a glidepath to completion of \nthe important troop funding bill. There is a bipartisan agreement we \nneed to have a signed bill providing funding for the troops before \nMemorial Day, and the distinguished majority leader and myself, and the \nPresident's representative, Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, have been \nworking toward that end and will continue to do that tomorrow in an \nadditional meeting with the Speaker and Leader Boehner from the House.\n  I, too, am pleased a bipartisan agreement on immigration appears to \nbe coming together. On the day I was elected Republican leader, I said \nI hope this Congress will do two important things that will make a \ndifference for our country. I thought the divided Government was \nuniquely situated to tackle both of these issues. One of them was \nSocial Security. I am not as optimistic on that issue as I would like \nto be. And the other issue is immigration. There is reason for optimism \ntoday that the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, will come together and \npass a landmark piece of legislation. We will find out next week, but I \nthink the compromise announced today certainly gives room for optimism \nthat might occur.\n  I did support the majority leader's decision to turn to that issue \nbefore Memorial Day. I thought it gave us the best chance of passing \nlegislation, and with those kinds of deadlines, it gave us the best \nchance of coming together. Hopefully, that process of coming together \nwas achieved earlier today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6259-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6259-S6260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ARMED FORCES DAY\n\n\n                    HONORING FRANK WOODRUFF BUCKLES,\n\n                            AN AMERICAN HERO\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, May 19 is Armed Forces Day. This is the day \nour country sets aside each year to remember and to honor the brave and \npatriotic Americans who serve today in the United States Armed Forces.\n  On Armed Forces Day in 1953, President Dwight David Eisenhower noted, \n``It is fitting and proper that we devote one day each year to paying \nspecial tribute to those whose constancy and courage constitute one of \nthe bulwarks guarding the freedom of this nation and the peace of the \nfree world.''\n  More than a half century later, his words still ring true. The \nsurvival of freedom still costs the commitment and sacrifice of \nAmerica's sons and daughters. I want to use this opportunity to let \nthem know that we in the United States Congress are thinking of them, \nand that we thank them for their service to our country.\n  I would also like to use this opportunity to pay tribute to another \nbrave and patriotic American, Mr. Frank Woodruff Buckles, who currently \nresides in the historic town of Charles Town, WV, and who served in the \nArmed Forces of the United States 90 years ago.\n  That's right--90 years ago.\n  Mr. President, last month, April 6 marked the 90th anniversary of the \nAmerica's entrance into World War I.\n  That was the ``war to end all wars.'' That was the ``war to make the \nworld safe for democracy.'' We know that did not happen. But World War \nI was the historic, global conflict that brought the United States onto \nthe international scene. And it marked the emergence of the United \nStates as a superpower.\n  Mr. President, 4.7 million Americans served in the U.S. military \nduring that war--the ``great war'' as it was called.\n  Of the 4.7 million Americans who served in World War I, only 4 are \nstill living. One of them is Mr. Frank Woodruff Buckles of Charles \nTown, WV.\n  Mr. Buckles was born in Harrison County, MO, on February 1, 1901, \nabout 40 miles from the birthplace of his future commander, GEN John J. \nPershing, the commander of the American Expeditionary Force in World \nWar I.\n  Mr. Buckles was only 16 years of age when the United States entered \nthe war.\n  Therefore, when he went to enlist in the Marines in order to fight \nthe kaiser, he was rejected because he was too young.\n  So he then tried the Navy. This time he was rejected because he was \nflatfooted.\n  Determined to serve his country, Mr. Buckles went into the Army. This \ntime, he was successful in enlisting because he lied about his age. On \nAugust 14, 1917, Mr. Buckles enlisted in the United States Army. Four \nmonths later, in December, 1917, he sailed ``over there'' aboard the \nRMS Carpathia, the vessel that had rescued the survivors of the Titanic \n5 years earlier.\n  As a doughboy, Private Buckles drove dignitaries around England and \nan ambulance around France. Mr. Buckles usually downplays his wartime \nexperience, explaining: ``There was nothing dramatic about it. \nSometimes I was driving in Winchester, England, sometimes France.'' But \nhis experience was indeed dramatic and it was important. Once war was \ndeclared, Mr. Buckles did not wait for his country to call him. He went \nfrom one military service to another until he was able to enlist, even \nif it meant fabricating his age. It was the willingness of 4.7 million \nbrave and patriotic Americans to enter the military and to serve our \ncountry that won that war. On this Armed Forces day, we need to \nremember them as well as the men and women currently wearing our \nNation's uniforms. We must keep all of them in our hearts and prayers, \nand make sure our country serves them, just the way they have served \nour country.\n\n  Mr. Buckles was discharged from the Army in 1920 at the age of 18. He \nattended business school, and then worked in various jobs in the United \nStates and Canada, including a stint in the bond department at Bankers \nTrust in New York City.\n  But his love of adventure and sense of excitement eventually led him \nout to sea again, this time working for different shipping lines as a \npurser and quartermaster. He first worked off the coast of South \nAmerica, then on to Europe.\n  In the 1930s, his work on a steamship line took him to Nazi Germany, \nwhere he attended the 1936 Olympics in Munich. Here he saw the great \nJessie Owens win a gold medal to the great embarrassment of German \nChancellor Adolph Hitler, who he also saw at the games.\n  In 1940, his work on steamship lines then landed him in the \nPhilippines. He was working in Manila when the Japanese invaded. Mr. \nBuckles was captured and spent the next 3\\1/2\\ years in Japanese prison \ncamps. Although he was a civilian, he was treated as a prisoner of war. \nAt dawn, February 23, 1945, the same day that the American flag was \nraised on Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi, the 11th Airborne Division \nliberated Mr. Buckles and his fellow prisoners.\n  After his release from prison camps, Mr. Buckles finally decided he \nhad enough adventure and excitement. ``I had been bouncing around from \none place to another for years at sea,'' he explained. ``It was time to \nsettle down.'' So he married Audrey Mayo.\n  I am pleased to point out that in 1954, Mr. Buckles and his wife \nsettled on a 330-acre farm in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, \nthe same area where his ancestor, Robert Buckles, had settled in 1732.\n  For the next five decades--that's right, five decades--Mr. Buckles \nhas continued to operate his beloved farm.\n  Maybe it is from breathing that good, clean West Virginia mountain \nair, or, perhaps, it is his own eternal youth and vigor. Whatever the \nreason, at the age of 106, this hardy West Virginian is still going \nstrong. He will serve as grand marshal of the World War I section of \nthe Memorial Day parade, here in Washington DC. A few years ago, the\n\n[[Page S6260]]\n\nPresident of France presented Mr. Buckles with the Legion of Honor at a \nceremony honoring World War I veterans at the French embassy here in \nWashington, DC. And he has been the subject of feature stories in USA \nToday, the Charleston Daily Mail, and ``America's Young Warriors,'' and \na number of other newspapers and magazines.\n  Mr. President, on this Armed Forces Day, I salute this brave and \npatriotic American. And I again salute and thank all those men and \nwomen serving in our Armed Forces today for their commitment and their \nsacrifice.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, this Saturday, May 19, is Armed Forces \nDay. Celebrated annually on the third Saturday of May, this is a day \nfor all of us as Americans to rally around our military members--\nwherever they are serving--and thank them for their patriotism and duty \nto country. This day has a long and proud history. With President Harry \nS. Truman leading the effort for this holiday, it came to fruition just \na few years after the close of World War II. It was at the end of \nAugust 1949 that Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson announced the \ncreation of Armed Forces Day to replace separate days of celebration \nfor the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. While the roots of \nthis celebration may have resulted from the unification of the Armed \nForces under the Department of Defense, it serves much more than a \nconsolidative purpose.\n  The account of the first Armed Forces Day is particularly riveting--\nas recorded in a page on the official web site of the Department of \nDefense: ``The first Armed Forces Day was celebrated by parades, open \nhouses, receptions, and air shows. In Washington DC, 10,000 troops of \nall branches of the military, cadets, and veterans marched pas[t] the \nPresident and his party. In Berlin, 1,000 U.S. troops paraded for the \nGerman citizens at Templehof Airfield. In New York City, an estimated \n33,000 participants initiated Armed Forces Day ``under an air cover of \n250 military planes of all types.'' In the harbors across the country \nwere the famed mothballed ``battlewagons'' of World War II, the \nMissouri, the New Jersey, the North Carolina, and the Iowa, all open \nfor public inspection. Precision flying teams dominated the skies as \ntracking radar [was] exhibited on the ground. All across the country, \nthe American people joined together to honor the Armed Forces.''\n  It is that last sentence that stands out to me: ``All across the \ncountry, the American people joined together to honor the Armed \nForces.'' Let this Saturday be another one of those days. Wherever our \nbrave military men and women are this Saturday--be it on the front \nlines in Iraq or Afghanistan, stationed along the DMZ that divides \nNorth and South Korea, on the open sea across the globe, or training in \nthe great American skies above, let's honor them. Let us not forget \ntheir service and dedication to protecting our freedoms and defending \nour way of life this Saturday and every Saturday, this day and every \nday.\n  To all our brave men and women in uniform and your families: thank \nyou for your selfless service and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6260-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     WE THE PEOPLE: THE CITIZEN AND THE CONSTITUTION NATIONAL TEAM\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. Presdient, this Congress has been making important \nefforts to show our support and commitment to our Nation's law \nenforcement officers. This week marks the 44th year that we have \ncelebrated National Police Week. On May 1, the Senate passed a \nresolution sponsored by my colleague Senator Specter, the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, and myself, marking May 15, 2007 as \nNational Peace Officers Memorial Day. Earlier this week, I was honored \nto participate in that ceremony here at the Capitol hosted by the Grand \nLodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary. As we do each \nyear, we gathered with the families of those who lost loved ones in \n2006 while serving in the line of duty. We commemorated their sacrifice \nto keep us safe and secure.\n  On Tuesday, the House passed H.R. 1700, the COPS Improvements Act of \n2007, by an overwhelming vote of 381 to 34. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has voted to report the Senate's companion bill which I \njoined with Senator Biden to introduce. Despite tremendous support for \nthis legislation, a Republican objection to passing the House bill has \nprevented this important legislation from passing the Senate. I am \ndisappointed that Senate action on these vital improvements to the COPS \nProgram has stalled, and I hope the objection is withdrawn so that the \nSenate can pass H.R. 1700.\n  This legislation would reauthorize and expand the ability of the \nAttorney General to award grants aimed at increasing the number of cops \non the streets and in our schools. To accomplish this goal, this bill \nwould authorize $600 million in designated funds to hire more officers \nto improve and expand community policing, which will in turn help \nreduce crime. In Vermont, for example, passage of the COPS Improvements \nAct would likely mean that 110 new officers would be put on the beat. \nAdditionally, the COPS Improvements Act would authorize $200 million \nannually for district attorneys to hire community prosecutors and $350 \nmillion annually for technology grants.\n  The COPS Program has been a resounding success, and the improvements \nto the program that are contained in this bill would help our State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies cope with the substantial reductions in \nfunding they have endured in recent years. Despite these reductions in \nfunding, law enforcement officers have an increased role in homeland \nsecurity responsibilities. H.R. 1700 includes ``Terrorism Cops,'' \nofficers who are focused specifically on homeland security, and would \nalso include the Troops to Cops Program to help soldiers returning from \nthe battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. In short, this legislation \ngives our law enforcement officers the tools they need to reduce crime \nand protect our citizens.\n  The Government Accountability Office has reported that between 1998 \nand 2000, COPS hiring grants were responsible for 200,000 to 225,000 \nless criminal acts--one-third of which were violent. With violent crime \non the rise and our State and local law enforcement officers stretched \nthin with new responsibilities, it is essential that we pass this \nlegislation. I urge those on the other side of the aisle to withdraw \ntheir objections and support our State and local law enforcement \nagencies by passing H.R. 1700.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6260-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6260-S6261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               340B PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT AND INTEGRITY ACT\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this Chamber has spent a good deal of time\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\nrecently discussing an important topic that affects all consumers in \nthis country--the high cost of prescription drugs. Not only do rising \nprescription drug costs contribute to all individuals' health insurance \ncosts--but our health care providers feel the burden of these rising \ncosts as well.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, rural hospitals serve as a lifeline \nto thousands of constituents living in medically underserved areas--and \nthe rising cost of drugs continues to squeeze their budgets. As we \ncontinue to see in all regions of the country, cost directly impacts \naccess.\n  In 1992, Congress created the 340B program under Medicaid to lower \nthe cost of drugs purchased by a limited number of entities serving a \nhigh number of low-income and uninsured individuals--such as Federally \nQualified Health Care Centers and nonprofit hospitals providing care to \na disproportionate share of Medicaid patients. Under the 340B program, \npharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide these entities \ndiscounts on outpatient drugs as part of each manufacturer's Medicaid \nparticipation agreement.\n  This week, I was pleased to reintroduce legislation with my colleague \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to improve the 340B program and \nextend these discounts so that they not only apply to outpatient drug \npurchases, but also inpatient prescription drug purchases for \nqualifying hospitals.\n  Additionally, this bill would expand eligibility in the program to \nall critical access hospitals, as well as sole community hospitals and \nrural referral centers that serve a high percentage of low-income and \nindigent patients.\n  This legislation includes important provisions to improve the \nintegrity of the program and generate savings to Medicaid. \nSpecifically, the bill would generate savings for the Medicaid program \nby requiring participating hospitals to credit Medicaid with a \npercentage of their savings on inpatient drugs. Additionally, the bill \nseeks to enhance the overall efficiency of the 340B program through \nimproved enforcement and compliance measures with respect to \nmanufacturers and covered entities.\n  Hospitals serving predominately rural areas, such as the 38 critical \naccess hospitals in South Dakota, play a crucial role in my State in \nproviding care to patients in underserved communities. Extending the \n340B drug discount program to these hospitals will help them to afford \ntheir prescription drugs--and at the same time lower the overall cost \nof care at these hospitals and to the Federal Government.\n  The 340B Program Improvement and Integrity Act of 2007 is commonsense \nlegislation that reduces the cost of drugs for health care providers \nserving society's most vulnerable citizens. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this bipartisan \nlegislation passed and signed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6261-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6261-S6262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AGREEMENT ON TRADE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last week, amid great fanfare, several \nMembers of the House and Senate announced they had reached an agreement \nwith the administration on language that facilitates the implementation \nof two trade agreements, and paves the way for the possible \nconsideration of additional trade agreements as well as the extension \nof so-called fast-track trade agreement implementing authority.\n  No sooner had the announcement been made than questions were raised \nabout just what the agreement was.

We now \nunderstand that the actual details of the agreement may not be fully \nspelled out until legislation implementing the trade agreements is \npresented to Congress for approval. Until then, everyone is free to \nspin this agreement as they wish.\n  Given the parties that were involved, hearing the announcement was a \nbit like hearing that the foxes and wolves had reached a deal on \nguarding the hen house. For the most part, the people who were \nnegotiating this agreement have a nearly unbroken record of supporting \nthe deeply flawed trade policies of the past decade and more. From the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, to the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade, GATT, which created the World Trade Organization, to \ngranting China permanent Most Favored Nation status, to the more recent \nagreements like the Central America Free Trade Agreement, the actors in \nthis deal have all been singing from the same hymn book. While I don't \nquestion the good intentions of those who were involved, no one should \nhave expected last week's announcement to produce significant changes \nto that hymn book.\n  Our trade policy has been disastrous. It has contributed to the loss \nof several million family-supporting jobs in this country. It has left \ncommunities across my State devastated, and I know the same is true in \ncommunities around this country.\n  Our trade deficit reaches new heights every year, as we send more and \nmore of our wealth overseas, much of it in the form of factories that \nprovided entire communities with decent, good-paying jobs. I hold \nlistening sessions in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year. This \nis my 15th year holding those listening sessions, listening to tens of \nthousands of people from all over Wisconsin. I completed my 1000th of \nthose sessions last fall, and I can tell you that there is nearly \nuniversal frustration and anger with the trade policies we have pursued \nsince the late 1980s. Even among those who would have called themselves \ntraditional free-traders, it is increasingly obvious that the so-called \nNAFTA model of trade has been a tragic failure.\n  I voted against NAFTA, GATT, and permanent most favored nation status \nfor China, in great part because I felt they were bad deals for \nWisconsin businesses and Wisconsin workers. At the time I voted against \nthose agreements, I thought they would result in lost jobs for my \nState. But, as I have noted before, even as an opponent of those trade \nagreements, I had no idea just how bad things would be.\n  Nor does the problem end with the loss of businesses and jobs. The \nmodel on which our recent trade agreements have been based \nfundamentally undermines our democratic institutions. It replaces the \njudgment of the people, as reflected in the laws and standards set \nforth by their elected representatives, with rules written by \norganizations dominated by multinational corporations. Food, \nenvironmental, and safety standards set by our democratic institutions \nare subject to challenge if they conflict with those approved by \nunelected international trade bureaucracies. Even laws that require the \ngovernment to use our tax dollars to buy goods made here, rather than \noverseas, can be challenged.\n  Our trade policy is a mess, and it needs to be fixed.\n  As bad as our trade policies have been, they have not been partisan \npolicies. I wish they were. I wish I could lay the blame at the feet of \nour colleagues in the other party. But Members of both parties have \naided and abetted these flawed policies. Presidents of both parties \nhave advanced them, and Members of Congress from both sides of the \naisle have approved them.\n  It should not come as a shock to anyone, then, that while the \nagreement announced last week was bipartisan, because it was negotiated \nby people who largely supported the flawed trade agreements of recent \nyears, it fails to address in a meaningful way the concerns of those \nwho have opposed those same agreements.\n  It is noteworthy that while the announced agreement is primarily \nrelated to enhancing international worker standards, not a single union \nhas endorsed it. While the agreement reportedly enhances international \nenvironmental standards, no environmental groups have endorsed it. Nor \nhave those business groups that have been critical of our trade \npolicies.\n  We are making progress, albeit slow progress, in educating the public \nand policymakers on the true nature of our trade agreements. In the \npast, when opponents of these flawed trade deals raised questions about \nthe actual provisions in those agreements, supporters were quick to \nplay the free trade card and label those who questioned the agreements \nas ``protectionist.''\n  This charge resonated with many of our newspaper editorial boards, \nwho\n\n[[Page S6262]]\n\nhave parroted the elegant theories of 18th century economist Adam \nSmith.\n  But the trade agreements into which we have entered in recent years \nare not simply reductions in tariffs, as Adam Smith envisioned. If \nthese agreements were just reductions in tariffs, they could be \nimplemented by a bill that is only one or two pages long. Of course, \nthat is not the case. These agreements are lengthy. The bills that \nimplement them are so massive as to be almost bullet proof. And the \nreason is that they go far beyond merely lowering tariffs. As Thea Lee \nwrote in the Wall Stree Journal:\n\n       We should all understand by now that modern, (post-NAFTA) \n     free-trade agreements are not just about lowering tariffs. \n     They are about changing the conditions attached to trade \n     liberalization, in ways that benefit some players and hurt \n     others. These are not your textbook free-trade deals. These \n     are finely orchestrated special-interest deals that boost the \n     profits and power of multinational corporations, leaving \n     workers, family farmers, many small businesses, and the \n     environment more vulnerable than ever.\n\n  Increasingly, some who blindly accepted these trade agreements in the \npast now are beginning to read the fine print. They recognize the role \nthese agreements have played in our skyrocketing trade deficits and the \nloss of millions of jobs. They understand that if we are to have a \nsustainable trade policy, then we must dramatically alter the NAFTA \nmodel of trade on which our recent trade agreements are based.\n  The agreement announced last week does not do that. And until our \ntrade agreements better reflect a more sustainable relationship with \nour trading partners as well as the broader interests of our own \nnational priorities--keeping businesses and good-paying jobs here, \nensuring strong protections for our environment, our food safety, and \neven the ability of our democratic institutions to set those national \npriorities--I will continue to oppose them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6262-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenators Menendez and Brownback this week in introducing a resolution \nthat recognizes the unique diplomatic and economic leverage that China \npossesses, and that offers that country a rare opportunity to be a \nforce for peace in the troubled Darfur region of Sudan.\n  By now, we are all aware of the devastation being wrought upon the \ninnocent people of Darfur. Over the past 4 years, hundreds of thousands \nof people have been killed and more than 2.5 million displaced as a \nresult of the ongoing and escalating violence caused by the Sudanese \nGovernment, associated Janjaweed militia attacks, and even the numerous \nrebel factions. Congress declared the Sudanese Government's atrocities \nto be genocide nearly 3 years ago, and my colleagues and I have been \nactively demanding that the United States do everything in its power to \nbolster the hard-working but inadequate African Union peacekeeping \nmission, support the efforts of courageous humanitarian workers, hold \nthose responsible accountable for their actions, and persuade all \nparties to commit to a legitimate political resolution that can end the \nconflict and ensure people can safely and voluntarily return to their \nhomes.\n  Although I am frustrated that the United States' efforts to achieve \nthese key objectives have been inadequate, I am even more upset by the \nSudanese Government's persistent obstruction of all efforts to address \nDarfur's deep security, humanitarian, and political crises. The United \nStates and other Western governments have made significant political \nand material investments in Sudan in an attempt to bring peace to that \nconflict-torn country, but as long as Khartoum continues to thwart its \ninternational obligations and pursue its violent campaign, these \ninvestments will not bring Sudan closer to peace.\n  All parties agree that the tipping point in Sudan will come when the \ngovernment there sees the costs of continuing to break existing \npromises and obstruct new agreements as greater than the benefits it \ncan achieve by doing so.\n  The country perhaps best positioned to affect the calculus of this \ncost-benefit analysis is China. Over the last decade, Beijing's energy \nfirms have invested between $3 billion and $10 billion in the Sudanese \nenergy sector, and China now exports seventy percent of Sudan's oil. \nChina recently cancelled over $100 million in Sudanese debt and is \nbuilding roads, bridges, an oil refinery, a hydroelectric dam, \ngovernment offices and a new $20 million presidential palace. With \nthese debt savings and oil revenues, Sudan has doubled its defense \nbudget in recent years, spending 60 percent to 80 percent of its oil \nrevenue on weapons--arms mostly made in China. I was very disturbed to \nsee that the chief of Sudan's armed forces was so warmly welcomed in \nBeijing last week and promised increased military exchanges and \ncooperation.\n  Eleven States, half a dozen cities, and more than 30 academic \ninstitutions across the United States have decided to divest from \ncompanies that do business with the Sudanese Government. Many of these \ncompanies are Chinese, which sends a signal to both Beijing and \nKhartoum that Americans--and others around the world--are willing to \nput their money where their mouths are when it comes to defending the \npeople of Darfur.\n  Africa can benefit from Chinese investment, but China's increasingly \nimportant role on the continent also carries responsibilities. As the \n2008 summer Olympics in Beijing approach, China is keen to be perceived \nas a key player on the world stage, but that means it needs to play by \nthe rules. According to a recent Amnesty International report, China \nis, and I quote ``allowing ongoing flows of arms to parties to Sudan \nthat are diverted for the conflict in Darfur and used there and across \nthe border in Chad to commit grave violations of international law.'' \nThis is, I note, also in violation of the U.N. arms embargo.\n  Recently, China has begun to play a more constructive role in Sudan, \nby offering to contribute an engineering unit to the U.N.-led \npeacekeeping force that awaits admission into Darfur and by appointing \na special representative to Africa who will focus specifically on the \nDarfur issue. These are notable, and welcomed developments, but they \nare not sufficient. We need to see a substantial policy shift in \nChina's relationship with Khartoum that is reflected in both their \npublic and their private efforts. China must send an unequivocal \nmessage that the relentless violence is unacceptable--and it must do so \nby working collaboratively and constructively with the rest of the \ninternational community to ensure a consistent message.\n  The resolution introduced today urges China to be more constructive, \nconsistent, and collaborative in its policy towards Sudan. It is our \nhope that through political messages like this resolution, diplomatic \ncommunication through formal and informal channels, and economic \nsignals sent by the divestment campaign, China will be persuaded to \ntake advantage of the unique opportunity it possesses to change the \npolitical calculus of the government in Khartoum so that the equation \nresults in peace for the people of Darfur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6262-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6262-S6263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            IBM CELEBRATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I proudly tell my friends in the \nSenate about an impressive milestone in the history of Vermont \nbusiness. This winter marked 50 years since IBM President Tom Watson \nJr. opened a manufacturing plant in Essex Junction. Today, IBM is \nVermont's largest private employer and one of the foundations to a \ngrowing technology sector throughout our State.\n  Many events have and will be planned to celebrate the many \nachievements IBM and its workforce have made in the Green Mountain \nState. Most recently, Vermont Business Magazine ran a collection of \nnews pieces and special features in its April 2007 issue about IBM's \nhistory in Vermont.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an op-ed I wrote recognizing the \nsuccesses that IBM and Vermont have enjoyed during the past 50 years be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From Vermont Business Magazine, Apr. 2007]\n\n               IBM's 50 Years of Innovation and Evolution\n\n                       (By Senator Patrick Leahy)\n\n       In 1957, then IBM President Tom Watson Jr. selected \n     Vermont's Essex Junction to\n\n[[Page S6263]]\n\n     build one of his company's key manufacturing facilities. Five \n     decades later, the technology and family of employees at IBM \n     Essex have come to define Northern Vermont as much as the \n     snowy winters, short summers and Yankee ingenuity that lured \n     Tom Watson to the Green Mountains in the first place.\n       The Essex Junction plant has been an integral part of IBM's \n     global strategy since its inception. In what has to be \n     considered an incredible ``run,'' IBM Essex has been a \n     worldwide leader in the development, design and manufacture \n     of semiconductor technology for the past 50 years. That is \n     quite an achievement in the cyclical and volatile \n     semiconductor industry and a testament to the tens of \n     thousands of Vermonters--and newly minted Vermonters--who \n     have worked tirelessly to maintain this world-class status \n     for the past five decades. That has meant adroitly adopting \n     strategies and new manufacturing processes over the years. \n     The plant has transformed itself from a general semiconductor \n     manufacturing facility to a high-end specialty logic \n     semiconductor manufacturing facility. This growth--and this \n     change--was possible with the vision and dedication of the \n     designers, engineers, inventors and technicians who work \n     along the banks of the Winooski River.\n       IBM, its partners and clients have literally and \n     figuratively altered the economy of Chittenden County and \n     Vermont for generations to come. From software companies big \n     and small, to cutting-edge nano-technology engineering firms, \n     the businesses attracted to IBM and the companies started by \n     former IBM employees have created high-paying jobs and a \n     culture of innovation that are envied across the New England \n     region.\n       During my 30 years representing Vermont in the United \n     States Senate, I have worked frequently with IBM's corporate \n     leadership, IBM's local leadership and many of the frontline \n     employees. The federal government recognizes that IBM Essex \n     is a national asset: a world class domestic production \n     facility with the highest reputation for ingenuity and \n     productivity and quality. That is why the Defense Advanced \n     Research Project Agency (DARPA) invested millions in the mask \n     house in Vermont. And that is why it made complete sense for \n     the federal government to select Essex Junction as a \n     ``Trusted Foundry'' to design and produce critical \n     semiconductors resulting in orders as high as $600 million \n     over the next decade.\n       The innovation at IBM Essex has played an important role in \n     helping IBM lead the nation in patent creation for more than \n     a decade. Last year alone, 360 patents came directly from the \n     IBM Essex Junction facility--making it one of IBM's top five \n     patent-producing facilities. The fostering and protection of \n     intellectual property is important not only to Vermont but to \n     the nation. During my tenure in the Senate I have made \n     reforms of our patent laws a high priority and I'll continue \n     to press that cause as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       The technology sector has changed dramatically over the \n     past five decades. That IBM Essex has successfully maintained \n     world class leadership despite all of these changes is simply \n     incredible. IBM Essex designs and manufactures microchips for \n     some of the world's leading computer, communications and \n     consumer products companies. Products and technology from IBM \n     in Vermont have helped make computers and electronic products \n     smaller, faster, cheaper and more reliable.\n       I would venture to say that Tom Watson's vision for IBM in \n     Vermont has turned out to be a great success. On behalf of \n     all Vermonters, I offer everyone who has made IBM Essex a \n     success a heartfelt thank you, for job after job, done well. \n     Congratulations on fifty years of innovation and prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6263-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DETECTIVE KEVIN ORR\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a special man who \ndied in the line of duty in Utah--Uintah County Sheriff's Detective \nKevin Orr. His wife Holley and their four children, Tyler, Kaylee, \nJessica, and Ashlee, were in Washington, DC this week to participate in \na ceremony where Detective Orr's name was added to the National Peace \nOfficers Memorial. The Orr family had the opportunity to join with \nother survivors of law enforcement officers to commemorate their loved \nones' lives and sacrifices.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting with the Orr family as they were paying \nrespects to him through his addition to the National Peace Officers \nMemorial. Many from his extended family visited with me in my office, \nincluding Kevin's parents, Eugene and Claudia Orr, and Holley's \nparents, Glen and Dixie Hartle. Extended family members who were also \nvisiting included Eric Hartle, Lisa Howe, Julie Luceor, Jolynn Orr, \nJeffrey Orr, Larry Orr, Damon Orr, and Jason Pazour. Their loss is \ntragic, but their unity as a family is unbreakable.\n  Detective Orr sustained fatal injuries in November 2006 when he \njoined in a search for a missing 25-year-old woman. The helicopter he \nwas riding in hit an unmarked power line hanging across the Green River \nand plummeted to the ground. Sadly, Detective Orr lost his life early \nthe next morning as a result of the injuries he sustained in the \naccident.\n  At the time of his death, Detective Orr had worked for the Uintah \nSheriff's Department for 11 years and was known for his dedication and \ncommitment to law enforcement and the people he served. In 1999 he was \nnamed Uintah County Deputy of the Year for the example he set and the \nwork he performed. He spent several years working with people in the \nDrug Court, making a difference in the lives of many who passed through \nthe program. One young woman who had been a participant in Drug Court \nstated that she owed her life to Kevin. He believed in people and \nwanted to see them succeed and become happier, more productive \ncitizens.\n  I was touched by what retired Vernal police officer Robert Roth said \nabout Kevin. He stated: ``He was the caliber of person that lived his \nlife as an example to all of us . . . We traditionally think of gun \nbattles or car chases, but it's about service. Some of us are willing \nto die for that cause and some of us have.''\n  When I met with Kevin's family this week, I was touched by their \nhumble, courageous spirits and their commitment to the legacy he left \nbehind as a valiant law enforcement officer. It reminded me of a quote \nI have always appreciated by an unknown source that says: ``You make a \nliving by what you get, but you make a life by what you give.''\n  Mr. President, Officer Orr was willing to give it all to help others. \nHe truly epitomized the ideals of sacrifice and service. I know that \nhis family misses him and grieves for their loss, but I also know that \nthey can find great peace and comfort from the example he left behind. \nHe was a valiant, dedicated public servant and his influence will be \nfelt by many generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6263-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6263-S6264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RETIREMENT OF JAMES F. AHRENS\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \ndistinguished career of James F. Ahrens, who will soon retire as head \nof the Montana Hospital Association. Jim Ahrens has been a mainstay of \nMontana's health care community for over two decades, and I know that I \nspeak for that community when I say that his presence as the head of \nMHA will be missed.\n  Jim Ahrens has served as president of MHA . . . An Association of \nMontana Health Care Providers, for nearly 21 years. Health care has \nchanged a lot since the mid-1980s, in good ways and bad. Our scientists \nhave developed remarkable new treatments. Yet, as ranks of the \nuninsured grow, many Americans can't take advantage of those \ntreatments. We have prevented Medicare's trust fund from going broke. \nYet the program still faces serious long-term fiscal challenges. We \nhave enacted the most significant change Part D--in Medicare's history. \nYet the new benefit has been marred by early administrative missteps.\n  As a key player in health care over the last two decades, I have \nrelied on Jim to gain a better understanding of these ever-changing \nevents. I have also come to know Jim as a close personal friend. When \nit comes to Jim, I don't have any `and yets.' I can think of no better \nexample than that than his work on the Critical Access Hospital \nprogram.\n  Back in the late 1980s, a citizens' task force came up with the idea \nof a limited service hospital for rural and frontier areas. This new \ntype of hospital would provide access to primary care in the most \nremote stretches of the country, while receiving a break from the \nstrict regulatory requirements governing hospitals and health \nfacilities. The Montana Legislature took the recommendations for this \nnew type of facility and created a special licensure category.\n  As incoming leader of MHA, Jim's job was to bring the concept to \nlife. Having just moved from Chicago to run the Montana Hospital \nAssociation, he hit the ground running. Jim worked with the Montana \nDepartment of Public Health and Human Services to develop a \ndemonstration project for this\n\n[[Page S6264]]\n\nnew type of facility. He and I then worked with the Federal Department \nof Health and Human Services' regional office in Denver to establish a \ndemonstration project and secure a Federal grant to fund it.\n  This demonstration project--the Medical Assistance Facility Project--\nwas hugely successful and served as the model for the Critical Access \nHospital Program that I authored in 1997. Today, more than 1,300 \nhospitals around the Nation enjoy CAH status, ensuring access to high-\nquality medical treatment in some of the most remote parts of our land.\n  I am very proud to have written that bill and to have made changes to \nimprove the CAH program since then. I am just as proud to have worked \nwith Jim in the process. With over 45 CAHs operating in Montana, the \nidea of a limited-service rural hospital has moved from concept to the \nmainstream. I have no doubt that the CAH Program has kept a number of \nMontana hospitals from closing. And when you are dealing with Montana-\nsized distances in health care, that can mean the difference between \nlife and death.\n  Through it all, Jim has been a mainstay. Always patient and kind but \nalways thinking ahead, his innovative style and vision have brought \npeople together for a healthier Montana. He changed MHA . . . from a \ncollection of hospitals to MHA . . . An Association of Montana Health \nCare Providers--a united group of hospitals, nursing homes, home health \norganizations, hospices, and physicians. He applied the same philosophy \nto form the Alliance for a Healthy Montana--a coalition of more than 25 \nhealth care organizations. The Alliance is now an effective and \ncohesive voice for health care change in Montana and came about almost \nsolely because of Jim's efforts. Over the past 8 years, the Alliance \nhas spearheaded three ballot initiatives, including one that reformed \nMontana's tobacco tax rate and two others that earmarked national \ntobacco settlement funds to pay for health care programs in Montana.\n  It makes sense that Jim would take the consensus approach that he \ndid, working to build a coalition from a group constituencies that \nweren't obvious allies. After all, Jim has spent his entire career as \nan executive in health care associations. He understood--and showed by \nexample--the powerful role associations can play in representing \nmembers' needs before Congress, legislatures, regulatory agencies, and \nprivate organizations.\n  As I said, Jim has been a trusted adviser to me throughout the last \ntwo decades. I have come to trust his perspective, judgment, and \nknowledge on health issues great and small. I have also benefited from \nJim's friendship. He is a gracious, compassionate, and generous \nperson--the kind of guy people like to be around. And while the people \nof MHA will miss having Jim around, I know that his family and friends \nlook forward to seeing a bit more of this exceptional individual. Jim's \ntransition will be complete on June 30, when he makes his retirement \nofficial. On behalf of a healthier Montana, we wish Jim Ahrens \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6264-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                EMS WEEK\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

I have sent the enclosed notice to the Federal \nRegister for publication, stating that the Burma emergency is to \ncontinue beyond May 20, 2007.\n  The crisis between the United States and Burma arising from the \nactions and policies of the Government of Burma, including its policies \nof committing large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in \nBurma, that led to the declaration of a national emergency on May 20, \n1997, has not been resolved. These actions and policies are hostile to \nU.S. interests and pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat \nto the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For \nthis reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the \nnational emergency and maintain in force the sanctions against Burma to \nrespond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of New Hampshire supporting the \n     U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                         House Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, the people of New Hampshire value clean air and \n     water, and prioritize natural resources protection for \n     economic growth, and better health, and quality of life for \n     our citizens;\n       Whereas, the governor of New Hampshire has declared in \n     executive order number 2005-4 that New Hampshire will lead-\n     by-example in energy efficiency to protect public health, \n     future economic growth, our environment, quality of life, and \n     taxpayer dollars; and\n       Whereas, the use of energy for electricity, heating, \n     cooling, and transportation has a significant effect on \n     public health and the environment, contributing to such \n     problems as ground-level ozone, acid rain, eutrophication of \n     water bodies, soot, haze, mercury contamination, and climate \n     change; and\n       Whereas, 5 New Hampshire cities, Dover, Keene, Manchester, \n     Nashua, and Portsmouth, and many cities across the United \n     States, have signed onto the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection \n     Agreement and have reduced global warming pollution through \n     programs that provide economic and quality of life benefits \n     such as reduced energy bills, green space preservation, air \n     quality improvements, reduced traffic congestion, improved \n     transportation choices, economic development, and job \n     creation through energy conservation and new energy \n     technologies, and have recognized that energy efficiency and \n     conservation will save taxpayer money; and\n       Whereas, rural communities and agriculture sectors will \n     benefit from energy efficiency and conservation and the \n     development of a broad spectrum of renewable energy sources \n     including wind power, biodiesel, biomass, methane digesters, \n     and solar, including establishing additional markets for \n     agricultural commodities, creating new uses for crops, \n     livestock, and their byproducts, more productive use of \n     marginal lands, improving wildlife habitat, and providing new \n     employment opportunities; and\n       Whereas, significant reduction in New Hampshire's \n     greenhouse gas emissions, diversification of in-state energy \n     sources, and collaboration with other northeastern states \n     will have a measurable effect on global warming and New \n     Hampshire will lead the region with sustainable economic \n     growth, the next generation of new technology, and dynamic \n     job creation; and\n       Whereas, producing 25 percent of New Hampshire's energy \n     demand from renewable sources by the year 2025 is realistic \n     and presents numerous benefits for the state's communities, \n     diversifies the business sector, protects the environment and \n     public health, and promotes national security; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives: That the New \n     Hampshire house of representatives supports the vision of a \n     ``25 by 25'' goal, whereby renewable energy will provide 25 \n     percent of the total energy consumed in New Hampshire by the \n     year 2025; and\n       That the New Hampshire house of representatives supports \n     incentives to consumers to increase energy efficiency and \n     conservation; and\n       That the New Hampshire house of representatives agrees that \n     smart energy measures, like anti-idling policies, expanding \n     public transportation choices, and appropriate vehicle \n     selection for state agency uses, will help reduce air \n     pollution and global warming gases; and\n       That copies of this resolution, signed by the speaker of \n     the house of representatives be forwarded by the house clerk \n     to the governor of New Hampshire, the President of the United \n     States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of the New Hampshire congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-96. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of New Hampshire urging Congress \n     to take actions relative to veterans' benefits and the war in \n     Iraq; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 10\n\n       Whereas, in the history of military campaigns for over 2 \n     centuries beginning with the Revolutionary War, the people of \n     the United States of America have engaged in military and \n     diplomatic initiatives to gain and preserve freedom for all \n     people; and\n       Whereas, the citizens of the state of New Hampshire \n     strongly support the men and women serving in the United \n     States Armed Forces in Iraq, Afghanistan, and arenas known \n     and not yet known; and\n       Whereas, over 3,000 American military personnel, including \n     17 from New Hampshire, have died since March of 2003 in the \n     hostilities in Iraq, and tens of thousands have returned home \n     with significant unmet physical and other health care needs; \n     and\n       Whereas, the citizens of the state of New Hampshire \n     recognize, appreciate, and are forever thankful for the \n     sacrifices that all of our American and New Hampshire \n     soldiers have made, especially those who have given their \n     lives or been wounded in previous and current battles to \n     protect our freedoms; and\n       Whereas, the unknown time line of the war in Iraq has \n     stretched thin our National Guard and Reserves, including the \n     New Hampshire national guard, and created a severe equipment \n     shortage, thereby reducing the readiness level of our \n     National Guard to fully meet its missions of responding to \n     natural disasters, terrorism, and protecting us at home; and\n       Whereas, the New Hampshire house of representatives has an \n     obligation to speak out on matters which affect the people of \n     our state, and the ability of our government to protect us at \n     home; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives: That the New \n     Hampshire house of representatives and the American people \n     will continue to support and protect the members of the \n     United States Armed Forces and the New Hampshire national \n     guard who are serving or who have served bravely and \n     honorably in Iraq and elsewhere; and\n       That the New Hampshire house of representatives disapproves \n     of the decision of President George W. Bush, announced on \n     January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional \n     United States combat troops to Iraq; and\n       That the New Hampshire house of representatives calls on \n     the Bush Administration and Congress to fund fully all \n     benefits for veterans to appropriately care for our brave men \n     and women when they return from this war and other combat; \n     and\n       That the New Hampshire house of representatives urges the \n     President and Congress to commence talks with the neighbors \n     in the Middle East and begin the orderly withdrawal of \n     American military forces from Iraq; and\n       That the clerk of the New Hampshire house of \n     representatives send copies of this resolution to governor \n     John Lynch, the president and minority leader of the New \n     Hampshire state senate, the President of the United States, \n     the United States Secretary of Defense, the United States \n     Secretary of State, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the New Hampshire congressional \n     delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6265-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6265-S6266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. DODD, from the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs, without amendment:\n       H.R. 1675.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit \na report to Congress providing a master plan for the use of the West \nLos Angeles Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, California, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto maintain the land on the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter campus for the exclusive use of America's Veterans.\n  This legislation is a companion to an identical bill introduced by \nCongressman Waxman in the House earlier this month.\n  The bill would:\n  Prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, from issuing \nenhanced-use lease agreements on the West Los Angeles VA property; \nexpand the scope of the Cranston Act, which already prohibits the \ndisposal of land and the use of enhanced-use leases on 109 acres, to \ncover the entire 388-acre West Los Angeles VA property; prohibit the VA \nfrom exchanging, trading, auctioning or transferring any land connected \nto the West Los Angeles VA; require that a master plan related to the \nWest Los Angeles VA property be completed no later than 1 year after \nthis legislation is enacted; prohibit the VA from receiving funding to \nenact the provisions of a master plan for the West Los Angeles VA \nwithout first receiving Congressional authorization; and establish a \npublic advisory committee, consisting of federally elected \nrepresentatives, local elected officials, local Veterans, and community \nmembers to provide input on the master plan.\n  The bill I am introducing today is absolutely essential in light of a \nnumber of unacceptable actions previously taken by the VA that, in my \nview, violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.\n  In March, I joined with my colleagues Senator Barbara Boxer and \nCongressman Henry Waxman in writing a letter to VA Secretary James \nNicholson, strongly objecting to recent decisions made by the VA \nrelating to the West Los Angeles VA facility and land.\n  For example, the VA has signed sharing agreements to allow an \nEnterprise-\n\n[[Page S6269]]\n\nRent-A-Car facility to operate on the VA land. The VA also continues to \nfilm on the property and recently allowed Fox Studios to construct a \nset storage building there.\n  In 1996, a 65,000-seat NFL Football stadium was proposed for the open \nspace on the West Los Angeles VA land until Congress passed a \nresolution to prohibit this action.\n  This legislation also ensures that the VA never issues an enhanced-\nuse lease agreement on the West Los Angeles VA property that would have \nlittle or nothing to do with direct veterans services.\n  The VA now has a number of other effective tools at its disposal to \nprovide services directly to veterans, including sharing agreements and \nexisting legislation to address homeless veterans' needs.\n  If the VA is already exceeding the scope of its sharing agreements, \nit is likely to also pursue enhanced-use leases for developing the \nproperty. Enhanced-use leases are disposal tools and should not be \npermitted on the West Los Angeles VA land, as the community and local \nveterans overwhelmingly oppose them.\n  Notably, Congress mandated that the VA create a Land Use master plan \nfor the entire West Los Angeles Veterans' property in 1998, Public Law \n105-368.\n  Last year, the Senate approved language in the fiscal year 2007 \nMILCON/VA Appropriations bill that required the VA to provide the \nAppropriations Committees a report on the master plan for the West Los \nAngeles VA Medical Center and connected land.\n  The fiscal year 2007 MILCON/VA Appropriations Act passed the Senate \non November 18, 2006.\n  Unfortunately, all but 2 of the 11 Appropriations bills, including \nMILCON/VA, were ultimately packaged together in a continuing resolution \nfor fiscal year 2007, and the language was never considered by the full \nCongress.\n  For too long, commercial interests have trumped the needs of our \nVeterans.\n  These 388 acres of land were donated to the Government in 1888 \nspecifically for serving and supporting our Nation's veterans and I \nstrongly believe they should remain that way.\n  This bill would make sure that this happens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1417\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``West Los Angeles Department \n     of Veterans Affairs Medical Center Preservation Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide assistance to improve the health of \nnewborns, children, and mothers in developing countries, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, on behalf of \nmyself and good friend, Senator Gordon Smith, the United States \nCommitment to Global Child Survival Act of 2007.\n  This bill seeks to drastically reduce child and maternal mortality \nrates abroad. It is a goal entirely within our reach, relying on tools \nthat are already within our grasp. We have the power to save millions \nof innocent lives; and there is no better measure for the success of \nour foreign aid.\n  The legislation would perform three simple yet vital functions. \nFirst, it would require the administration to develop and implement a \nstrategy to improve the health of, and reduce mortality rates among, \nnewborns, children, and mothers in developing countries.\n  Second, it would establish a task force to monitor and evaluate the \nprogress of the relevant departments and agencies of our Government in \nmeeting by 2015 the U.N. Millennium Development Goals related to \nreducing mortality rates for mothers and for children under 5.\n  Third, it would authorize appropriations for programs that improve \nthe health of newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries. \nSpecifically, it would increase funding for child survival programs \nfrom the current level of around $350 million to $600 million in fiscal \nyear 2008, $900 million in fiscal year 2009, $1.2 billion in fiscal \nyear 2010, and up to $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2011-2012.\n  I know that some of my colleagues will dispute the wisdom of such a \nlarge investment. None of them would deny this issue's importance; but \nsome may question its priority. How can we answer them?\n  In a world of seemingly intractable problems, we have here an \nopportunity for quick and uncomplicated success. Each dollar we spend \nin this cause helps to save a vulnerable life.\n  And what is more, we have already given our word. As part of the \nMillennium Development Goals, the United States made an explicit \ncommitment, along with 188 other countries, to reducing child and \nmaternal mortality. But at current funding levels, we are set to renege \non that promise by a wide margin.\n  On September 14, 2005, President Bush stated that the United States \nis ``committed to the Millennium Development Goals.'' I commend the \nPresident for his words, but they have not been matched with action.\n  As we reach the goals' halfway mark, the world's progress is \ndistressingly slow. The leading medical journal The Lancet reports \nthat, of the 60 countries accounting for 90 percent of child\n\n[[Page S6270]]\n\ndeaths, ``only 7 are on track to meet the goal for reducing child \nmortality, 39 are making some progress, and 14 are cause for serious \nconcern.''\n  Now what does that mean in real, human terms? It means each year over \n10 million children under the age of 5 die in the developing world, \nthat's approximately 30,000 each day. About 4 million of those children \ndie in their first 4 weeks of life. In many cases, they aren't even \nprovided with a fighting chance. Preventable or treatable diseases such \nas measles, tetanus, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria are the most \ncommon causes of death.\n  Similarly, more than 525,000 women die from causes related to \npregnancy and childbirth, more than 1,400 each day. Some of the most \ncommon risk factors for maternal death include early pregnancy and \nchildbirth, closely spaced births, infectious diseases, malnutrition, \nand complications during childbirth.\n  Nearly every one of those deaths is entirely preventable. And that \nfact makes a poor American commitment inexcusable.\n  That commitment will not require new medicine. It will not require \nsophisticated technology. The tools we need are already at hand. Even \nnow, simple measures are saving lives in the developing world.\n  Studies in the Lancet tell us that, for just over $5 billion, the \nworld could prevent two-thirds of under-5 child deaths with proven, \nlow-cost, high-impact interventions. For 6 million lives, that is a \nbargain.\n  How cheap are these lifesaving measures? Oral rehydration therapy for \ndiarrhea costs 6 cents per treatment. Antibiotics to treat respiratory \ninfections cost a quarter per treatment. Encouraging breastfeeding, \nproviding vitamin supplements and immunizations, and expanding basic \nclinical care are just as cost effective.\n  This bill incrementally scales up U.S. funding for child and maternal \nhealth programs up to $1.6 billion by 2011. That is a third of the \nmoney the world needs to save those 6 million children's lives, and it \nis proportionate to our efforts against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. And \nit is less money than we spend in Iraq in just 1 week. Yes, 1 week.\n  To be clear, America is not new to this battle. We've had some \nsignificant successes: Between 1960 and 1990, U.S. investment in \nreducing child mortality in the developing world contributed to a 50 \npercent reduction in under-5 deaths. Over the past 20 years, we have \ndevoted over $6 billion to child survival programs.\n  But as I have noted, at current funding levels in the U.S. and \nabroad, the world will not meet the Millennium Development Goals. \nCertainly, America cannot meet them alone. But with a strong effort, we \ncan galvanize other nations to do their part and come forward with the \nfunds we need to save lives.\n  So I am proud to offer the Global Child Survival Act of 2007, a bill \nwith widespread, bipartisan, bicameral support. It has been endorsed by \nSave the Children, the US Fund for UNICEF, and the One Campaign; is \nbeing jointly introduced with my good friend Senator Gordon Smith from \nacross the aisle; and was introduced last week in the House in a \nbipartisan manner by Congresswoman Betty McCollum and Congressman Chris \nShays.\n  For me it's simple. As the world's only superpower and largest \neconomy, the United States is in a unique position to tackle the \ntoughest challenges of our times. Where we can make a concrete \ndifference, we must not fail to act. Where we have the tools to \nalleviate death and suffering, we must deliver them.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Millions of lives are \nin the balance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States Commitment to \n     Global Child Survival Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 2000, the United States joined 188 countries in \n     committing to achieve 8 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \n     by 2015, including ``MDG 4'' and ``MDG 5'' that aim to reduce \n     the mortality rate of children under the age of 5 by \\2/3\\ \n     and maternal mortality rate by \\3/4\\ in developing countries, \n     respectively.\n       (2) The significant commitment of the United States to \n     reducing child mortality in the developing world contributed \n     to a 50-percent reduction in the mortality rate of children \n     under the age of 5 between 1960 and 1990, and over the past \n     20 years, the United States has invested over $6,000,000,000 \n     in child survival programs run by the United States Agency \n     for International Development.\n       (3) According to one of the world's leading medical \n     journals, the Lancet, despite United States and global \n     efforts to achieve MDG 4, of the 60 countries that account \n     for 94 percent of under-5 child deaths, ``only seven \n     countries are on track to meet MDG 4, thirty-nine countries \n     are making some progress, although they need to accelerate \n     the speed, and fourteen countries are cause for serious \n     concern''.\n       (4) 10,500,000 children under the age of 5 die annually, \n     over 29,000 children per day, from easily preventable and \n     treatable causes, including 4,000,000 newborns who die in the \n     first 4 weeks of life.\n       (5) 3,000,000 children die each year due to lack of access \n     to low-cost antibiotics and antimalarial drugs, and 1,700,000 \n     die from diseases for which vaccines are readily available.\n       (6) Maternal health is an important determinant of neonatal \n     survival with maternal death increasing death rates for \n     newborns to as high as 100 percent in certain countries in \n     the developing world.\n       (7) Approximately 525,000 women die every year in the \n     developing world from causes related to pregnancy and \n     childbirth.\n       (8) Risk factors for maternal death in developing countries \n     include pregnancy and childbirth at an early age, closely \n     spaced births, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and \n     complications during childbirth.\n       (9) According to the Lancet, nearly \\2/3\\ of annual child \n     and newborn deaths, 6,000,000 children, can be avoided in \n     accordance with MDG 4 if a package of high impact, low-cost \n     interventions were made available at a total, additional, \n     annual cost of $5,100,000,000, including oral rehydration \n     therapy for diarrhea ($0.06 per treatment) and antibiotics to \n     treat respiratory infections ($0.25 per treatment).\n       (10) 2,000,000 lives could be saved annually by providing \n     oral rehydration therapy prepared with clean water.\n       (11) Exclusive breastfeeding--giving only breast milk for \n     the first 6 months of life--could prevent an estimated \n     1,300,000 newborn and infant deaths each year, primarily by \n     protecting against diarrhea and pneumonia.\n       (12) Expansion of clinical care for newborns and mothers, \n     such as clean delivery by skilled attendants, emergency \n     obstetric care, and neonatal resuscitation, can avert 50 \n     percent of newborn deaths and reduce maternal mortality.\n       (13) The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), with \n     support from the World Health Organization, the World Bank, \n     and the African Union, has successfully demonstrated the \n     accelerated child survival and development program in \n     Senegal, Mali, Benin, and Ghana, reducing mortality of \n     children under the age of 5 by 20 percent in targeted areas \n     using low-cost, high-impact interventions.\n       (14) On September 14, 2005, President George W. Bush stated \n     before the United Nations High-Level Plenary Meeting that the \n     United States is ``committed to the Millennium Development \n     Goals''.\n       (15) Nearing the halfway point of attaining the MDGs by \n     2015 with thousands of avoidable newborn, child, and maternal \n     deaths still occurring, the United States must immediately \n     scale up its funding and delivery of proven low-cost, life-\n     saving interventions in order to fulfill its commitment to \n     help ensure that MDGs 4 and 5 are met.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to develop a strategy to reduce mortality and improve \n     the health of newborns, children, and mothers, and authorize \n     assistance for its implementation; and\n       (2) to establish a task force to assess, monitor, and \n     evaluate the progress and contributions of relevant \n     departments and agencies of the United States Government in \n     achieving MDGs 4 and 5.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Energy Diplomacy and \n     Security Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 702. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Major energy producer.--The term ``major energy \n     producer'' means a country that--\n       (A) had crude oil, oil sands, or natural gas to liquids \n     production of 1,000,000 barrels per day or greater average in \n     the previous year;\n       (B) has crude oil, shale oil, or oil sands reserves of \n     6,000,000,000 barrels or greater, as recognized by the \n     Department of Energy;\n       (C) had natural gas production of 30,000,000,000 cubic \n     meters or greater in the previous year;\n       (D) has natural gas reserves of 1,250,000,000,000 cubic \n     meters or greater, as recognized by the Department of Energy; \n     or\n       (E) is a direct supplier of natural gas or liquefied \n     natural gas to the United States.\n       (2) Major energy consumer.--The term ``major energy \n     consumer'' means a country that--\n       (A) had an oil consumption average of 1,000,000 barrels per \n     day or greater in the previous year;\n       (B) had an oil consumption growth rate of 8 percent or \n     greater in the previous year;\n       (C) had a natural gas consumption of 30,000,000,000 cubic \n     meters or greater in the previous year; or\n       (D) had a natural gas consumption growth rate of 15 percent \n     or greater in the previous year.\n\n     SEC. 703. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENERGY DIPLOMACY AND SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is imperative to the national security and \n     prosperity of the United States to have reliable, affordable, \n     clean, sufficient, and sustainable sources of energy.\n       (2) United States dependence on oil imports causes \n     tremendous costs to the United States national security, \n     economy, foreign policy, military, and environmental \n     sustainability.\n       (3) Energy security is a priority for the governments of \n     many foreign countries and increasingly plays a central role \n     in the relations of the United States Government with foreign \n     governments. Global reserves of oil and natural gas are \n     concentrated in a small number of countries. Access to these \n     oil and natural gas supplies depends on the political will of \n     these producing states. Competition between governments for \n     access to oil and natural gas reserves can lead to economic, \n     political, and armed conflict. Oil exporting states have \n     received dramatically increased revenues due to high global \n     prices, enhancing the ability of some of these states to act \n     in a manner threatening to global stability.\n       (4) Efforts to combat poverty and protect the environment \n     are hindered by the continued predominance of oil and natural \n     gas in meeting global energy needs. Development of renewable \n     energy through sustainable practices will help lead to a \n     reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and enhance \n     international development.\n       (5) Cooperation on energy issues between the United States \n     Government and the governments of foreign countries is \n     critical for securing the strategic and economic interests of \n     the United States and of partner governments. In the current \n     global energy situation, the energy policies and activities \n     of the governments of foreign countries can have dramatic \n     impacts on United States energy security.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States national security requires that the \n     United States Government have an energy policy that pursues \n     the strategic goal of achieving energy security through \n     access to clean, affordable, sufficient, reliable, and \n     sustainable sources of energy;\n       (2) achieving energy security is a priority for United \n     States foreign policy and requires continued and enhanced \n     engagement with foreign governments and entities in a variety \n     of areas, including activities relating to the promotion of \n     alternative and renewable fuels, trade and investment in oil, \n     coal, and natural gas, energy efficiency, climate and \n     environmental protection, data transparency, advanced \n     scientific research, public-private partnerships, and energy \n     activities in international development;\n       (3) the President should ensure that the international \n     energy activities of the United States Government are given \n     clear focus to support the national security needs of the \n     United States, and to this end, there should be established a \n     mechanism to coordinate the implementation of United States \n     international energy policy among the Federal agencies \n     engaged in relevant agreements and activities; and\n       (4) the Secretary of State should ensure that energy \n     security is integrated into the core mission of the \n     Department of State, and to this end, there should be \n     established within the Office of the Secretary of State a \n     Coordinator for International Energy Affairs with \n     responsibility for--\n       (A) developing United States international energy policy in \n     coordination with the Department of Energy and other relevant \n     Federal agencies;\n       (B) working with appropriate United States Government \n     officials to develop and update analyses of the national \n     security implications of global energy developments;\n       (C) incorporating energy security priorities into the \n     activities of the Department;\n       (D) coordinating activities with relevant Federal agencies; \n     and\n       (E) coordinating energy security and other relevant \n     functions currently undertaken by offices within the Bureau \n     of Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs, the Bureau \n     of Democracy and Global Affairs, and other offices within the \n     Department of State.\n\n     SEC. 704. STRATEGIC ENERGY PARTNERSHIPS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S6299]]\n\n       (1) United States Government partnership with foreign \n     governments and entities, including partnership with the \n     private sector, for securing reliable and sustainable energy \n     is imperative to ensuring United States security and economic \n     interests, promoting international peace and security, \n     expanding international development, supporting democratic \n     reform, fostering economic growth, and safeguarding the \n     environment.\n       (2) Democracy and freedom should be promoted globally by \n     partnership with foreign governments, including in particular \n     governments of emerging democracies such as those of Ukraine \n     and Georgia, in their efforts to reduce their dependency on \n     oil and natural gas imports.\n       (3) The United States Government and the governments of \n     foreign countries have common needs for adequate, reliable, \n     affordable, clean, and sustainable energy in order to ensure \n     national security, economic growth, and high standards of \n     living in their countries. Cooperation by the United States \n     Government with foreign governments on meeting energy \n     security needs is mutually beneficial. United States \n     Government partnership with foreign governments should \n     include cooperation with major energy consuming countries, \n     major energy producing countries, and other governments \n     seeking to advance global energy security through reliable \n     and sustainable means.\n       (4) The United States Government participates in hundreds \n     of bilateral and multilateral energy agreements and \n     activities with foreign governments and entities. These \n     agreements and activities should reflect the strategic need \n     for energy security.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States--\n       (1) to advance global energy security through cooperation \n     with foreign governments and entities;\n       (2) to promote reliable, diverse, and sustainable sources \n     of all types of energy;\n       (3) to increase global availability of renewable and clean \n     sources of energy;\n       (4) to decrease global dependence on oil and natural gas \n     energy sources; and\n       (5) to engage in energy cooperation to strengthen strategic \n     partnerships that advance peace, security, and democratic \n     prosperity.\n       (c) Authority.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to \n     establish and expand strategic energy partnerships with the \n     governments of major energy producers and major energy \n     consumers, and with governments of other countries (but \n     excluding any countries that are ineligible to receive United \n     States economic or military assistance).\n       (d) Purposes.--The purposes of the strategic energy \n     partnerships established pursuant to subsection (c) are--\n       (1) to strengthen global relationships to promote \n     international peace and security through fostering \n     cooperation in the energy sector on a mutually beneficial \n     basis in accordance with respective national energy policies;\n       (2) to promote the policy set forth in subsection (b), \n     including activities to advance--\n       (A) the mutual understanding of each country's energy \n     needs, priorities, and policies, including interparliamentary \n     understanding;\n       (B) measures to respond to acute energy supply disruptions, \n     particularly in regard to petroleum and natural gas \n     resources;\n       (C) long-term reliability and sustainability in energy \n     supply;\n       (D) the safeguarding and safe handling of nuclear fuel;\n       (E) human and environmental protection;\n       (F) renewable energy production;\n       (G) access to reliable and affordable energy for \n     underdeveloped areas, in particular energy access for the \n     poor;\n       (H) appropriate commercial cooperation;\n       (I) information reliability and transparency; and\n       (J) research and training collaboration;\n       (3) to advance the national security priority of developing \n     sustainable and clean energy sources, including through \n     research and development related to, and deployment of--\n       (A) renewable electrical energy sources, including biomass, \n     wind, and solar;\n       (B) renewable transportation fuels, including biofuels;\n       (C) clean coal technologies;\n       (D) carbon sequestration, including in conjunction with \n     power generation, agriculture, and forestry; and\n       (E) energy and fuel efficiency, including hybrids and plug-\n     in hybrids, flexible fuel, advanced composites, hydrogen, and \n     other transportation technologies; and\n       (4) to provide strategic focus for current and future \n     United States Government activities in energy cooperation to \n     meet the global need for energy security.\n       (e) Determination of Agendas.--In general, the specific \n     agenda with respect to a particular strategic energy \n     partnership, and the Federal agencies designated to implement \n     related activities, shall be determined by the Secretary of \n     State and the Secretary of Energy.\n       (f) Use of Current Agreements To Establish Partnerships.--\n     Some or all of the purposes of the strategic energy \n     partnerships established under subsection (c) may be pursued \n     through existing bilateral or multilateral agreements and \n     activities. Such agreements and activities shall be subject \n     to the reporting requirements in subsection (g).\n       (g) Reports Required.--\n       (1) Initial progress report.--Not later than 180 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State \n     shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a \n     report on progress made in developing the strategic energy \n     partnerships authorized under this section.\n       (2) Annual progress reports.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 20 \n     years, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees an annual report on agreements \n     entered into and activities undertaken pursuant to this \n     section, including international environment activities.\n       (B) Content.--Each report submitted under this paragraph \n     shall include details on--\n       (i) agreements and activities pursued by the United States \n     Government with foreign governments and entities, the \n     implementation plans for such agreements and progress \n     measurement benchmarks, United States Government resources \n     used in pursuit of such agreements and activities, and \n     legislative changes recommended for improved partnership; and\n       (ii) polices and actions in the energy sector of \n     partnership countries pertinent to United States economic, \n     security, and environmental interests.\n\n     SEC. 705. INTERNATIONAL ENERGY CRISIS RESPONSE MECHANISMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cooperation between the United States Government and \n     governments of other countries during energy crises promotes \n     the national security of the United States.\n       (2) The participation of the United States in the \n     International Energy Program established under the Agreement \n     on an International Energy Program, done at Paris November \n     18, 1974 (27 UST 1685), including in the coordination of \n     national strategic petroleum reserves, is a national security \n     asset that--\n       (A) protects the consumers and the economy of the United \n     States in the event of a major disruption in petroleum \n     supply;\n       (B) maximizes the effectiveness of the United States \n     strategic petroleum reserve through cooperation in accessing \n     global reserves of various petroleum products;\n       (C) provides market reassurance in countries that are \n     members of the International Energy Program; and\n       (D) strengthens United States Government relationships with \n     members of the International Energy Program.\n       (3) The International Energy Agency projects that the \n     largest growth in demand for petroleum products, other than \n     demand from the United States, will come from China and \n     India, which are not members of the International Energy \n     Program. The Governments of China and India vigorously pursue \n     access to global oil reserves and are attempting to develop \n     national petroleum reserves. Participation of the Governments \n     of China and India in an international petroleum reserve \n     mechanism would promote global energy security, but such \n     participation should be conditional on the Governments of \n     China and India abiding by customary petroleum reserve \n     management practices.\n       (4) In the Western Hemisphere, only the United States and \n     Canada are members of the International Energy Program. The \n     vulnerability of most Western Hemisphere countries to supply \n     disruptions from political, natural, or terrorism causes may \n     introduce instability in the hemisphere and can be a source \n     of conflict, despite the existence of major oil reserves in \n     the hemisphere.\n       (5) Countries that are not members of the International \n     Energy Program and are unable to maintain their own national \n     strategic reserves are vulnerable to petroleum supply \n     disruption. Disruption in petroleum supply and spikes in \n     petroleum costs could devastate the economies of developing \n     countries and could cause internal or interstate conflict.\n       (6) The involvement of the United States Government in the \n     extension of international mechanisms to coordinate strategic \n     petroleum reserves and the extension of other emergency \n     preparedness measures should strengthen the current \n     International Energy Program.\n       (b) Energy Crisis Response Mechanisms With India and \n     China.--\n       (1) Authority.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to \n     establish a petroleum crisis response mechanism or mechanisms \n     with the Governments of China and India.\n       (2) Scope.--The mechanism or mechanisms established under \n     paragraph (1) should include--\n       (A) technical assistance in the development and management \n     of national strategic petroleum reserves;\n       (B) agreements for coordinating drawdowns of strategic \n     petroleum reserves with the United States, conditional upon \n     reserve holdings and management conditions established by the \n     Secretary of Energy;\n       (C) emergency demand restraint measures;\n       (D) fuel switching preparedness and alternative fuel \n     production capacity; and\n       (E) ongoing demand intensity reduction programs.\n       (3) Use of existing agreements to establish mechanism.--The \n     Secretary may, after consultation with Congress and in \n     accordance with existing international agreements, including \n     the International Energy Program,\n\n[[Page S6300]]\n\n     include China and India in a petroleum crisis response \n     mechanism through existing or new agreements.\n       (c) Energy Crisis Response Mechanism for the Western \n     Hemisphere.--\n       (1) Authority.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to \n     establish a Western Hemisphere energy crisis response \n     mechanism.\n       (2) Scope.--The mechanism established under paragraph (1) \n     should include--\n       (A) an information sharing and coordinating mechanism in \n     case of energy supply emergencies;\n       (B) technical assistance in the development and management \n     of national strategic petroleum reserves within countries of \n     the Western Hemisphere;\n       (C) technical assistance in developing national programs to \n     meet the requirements of membership in a future international \n     energy application procedure as described in subsection (d);\n       (D) emergency demand restraint measures;\n       (E) energy switching preparedness and alternative energy \n     production capacity; and\n       (F) ongoing demand intensity reduction programs.\n       (3) Membership.--The Secretary should seek to include in \n     the Western Hemisphere energy crisis response mechanism \n     membership for each major energy producer and major energy \n     consumer in the Western Hemisphere and other members of the \n     Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum authorized under section \n     706.\n       (d) International Energy Program Application Procedure.--\n       (1) Authority.--The President should place on the agenda \n     for discussion at the Governing Board of the International \n     Energy Agency, as soon as practicable, the merits of \n     establishing an international energy program application \n     procedure.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of such procedure is to allow \n     countries that are not members of the International Energy \n     Program to apply to the Governing Board of the International \n     Energy Agency for allocation of petroleum reserve stocks in \n     times of emergency on a grant or loan basis. Such countries \n     should also receive technical assistance for, and be subject \n     to, conditions requiring development and management of \n     national programs for energy emergency preparedness, \n     including demand restraint, fuel switching preparedness, and \n     development of alternative fuels production capacity.\n       (e) Reports Required.--\n       (1) Petroleum reserves.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy \n     shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a \n     report that evaluates the options for adapting the United \n     States national strategic petroleum reserve and the \n     international petroleum reserve coordinating mechanism in \n     order to carry out this section.\n       (2) Crisis response mechanisms.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     State, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, shall \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     on the status of the establishment of the international \n     petroleum crisis response mechanisms described in subsections \n     (b) and (c). The report shall include recommendations of the \n     Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy for any \n     legislation necessary to establish or carry out such \n     mechanisms.\n       (3) Emergency application procedure.--Not later than 60 \n     days after a discussion by the Governing Board of the \n     International Energy Agency of the application procedure \n     described under subsection (d), the President should submit \n     to Congress a report that describes--\n       (A) the actions the United States Government has taken \n     pursuant to such subsection; and\n       (B) a summary of the debate on the matter before the \n     Governing Board of the International Energy Agency, including \n     any decision that has been reached by the Governing Board \n     with respect to the matter.\n\n     SEC. 706. HEMISPHERE ENERGY COOPERATION FORUM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The engagement of the United States Government with \n     governments of countries in the Western Hemisphere is a \n     strategic priority for reducing the potential for tension \n     over energy resources, maintaining and expanding reliable \n     energy supplies, expanding use of renewable energy, and \n     reducing the detrimental effects of energy import dependence \n     within the hemisphere. Current energy dialogues should be \n     expanded and refocused as needed to meet this challenge.\n       (2) Countries of the Western Hemisphere can most \n     effectively meet their common needs for energy security and \n     sustainability through partnership and cooperation. \n     Cooperation between governments on energy issues will enhance \n     bilateral relationships among countries of the hemisphere. \n     The Western Hemisphere is rich in natural resources, \n     including biomass, oil, natural gas, coal, and has \n     significant opportunity for production of renewable hydro, \n     solar, wind, and other energies. Countries of the Western \n     Hemisphere can provide convenient and reliable markets for \n     trade in energy goods and services.\n       (3) Development of sustainable energy alternatives in the \n     countries of the Western Hemisphere can improve energy \n     security, balance of trade, and environmental quality and \n     provide markets for energy technology and agricultural \n     products. Brazil and the United States have led the world in \n     the production of ethanol, and deeper cooperation on biofuels \n     with other countries of the hemisphere would extend economic \n     and security benefits.\n       (4) Private sector partnership and investment in all \n     sources of energy is critical to providing energy security in \n     the Western Hemisphere.\n       (b) Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum.--\n       (1) Establishment.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to \n     establish a regional-based ministerial forum to be known as \n     the Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum.\n       (2) Purposes.--The Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum \n     should seek--\n       (A) to strengthen relationships between the United States \n     and other countries of the Western Hemisphere through \n     cooperation on energy issues;\n       (B) to enhance cooperation between major energy producers \n     and major energy consumers in the Western Hemisphere, \n     particularly among the governments of Brazil, Canada, Mexico, \n     the United States, and Venezuela;\n       (C) to ensure that energy contributes to the economic, \n     social, and environmental enhancement of the countries of the \n     Western Hemisphere;\n       (D) to provide an opportunity for open dialogue and joint \n     commitments between member governments and with private \n     industry; and\n       (E) to provide participating countries the flexibility \n     necessary to cooperatively address broad challenges posed to \n     the energy supply of the Western Hemisphere that are \n     practical in policy terms and politically acceptable.\n       (3) Activities.--The Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum \n     should implement the following activities:\n       (A) An Energy Crisis Initiative that will establish \n     measures to respond to temporary energy supply disruptions, \n     including through--\n       (i) strengthening sea-lane and infrastructure security;\n       (ii) implementing a real-time emergency information sharing \n     system;\n       (iii) encouraging members to have emergency mechanisms and \n     contingency plans in place; and\n       (iv) establishing a Western Hemisphere energy crisis \n     response mechanism as authorized under section 705(c).\n       (B) An Energy Sustainability Initiative to facilitate long-\n     term supply security through fostering reliable supply \n     sources of fuels, including development, deployment, and \n     commercialization of technologies for sustainable renewable \n     fuels within the region, including activities that--\n       (i) promote production and trade in sustainable energy, \n     including energy from biomass;\n       (ii) facilitate investment, trade, and technology \n     cooperation in energy infrastructure, petroleum products, \n     natural gas (including liquefied natural gas), energy \n     efficiency (including automotive efficiency), clean fossil \n     energy, renewable energy, and carbon sequestration;\n       (iii) promote regional infrastructure and market \n     integration;\n       (iv) develop effective and stable regulatory frameworks;\n       (v) develop renewable fuels standards and renewable \n     portfolio standards;\n       (vi) establish educational training and exchange programs \n     between member countries; and\n       (vii) identify and remove barriers to trade in technology, \n     services, and commodities.\n       (C) An Energy for Development Initiative to promote energy \n     access for underdeveloped areas through energy policy and \n     infrastructure development, including activities that--\n       (i) increase access to energy services for the poor;\n       (ii) improve energy sector market conditions;\n       (iii) promote rural development though biomass energy \n     production and use;\n       (iv) increase transparency of, and participation in, energy \n     infrastructure projects;\n       (v) promote development and deployment of technology for \n     clean and sustainable energy development, including biofuel \n     and clean coal technologies; and\n       (vi) facilitate use of carbon sequestration methods in \n     agriculture and forestry and linking greenhouse gas emissions \n     reduction programs to international carbon markets.\n       (c) Hemisphere Energy Industry Group.--\n       (1) Authority.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy, \n     should approach the governments of other countries in the \n     Western Hemisphere to seek cooperation in establishing a \n     Hemisphere Energy Industry Group, to be coordinated by the \n     United States Government, involving industry representatives \n     and government representatives from the Western Hemisphere.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of the forum should be to \n     increase public-private partnerships, foster private \n     investment, and enable countries of the Western Hemisphere to \n     devise energy agendas compatible with industry capacity and \n     cognizant of industry goals.\n       (3) Topics of dialogues.--Topics for the forum should \n     include--\n       (A) promotion of a secure investment climate;\n\n[[Page S6301]]\n\n       (B) development and deployment of biofuels and other \n     alternative fuels and clean electrical production facilities, \n     including clean coal and carbon sequestration;\n       (C) development and deployment of energy efficient \n     technologies and practices, including in the industrial, \n     residential, and transportation sectors;\n       (D) investment in oil and natural gas production and \n     distribution;\n       (E) transparency of energy production and reserves data;\n       (F) research promotion; and\n       (G) training and education exchange programs.\n       (d) Annual Report.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees an annual report on the \n     implementation of this section, including the strategy and \n     benchmarks for measurement of progress developed under this \n     section.\n\n     SEC. 707. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.\n\n       In this title, the term ``appropriate congressional \n     committees'' means the Committee on Foreign Relations and the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Energy \n     and Commerce of the House of Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1420. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nrequire staff working with developmentally disabled individuals to call \nemergency services in the event of a life-threatening situation; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend Senator \nLautenberg to reintroduce Danielle's Act, an important piece of \nlegislation that I know will save countless lives. I would also like to \nrecognize Representative Rush Holt, who has championed the bill in the \nHouse and has been a tireless advocate for individuals with \ndisabilities. This bill is named in memory of a young woman from New \nJersey, Danielle Gruskowski, whose life was cut tragically short by a \nfailure to call 9-1-1. The great State of New Jersey has already passed \nDanielle's Law, and it is time for Congress to act as well.\n  In order to understand the importance of this legislation, I would \nlike to share Danielle's story. She was born December 6, 1969, to Diane \nand Doug Gruskowski and raised in Carteret, NJ. Danielle was \ndevelopmentally disabled and diagnosed with Rett Syndrome, a \nneurological disorder that causes a delay or regression in development, \nincluding speech, hand skills, and coordination. While Danielle needed \nhelp with daily activities, she managed to lead a full and active life. \nAs a young adult, Danielle moved to a group home to experience the \npositive benefits of independent living. Tragically, on November 5, \n2002, Danielle passed away at the age of 32 because no one in the group \nhome called 9-1-1 when she was clearly in need of emergency medical \nattention.\n  So that no other mother would lose her child in such a tragic \ncircumstance, Danielle's mother and her aunt, Robin Turner, developed a \nstrong coalition of supporters and worked with their State \nrepresentatives to develop and pass what we know as Danielle's Law. \nLike the New Jersey law, my bill will require staff working with \nindividuals who have a developmental disability or traumatic brain \ninjury to call emergency services in the event of a life-threatening \nsituation. The legislation would raise the standard of care by \nimproving staff training and ensuring that individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities get emergency care when they need it.\n  All Americans deserve an advocate, and today I am speaking for those \nwho often cannot speak for themselves. I am proud to be an advocate for \nindividuals with disabilities, and I am proud to be an advocate for the \nfamilies in New Jersey who are counting on safe, secure, and healthy \nindependent living environments for their loved ones with disabilities. \nI also would like to recognize the hard-working caregivers and staff \nwho help provide for the needs of those with disabilities. They show \ntheir compassion every day when they show up for work, performing one \nof the most difficult but rewarding jobs in our society--caring for \nsomeone's mother, father, son, or daughter. These caregivers play such \na critical role in our society and their contributions are to be \ncommended.

A bill to provide for the maintenance, management, and \navailability for research of assets of Air Force Health Study; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation intended \nto ensure that valuable biological specimens and data from a seminal \nAir Force Health Study will be properly maintained and safeguarded for \nfuture research opportunities.\n  In 1979, the U.S. Air Force began a study that lasted over 20 years \nto evaluate the health outcomes of occupational exposure to agent \norange among the men who were members of Operation Ranch Hand during \nthe Vietnam War. That study is now completed.\n  During six cycles of examinations--1982, 1985, 1987, 1992, 1997, and \n2002--in which 2,758 members of the Air Force participated, data and \nspecimens were gathered. No other epidemiological data set of Vietnam \nveterans contains as detailed information over as long a time period. \nAnalysis of this data has contributed to a greater understanding of the \nlong-term health effects of exposure to agent orange. Approximately \n$143 million was spent on this study.\n  An amendment I authored last year, which was included in the 2006 \nNational Defense Authorization Act, resulted in transferring Ranch Hand \nStudy materials from the Air Force to the Medical Follow-Up Agency of \nthe Institute of Medicine for preservation and future use. In order to \nmake the most effective use of this material, the Medical Follow-Up \nAgency requires small amounts of funding for several years to ensure \nthat the specimens and data are properly maintained in a useful format \nand made available for further research.\n  My bill is consistent with the recommendations of the Institute of \nMedicine's report on the disposition of the study. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 1422. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a \nprogram to provide to agricultural operators and producers a reserve to \nassist in the stabilization of farm income during low-revenue years, to \nassist operators and producers to invest in value-added farms, to \npromote higher levels of environmental stewardship, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Farm Risk \nManagement Act for the 21st Century. This bill is a\n\n[[Page S6302]]\n\nblueprint on how to transition away from the farm programs linked to \nthe Great Depression into a new market driven system. We have also \nsuggested how Congress could utilize achieved savings to improve our \nfarm economy, our environment, alleviate hunger, promote renewable \nenergy, and reduce our Federal deficit.\n  Current Federal Farm Programs target payments to a relatively narrow \nsector of American farmers and provide direct payments regardless of \ncommodity prices. The bulk of these payments are made to growers of \njust 5 crops. Cotton, rice, corn, wheat, and soybean farmers receive \nabout 85 percent of the annual payments provided by U.S. taxpayers. \nNotably, about 70 percent of these payments go to only 10 percent of \nour nation's farmers.\n  The current farm subsidy system is inequitable, inefficient, and \ndisconnected from the core goal of maintaining a family farm safety \nnet. It is also self-perpetuating, in that it stimulates over-\nproduction and stagnant prices that produce calls for greater \nGovernment support. I believe that what we need is a true safety net \nthat would embrace all farmers, avoid incentives to overproduce \ncommodities when market signals do not exist, and lower costs for \ntaxpayers.\n  On my farm in Marion County, IN, we have 604 acres of corn, soybeans, \nand trees. This farm currently qualifies and receives direct payments \nas well as counter-cyclical and loan deficiency payments when prices \ndictate. Under this new plan we would continue to receive these \npayments for one year. After that year the farm will receive direct \npayments that decline over the next 5 years, and most of those payments \nwould be deposited in an individual risk management account held in \nconjunction with the Secretary of Agriculture at a lending institution \nof our choice. We would be able to use funds from this risk management \naccount to purchase crop or revenue insurance, to invest in enterprises \nthat add value to the crops we produce, or to cover losses not covered \nby crop or revenue insurance compared to the 5 year revenue average of \nour operation. This legislation would also provide incentives for \nemploying environmentally responsible farming techniques and other \nconservation practices.\n  In addition to being a more market oriented approach, the plan also \nhas the added advantage of saving Federal resources, which will be \ninvested in conservation activities, domestic and international \nnutrition programs, bioenergy research and deployment, and deficit \nreduction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1425. A bill to enhance the defense nanotechnology research and \ndevelopment program; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nCollins from Maine and Senator Warner from Virginia to introduce \nlegislation to strengthen the Department of Defense nanotechnology \ninitiative. I greatly appreciate their strong leadership on this issue \nand their understanding of the importance of how the development of \nnanotechnology will impact our armed forces in the future.\n  This bill, the Defense Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of \n2007, sustains the Department's nanotechnology research and development \nprogram while at the same time transitioning the technologies developed \ninto products that can enhance the United States military capability.\n  The Department of Defense has done a tremendous job conducting \nnanotechnology research and development. Examples of this \nnanotechnology research include improved energy absorbing body armor, \nlightweight batteries, and novel chemical and biological sensor. I \nbelieve now is the time to start the transition of this research into \nnew technologies and products to protect our military personnel and \nenhance our war fighting capability.\n  The Department of Defense has a long history of successfully \nsupporting innovative nanotechnology research efforts for the future \nadvancement of the war fighter and battle systems. Congress established \nthe defense nanotechnology research program Section 246 of the Bob \nStump National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2003, Public \nLaw 107-314, which this bill updates and enhances. Section 246 requires \nthe Secretary of Defense to carry out a defense nanotechnology research \nand development program in coordination with other Federal agencies \nperforming nanotechnology research and development activities \nestablished by the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development \nAct, Public Law 108-153. The investment strategy described in the \nNational Nanotechnology Initiative, or NNI, Strategic Plan identifies \nand defines 7 major subject categories, or program component areas, \nrelating to areas of investment that are critical to accomplishing the \noverall goals of the NNI. The Department of Defense has organized its \nnanotechnology research to align with these 7 program component areas \nand each year since 2004 has submitted to Congress an annual report on \nthe nanotechnology programs within the Department of Defense.\n  This bill requires the Secretary of Defense to act through the Under \nSecretary for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, who shall \nsupervise the planning, management, and coordination of the program. We \nbelieve this office can best achieve the goals of maintaining a state-\nof-the-art research and development program while simultaneously \naccomplishing technology transition. The bill directs the Department to \ncoordinate all nanoscale research and development within the Department \nof Defense with other departments and agencies of the United States \nthat are involved in the NNI and with the National Nanotechnology \nCoordination Office, NNCO, including providing appropriate funds to \nsupport the NNCO. The bill also directs the Department to develop a \nstrategic plan for defense nanotechnology research and development that \nintegrates with the NNI strategic plan, issue policy guidance each year \nto the defense agencies and services that prioritizes the Program's \nresearch initiatives, state a clear strategy for transitioning the \nresearch into products needed by the Department of Defense, and develop \na plan to transition nanoscale research and development within the \nDepartment of Defense, including the Small Business Innovative Research \nand Small Business Technology Transfer Research programs, to the \nDepartment of Defense Manufacturing Technology program.\n\n  Finally, the bill requires the Department to submit a biennial report \nto the congressional defense committees describing the Department's \ncoordination with the other departments and agencies participating in \nthe NNI, a review of the findings relating to the Department by the NNI \ntriennial external review, an assessment of the Department's technology \ntransition from research to enhanced war fighting capability, an \nevaluation of nanotechnology used in foreign defense systems, and an \nappraisal of the defense nanotechnology manufacturing and industrial \nbase. Because there is a need for metrics and goals to ensure that the \nDepartment's nanotechnology program is well structured and successfully \ndeveloping needed defense technologies, the bill requires a review by \nthe Government Accountability Office of the overall Department \nnanotechnology program.\n  Nanotechnology is one of the next great scientific frontiers with the \npotential to enable novel applications that can enhance war fighting \nand battle system capabilities. I am proud to say that in Arkansas \nseveral universities including the University of Arkansas, the \nUniversity of Arkansas at Little Rock, and Arkansas State University \nare performing research and technology development in support of the \nDepartment of Defense nanotechnology program. One example of particular \nnote is the Center for Ferroelectric Electronic-Photonic Nanodevices \nthat is developing new nanomagnetic devices for high performance \ninformation and communication technology. Our Arkansas small businesses \nare also contributing to the defense nanotechnology industrial base by \ndeveloping novel nanoscale materials, devices, and products.\n  I am very excited by the future nanotechnology holds for Arkansas and \nthe United States. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee I \nlook forward to working to strengthen the Department of Defense \nnanotechnology program.\n\n[[Page S6303]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1425\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nas an independent agency, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nremove the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and restore it as an independent, \ncabinet-level agency.\n  In the days after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Americans witnessed \nincompetence on the part of FEMA, the Department of Homeland Security, \nand the Administration in responding to a catastrophe of this \nmagnitude. Countless Americans who were left behind were failed by \ntheir government when they needed help the most.\n  Sadly, the tragedy continues for the more than 80,000 people still \nliving in trailers and for the cities and towns still struggling to \nrebuild. In the years since the catastrophes of Katrina and Rita, \nFEMA's failures have continued.\n  The Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security found \nthat FEMA awarded $3.6 billion in contracts to maintain trailers for \nhurricane victims to companies with no ties to the Gulf Coast region \nand bad paperwork.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, FEMA wasted $1 \nbillion in improper payments to individuals. FEMA spent $900 million on \ntrailers that could not be used in flood zones. And FEMA paid $1.8 \nbillion for hotel rooms and cruise ship cabins that were more expensive \nthan apartments.\n  It was reported recently that more than $40 million worth of \nstockpiled food for the 2006 hurricane season spoiled due to FEMA's \nlack of preparation.\n  FEMA also disclosed in recent days that it will not have a new \nnational response plan ready in time for the start of this year's \nhurricane season.\n  It is past time to restore competence and accountability, and to \nreestablish FEMA as an independent agency outside the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  In the Clinton administration, the head of FEMA reported directly to \nthe President of the United States and that direct communication meant \nthe buck stopped with the President, instead of being lost in the \nbureaucracy.\n  The Government Accountability Office says that managing the \ntransformation of an agency of the size and complexity of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security will likely span a number of years. \nUnfortunately with regard to preparing and recovering from a disaster, \nwe cannot wait years for the Department of Homeland Security to live up \nto its intended mission. When the next disaster or catastrophe happens, \nwe cannot afford to say that we'll be ready next time.\n  Under my legislation, the Director of FEMA reports directly to the \nPresident\n\n[[Page S6304]]\n\nand would have full authority to coordinate with all agencies and to \ntake the necessary action to ensure resources and recovery personnel \nare deployed quickly in an emergency to impacted areas.\n  When we created the Department of Homeland Security, in the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002, I said then that I was deeply concerned about \nmoving FEMA under the Department of Homeland Security because when it \noperated as an independent agency, especially on September 11 and in \nthe response thereafter, it was highly-functioning, and well-run.\n  I remarked then that moving FEMA under the Department of Homeland \nSecurity must not force a highly-functioning and competent agency into \na bureaucracy that will challenge integration and diminish FEMA's \neffectiveness in responding to crises of all kinds. Unfortunately, that \nseems to be exactly what has happened and that is exactly what we must \nfix.\n  The bureaucracy created by moving FEMA under the Department of \nHomeland Security is clearly not working and we must ensure that FEMA \nhas the ability and the authority to respond to a disaster or \ncatastrophe. I thank all of my colleagues who have cosponsored this \nlegislation and I hope that every Senator in this chamber will \ncosponsor this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part B of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to assure access to durable medical equipment under the Medicare \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Conrad and \nRoberts in introducing the Medicare Durable Medical Equipment Access \nAct of 2007.\n  Some background on why this bill is necessary might be useful.\n  Among the provisions of the Medicare Modernization Act, MMA, was a \nprovision that instituted a bidding process for durable medical \nequipment. It was a good concept--we have all seen the advantages to \nMedicare beneficiaries and to the Federal Government of competitive \nbidding in Medicare Part D. The government and beneficiaries are paying \nlower prices for prescription drugs as a result of fair competition.\n  At the time of the passage of the MMA, it was known that Medicare was \noverpaying substantially for certain durable medical equipment. The MMA \ninstituted a bidding process for durable medical equipment in order to \nbring market discipline to the purchasing process. It also directed the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, to establish badly needed \nquality standards for Medicare's suppliers of durable medical equipment \nand related services.\n  The purpose of S. 1428, the Medicare Durable Equipment Access Act, is \nto correct problems arising from provisions in the MMA that apply to \nrural areas and urban areas of low population density. The bill seeks \nto protect the access of Medicare beneficiaries in these areas to \nhomecare equipment and services. It also will allow small businesses to \nparticipate in the program, but only if they meet the quality standards \nestablished in this legislation and can meet the competitively bid \nprice.\n  The bill protects Medicare beneficiaries in three ways.\n  First, the MMA permits the HHS Secretary to exempt from the bidding \nprocess rural areas and areas with low population density that are not \ncompetitive unless there is a significant national market through mail \norder for a particular item or service. The law also permits suppliers \nin rural areas to be exempted from the program's quality standards. \nMedicare patients must be assured that they are dealing with qualified \nsuppliers and our bill assures them that they will be.\n  Second, the MMA allows the Secretary of HHS to exempt rural areas and \nsparsely populated urban areas from the bidding process if they lack \nhealth care infrastructure, a vague and subjective judgment. This bill \ndefines areas eligible for exemption as metropolitan service areas with \nfewer than 500,000 people.\n  Finally, the MMA established a Program Advisory and Oversight \nCommittee to advise the Secretary on implementation of the program. The \nMMA exempted the Program Advisory and Oversight Committee from The \nFederal Advisory Committee Act, FACA. FACA was enacted by Congress in \n1972. Its purpose is to ensure that committees that advise the \nexecutive branch be accessible to the public and objective in their \njudgments. This bill places this program under FACA.\n  This legislation also provides important protection to small \nbusinesses. The MMA provides that there shall be no administrative or \njudicial review for businesses participating in competitive bidding. \nOur bill provides for judicial appeal rights, giving legal recourse to \nbusinesses that participate in the competitive bidding process.\n  The MMA also directs the HHS Secretary to take appropriate steps to \nensure that small suppliers have an opportunity to participate. Our \nbill specifies that such appropriate steps shall include permitting \nsuppliers that are classified as small businesses under the Small \nBusiness Act to continue to participate at the single payment amount, \nso long as they submit bids at less than the fee schedule amount.\n  In addition, the MMA permits the HHS Secretary to use competitive \nacquisition bid rates from one region to determine payment rates in \nanother noncompetitive acquisition area. Our bill requires the HHS \nSecretary to complete a comparability analysis to ensure that payments \nin non-competitive areas are fair. It requires the Secretary to publish \nthe analysis in the Federal Register.\n  Finally, the purpose of the competitive bidding process is to save \nthe Medicare program and its beneficiaries' money from the purchase of \ndurable medical equipment, but a new bureaucracy must be created to \nimplement the program. Our bill requires the HHS Secretary to exempt \nfrom competitive acquisition requirements any items and services not \nlikely to result in savings of at least 10 percent.\n  Twenty-five small suppliers of durable medical equipment in Utah have \nbanded together to support this legislation and I believe they speak \nfor hundreds of small suppliers around the United States. They support \nthe establishment of quality standards for all suppliers of durable \nmedical equipment to Medicare. They are willing to price their products \ncompetitively. They are used to providing personal services to their \ncustomers in small Utah towns. Their customers are also their \nneighbors. They all fear that their businesses, which are built on \npersonal service, may be sacrificed to large suppliers from distant \ncities who cannot educate Medicare beneficiaries. A flyer in the mail \nmay not be enough to teach a disabled diabetic how to use a walker.\n\n[[Page S6309]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation which permits the \npotential savings from competitive bidding, mandates quality standards \nfor all of Medicare's durable medical equipment suppliers, and protects \nsmall businesses and Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas and in low \ndensity urban areas.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Hatch, in reintroducing the Medicare Durable Medical Equipment, \nDME, Access Act. This bill will help protect rural DME providers from \nthe negative consequences of competitive bidding and ensure that \nseniors have access to the highest quality of DME supplies. It will \nalso help to rid the system of fraudulent suppliers who are filing \nimproper and illegal claims.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Medicare Modernization Act, MMA, \nrequired Medicare to replace the current DME payment methodology for \ncertain items with a competitive acquisition process, which is \ncurrently underway. In fact, the first round of bids are due on July \n13. Our bill would address several issues that could negatively impact \nthe ability of rural suppliers to compete and ensure that seniors are \ngetting high-quality products.\n  Specifically, our bill would strengthen language in the MMA that \nallows the Secretary to exempt rural areas by requiring the Secretary \nto exempt metropolitan statistical areas with fewer than 500,000 \npeople. In addition, the legislation would require that the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, include the attainment of quality \nstandards as a factor in computing the winning bid to ensure that \npatients receive both high-quality and low-cost equipment. Third, the \nMedicare Durable Medical Equipment Access Act would allow small \nbusinesses to continue providing DME in Medicare at the acquisition bid \nrate, even if the businesses didn't have the winning bid. Finally, the \nbill would take additional steps to ensure that competitive acquisition \nresults in savings, that providers have access to administrative and \njudicial review, and that any meetings of the newly created CMS Program \nAdvisory and Oversight Committee on competitive bidding be open to the \npublic.\n  Many argue that there is fraudulent activity in the Medicare DME \nbenefit and that is why competitive bidding is necessary. I agree that \nit is far too easy to obtain a supplier number and start filing \nimproper and illegal claims. That is why I applaud the efforts of CMS \nand others who are cracking down on the inappropriate behavior. \nHowever, it is also imperative that we ensure sufficient access to \nquality DME care in the program and protect those suppliers who are \nacting appropriately. I believe this bill achieves the appropriate \nbalance between these two goals. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 1430. A bill to authorize State and local governments to direct \ndivestiture from, and prevent investment in, companies with investments \nof $20,000,000 or more in Iran's energy sector, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I rise today, along with Senator Brownback, to introduce \nthe Iran Sanctions Enabling Act of 2007. Before proceeding, I want to \ncommend Chairman Frank for introducing similar legislation on the House \nside--he is a major force behind this legislation and should be \nrecognized for his work on this issue.\n  This bill will enable citizens, institutional investors, and State \nand local governments to ensure that their money is not being used by \ncompanies that help develop Iran's oil and gas industry. This would \nplace additional economic pressure on the Iranian regime with the goal \nof changing Iranian policies.\n  The Obama-Brownback legislation does this in three ways:\n  First, this legislation requires the U.S. government, every 6 months, \nto publish a list of companies that are investing more than $20 million \nin Iran's energy sector. This sunshine provision accomplishes two \nimportant objectives. It provides investors with the knowledge they \nneed to make informed decisions about the consequences of their \ninvestments. And, since it is already illegal for U.S. companies to \nmake such investments, it provides a powerful incentive for foreign \ncompanies to discontinue investments in Iran.\n  Second, this legislation authorizes State and local governments to \ndivest the assets of their pension funds and other funds under their \ncontrol from any company on the list. Several states, such as Florida \nand Missouri, have already taken actions to achieve these ends. But the \nStates' authority to undertake these measures is unclear, so an \nexplicit authorization from Congress, contained in this bill, will \nresolve this issue.\n  Third, this legislation seeks to give fund managers safe harbor and \nalso provide investors with more choices. For fund managers who divest \nfrom companies on this list, the Obama-Brownback bill helps protect \nthese managers from lawsuits brought by unhappy investors. The bill \nalso expresses the sense of Congress that the government's own 401(k) \nfund, the Thrift Savings Plan, should create a ``terror-free'' and \n``genocide-free'' investment options for government employees.\n  We need this bill, as Iranian actions have been well-documented. \nIran's pursuit of a nuclear program, and its unwillingness to allow \ncomprehensive international oversight, pose unacceptable risks to the \nUnited States and our allies. The international community has voiced \nits opposition to Iran's nuclear ambitions. For example, the U.N. \nSecurity Council passed resolutions last December, and again in March \nof this year, increasing sanctions on Iran for its failure to suspend \nuranium enrichment.\n  The Iranian regime has been actively sowing the seeds of instability \nand violence in Iraq, with deadly consequences for American soldiers. \nBeyond Iraq's borders, Iranian leaders are exporting militancy, \nsectarianism, and rejectionism throughout the Middle East. Fueled by \nthe billions of dollars it earns from oil and gas exports, Iran has \nbeen pumping money into radical Islamist terror groups like Hezbollah \nand Hamas. Every bit as worrying is the rhetoric of President Mahmoud \nAhmadinejad publicly calling to ``wipe Israel off the map.''\n  It is quite a list. But in the midst of all of this, there are signs \nthat some Iranians understand the impact their regime's behavior is \nhaving on Iran's national interests. Conservatives in Iran look where \nthe radicals are trying to take the country--more confrontation and \nmore radicalism, and they are worried.\n  We should send a message that, if Iran wishes to benefit from the \ninternational system, it must play by international rules. If it \nchooses to flout those rules, then the world will turn its back on \nIran. Pressuring companies to cut their financial ties with Iran is an \nimportant piece of that process, and we should allow pension funds to \ndo so.\n  For all of its bluster, Iran is not a strong country. Its oil \ninfrastructure is weak and badly in need of investment. The economy \nlurches under the weight of quasi-state run industries, and billions of \ndollars in Iranian cash sit offshore because Iranians have so little \nfaith in their government's management of the economy. This is \nprecisely why we need legislation along the lines of what I am \nintroducing here today.\n  In general, we need to think carefully about allowing divestment, \nwhich is a tool that can be misused. However, I believe that Iran is a \nspecial case. And, in this case, divestment legislation can dissuade \nforeign companies from investing in energy operations whose profits \nwill be used to threaten us. It is not a magic bullet--there is none in \nthis situation--but is one of a menu of actions, each of which can help \nus to deter Iranian aggression.\n  We are currently involved in one ruinous war, and we need to avoid \nindiscriminate saber-rattling which could involve us in another. This \nadministration's failure in Iraq has emboldened and empowered Iran, and \nthe forces allied with it, including Hamas and Hezbollah. And while we \nshould take no option, including military action, off the table, \nsustained and aggressive diplomacy combined with tough sanctions should \nbe our primary means to deal with Iran. It is incumbent upon us to find \nand implement ways to pressure Iran short of war, ways that demonstrate \nour deep concern about Iran's behavior, and ways that will help us to \nexert leadership on this issue. This bill is one of those ways.\n\n[[Page S6310]]\n\n  I have called for direct engagement with Iran over its efforts to \nacquire nuclear weapons. But, direct dialogue, as we conducted with the \nSoviet Union during the Cold War, should be part of a comprehensive \ndiplomatic strategy to head off this unacceptable threat. So should the \nlegislation Senator Brownback and I are introducing today.\n  I hope my colleagues will cosponsor the Obama-Brownback legislation. \nOn the House side, I hope my colleagues in that Chamber sign on to the \nFrank bill. I look forward to working with others to get this bill \nsigned into law.\n  In closing, I want to thank Daniel McGlinchey and James Segel of \nChairman Frank's staff for their work on this bill. They were \nextraordinarily helpful in putting together this legislation, and I \nwould be remiss I did not recognize their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6310-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 206--TO PROVIDE FOR A BUDGET POINT OF ORDER AGAINST \n    LEGISLATION THAT INCREASES INCOME TAXES ON TAXPAYERS, INCLUDING \nHARDWORKING MIDDLE-INCOME FAMILIES, ENTREPRENEURS, AND COLLEGE STUDENTS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Allard) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                              S.

Res. 207\n\n       Whereas the Department of Justice is responsible for \n     upholding and enforcing the law throughout the United States \n     of America;\n       Whereas the Attorney General, as the Nation's chief law \n     enforcement official, must place the rule of law above \n     partisan political gain;\n       Whereas Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has consistently \n     provided misleading and incomplete testimony to Congress \n     regarding his role in the inappropriate and politically \n     motivated firings of at least 8 United States Attorneys, as \n     well as refusing to acknowledge widespread concern within the \n     Department of Justice on the legality of its domestic \n     surveillance program;\n       Whereas, according to the testimony of former Deputy \n     Attorney General James Comey, Attorney General Alberto \n     Gonzales, while White House Counsel, attempted to pressure \n     then-Attorney General John Ashcroft to authorize a domestic \n     surveillance program that the Department of Justice itself \n     had determined had ``no legal basis'', while he was in the \n     intensive care unit of George Washington University Hospital \n     and had relinquished the powers of the Attorney General;\n       Whereas the current controversies surrounding the Attorney \n     General have undermined the effectiveness and integrity of \n     the Department of Justice and have contributed to a reduction \n     in morale among employees who have important work to \n     accomplish;\n       Whereas the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, in this resolution referred to as the ``World \n     Bank'', plays a vital role in global efforts to reduce \n     poverty, aid development, and promote good governance in all \n     nations in which it operates;\n       Whereas anti-corruption efforts have been a key element of \n     the World Bank strategy under both the current and previous \n     Bank Presidents;\n       Whereas Paul D. Wolfowitz, President of the World Bank, \n     arranged for a pay and promotion package for Shaha Ali Riza, \n     a bank employee with whom he had a personal relationship, \n     upon becoming President in 2005;\n       Whereas, on May 14, 2007, an Ethics Committee of the World \n     Bank investigating this incident reported to the World Bank's \n     Board of Directors that ``Mr. Wolfowitz's contract requiring \n     that he adhere to the Code of Conduct for board officials and \n     that he avoid any conflict of interest, real or apparent, \n     were violated'' in arranging for a pay raise and promotion \n     for Shaha Ali Riza, thus contravening World Bank ethical and \n     governance rules;\n       Whereas, on April 26, 2007, more than 40 members of the \n     Bank's anti-corruption unit issued a statement declaring that \n     due to corruption allegations against Mr. Wolfowitz, ``The \n     credibility of our front-line staff is eroding in the face of \n     legitimate questions from our clients about the bank's \n     ability to practice what it preaches on governance'';\n       Whereas several of the World Bank's largest donors, \n     including European nations who supply a major portion of the \n     World Bank's operating revenue, have warned that they might \n     withhold funds for the World Bank so long as Mr. Wolfowitz \n     remains in office; and\n       Whereas the actions of Attorney General Gonzales and Mr. \n     Wolfowitz have created a crisis of confidence and credibility \n     within two vital institutions with serious national and \n     international consequences and merit decisive action by the \n     President of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate calls on the President of the \n     United States immediately to recommend new candidates for the \n     positions of the Attorney General of the United States and \n     the President of the World Bank in order to preserve the \n     integrity and the efficacy of the Department of Justice and \n     the World Bank.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk, which next \nweek I will ask my colleagues to consider. I do so with some \nreluctance, but we have reached a point where the concerns revolving \naround the Attorney General's Office as well as the head of the World \nBank have come to a point where I think this body ought to express \nitself, given the concerns that are mounting about these individuals' \nability to perform their functions.\n  Washington, DC, has always been home to controversies. We know that. \nBut the ones currently swirling around the Department of Justice and \nthe World Bank are simply unacceptable and I think must come to an end. \nThe President, in my view, must assume the responsibility here.\n  We are focused on calling for resignations, but the Commander in \nChief, the President, is where the buck stops. He bears the \nresponsibility to replace these individuals if they have reached a \npoint where they no longer have the ability to run these institutions, \ninstilling the kind of confidence and global support the American \npublic would expect.\n  I do not say this with any sense of glee at all, but I think we have \narrived at a moment where a change of leadership in these two offices \nis essential.\n  Let me begin with Mr. Gonzales, if I may, whose saga continues to \nunfold, with each revelation more disturbing than the last.\n  The Attorney General is the chief law enforcement officer of the \ncountry. He must be above politics, and put administration of justice \nabove partisan gain. Clearly, that is not the case here. It is now \nabundantly clear the Attorney General has placed his friendship and \nallegiance to the President above the sworn duty to defend and protect \nthe Constitution. These are not allegations I have made alone; others \nhave also made these points.\n  We heard Tuesday in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing the \nshocking testimony of the former Deputy Attorney General of the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S6311]]\n\nabout Mr. Gonzales' role while White House Counsel, attempting to \npressure then-Attorney General John Ashcroft to authorize domestic \nsurveillance despite the fact that the Justice Department, under John \nAshcroft, determined that would be illegal. He went to Attorney General \nAshcroft's bedside when he was in critical condition to try to secure \nhis signature to allow those practices to go forward. This is not \nhealthy. It is hurting our country, hurting the morale of the Justice \nDepartment, and it is time for the President to step forward and \nappoint a new Attorney General.\n  Let me, if I quickly can, turn to the President of the World Bank, \nMr. Wolfowitz. The World Bank, as we all know, plays a vital role in \nglobal efforts to reduce poverty, aid development, and promote good \ngovernance in all nations in which it operates. Mr. Wolfowitz in \nparticular made fighting corruption his signature issue at the bank; \nyet we know of the allegations here. I don't need to go into detail \nabout them. My colleagues know what they are; they have been widely \nreported. A World Bank ethics committee investigating this incident \nreported to the World Bank's Board of Directors:\n\n       Mr. Wolfowitz's contract requiring that he adhere to the \n     Code of Conduct for board officials and that he avoid any \n     conflict of interest, real or apparent, was violated.\n\n  That is their conclusion. In short, I believe Mr. Wolfowitz broke the \nWorld Bank's ethical and governance rules, and instead of combating \ncorruption abroad, as he pledged to do, his actions brought it to the \nheart of the World Bank.\n  I point out that 40 members of the Bank's anti-corruption unit issued \na statement saying this:\n\n       The credibility of our front-line staff is eroding in the \n     face of legitimate questions from our clients about the \n     bank's ability to practice what it preaches on governance.\n\n  These are not my words; again, these are the words of the World Bank \nstaff. Their work is being compromised by the actions of their \nPresident.\n  Moreover, several of the World Bank's largest donors, including \nEuropean nations who supply a major portion of the World Bank's \noperating revenue, have warned they might withhold these funds for the \nWorld Bank so long as Mr. Wolfowitz remains in office.\n  I don't take any pleasure in suggesting this. But when the Justice \nDepartment and the World Bank are under assault because of the actions \nof their two leaders, it is time for the American President, who has \nthe authority to replace these individuals, to do so. I know there is \nreluctance on the part of my colleagues to involve themselves in some \nof these matters, but when institutions as important as the Justice \nDepartment and the World Bank are suffering from loss of credibility, I \nthink it is incumbent on this body to express itself.\n  At an appropriate time next week I will ask for this resolution to be \nconsidered by this body. I know we have the important matter of \nimmigration to consider, but this matter is also important.\n  Of course, should the President move forward and call for the \nresignations and replace these individuals, then this resolution would \nbe moot. In the meantime, I intend to press forward with this idea. I \nurge my colleagues in both parties to support this resolution, \nregardless of their feelings about these individuals or their personal \nrelationships with them--we bear a responsibility that goes beyond \npersonalities here.\n  The Justice Department deserves better. The World Bank deserves \nbetter. I hope my colleagues will join in a bipartisan way to express \nthe sense of the Senate that the President ought to replace these \nindividuals and restore the confidence and the good feelings we all \nought to have about both of these institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6311-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 208--ENCOURAGING THE ELIMINATION OF HARMFUL FISHING \n  SUBSIDIES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO OVERCAPACITY IN THE WORLD'S COMMERCIAL \n    FISHING FLEET AND LEAD TO THE OVERFISHING OF GLOBAL FISH STOCKS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. \nSnowe, Mr. Lott, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Sununu, \nMs. Landrieu, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Vitter) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution, \nalong with my colleague Senators Enzi and Inouye, to honor the \naccomplishments of Stephen Joel Trachtenberg. This resolution honors a \nremarkable man. President Trachtenberg is about to retire in July 2007 \nas the third-longest serving President of George Washington University, \none of this country's premier educational organizations; an institution \nthat contributes deeply, year after year, to our understanding of the \nworld around us.\n  I have known Steve Trachtenberg for a long time, since his service in \nConnecticut as the third President of the University of Hartford from \n1977 to 1988. He is a proud native of Brooklyn, N.Y., and as an \naccomplished author, scholar, and educator, he has earned the respect \nand admiration of his colleagues, peers and students. I know he is also \nproud of his wife, Francine Zorn Trachtenberg, and his two sons, Adam \nand Ben.\n  President Trachtenberg earned his bachelor's degree from Columbia \nUniversity in 1959, and showed his skill at making sound decisions by \ngoing to Yale to get his law degree in 1962. A Master of Public \nAdministration degree followed later from Harvard.\n  Prior to his illustrious career in academia, he served in government \nas a special assistant to the U.S. Education Commissioner at the \nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare, as an attorney with the \nU.S. Atomic Energy Commission, and on the Hill as a legislative aide to \nformer Indiana Congressman John Brademas.\n  President Trachtenberg's has won numerous well-deserved awards and\n\n[[Page S6313]]\n\nhonorary degrees. I will only site a few examples here. In 1982 he was \ncelebrated by the Connecticut Region of Hadassah with the Myrtle Wreath \nAward. In 1984 he was presented with The Mt. Scopus Award from Hebrew \nUniversity in Jerusalem, and in 1987 received the Human Relations Award \nfrom the National Conference of Christians and Jews.\n  In 1988 he was honored with the Distinguished Public Service Award \nfrom the Connecticut Bar Association, and was proudly recognized by the \nHartford NAACP for his contributions to the education of minority \nstudents. In 1992 he received the International Salute Award in honor \nof Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  He was even named ``Washingtonian of the Year 2000'' by Washingtonian \nMagazine, was decorated in 2000 with a medal by King Mohammed VI of \nMorocco, and was awarded the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Knight \nGrand Cross for Distinguished Service to Freemasonry and Humanity.\n  For all he has done, ``Stephen Joel Trachtenberg Day'' was declared \nby resolution of the Council of the District of Columbia, on January \n22, 1998, in honor of his commitments to minority students, scholarship \nprograms, public school partnerships and community service. Not to be \noutdone, ``Stephen Joel Trachtenberg Day in San Francisco!'' was \ndeclared by Proclamation of the City and County of San Francisco, on \nFebruary 2, 1999.\n  He is also a respected author writing Reflections on Higher Education \nin 2002, Thinking Out Loud in 1998, and Speaking His Mind in 1994.\n  As President of George Washington University he opened new buildings \nfor the School of Business and the Elliott School of International \nAffairs, a new hospital, and added the Mount Vernon Campus, formerly \nthe Mount Vernon College for Women. He also created five new schools: \nPublic Health and Health Services, Public Policy and Public \nAdministration, College of Professional Studies, Graduate School of \nPolitical Management, and Media and Public Affairs. Importantly he \n``reinvented'' the University's position and positive reputation as \nWashington, D.C.'s center of scholarship.\n  After all of these accomplishments he is retiring as President of the \nGeorge Washington University, but will continue as President Emeritus \nand as a University Professor of Public Service.\n  In this resolution, the Senate:\n  1. honors and salutes the accomplishments of Stephen Joel \nTrachtenberg and recognizes his deeds throughout his 19 years of \nservice as President of The George Washington University in Washington, \nD.C.;\n  2. recognizes his accomplishments and achievements in higher \neducation, as an author, as an attorney and as a public official; and\n  3. based upon his service extends its appreciation to him in \nrecognition of his retirement as President of The George Washington \nUniversity in Washington, D.C.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to act quickly on this resolution to \nhonor the efforts of President Trachtenberg on behalf of so many who \nhave benefited from his extraordinary service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6313-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 208.\n\n[[Page S6359]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 208) encouraging the elimination of \n     harmful fishing subsidies that contribute to overcapacity in \n     the world's commercial fishing fleet and lead to the \n     overfishing of global fish stocks.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss the \novercapitalization of the world's fishing fleets, which is being fueled \nby the subsidies foreign governments direct to their fishing \nindustries. The problems caused by these subsidies affect not only our \nglobal fisheries resources, but also the coastal communities which \ndepend upon them. I introduced a Senate resolution condemning these \nsubsidies and the unsustainable fishing practices they enable.\n  Fisheries resources--especially large predatory species and other \ncommercially valuable fish stocks--have been overexploited by foreign \nindustrial fishing fleets for years. As a result, these stocks have \ndeclined precipitously. In fact, the Food and Agriculture Organization \nof the United Nations estimates that one-quarter of global fish stocks \nare overexploited, depleted, or recovering from overexploitation.\n  To a significant extent, the decline of fisheries resources around \nthe world is intensified by the outdated and mistaken assumption--still \nheld by many nations--that our oceans' productivity is infinite and \nthat fish stocks can be harvested without consequence.\n  In the United States, we know this is not the case. While we once \nused subsidies to increase our harvesting capacity, we have since \neliminated this practice. Today, we have developed a fisheries \nmanagement system which respects and conforms to the requirements of \nfisheries conservation. The Magnuson-Stevens Act, including the \namendments added in January, continues to ensure our harvests are \nguided by science-based catch limits. These controls prevent \noverfishing and provide managers with the tools they need to limit \nentry and prevent overcapitalization.\n  Unfortunately, sustainable fishing policies are not the norm among \nall fishing nations. Many countries with subsidized industrial fishing \nfleets have sought to exploit not only their own waters, but also the \nhigh seas. Fisheries in international waters are largely unregulated, \nbut even where international management bodies do exist, these damaging \npractices are carried out in defiance of international quotas and other \nharvest limits. Not surprisingly, those countries engaged in illegal, \nunregulated, and unreported--or ``IUU'' fishing--are often the same \nones that use subsidies to expand their fleets.\n  These subsidies, and the IUU fishing associated with them, must end. \nToday, the capacity of the global fishing fleet is far greater than \nwhat is needed to catch the oceans' sustainable level of production. \nSubsidies also create an uneven playing field among fish trading \ncountries by masking the true cost of fishing. To the economic \ndetriment of the U.S. and other nonsubsidizing nations, up to one-\nquarter of global fish trade is currently generated by subsidized \nfisheries. Ultimately, if nations are allowed to stay on this \nunsustainable path, fish stocks in the global ocean commons will be \nreduced even further.\n  The United States, with the support of other countries opposed to \nsubsidies, is now leading an international initiative against harmful \nfisheries subsidies. Last month, the United States Trade Representative \npresented a proposal to the World Trade Organization which would \neliminate this type of subsidy among WTO members. This proposal, being \nnegotiated in the Doha Development Round, holds great promise for \nending those subsidies which distort trade, weaken economic conditions \nin fishing communities, and lead to IUU fishing and other unsustainable \nharvesting practices.\n  This resolution condemns these harmful foreign fishing subsidies, and \nI urge each of my colleagues to give it their full support.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to; that the preamble be agreed to; and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 208) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 208\n\n       Whereas 2.6 billion people in the world get at least 20 \n     percent of their total dietary animal protein intake from \n     fish;\n       Whereas the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \n     Nations has found that 25 percent of the world's fish \n     population are currently overexploited, depleted, or \n     recovering from overexploitation;\n       Whereas scientists have estimated that populations of many \n     large predator fish such as tuna, marlin, and swordfish have \n     been overfished by foreign industrial fishing fleets;\n       Whereas the global fishing fleet capacity is estimated to \n     be considerably greater than is needed to catch what the \n     ocean can sustainably produce;\n       Whereas the United States Congress recognized the threat of \n     overfishing to our oceans and economy and therefore included \n     the requirement to end overfishing in United States \n     commercial fisheries by 2011 in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \n     Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 \n     (Public Law 109-479);\n       Whereas the United States Commission on Ocean Policy and \n     the Pew Oceans Commission identified overcapitalization of \n     the global commercial fishing fleets as a major contributor \n     to the decline of economically important fish populations;\n       Whereas harmful foreign fishing subsidies encourage \n     overcapitalization and overfishing, support destructive \n     fishing practices that would not otherwise be economically \n     viable, and amount to $10 to $15 billion annually, an amount \n     equivalent to 20 to 25 percent of the global commercial trade \n     in fish;\n       Whereas such subsidies have also been documented to support \n     illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing, which impacts \n     commercial fisheries in the United States and around the \n     world both economically and ecologically;\n       Whereas harmful fishing subsidies are concentrated in \n     relatively few countries, putting other fishing countries, \n     including the United States, at an economic disadvantage;\n       Whereas the United States is a world leader in advancing \n     policies to eliminate harmful fishing subsidies that support \n     overcapacity and promote overfishing; and\n       Whereas members of the World Trade Organization, as part of \n     the Doha Development Agenda (Doha Development Round), are \n     engaged in historic negotiations to end harmful fishing \n     subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the United States should \n     continue to promote the elimination of harmful foreign \n     fishing subsidies that promote overcapitalization, \n     overfishing, and illegal, unregulated, and unreported \n     fishing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/17/senate-section/article/S6359-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6359-S6360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR NEW POWER-SHARING GOVERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am delighted to join Senators Dodd, \nBiden, Collins, Kerry, McCain, Clinton, Leahy, Smith, Schumer and Obama \nin support of a Senate resolution commending the extraordinary success \nof achievement last week in the peace process in northern Ireland.\n  Ten days ago, on May 8, I was in Belfast to witness the dawn of a new \nday in the history of northern Ireland--a day that reaffirmed that \npeace is possible, even in the face of tragic history.\n  It was an honor to participate in a White House delegation to Belfast \nand to join Prime Minister Blair of Great Britain and Prime Minister \nAhern of Ireland, who have been powerful forces for peace and \nreconciliation, as former foes in northern Ireland took the oath of \noffice and agreed to share power on an equal basis.\n  This success could not have been achieved without the courage and \ndetermination of the political leaders of northern Ireland over many \nyears in securing a new way forward and forming a new government that \noffers hope for a brighter future for all the people of that land and a \nhealing of the terrible wounds of the past.\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\n  The courageous example of the people of northern Ireland, who have \nchosen peace and reconciliation, also offers a lesson of hope to other \ntroubled areas of the world.\n  The resolution we are introducing expresses the strong support of the \nUnited States for the new power-sharing Government. It recognizes the \ncontributions of British and Irish and American leaders whose efforts \nover the years have been indispensable in to the formation of the new \nGovernment and the achievement of lasting peace and stability in \nnorthern Ireland.\n  May 8 will long be remembered as a historic day for peace in northern \nIreland. All friends of Ireland in the United States commend the First \nMinister of the new Government, Reverend Ian Paisley of the Democratic \nUnionist Party and the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness of Sinn \nFein for coming together in peace to begin this new era of hope for all \nthe people of northern Ireland, and we wish them continuing success in \nmeeting the challenges that lie ahead.\n  The United States stands ready to support their new Government. I \nurge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 209\n\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2007, the Reverend Ian Paisley and \n     Martin McGuinness became Northern Ireland's first minister \n     and deputy first minister, marking the beginning of a new era \n     of power-sharing;\n       Whereas Reverend Paisley, the Democratic Unionist leader, \n     and Mr. McGuinness, the Sinn Fein negotiator, have put aside \n     decades of conflict and moved towards historic reconciliation \n     and unity in Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2007, Reverend Paisley declared, ``I \n     believe that Northern Ireland has come to a time of peace, a \n     time when hate will no longer rule.'';\n       Whereas Mr. McGuinness declared this new government to be \n     ``a fundamental change of approach, with parties moving \n     forward together to build a better future for the people that \n     we represent'';\n       Whereas British Prime Minister Tony Blair declared that \n     ``today marks not just the completion of the transition from \n     conflict to peace, but also gives the most visible expression \n     to the fundamental principle on which the peace process has \n     been based. The acceptance that the future of Northern \n     Ireland can only be governed successfully by both communities \n     working together, equal before the law, equal in the mutual \n     respect shown by all and equally committed both to sharing \n     power and to securing peace. That is the only basis upon \n     which true democracy can function and by which normal \n     politics can at last after decades of violence and suffering \n     come to this beautiful but troubled land.'';\n       Whereas the Taoiseach of Ireland, Bertie Ahern, declared \n     that ``on this day, we mark the historic beginning of a new \n     era for Northern Ireland. An era founded on peace and \n     partnership. An era of new politics and new realities.''; and\n       Whereas President George W. Bush, like his predecessor \n     President William J.
