Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nproceed to a period of morning business, with Senators allowed to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes each. Following morning business, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 7005, the \nlegislative vehicle for the auto industry's financing and \nrestructuring. Rollcall votes are possible during today's session in \nthe Senate.\n  When we left here a few weeks ago, the decision was made that there \nwould be 1 week for the automobile industry to make presentations to \nthe two committees of jurisdiction, the House and the Senate Banking \nCommittees, to determine what would take place during the following \nweek. That was last week, and hearings were held in both committees, \nand evidence, in fact, was taken. There have been weeks and weeks of \nwork put into coming up with a piece of legislation on which we can \nvote. That matter is before the Senate in H.R. 7005.\n  I have had calls from a number of Senators today--frankly, mostly \nRepublican Senators--telling me that they have the solution to all of \nthe problems of the auto industry; they need a few amendments. A few \namendments. We have done our very best to include everyone who wants \nany input into this legislation. The White House, President Bush and \nhis people have been heavily involved in this legislation. This is, in \neffect, the White House's legislation.\n  There was a decision made that the minority would not participate in \nthe preparing of this legislation. But the White House was heavily \ninvolved. Negotiations took place over days between Chairman Frank and \nChairman Dodd and the White House, and we now have a piece of \nlegislation. Some have asked: Well, what we want is to set up a \nprocedure where we have lots of amendments, and then we will ultimately \nvote on the final version.\n  I think it is only fair that if the minority, the Republicans, want \nto have a better bill, then they should offer an alternative. I invite \nthem to do it. The House passed a bill last night. It would be my \nsuggestion that we perhaps have a vote on the substitute or the \nalternative the Republicans would put forward, vote on the House bill, \nvote on the Senate bill. If there is no agreement that can be reached \non that, we have danced this tune long enough.\n  What we will do, we can have a motion to proceed to this tomorrow, \nand if the Republicans want to come and say, well, you know, you have \nnot allowed us any opportunity to offer amendments--that is what has \ntaken place for the last 2 years, and look what it got the Republicans: \nlost seven or eight Senate seats, lost the Presidency. We want to \nlegislate, and we are doing the very best we can to do that.\n  I have reached out to my Republican colleagues. As soon as the \nelections were over, I called a number of Republicans and said: We want \nto work with you. We cannot continue doing what we have done in the \npast. But we are right back where we have been for 2 years, the same \nplace we have been for 2 years.\n  So, again, I suggest that if the Republicans have an alternative, let \nthem\n\n[[Page S10890]]\n\noffer that. It would be very easy to do. We could vote on a Republican \nalternative, we would have a vote on the White House proposal now \nbefore the Senate, and we would vote on the bill that passed the House \nand leave here. If that is not something the Republicans choose to do, \nthen we will vote tomorrow on a motion to proceed to the bill that has \nbeen prepared, drafted, and had input on by the two committees and the \nWhite House. If we are not allowed to proceed to that, then we, in \nfact, will be through with this, as we have been through with numerous \npieces of legislation through the past year.\n  So, again, I invite the Republicans, if they have an alternative, to \nput it forward. They have had ample opportunity to do that. Again, I \nhave received a number of phone calls from Republicans today saying: I \nhave just the thing that needs to be done to make this a great piece of \nlegislation. Well, I would hope they would be ready to do that. If not, \nwe will have a vote tomorrow on a motion to proceed to H.R. 7005.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about where we are in \nthis auto bailout. In essence, it is show time here. A bill came over \nfrom the House last night. It is the end of the year. There is an \nimpending crisis we are dealing with here in the country. So today we \nwill be debating that and hopefully in the next few days take a vote.\n  I spent a lot of time in the committee talking with certain and \nvarious parties involved. I spent a lot of time outside the committee \ndoing the same thing. There is no doubt we are going through an \neconomic time that is very difficult for the auto industry. It is also \ndifficult for businesses and families all across this country as they \ntry to make their budgets work out.\n  As we have looked at this issue, I know there has been a lot of \nnegotiation that has taken place between the White House and House \nDemocrats. I really think the product that has been developed is a very \npoor product.\n  I don't blame that on my Democratic colleagues who negotiated because \nthe White House is actually at a point where they are looking for the \nnext flight out of town on January 20. Basically, they want to kick the \ncan down the road and let some other administration and some other \nCongress deal with this issue. All of us are going to be here next \nyear. It is our responsibility to deal with this issue in a \nprofessional and a competent manner and actually solve the problem.\n  I say to my colleagues on both the left and right, on the Democratic \nand Republican sides, we have a historic opportunity to actually solve \nthis problem. The solution is very simple.\n  I have looked at this legislation that has come over. It is similar \nto so many things we do around here. It is akin to a three-humped \ncamel. You couldn't make it more ineffective and more complicated. We \nhave put in place a czar. It seems like with everything we do around \nhere, we try to find a person who can save us from the crisis that is \nhappening. We did the same with the financial rescue package not long \nago. I have looked at the actual responsibilities of this czar. I said \nyesterday I had a banking staff person who actually could fulfill those \nresponsibilities. She read that in the paper this morning and came in \nand said she is overqualified, that in essence this is not something \nshe would want to take on. I think we can use some help, certainly, \nfrom the outside, and there may be a role for somebody such as this. \nBut what we are looking at is a fairly simple transaction. It is a lot \nof money, a fairly simple transaction.\n  Here is what we have. We have three companies. Two of the companies \nare on the verge of bankruptcy. As a matter of fact, I would say two of \nthe companies are in bankruptcy. I know Chrysler, today, is meeting \nwith their supplier group. I know if they don't win concessions today, \nthey are in great trouble. General Motors has told us if they don't \nreceive funding by the end of this year, they will have to file \nbankruptcy. I believe that.\n  We have a lot of Republicans who would like to see that happen, would \nlike to see chapter 11 occur and to see them go through the laws that \nexist for reorganization in a way that is clean and allow them to move \nahead in a financially stable way. As a matter of fact, many \nRepublicans would actually agree to something called debtor-in-\npossession financing after that occurred so these companies could \nevolve. There are people on the other side of the aisle who have \ndecided that is a cost that is too great to bear.\n  I started out along the path that I believed the best way for us to \nsolve the problem was to actually cause these companies to go through \nreorganization and any role we might play as the Federal Government \nwould be in the way of debtor-in-possession financing. After listening \nto the testimony and after talking to people all across the country who \nare involved, I do believe the supply chain is in great stress. They \nare undercapitalized. The three companies have already been utilizing \nthe supplier chain for financing by paying late and carrying payments \nfor lengths of time. I do think the supply chain is fragile.\n  What I have tried to do is figure out a way to create a piece of \nlegislation that is elegant, simple, actually solves the problem, and \ncauses these companies to be in great shape and for us to be able to \nmove ahead and know that has been done.\n  There are a lot of times I have heard people say: We are from the \nGovernment, and we are here to help you. When people hear that, they \nusually run for the hills. This is a case where if we will take a \nmoment, we can actually do something that is great for these companies. \nWe have a big stick. These companies cannot get financing anyplace \nexcept from the Federal Government. So we have an opportunity to sort \nof thread the needle in a simple way and cause these companies to be \nsuccessful.\n  Let me say, other than the economic issues, these companies have \nthree major issues. Each one of them is different. We know that \nbasically we are talking about General Motors here. We wouldn't be \nhaving this discussion if it weren't for General Motors. Chrysler would \nnot be here if it weren't for that. They are in serious trouble but \nwouldn't have the clout to be able to talk to us in this way. Ford has \nmoney today because of refinancing they did back in 2006. They are not \neven part of the discussion today. They might be down the road, but \ntoday they are financially viable, although burning cash at a rate that \nis almost equal to that of General Motors. We are talking--to make this \nclear to people--\n\n[[Page S10891]]\n\nabout three entities we need to talk to: General Motors, Cerberus or \nChrysler, and the UAW.\n  There are three things that are basically causing these companies \ndifficulty. One is the capital structure. The debt these companies have \nis not sustainable. It doesn't matter how much money we were to put \ninto General Motors; with the $62 billion in debt they have today, \nthere is no way they can sustain their company. They cannot. GM only \nhas a market cap today of around $2 billion. Toyota has a market cap of \n$130 billion. BMW has a market cap of $14 billion. So this is a company \nthat has a huge amount of debt and very little value. Chrysler probably \nhas no value. They are privately held. So we have two companies we need \nto deal with in a similar way, as it turns out.\n  Let me lay something out. Right now the capital structure in both \nplaces is too high. Cerberus and Chrysler can't withstand its debt. GM \ncannot withstand its debt. Secondly, the labor costs are out of line. I \nknow there is a lot of talking about the UAW. Candidly, I will admit, \nin some cases they get a bad rap. A lot of the people who are my \nfriends would not like me saying that, but in some cases they actually \nget a bad rap as to the way the comparisons go.\n  The third issue is the dealership issue. I don't think we can deal \nwith that today. There are two issues we can deal with in this loan and \nsolve the problem. One is the capital structure. The other is the labor \nissue. Here is what I propose. We will be putting this forward, as \nSenator Reid mentioned. We have some alternative legislation. I hope it \nis something both Democrats and Republicans can embrace. It is very \nsimple. Let's go ahead and fund the money. Let's fund the money that \nhas been requested. To Republicans, that is like debtor-in-possession \nfinancing anyway because these companies are basically bankrupt. To \nDemocrats, the funding is in place to cause these companies to be \nwhole. Let's go ahead and fund the request that has taken place.\n  Let's have three covenants. We can do this with a very short bill \nwhich we drafted. The first covenant is that by March 15, the \noutstanding indebtedness at the two companies that are going to apply \nfor this has to be reduced by two-thirds or the companies have to file \nfor bankruptcy on March 15. That gives the companies, the bondholders, \nwhich we have talked to on the phone, plenty of incentive to make sure \nthe debt is reduced by two-thirds so these companies have a capital \nstructure that allows them to go forward. This is the only way they \nwill be successful. We have had plenty of people testify that if we put \nour money on top of the $62 billion in debt GM has, there is no way \nthey can be successful, even if we are selling 20 million cars a year. \nToday, we know, we are selling at a 10 million rate. That is No. 1. \nGive them the money. If by March 15 they haven't reduced their capital \nstructure in that regard--and we have talked to people on all sides who \nbelieve this can happen, but it can only happen with the stick of \nGovernment, meaning we are going to force them into bankruptcy if they \ndon't do it. That is the first covenant.\n\n  The second covenant is, I have listened to Mr. Gettelfinger's \ntestimony and talked to him on the phone this morning. He says the only \nway the UAW can make concessions is if they see the bondholders have \ndone so first. This legislation makes that happen by March 15. So, \nsecondly, after the UAW has seen that the bondholders have taken a \n``haircut,'' a word that is used around here a lot, they have to do two \nthings: No. 1, they have to convert half the VEBA obligation, the \nVoluntary Employee Benefit Association obligations. They have to \nconvert half those to equity. If the company goes bankrupt, these \nfuture payments are never going to happen anyway. Again, that reduces \nthe debt at GM by another $10.5 billion, and it gives the UAW equity in \na company that actually has value now because the debt by the \nbondholders has been reduced. That is the second covenant--very simple.\n  The third action they have to take is at that same public meeting \nwhere they take a vote, they have to agree to have a contract in place \nthat puts them in parity with companies such as Toyota and Nissan and \nVolkswagen and other companies here. Before everybody goes crazy over \nthat, that is as certified by the Secretary of Labor. That is not \nsomething we prescribe. I realize there will be subtleties in that. \nThere are comparisons that have to be made. To my friends on the left, \nthat would be a Secretary of Labor by the Obama administration who has \nthe ability to look at the various differences and nuances to actually \ncertify that.\n  I have talked to Ron Gettelfinger this morning. Because of the \ndebates we have had recently, I am probably not on his Christmas card \nlist this year. I realize that. But he actually is talking with his \nleaders about this. I have talked to the COO at General Motors last \nnight and this morning. He was the former chief financial officer. He \nagrees this will work. This gives the stick to the Government to make \nthem have to do the things they need to do to actually cram down their \nbondholders.\n  I have heard a lot about Main Street and Wall Street. For those \npeople who want to take an ounce or a pound of flesh from Wall Street, \nthose are mostly the people who own these bonds. They will be taking \nthis huge haircut, two-thirds. In GM's case, it is about $20 billion \nthat would be converted to equity and take away a face amount of debt.\n  I plan to be here all day today. I would like to take 30 minutes off \nfrom 12:30 to 1 to give a talk someplace. But I would ask any Democrat, \nany Republican to please come down to the floor, call me, e-mail me, \ntell me why we couldn't put in place these three covenants which are \nvery reasonable. They are the only actions that can happen in real time \nto make these companies successful. Let's pass a bill that causes these \ncompanies to be strong, gives them the money to breathe.\n  By the way, we had somebody testify the other day in Banking who said \nthat if we give money to these companies in the form they are in today, \nwe will end up giving $75 to $125 billion. I talked to the President of \nGM this morning. He says if we can make this happen--of course, the \nbondholders say we can, he says we can--that they will be limited in \ntheir request to only what they have asked for. They do not believe any \nmore U.S. dollars will be required.\n  I ask my colleagues, why would we not take a simple piece of \nlegislation, put it in place. It acts like debtor-in-possession \nfinancing. It does what we need to do to make sure the bondholders and \nthe UAW themselves do the things they need to do to make the company \nwhole. Management is already hamstrung by the bill. It lays out the \nitems management must forgo for these loans to be in place. Let's leave \nhere having done something that actually causes these companies to be \nhealthy, vibrant, able to go into the future in a strong way for the \nfirst time in 30 years. We can do something great today, if we will \nonly sit down and do it.\n  I ask my colleagues to do one other thing. We have tried to make this \nso complicated. There are three groups each of you can call to see if \nthis will work. Call Chrysler, call General Motors, call the UAW and \nask them if this will work. If there is a sentence we need to change, a \ncomma we need to put in place, let's do it. But it is very simple. We \nhave drafted a bill as if we are saving the world. We are talking about \nthree companies alone, actually two companies today alone and three \ncovenants can solve this problem, put them on a solid foundation, move \nthem ahead. We will have done the right thing for the American \ntaxpayers. We will have done the right thing for these companies, and \nwe will have acted responsibly together in concert, doing something \nthat, again, is right for our country.\n\n  Mr. President, thank you for the great length of time. I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will come down and tell me why \nthis will not work. Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Tennessee yield for \na question through the Chair?\n  Mr. CORKER. Yes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. First of all, Mr. President, I commend the distinguished \nSenator for all the work he has done on this issue over the last 2 \nmonths. But I\n\n[[Page S10892]]\n\nhave one question. Is it not true that almost all those conditions in \nthose three conditions you outlined were in whole or in part verbally \ncontemplated by the automakers in terms of what it is going to take for \nthem to come back and be profitable in the first place?\n  Mr. CORKER. No question. I say to the Senator from Georgia, they have \ncome in our offices and actually--they have advisers. Their financial \nadvisers have told them that they need for us to craft this legislation \nthis way so they have the hammer they need to make the bondholders \nreduce their debt so they can be healthy. Without this kind of hammer, \nnothing is going to happen.\n  Look, you have read this bill. This bill says they have to have a \nplan to show a net present value in place by March 31--a plan. It does \nnot say when it has to be accomplished. We can solve this problem so \nsimply for them, for the United Auto Workers, for the State of \nMichigan.\n  By the way, for the record, I want to say I have a General Motors \nplant in my State. It is very important. It is modern. It has been \ninvested in. We have a Nissan plant, and we have a Volkswagen plant \ncoming.\n  The automobile industry is very important to me, as I know it is to \nyou, I say to the Senator from Georgia. I thank him for that question.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, I \nthank you for your hard work.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I also thank the Senator from Tennessee \nfor all his labors and what he has been through. Quite frankly, I came \nback from the Horn of Africa and Afghanistan on Saturday or Sunday--\nanyway, over the weekend--and when I saw all this stuff coming up, I \nknew from my experience in the Senate that nothing was going to happen \nfor a few days, so I did not stay and work hard like my friend from \nTennessee. I went back to Oklahoma. I do that now and then just to talk \nto normal people, to hear what these people have to say, as opposed to \nthe bureaucrats and the stuff we get in Washington.\n  In a way, it is a little bit humorous. We went through the $700 \nbillion bailout. I can remember everybody talking about Secretary \nPaulson coming down and saying: The world is going to come to an end if \nwe do not do this. He said: We are going to have to do it.\n  Well, we did some calculations, and I do not think most of the \nAmerican people realize when we talk about these numbers--whether it is \n$14 billion or $700 billion--how much it really is. If you did your own \nmath when this stuff comes up--this is what I always do--there are 139 \nmillion families in America who file tax returns. If you take the 139 \nmillion families and divide that number into $700 billion, that is \n$5,000 a family. Now we are talking about something that is serious. \nWhen I tell people in Oklahoma that, that gets their attention.\n  So here we are talking about $14 billion right now. Nobody seemed to \ncare before, and we just passed that matter by a huge margin: 75 to 24. \nI was one of the 24 who voted against the $700 billion bailout. But we \npassed it by that huge margin, more than 2 to 1. It is something that \nis so much bigger than the $14 billion we are talking about now. We are \nmaking a big issue about the $14 billion. Where was all the concern and \noutrage when we were talking about $700 billion?\n  So we watched it come along, and we saw that we gave the Secretary of \nthe Treasury all the money that he was asking for. Then we find out \nthat as to what he was going to use the money for, it was not used for \nthat at all. He said, and I heard it myself--everyone in here heard it: \nthe Democrats heard it; the Republicans heard it--if we don't have this \n$700 billion to buy out troubled assets, this whole country is going to \ngo down--this doom and gloom. Once he got it, he did not do it. He did \nnot come to us and say: Well, there is a different plan now. We are \ngoing to use it in some other way because I don't think this is going \nto work.\n  So that got my attention. I decided at that time: Well, if they are \ngoing to go ahead and give him this $700 billion, let's see what there \nis in that law that we passed that might be to the benefit of people \nwho are concerned about this issue. I saw that it was broken into two \nparts. The first $350 billion pretty much was given to him to use at \nhis discretion, which he did. He did not come to us and say he was \ngoing to use it in a different way. He just went ahead and did it. It \nis the first time in the history of America that anything close to $350 \nbillion was spent in such a way.\n  Then we have in the law that was passed a provision that says if he \nneeds the other $350 billion, he can go ahead and do that, and if there \nis not an objection--as a matter of fact, if he does this, and does \nthis when we are out of session, we would be helpless to try to do \nanything to stop it.\n  So I introduced a bill. It is S. 3683. It is not going to be \nconsidered. I am not a member of the club, so that is not going to come \nup, although we have made an effort and we actually have some Democrats \non the bill. That is something that uses the rules that are out there \nand says we can change the second $350 billion so it will take a \npositive act of Congress to allow them to access the second $350 \nbillion.\n  Now, let's quickly jump back to the current issue. I wanted to put \nthat in perspective because when we talk about $14 billion, compared to \n$700 billion, I just wish there was that much outrage when we were \nmaking that commitment. So here we are talking about one unelected \nbureaucrat to be known as the car czar--get ready for the car czar. We \nhave only had one good czar in the history of America that I know of, \nand that was Bill Bennett when he was the drug czar. However, he was \nnot given a blank check to spend a whole bunch of money. He is just a \nbrilliant guy who was going to try to stop some of the stupid things we \nwere doing in this country. That was back in the 1980s when the drug \nproblem first surfaced as a major problem. He did a great job. I draw \nhim out as an exception when I talk about czars. Now we are talking \nabout a car czar. This guy is going to have the same bureaucratic power \nthat Secretary Paulson had during the time he pulled off this $700 \nbillion bailout.\n  Now, this bill makes the U.S. Government, the taxpayers, part owners \nof these companies. This $14 billion bill is one that is going to \nsurface probably today. People are talking about, and the leader talked \nabout, maybe we will go all the way through the weekend if we do not \nget something done. But the instrument that came over from the House \nyesterday to the Senate is most likely what we are going to be \nconsidering, and it is one that makes the Government part owners of \nthese companies.\n\n  The car czar does not have any specific instructions, such as \nrenegotiating some of the union contracts and some of the things that \nwill have to be done. I looked at this early on, and I thought, as \nundesirable as bankruptcy is, I do not know of any other way you can \nactually force the tough negotiations that will have to take place. It \nhas to be management and labor. It is not just labor; it is not just \nmanagement. There has been mismanagement. But they would have to \nsatisfy the courts that we have a system that will work.\n  I read an article in the New York Times from the middle of November, \nand it was entitled ``A British Lesson on Auto Bailouts.'' It discussed \nthe British treatment of the Leyland automobile in the 1970s and 1980s. \nThe article reported that the British Government ultimately spent--\nwell, transferring this or putting this in U.S. dollars--they spent \n$16.5 billion--that is comparable to what we are talking about now--to \nbailout the British automobile company called Leyland.\n  The article quoted a top official from the Thatcher government, which \nreluctantly but ultimately backed the bailout. He said:\n\n       I'm not telling the U.S. what to do, but the lesson of the \n     British experience is don't throw good money after bad. \n     British Leyland carried on for a few more years, but they are \n     not there now, are they?\n\n  No, Mr. President, they are not. They are bankrupt after burning \nthrough the taxpayers' bailout dollars.\n  Now, why we now believe Government bailouts and Government ownership \nof shares of these companies is going to be a successful venture \nwithout a clear idea of what these companies would do to significantly \nalter their business models, and at least until well into next year--I \ndo not\n\n[[Page S10893]]\n\nknow why we think this because it has not happened. It has not happened \nsuccessfully before.\n  In the New York Times, just a few days ago, Jeffrey Garten, who \nserved as Under Secretary of Commerce during the Clinton \nadministration, and who is now a professor at Yale University, was \nquoted as saying this:\n\n       We're at this moment in history, in which the Chinese are \n     touting that their system is better than ours with their mix \n     of capitalism and state control and our response, it looks \n     like, is to begin replicating what they've been doing.\n\n  Now, that is what he says we are doing: replicating now what the \nChinese have been doing. I have to say this: I am very much concerned \nabout the Chinese. I have spent quite a bit of time in Africa and other \nparts of the world. But in Africa, the Chinese, I think, pose the \ngreatest threat to us. It is an economic threat as well as a military \nthreat. But, nonetheless, does that mean we should be doing what they \nare doing? And we are replicating their system, according to Jeffrey \nGarten.\n  I cannot support Congress using taxpayer dollars to bail out yet \nanother industry. I can remember when we were talking about this a few \nweeks ago with the $700 billion bailout. We were talking about this as \nif this were something that was going to be a one-shot deal. I said, \nstanding on this Senate floor, that as soon as this goes through, they \nare going to start lining up.\n  I said: You are going to get not just the bankers, you are going to \nget the auto dealers and the airlines and everybody else out there \nsaying, well, if this is what is out there, bail me out, too. I want to \nbe bailed out.\n  So this is what is happening. We are now looking at one unelected \nbureaucrat administering a brandnew Government program with taxpayer \ndollars buying ownership in an industry. I think we have heard this one \nbefore. I know the American people have heard this before also.\n  This is exactly what Secretary Paulson did. I am talking about the \nmassive $700 billion financial bailout legislation. Let's keep in mind, \nwe are talking about an amount that is far less than that. We are \ntalking about $14 billion.\n  I remember talking on the Senate floor when it looked as though we \nhad $350 billion that was not going to be used. In fact, Secretary \nPaulson said--this was interesting--right before we went into recess, \nSecretary Paulson said: We have no intentions of using, no reason to \nuse the other $350 billion. We have a reserve that we have not spent \nyet of about $15 billion.\n  I responded and said: Well, if you do not have any intentions of \nusing it, let's go ahead and change the system so you cannot use it. I \ndo not want to have us adjourn and find out: Oh, I think we will use \nanother $350 billion, which is comparable to about $2,500 per family \nfiling a tax return.\n  Well, the Congress gave Secretary Paulson the $700 billion in two \ninstallments, and we all know how that second installment is. I have \nauthored two bills. One of them is S. 3683, sponsored by, of all \npeople, Bernie Sanders, the one who is a self-proclaimed socialist, a \nguy who is on the opposite end of the philosophic specter from me. Yet \nhe knows this is something that is wise: to have accountability for the \n$350 billion. I do not have her name on here, but I think Senator \nMikulski might also have been on here because I was on the Senate floor \nwith her, and she said it would be a good idea. We have Senators \nBarrasso, Wicker, DeMint, Roberts, and Vitter.\n  This legislation would freeze the unexpended expenditures of the \noriginal $350 billion and require an affirmative vote--is that asking \ntoo much--an affirmative vote to access the remaining $350 billion. It \nis automatic now. That is all we are asking for.\n  So I think that as we talk today--and, hopefully, this will be over \ntonight; I anticipate that it will because it goes on and on and on, \nand nobody, right before Christmas, wants to be working over the \nweekend when it looks like nothing meaningful is going to happen--let's \nbring it on, bring on the bill. Let's have a vote on it. Let's get it \nover with today, and, hopefully, we can reject it. think a lot of \nMembers in this body, some of those who supported the $700 billion \nbailout, have a chance at redemption right now by opposing this \nlegislation.\n\n  So, once again, let me just put it back in perspective. I came back \nfrom Afghanistan on the weekend and I saw the discussion take place, \nand I had an idea, through the experience I have on the Senate floor, \nthat nothing was going to happen for the next 2 or 3 days, so I went \nback to Oklahoma and talked to real people.\n  By the way, I have to say this: I talked to a lot of dealers in \nOklahoma about the idea of a car czar, and because of the prospect of a \nWashington bureaucrat telling the car manufacturers how to run their \nbusinesses and what kind of cars to make, it did not give them hope for \nthe future. These people were opposed to it. I know a lot of the car \ndealers are for this. They are concerned about keeping the parts \ninventories and all of that, but I look at this, and I don't see any \nother way it can happen.\n  By the way, I would say concerning this bailout bill, I don't think \nthey did anything to address the California waiver. This is something \nthat has to be done if they are really sincere about this bill that \ncame over from the House. Someone can correct me if they have corrected \nthe problems of the California waiver; I don't think they have. Right \nnow, there is litigation out there, where California wants to be able \nto determine what its tailpipe restrictions are. It is in the courts \nright now, but if they are successful, then that would mean we have 50 \nStates that can determine what their emission requirements are in their \nState. You talk about one factor driving up the price of cars, that \nwould be it.\n  Again, I don't know for sure what all is in this thing from the \nHouse, but I do know this: The basic bill is the same bill that we had \nbefore. It is based on a concept that the bureaucracy can run the free \nenterprise system better than the free enterprise system can, and it \ndoesn't work. Let's solve the problem of the $14 billion, but let's get \nsome people to join in with me on the Senate bill that will allow us to \nrequire an affirmative vote for the second $350 billion.\n  Let's put that in perspective: $350 billion as opposed to $14 \nbillion. I think it deserves the attention of the Members of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the possible \nbailout of the Big 3 automobile manufacturers. General Motors, \nChrysler, and Ford have come before this Congress asking for tens of \nbillions of dollars from the taxpayers. This bailout, however, raises a \nnumber of questions that concern me greatly.\n  The economy of the United States is rooted in free-market principles. \nThese principles, coupled with our Nation's entrepreneurial spirit, \nhelped America become the richest and most innovative country in the \nworld. Even though our economy is struggling right now, we cannot \nabandon those principles.\n  American automobile company executives have made many poor decisions \nover the past few decades. Those decisions combined with a poor \neconomy, have put them in a desperate situation, particularly General \nMotors. It seems to me that this is exactly why we have Chapter 11 \nbankruptcy. Now, when I say bankruptcy, I am not talking about \nliquidation. That is Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Chapter 11 bankruptcy \nprovides struggling companies with the opportunity to restructure \nresponsibly so that they can transform into efficient and profitable \nfirms. Chapter 11 exists to protect both the employees and the company \nitself by giving them a chance to get things right. The Big 3 should \nnot view Chapter 11 as some sort of death sentence. Instead, they \nshould see it as the best opportunity to put themselves on the same \ncompetitive footing with companies such as Toyota and BMW. Venerable \ncompanies in America such as Macy's and Continental Airlines have filed \nfor Chapter 11 and have emerged as stronger, more viable companies. So \nwhy should the Big 3 be treated any differently?\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\n  I know these companies would say they are somehow unique and that \nbankruptcy simply will not work for them. I am not so sure about that. \nThe Big 3 worry that today's financial environment would prevent them \nfrom securing debtor-in-possession financing from the private sector. \nThey would need such funding to keep operating through a bankruptcy \nproceeding. This is where the government can step in. This would ensure \nthat automakers have the funds to complete the Chapter 11 process.\n  The Big 3 also worry that few consumers would buy a car from a \ncompany that might not be around in a few years to stand by the car's \nwarranty. Again, the government could step in and guarantee the \nwarranties. After all, what is a better backup of a warranty than the \nfull faith and credit of the U.S. Government? And if the government \ntook these steps, wouldn't that give the Big 3 a good chance to \nsuccessfully reorganize through Chapter 11 bankruptcy?\n\n  The Big 3 have testified before Congress that they would require \nabout $34 billion to avoid liquidation. They would need this help over \nthe next year or two. Many independent analysts, however, believe that \nnumber may triple that. Frankly, I am more inclined to believe the \nindependent estimates are closer to reality. After all, the Big 3 have \ntime and again proven unable to adequately plan for the future. Why \nshould we believe their projections now? With the deficit reaching $1 \ntrillion or more next year, why aren't we having a debate over the true \ncost of such a bailout? We should be worried about the U.S. taxpayer.\n  In this legislation, there has been talk about creating a ``car \nczar'' to oversee any restructuring that would accompany a bailout. \nThis czar, however, would not have nearly the same sort of powers a \nbankruptcy court judge would have under Chapter 11. Injecting a \ngovernment bureaucrat into the process is not a serious solution. If \nyou have been around Washington long enough, you know it is more like a \nserious problem. Wouldn't it be better to have an expert such as a \nbankruptcy court judge oversee the process?\n  Not only would a bankruptcy judge have more tools than a car czar, \nbut the judge would not be influenced by the political process. A \nbailout would invite all sorts of meddling from lawmakers to have the \ncompanies carry out their own pet policies. We should not be using this \nbailout as a vehicle to implement domestic social policy.\n  Not to mention that creditors or stakeholders will just lobby \nCongress to make the sort of concessions that would be required of them \nunder the bankruptcy. We see this sort of lobbying right now with the \nTARP program. Everyone is trying to tweak the program to benefit their \nown narrow self-interest. Why would we expect the auto unions or \nsuppliers or dealers to behave any differently? I worry that \npoliticizing the restructuring of the Big 3 would jeopardize any \nchances of success they may have.\n  All this talk of government-directed restructuring also raises bigger \npicture questions. Why does Congress think we can succeed where so many \nbusinessmen have already failed? What sort of experience in the car-\nmaking business does this Congress have? Last I checked, none of my \ncolleagues have a background in running a car company. And this car \nczar seems doomed to failure too. One government bureaucrat to oversee \nthe reorganization of three massive companies? What track record can we \npoint to that makes us think this will work?\n  This strikes me as a questionable intervention by the government into \nthe private sector. We have the government thinking it can run these \nbusinesses better than they can. Heck, we cannot even run the \ngovernment. We also have the government choosing which individual \ncompanies deserve help and which do not. This is not what the \nGovernment should be doing. Government should not be picking winners or \nlosers in the private sector. For the long-term health of the country's \nentrepreneurial-based economy, this could be a dangerous precedent.\n  One of the companies asking for a bailout is Chrysler, which is owned \nby an investment fund known as Cerberus. Some reports indicate Cerberus \nmay have significant asset holdings, into the billions of dollars. But \nit appears Cerberus has done nothing to infuse any emergency cash into \nChrysler to save it. Why should the government bail out Chrysler, when \nits own parent company seems unwilling to offer any help?\n  If we bail out the car companies, what does that mean for other \nstruggling industries? The automakers are not the only ones suffering \ntoday in this bad economy. Would we have to bail out every large \ncompany in every major industry? Tourism is one of America's biggest \nindustries and has a high employment multiplier, much like the auto \nindustry. Hotel rooms are going empty as consumers cut back on travel. \nMany state economies, such as in my own State of Nevada, are hurting \nbecause of the downturn in consumer travel. Should the hotels receive a \nbailout? How about the newspaper industry? We know their businesses are \nhurting too. The Tribune Company filed for Chapter 11. Should we be \nbailing them out as well? Where do we draw the line? Can we even draw a \nline once we have given the Big 3 a bailout?\n  The proposed automaker bailout is indicative of a big-government \napproach to dealing with our economy. We are in the midst of a \nrecession, yet we have come back for a late session of Congress to talk \nabout saving just three companies. Why aren't we considering pro-growth \npolicies to help the larger economy? We should be considering long-\nterm, pro-growth tax cuts rather than searching for ways to spend more \nof the taxpayers' money. For instance, lowering the corporate tax rate \nwould put more money back into the hands of companies all across \nAmerica. This would help companies stay afloat and to avoid cutting \njobs during these difficult times. Instead, the Democrats are looking \nto spend money on bloated, uncompetitive automakers.\n  As we debate whether to loan billions of dollars to the automakers, I \nurge my colleagues to consider all the important questions I have \nraised today. This issue is not as simple as answering ``how many jobs \nmight be lost?'' or ``how much it will cost the government?'' We must \nalso consider questions such as ``what is the Government's proper role \nduring this economic downturn?'' ``What could be the unintended \nconsequences of our actions?'' ``Are we setting a dangerous precedent \nfor needless political intervention?'' ``How might this affect our \nballooning deficit?'' ``Are we taking the best course of action for the \nlong-term health of the U.S. Government?''\n  We would do America a disservice by approving any bailout package for \nthe Big 3 before finding at least some consensus on these questions. \nFurthermore, I believe we must look more closely at Chapter 11 as a \nviable option for the automakers. Chapter 11 reorganization for any of \nthe Big 3 is far from ideal, but we do not live in an ideal world nor \nduring ideal times. We should not dismiss one of the most powerful \ntools available to us so readily.\n  I hope my colleagues will think long and hard about the issues I have \nraised today before making any decisions about the possible bailout. If \nthis bailout package that is before us today fails, we can rewrite the \nbill and do it in a way that is better for the U.S. auto manufacturing \nindustry.

Mr. President, I stand to again address the key issue \nbefore us that affects so many Americans, American families, and indeed \nall of us, through our economy: the proposed U.S. auto industry \nbailout.\n  Yesterday, I stood here and announced two conclusions I was driven to \nreach. First, I would have to strongly oppose the bailout package in \nits present form because I don't think it demands the fundamental \nrestructuring it will take for those companies to survive. Second, \nbecause of that very point, I would use every procedural tool available \nto block, stop, and delay that package from passing into law.\n  I, again, reached those conclusions. I restate that commitment for \none very simple, very compelling reason--because so much is at stake; \nbecause we need to get it right; because millions of individual workers \nand families, and indeed all of us, through our economy, will suffer \nthe consequences of our not taking appropriate action.\n  Again, let me be clear, I am not trying to block this package in \nspite of job losses that would occur if these companies went down. I am \ntrying to block this package because of that, in light of that, because \nthis package doesn't demand the fundamental core restructuring that is \nabsolutely necessary for these companies to survive.\n  This package puts those companies down a road where I believe that is \nunlikely to ever happen. It would throw a lot of taxpayer dollars at \nthe problem to buy time, but it doesn't change the endgame, in my \nopinion.\n  Let me also make clear, having said all that, I am not for doing \nnothing. I am not for going home and forgetting about this and walking \naway. This is a serious crisis we must address. I am for doing \nsomething, but the right thing, the right way, something that will \nensure, demand the fundamental core restructuring it will take for \nthese American companies to survive.\n  What do I mean by that? I could support a few alternatives. Let me \noutline two specific alternatives that are being worked on now, that \nhave been developed, that are being discussed by many Members that I \ncould support. First of all, I could certainly support a strong, \ncomprehensive alternative being developed by Senator Bob Corker of \nTennessee and others. That proposal wouldn't throw $14 billion at the \ncompany before any outline of a restructuring plan is agreed to. It \nwould say: No, we need to agree and nail down and ensure some of those \nfundamentals now, before any taxpayer dollars go to those companies.\n  What are those fundamentals? Senator Corker outlines four that I \nagree are at the core of the issue and must be nailed down before any \ntaxpayer dollars should go to those companies.\n  First, his proposal would require that participating companies reduce \ntheir outstanding debt obligations by at least two-thirds by forcing \nthe companies' bondholders to accept an equity swap or debt for debt \nand equity swap--in other words, for the taxpayer dollars we would be \nsending to those companies not to boost the take, not to boost the \nvalue of bonds for those bondholders, but for the bondholders to \ncontribute something up front to reduce the debt of the companies. That \nis crucial because right now those companies, particularly GM, are \ndrowning under unbelievable debt, and that alleged loan would be on top \nof that. So that is crucial.\n  Second, we would agree up front that the companies would become more \ncompetitive by requiring that all-in labor costs and work rules would \nbe immediately on par with other automaking companies such as Nissan, \nToyota, and Honda. Obviously, a major source of the uncompetitiveness \nof the three U.S. automakers is their labor costs. They cannot possibly \ncompete in this global marketplace when their costs are way, way \nhigher, 80 percent higher than competitors such as Toyota, Honda, and \nNissan. This aspect of the Corker plan would ensure that is nailed down \nup front.\n  Third, the legislation would require that changes in payments to the \nUAW VEBA accounts occur to help the companies' cash flow, specifically \nthat at least half of any scheduled payments be made in stock. There \nagain, it would reinforce the sense that the workers and the union have \na real stake in all of this working and in those companies surviving.\n  Fourth, any compensation, outside of customary severance pay, that \ngoes now to workers who have been fired or laid off or furloughed would \nend. Again, a major cost to these U.S. companies, a major source of \ntheir uncompetitiveness is they are paying lots of money, tens of \nmillions or billions of dollars for people not to work, for people not \nto work.\n  That is a plan I could support. That is not putting the cart before \nthe horse. That is getting things in the right order, nailing down that \nessential restructuring now before any taxpayer dollars go out the \ndoor.\n  A second alternative I could support would involve a formal \nbankruptcy process. A lot of folks make the argument that bankruptcy is \nnot an option, that consumers will never buy a car of a company in \nbankruptcy; they don't know if the warranty will be there or be good 6 \nmonths or a year from now. We can fix that problem. We can address that \nproblem with appropriate limited Government assistance and \nparticipation in the formal bankruptcy.\n  Specifically, I would support a plan whereby the Government could \nplay that role in two limited, specific ways: one, backing up the \nwarranty obligations of the companies with the full faith and credit of \nthe U.S. Government so consumers can retain that confidence and, two, \nproviding debtor-in-possession financing if that is necessary. I \nbelieve the Government playing that crucial role, or something akin to \nthat, can make a traditional bankruptcy process work.\n  Again, Mr. President, I stand before you and my colleagues in the \nSenate--indeed, all the American people--to urge us to adopt one of \nthose alternative paths, to urge us to think outside the tiny \nconstricted box folks have tried to put us into and find a third way, a \nbetter way which does exist. There are folks who argue it is this or \nbust. Quite frankly, that is baseless fear mongering. There is another \nway. There is a third path and a better way. I have outlined two just \nin the last few minutes. Let's choose that better path. Let's do the \nresponsible thing. Let's demand the fundamental core restructuring it \nwill take for these companies to survive. And let's demand it and nail \nit down now, not throw billions of taxpayers' dollars at them simply \nupon the request that they sit down to begin to think about such \nrestructuring. That is the plan before us. That is unreasonable. That \nis not an appropriate role for the taxpayers. But these two \nalternatives I outlined would be far different, would demand and ensure \nthat core fundamental restructuring happens.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to join me in voting no on the important vote tomorrow \nmorning on the present plan and to say yes to real restructuring, \nfundamental core restructuring that can save a maximum number of these \njobs in America.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, these are, indeed, turbulent times for \nthe U.S. economy. Over the past several months, Americans have seen \ngiant companies fail, significant job losses, and, after unprecedented \nproblems in the credit markets, the frightening prospect of total \ndisarray within our Nation's mainstream economy.\n  The crisis in the credit markets came at us quickly. We were told \nthat urgent Government action was needed in order to shore up the \nbroader economy and that failure to act would lead to a complete \ncollapse of consumer credit, the very lifeblood of our Nation's \neconomy. Under ordinary circumstances, I would have opposed such a \nmeasure. Government intervention in the marketplace,\n\n[[Page S10896]]\n\nfrankly, cuts against all my ordinary impulses. But this was not an \nordinary event. I and many others believed that extraordinary action \nwas needed to protect millions of ordinary Americans from the colossal \nand far-reaching mistakes of a few. And action was taken. The systemic \nbreakdown some envisioned has not occurred. So there is reason to \nbelieve the medicine has had some effect. But on the whole, the overall \neconomy continues to struggle. Some industries have been hit harder \nthan others, and one of them certainly is the auto industry.\n  The problems in the auto industry have been long in the making. But \nlast month the situation grew so dire that American automobile makers \ncame to Washington with an urgent appeal for Federal help. Over the \npast few weeks, lawmakers have taken the time to examine the problems \nof these companies and the solutions that have been proposed. Now the \nAmerican taxpayers are being asked to put their money behind a plan \nthat is aimed at helping these companies survive.\n  Republicans received that plan late yesterday morning, about this \ntime yesterday. We reviewed it closely to see if it meets the criteria \nI have laid out repeatedly for taxpayer protections and for an \neffective strategy for securing the long-term viability of these \ncompanies. In the end, I concluded that it does not.\n  In some ways, the proposal that was worked out by the White House and \ncongressional Democrats appears tough. It calls on struggling auto \ncompanies and auto workers to make the sort of sacrifices they have not \nbeen accustomed to making in the past. It also includes time limits as \na way of hastening necessary reforms. But in reality, this proposal is \nnot nearly tough enough. A primary weakness relates to the so-called \ncar czar who has nearly unlimited power to allocate taxpayer dollars \nbut limited ability to force the kinds of tough concessions long-term \nviability would require. Another problem lies outside the proposal \nitself, and here I am referring to the type of Government action that \nis being contemplated.\n  Somewhat lost in the recent debate over the auto industry is the \nfundamental difference between it and the financial rescue plan \nCongress approved in October. While that plan was intended to rescue \nthe entire economy, this one is intended to save a single industry. \nThat plan was intended to help everyone from small business owners to \ncollege students, and every lawmaker who voted for it acted in the \nbelief that is exactly what it would do. A failure to appreciate this \ndistinction has caused a number of other industries and even a number \nof municipalities across the country to prepare their own proposals for \nGovernment rescue, as all Americans weather the tough economy. It has \nalso created the impression in some minds that the Federal Government \nis picking favorites and that favorite businesses get help while others \ndo not. A lot of struggling Americans are asking where their bailout \nis. They wonder why one business would get support over another. When \nit comes to the auto industry, many Republicans in Congress have asked \nthese same questions.\n\n  There are many principled reasons to oppose this bill. But the \nsimplest one is also the best--a government big enough to give us \neverything we want is a government big enough to take everything we \nhave. This is as true for individuals as it is for business. It is the \nprimary principle upon which American industry, including the auto \nindustry, was built. Even in turbulent moments such as this--perhaps \nespecially at moments such as this--it is a principle worth defending.\n  Now, some argue the effects of the auto industry collapse would be \ntoo acute and far-reaching for an already struggling economy to bear. \nThis is impossible to know. Even if we grant that these companies would \nfail without taxpayer help, we would still have to ask ourselves \nwhether the proposal before us achieves the goal everyone claims to \nembrace; namely, the long-term viability of ailing car companies. In my \nview, it does not.\n  I have already enumerated some of the weaknesses in the plan. But in \nthe end, its greatest single flaw is it promises taxpayer money today \nfor reforms that may or may not come tomorrow. We would not be serving \nthe American taxpayer well if we spent their hard-earned money without \nknowing with certainty that their investment would result in stronger, \nleaner automobile companies that would not need additional taxpayer \nhelp a few months or weeks down the road. We simply cannot ask the \nAmerican taxpayer to subsidize failure.\n  Now, all Americans, including myself, are worried about the future of \nour Nation's automakers. These companies have a venerable place in the \nstory of modern America. They continue to provide hundreds of thousands \nof jobs across the country, including 50,000 auto-related jobs in my \nhome State of Kentucky. But many Americans are also worried about the \nprospect of the Government intervening on behalf of some industries and \nnot intervening on behalf of others, especially when there is no \nguarantee--no guarantee--that the interventions will work. They wonder \nwhen the spending stops. If I were to vote in favor of this bill, I \nwould not have a very good answer for them.\n  The best route for the long-term viability of ailing car companies \nmay be a rocky one. Government help is not the only option. It is not \neven the best option. Long-term viability is still possible, but it is \nonly possible if these companies are forced to make the tough choices \nnecessary for their survival.\n  My colleague, Senator Corker, has proposed an amendment that would go \na long way toward improving this bill. In keeping with the principles I \nhave outlined before in these comments this morning, the Corker \namendment does not just encourage reform--it doesn't just encourage \nreform--it requires reform. It does so with crucial specificity. First, \nparticipating companies would be required to reduce their outstanding \ndebt by at least two-thirds through an equity swap with bondholders. \nThe Corker amendment also requires that labor cost at participating \ncompanies be brought on par with companies such as Nissan, Toyota--\nwhich I also have in my State--and Honda, not tomorrow but immediately \nbecause it is delusional to think a company which spends $71 per labor \nhour could compete with a company in the same industry that spends $49 \nper labor hour.\n  The Corker amendment would improve the liquidity and cash flow of \nautomakers by requiring that a portion of the payments made to the \nunion accounts consist of company stock. Finally, the Corker amendment \nwould require participating companies to file for chapter 11 \nreorganization if any of these conditions--if any of these conditions--\naren't met by a fixed date.\n  The Corker amendment forces necessary reforms, holds companies \naccountable, and assures taxpayers that these companies will not be \nback for more. If legislative action were necessary, the Corker \nproposal would make many much needed and dramatic improvements to the \nunderlying bill.\n  I, similar to all my colleagues, want the U.S. auto industry not only \nto survive but to thrive. By cutting costs, streamlining production, \nincreasing fuel efficiency, and investing in new technologies and \nattractive, more competitive designs, American auto companies will once \nagain make cars people all over the world will want to buy. Then, \nAmericans would be able to say, again, with pride that our cars are the \nbest.\n  In addition, protecting the taxpayer is a goal Republicans have been \nfighting hard for in this debate, and in my view it is a goal that is \nwell worth our efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business, with a 10-minute \ntime limit. There is no unanimous consent request on the order of \nspeakers.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have to say we are now here, approaching \nChristmas, in a deepening recession. On December 1, the National Bureau \nof Economic Research said that, in fact, the recession had begun in \nDecember 2007.\n\n[[Page S10897]]\n\n  How many jobs have been lost in the last year? Almost 2 million jobs \nhave been lost in the last year. So we are here today on the heels of a \nloss of 2 million jobs. The unemployment rate stands at 6.7 percent, \nand it is growing. In my State, it is 8.2 percent. Today, the Labor \nDepartment reported that initial applications for jobless benefits rose \nto 573,000, the highest number in 26 years.\n  So when I hear someone come to the floor and say: Gee, I didn't get \nall the language until a couple days ago and this is a problem; you \nknow, sit down and read the language. We cannot afford to say we are \nnot going to do something and act to turn around this recession because \nsomebody didn't have the time to read the bill.\n  Consumer confidence has plunged to its lowest level since the survey \nbegan in 1967. Gross domestic product has dipped, personal spending \ndecreased 3.7 percent in the third quarter, and according to the CBO--\nthe Congressional Budget Office--American workers lost more than $2 \ntrillion over 15 months as the stock market decline devastated \nretirement accounts. Let me say that again. American workers lost more \nthan $2 trillion over 15 months as the stock market decline devastated \nretirement savings accounts. So we are dealing with a crisis.\n  Compared to a year ago, U.S. foreclosure filings increased 71 percent \nin the third quarter. The Institute for Supply Management Index, which \nis a key gauge of U.S. manufacturing activity, fell to a 26-year low in \nNovember. Manufacturing activity fell to a 26-year low in November. \nHome prices, tracked by S's 20-city housing index, dropped 17.4 \npercent in September. That is a record--the fastest decline on record. \nDo you hear what I am saying? The job losses, the jobless claims, the \nforeclosures, the stock market, everything is going in the wrong \ndirection. For people who don't know what the fundamentals of the \neconomy mean, that is the fundamentals of the economy. That is the \nfundamentals--unemployment, housing prices, stock market, retirement \nincomes.\n  Construction spending fell by 1.2 percent in October, much more than \nwhat was expected--another fundamental of the economy. Construction of \nsingle-family homes plunged 4.6 percent from September. Sales at the \nwholesale level plunged by 4.1 percent in October. That is nationwide.\n  My State of California trails only Michigan in the total number of \nauto-related jobs. In fact, there are nearly 200,000 Californians \nemployed by auto dealers, manufacturers, and wholesalers whose \nlivelihoods are at stake.\n  At the Vehicle Accessory Center in Rancho Cucamonga, CA, 50 workers \nmanufacture auto parts for GM cars.\n  The general manager, Russell Hoyt, writes that without a bridge loan \nto the Big Three, ``we run the risk of losing all of the gains we've \nmade over the years to make our company more competitive and to build \nnew technologies and cars that will benefit consumers and improve our \nnation's energy security.''\n  Gina Underwood, the controller of a Saturn dealership that employs 48 \npeople in Ontario, CA, wrote to me about the impact the credit market \nis having on her business.\n  She says ``the potential trickle down into my community borders on \ncatastrophic.'' She adds that ``helping our industry in the short-term \nwill have a much lower cost than addressing the effects of a failed \nindustry in the midst of an economic turnaround.''\n  The Los Angeles Federation of Labor says the decline in the auto \nindustry is ``responsible for nearly 11 percent of California's job \nloss in the past year. It has also robbed millions of dollars from \nstate and local treasuries that are responsible for funding some of our \nmost crucial public services.''\n  The California chapter of the United Auto Workers writes that ``these \nloans will enable domestic auto companies to continue operations and \nwill avoid putting thousands of people out of work.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe California recession figures.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      California Recession Figures\n\n       In California, the unemployment rate is at 8.2 percent--the \n     highest in 14 years.\n       California has lost 101,000 jobs over the past year and \n     487,000 more people were looking for work in October than \n     were doing so a year ago.\n       1.5 million Californians are out of work.\n       The University of the Pacific Business Forecasting Center \n     has predicted that the state's unemployment rate will peak at \n     9.6 percent the end of next year and won't dip below 9 \n     percent until 2011.\n       Through the first three quarters of 2008, more than 189,000 \n     California homes were lost to foreclosure.\n       The number of California homes in foreclosure totaled \n     79,511 in the third quarter--more than triple last year's \n     number.\n       In cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego, \n     housing prices have declined more than 25 percent.\n       In October 51 percent of homes sold in Southern California \n     were in foreclosures, compared to 16 percent the year before.\n       A recent report stated that over 27 percent of California \n     homeowners are already ``underwater,'' or have negative \n     equity in their home.\n       The Joint Economic Committee estimates that California \n     state-wide home prices will fall 17 percent between 2007 and \n     2009, resulting in a net loss of over 1 trillion in housing \n     wealth.\n       The state budget shortfall for next year could reach $28 \n     billion.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Suffice it to say that 1.5 million Californians are out \nof work, and in the third quarter we had 79,000 foreclosures, more than \ntriple last year's numbers. We have a State budget crisis, some of it \nemanating from this downturn, and we have to step up to the plate and \ndo our part. Whether we live in a city, whether we live in a county, \nwhether we work for the people as a member of a city council, whether \nwe work as a county supervisor, whether we work as a mayor or a House \nMember or a Senator, all of us who work for the people have to step up \nto the plate.\n  I did something interesting, and it might be of interest to you. I \nworked with my staff. We have 58 counties in California and we got on \nthe phone and we talked to the leaders of each of those counties and \nthe 10 major cities in our State. We do have 38 million people in our \nState. They told us what is happening on the ground there, and it is \nnot a pretty picture. Now, some of them are doing better than others. A \nlot of them are facing unemployment rates in their cities of 13 \npercent, 12 percent, and 9 percent. In the inland empire area, which is \njust east of Los Angeles, we have the highest unemployment rate in the \nNation, about 9.1 percent.\n  So the point of my setting the stage for my remarks by giving a broad \nlook at what is happening is to make sure people understand we are not \ntaking up this auto rescue plan in normal times. If it was normal \ntimes, that would be one thing. I wouldn't be that sympathetic to the \nbig three in normal times. I have had my arguments with them since the \n1980s. I think their fighting California and the 19 other States that \nwant better fuel economy is a huge mistake on their part, and I don't \nwant to reward them for that. But I have to tell you, when you look at \nthe times we are in, you recognize we need to bridge these troubled \ntimes right now, bridge these troubled times with a loan so we can take \na look at this when we have a new President, a new Congress, and, \nfrankly, when we begin to see a light at the end of this tunnel, which \nI believe is going to come when our new President comes to us in \nJanuary and we start to put together a plan for economic recovery.\n  How tragic would it be if we lost this manufacturing base at this \npoint in this recession, just as I do believe we are going to pull \nourselves out of this mess we are in. We need a bridge to better times \nfor the auto industry. By the way, other countries around the globe are \ndoing the same for their auto industries. Because there are two things \nhappening here. Detroit got in trouble because, in my view, they built \nthose big cars, they didn't diversify their fleet, and they fought us \non fuel economy. Believe me, I was in that fight against them every \nstep of the way. They won that fight. But now they are losing at the \nend of the day because they made a mistake in fighting us.\n  But we don't want to lose this manufacturing base at this time. We \nwould be the only industrialized nation in the world not to have a \ndomestic auto industry.\n  When I hear my colleagues say I don't like this little sentence here \nor that sentence there, I understand that. Believe me, there are a lot \nof things in\n\n[[Page S10898]]\n\nthese bills I do not like at all. But we have to step back and say, in \nthese troubled times, unparalleled since the Great Depression, do we \nwant to leave here and risk the chance that we could wake up without a \nmanufacturing base in our great Nation? I say the answer is no.\n  I have three reasons for voting for this rescue package: Jobs, jobs \nand jobs. When we were hit with foreclosures, the first round of them, \nthey had to do with predatory lending. They had to do with some things \nthat were outrageous--people put in these subprime loans who could have \nbeen in prime loans. They woke up one day when they were paying $400 a \nmonth and suddenly it is $1,000 a month. They couldn't do it. We hope \nthose loans could be restructured. That is one set of difficult \ncircumstances for going into foreclosures. The far worse set of \ncircumstances is when you lose your job and your family cannot make it. \nThat is the thing I wish to avoid.\n  My focus is on this economy and making sure we are doing everything \nto save, preserve, and create jobs. With each passing day, we realize \nwhat a crisis we are in. Again, today we found out more people filed \nfor unemployment compensation, a bigger number than we have seen in 26 \nyears. When I heard we lost 533,000 jobs last month, it sent shivers up \nand down my spine. If we don't act, we risk seeing another 2 to 3 \nmillion jobs that could be at risk. We know even the collapse of one of \nthe big three could cause that.\n  In my home State, we have 200,000 auto-related jobs, second only to \nMichigan.\n  At the Vehicle Accessory Center at Rancho Cucamonga, our general \nmanager there writes that without a bridge loan to the big three:\n\n       We run the risk of losing all the gains we've made over the \n     years to make our company more competitive and to build new \n     technologies and cars that will benefit consumers and improve \n     our nation's energy security.\n\n  Gina Underwood, a controller at Saturn of Ontario, employing 48 \npeople in Ontario, CA, wrote to me about the impact of the credit \ncrisis. She says:\n\n       The potential trickle down into my community borders on \n     catastrophic.\n\n  She adds:\n\n       Helping our industry in the short-term will have a much \n     lower cost than addressing the effects of a failed industry \n     in the midst of an economic turnaround.\n\n  The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor says the decline in the \nauto industry:\n\n       . . . is responsible for nearly 11 percent of California's \n     job loss in the past year.\n\n  The California chapter of the United Auto Workers writes:\n\n       These loans will enable domestic auto companies to continue \n     operations and will avoid putting thousands of people out of \n     work.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Vehicle Accessory Center,\n\n                          Rancho Cucamonga, CA, November 12, 2008.\n     Senator Barbara Boxer.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I own a company that exclusively \n     provides goods and services to General Motors Dealerships in \n     Southern California. I am writing to urge you to support GM \n     and America's domestic auto industry. Our company employs up \n     to 50 people and there are millions more Americans among \n     suppliers, dealers, retirees and communities that depend on \n     our industry for their livelihood and well-being.\n       All of us need your support now. We cannot sustain our \n     industry because of the worst financial crisis to hit our \n     country in over half a century. We run the risk of losing all \n     of the gains we've made over the years to make our company \n     more competitive and to build new technologies and cars that \n     will benefit consumers and improve our nation's energy \n     security.\n       Our industry is the real economy that runs through Main \n     Street. I call on you and your Congressional colleagues to \n     help preserve jobs and help the domestic auto industry \n     weather this financial storm. With your support, I know my \n     company will emerge stronger and more competitive. And, that \n     means a stronger economy and a more competitive America.\n       I have attached an industry fact sheet that really \n     demonstrates the critical nature of this industry to our \n     economy. I look forward to seeing you take an active role in \n     passing legislation to support this critical economic need.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Russell R. Hoyt,\n     General Manager/Partner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Saturn of Ontario,\n\n                                    Ontario, CA, December 2, 2008.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: My name is Gina M Underwood and I am \n     the Controller at Saturn of Ontario. My dealership employs 48 \n     with an annual payroll of $1,986,059. Our business also \n     supports dozens of local suppliers that are intertwined in \n     our community providing multiple more jobs. I am writing \n     because I fear much of this will be lost and the impact to my \n     community severe if the domestic auto industry is allowed to \n     fail under the weight of the current economic chaos. I \n     believe I have good reason to request your support.\n       The negative effects of the global credit crisis have \n     caused a huge downturn in consumer confidence that I see play \n     out on my car lot every day. I have seen my sales plummet to \n     levels not seen since World War II. The manufacturers who \n     supply me can't get credit to complete their restructurings \n     and put advanced technologies into production, my customers \n     can't get credit to buy the new cars off my lot and I can't \n     get credit to finance my monthly inventory. The potential \n     trickle down into my community borders on catastrophic.\n       Hundreds of jobs in my community will be lost.\n       Multiple suppliers will go under.\n       On a broader scale, billions of dollars already invested in \n     asserting U.S. technological leadership for advanced \n     propulsion systems--in batteries, fuel cells, hybrids and \n     biofuels--will be lost.\n       Our manufacturing ability, critical for our national \n     security is threatened which only exacerbates our dependence \n     on foreign oil.\n       The critics say that the industry has not done enough to \n     save itself. They could not be more wrong. The auto \n     manufacturers have been investing $10 billion in plants and \n     equipment each year. The quality gap has been all but erased \n     between U.S.-based and foreign manufacturers. And new labor \n     agreements that will put the domestic industry in line with \n     our foreign competitors will take effect in 2010.\n       I cannot urge you strongly enough to take action on behalf \n     of my community and my industry. Helping our industry in the \n     short-term will have a much lower cost than addressing the \n     effects of a failed industry in the midst of an economic \n     turnaround. Sadly, I fear the price of inaction is greater \n     than my business can bear. Thank you for your time to hear my \n     concerns.\n       Sincerely,\n     Gina Underwood.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Los Angeles County\n\n\n                                 Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO,\n\n                                Los Angeles, CA, December 5, 2008.\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     Los Angeles, CA.\n       Hon. Barbara Boxer: I write to you out of concern for the \n     millions of autoworkers who will lose their good jobs if \n     federal emergency aid isn't passed for automakers and because \n     the industry's downfall is responsible for nearly 11 percent \n     of California's job loss in the past year. It has also robbed \n     tens of millions of dollars from state and local treasuries \n     that are responsible for funding some of our most crucial \n     public services.\n       While we in Los Angeles are fortunate not to be home to an \n     industry that is on a verge of collapse, we are the nation's \n     capitol of the working poor. In my many years leading the \n     union representing hotel workers, I have come to witness how \n     low-wage workers struggle just to get by. They struggle to \n     feed their children, pay their bills and rent. When their \n     children fall ill they rely on home remedies instead of \n     taking them to the doctor because they simply can't afford \n     it.\n       My concern for workers if the emergency assistance fails to \n     pass is not whether they will find another job elsewhere, but \n     what will become of them in that next job. I worry that it \n     will force them into our nation's ranks of the working poor. \n     In my 30 years in the labor movement I've come to learn that \n     poverty in our communities doesn't stem from a lack of jobs. \n     It stems from a lack of good jobs that provide middle class \n     wages and benefits--jobs that provide the pathway to reach \n     the American dream.\n       As leaders, you as a public servant and I as a labor \n     leader, have a moral responsibility to fight for good jobs \n     that allow men and women to raise their families with pride, \n     dignity and with the piece of mind that a secure retirement \n     brings. We must do everything possible to ensure that the \n     industry that was once the backbone of our middle class rises \n     to those heights once again, So I urge you today to vote for \n     government aid to automakers.\n           In solidarity,\n                                               Maria Elena Durazo,\n     Executive Secretary-Treasurer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 UAW Region 5,\n\n                                    Fremont, CA, December 1, 2008.\n     Re Bridge Loan for the Big Three.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On behalf of the UAW postdoctoral \n     research members who reside in San Francisco, we would \n     greatly appreciate it if you would take some time away from \n     your busy schedule to meet with us before December 8, 2008, \n     here in the City.\n       The purpose of our meeting is to help you understand the \n     serious issues that the UAW is facing concerning the Big \n     Three auto loans. These loans will enable domestic auto \n     companies to continue operations and will avoid putting \n     thousands of people out of work. We also need to remember \n     that suppliers who make certain parts for auto companies will \n     be affected by this as well. Let's\n\n[[Page S10899]]\n\n     not forget that the auto industry has been woven into the \n     fabric of the United States of America, and without it, we \n     will fail.\n       This is an extremely important issue to all of us. Please \n     would you contact my secretary, Veronica Morgan, at (510) \n     656-9901, and let her know the date and time you will be \n     available. You can also contact me on my cell, (510) 299-\n     7399.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Pat Caccamo,\n                                 UAW CAP Representative, Region 5.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the unemployment rate in my State, again, \nis 8.2 percent in California; 8.2 percent. It is rising. Losing another \n200,000 jobs at this time is catastrophic. If we leave and we risk \nthat, then it is our fault. The people who vote this way will have to \nanswer to their own consciences. Failure to act is not an option.\n  Here's the thing, there is a huge cost of inaction. I understand my \ncolleagues are very concerned about the cost to taxpayers. I share that \nconcern. I never heard them talk about that when their States were \ngiving all kinds of incentives to foreign car companies to come in. I \nwill get to that later. But here is what happens in addition to the \nmassive job losses if the big three fail. The burden on taxpayers to \npick up the pieces would be much more costly than these loans. Losing \nGM, Ford or Chrysler would add billions of dollars in costs to the \nalready depleted Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Taxpayers would \nhave to provide health care, unemployment benefits, and other related \nservices. Unfunded health care liabilities would be forced into \nMedicare and Medicaid with costs reaching $50 billion. If the \nautomakers file for bankruptcy, it could lead to a $108 billion loss to \nthe Treasury because of reduced individual income.\n  My colleagues say let them go bankrupt, as if it is a magic solution. \nIt is not a magic solution because the polls tell us 80 percent of the \npeople will not buy a car from a bankrupt automaker because of obvious \nreasons. If you want to keep your car 3, 4, 5 years--I keep mine 9 or \n10 years--you want to make sure you have the parts available to fix \nyour car. You want to make sure you have someone who understands the \ncar and can service the car.\n  This is not similar to a dress company going out of business and \ndeclaring bankruptcy. That is sad and it is tough but, you know, you \nare not going to worry about it. If you have a dress by someone and the \ncompany goes out of business, you are not going to be dealing with that \nmanufacturer. You are if you buy a car. By providing $14 billion in \nloan authority now with requirements that the money be paid back, we \nare taking steps to protect taxpayers from at least $150 billion in \nfuture liabilities, should the auto companies shut down.\n  Then there are people who say isn't this the first of what could be \nmany interventions? I can't predict that. I am just saying at this \ntime, now, with what we know about the state of this economy, with what \nwe know about the state of the lost equity in the market, with what we \nknow about the state of housing, of construction, of the number of \npeople filing--this the Christmas season. My goodness, let's take a \nchance on this. Let's take a chance on this.\n  The administration gave $150 billion to an insurance company. I never \nheard anybody at that time say: Well, the workers in that insurance \ncompany make too much money. That is the problem. You never heard a \nword about that from my Republican friends. Blaming the workers for \nthis is outrageous. They have given back and they have given back and \nthey have given back.\n  What would happen to the thousands of other associated businesses \nthat rely on GM, Ford, and Chrysler if they went belly up? The big \nthree share 80 percent of the supplier base in this country. If one of \nthe companies goes bankrupt, these small- and medium-size businesses \ncould lose significant revenue and be forced to make layoffs or close \ntheir doors.\n  I wish to talk about other countries taking significant steps to \nsupport their domestic auto manufacturing base. Countries throughout \nEurope and Asia are providing assistance to their auto manufacturers \nduring this time of crisis. You take all the auto companies now--take \nToyota. Their sales are way down. Everybody is hit by this recession. \nThe question is, Do we abandon this manufacturing base? Credit markets \nare still frozen. For that, I have to say, and let me be clear--I don't \nunderstand what Mr. Paulson has done since we gave him that authority \nfor $350 billion. Why are the credit markets still as frozen as they \nare?\n  The answer comes back: It could have been worse. I believe that. It \ncould have been worse. But we need to do a better job there. Let me be \nclear, I am not voting--if I have to vote today, tomorrow, next week--\nto release the next $350 billion to this administration. So let me put \nthat on the line.\n  Other countries are recognizing that, with the credit markets frozen, \nthey need to maintain their strong manufacturing base. We are the \ngreatest country in the world. How could we ever continue our \nleadership if we lose that manufacturing base? I know Senator Stabenow \nhas been quite eloquent on the point, about how integrated the \nmanufacturing base is with our military and national defense \ninfrastructure. The big three automakers are the biggest customers for \nmany of the major suppliers of parts and technology for the armed \nservices. From onboard computer devices to tires to engine machinery, \nthese suppliers often rely on the big three to sustain their \nbusinesses.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side who are taking the lead \nagainst this: Think about it. We all stand for a strong defense. If you \nlose this manufacturing base, whom are you going to rely on if we have \nmore national emergencies, international emergencies? We know we cannot \nafford to lose this base.\n  I mentioned before that some of my colleagues on the other side--the \nSenator from Alabama, the Senator from Tennessee--they have been very \noutspoken against helping the auto companies. Where were they when \nAlabama provided $258 million in taxpayer-funded incentives to the \nforeign automaker Mercedes-Benz to build an auto manufacturing plant in \nthe State of Alabama? I never heard them speak up. Do they only speak \nout against American workers who work for American companies here? They \nsupport the foreign companies, not the American companies.\n  Tennessee offered at least $200 million in incentives to Toyota to \nbuild an assembly plant in Chattanooga. Instead, they landed in \nMississippi. Mississippi provided Toyota $296 million in taxpayer-\nfunded initiatives. Why don't I hear my colleagues from Tennessee or \nMississippi out here saying: Oh, that was a mistake. Taxpayers should \nnot have been on the hook.\n  Something is wrong. Is this about not helping these workers because \nthey are tough and they joined a union? Is that it? What is this? It \ndoesn't smell right. You can't support giving money to lure foreign \nmanufacturers into your State, foreign auto companies into your State, \nand then suddenly turn on folks who are trying to save the domestic \nautomobile industry.\n  It is not that I am against what those States did. I am just talking \nabout being consistent. If you didn't oppose giving money to foreign \ncar companies, why do you oppose giving a bridge loan to our own \ndomestic manufacturing base at a time of great economic peril?\n  We will live to fight another day on this, that is for sure. As I \nsaid, if this were a different time, if this were a different place, if \nthe economy were thriving and one of those companies had problems due \nto their own ineptitude, I would not be here now. This is a worldwide \nrecession. Other countries are moving forward. I hope the American \npeople understand this.\n  If we are to add 2 to 3 million more unemployed people onto the list, \nwe are going to be in a downward spiral. It is going to be very hard \nfor us to recover in the near term.\n  Again, the big three have made a lot of mistakes. I met with them in \nthe 1980s. I will never forget it. I was over in the House and I was on \na committee that was dealing with fuel economy. I said: Why don't you \nmake more of these fuel-efficient cars? At that time, I said: My kids \nare in college. I see their friends are all buying these smaller cars. \nThey want to buy American, but they cannot. They cannot afford the gas. \nThat was after we had this crisis in the 1970s.\n  They said: You don't know what you are talking about. Those small \ncars, you don't make enough money on\n\n[[Page S10900]]\n\nthem, they are no good. People want big cars. That is good. We make \nmore money. They said to me: We are giving up those small cars to other \ncompanies, to foreign companies.\n  I believed that was wrong. I said you need to have diversity.\n  They decided to go their way.\n  I don't have a great deal of sympathy for the management over there \nresponsible for this. They didn't take the lead in research and \ndevelopment of advanced technology vehicles. They put too many of their \nresources into gas guzzlers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. They ignored signs that their future success would depend \non an ability to adapt to a changing business climate with innovation \nand new technologies. When I learned of the financial problems facing \nGM, Ford, and Chrysler, I viewed a possible rescue plan as an \nopportunity to help Detroit embrace new technologies that could lead \nthem toward a strong and prosperous future. I still think, because of \nthe White House's objection, the bill before us is making a big mistake \nbecause I wanted to make sure we could say in this bridge loan the \nfunds could not be used to pursue litigation related to the California \nwaiver.\n  Well, the administration will not go for that. We know where they \nstand on energy independence, we know where they stand on fighting \nglobal warming, on clean cars. They stand nowhere--or I should say they \nstand somewhere in a bad place. If the big three would embrace the \nCalifornia waiver, understanding that 19 other States are with us, and \nproduce cars to meet the goals, the very clean-air goals we have there, \nI think we would be a leader in the world. I see that in our future. I \nreally do.\n  I know in your State, Mr. President, we are seeing a whole new range \nof manufacturing dealing with solar panels. It is very exciting. This \nis the future. This is the future. Our big three should be leading the \nway. I hope they got the message in this last runup of gas prices. I \nhope they get the message that there is global warming and that we are \ngoing to have to deal with it if our planet is to survive.\n  I am confident that President-elect Obama is going to approve the \nwaiver. I am confident that when he does that, it is going to be a big \nhelp to the big three because they will really buckle down.\n  By the way, we are going to reimburse this technology fund, they are \ngoing to move ahead and they are going to meet the requirements with \nthe cleanest cars possible, and it will be a new day. Now, if all three \nof them do it and two of them survive in the future, that may be the \nway. We do not know. But what we do know is that today, this day, \nDecember 11, so close to Christmas, we do know that to walk away \nwithout helping this important industry could lead--could lead--to a \nfar deeper recession and even toward a depression.\n  With this auto retooling program from which these funds are being \nborrowed, this will be replenished. Speaker Pelosi has indicated to me \npersonally that they will be replenished. I call on my colleagues in \nthe Senate to support quick replenishment of the program, which is \nessential to the effort of repositioning the U.S. at the forefront of \nnew transportation and advanced battery technologies.\n  You know, we have startup companies in my State--very exciting. One \nof them is called Tesla Motors and the other is Fisker Automotive. That \nis two of them. They are leading the effort to develop advanced \ntechnology batteries, zero-emission cars, and high-performance plug-in \nhybrid electric vehicles. I have driven some of these cars. They are \nextraordinary. These companies and others, including the big three, are \nprocessing section 136 loan applications to retool manufacturing plants \nand speed up the development of technology that will put the United \nStates right out in front, leading the way to clean cars and clean \ntechnology.\n  I wish to point out that no bill is perfect. I could write a bill \nthat would be far better for me. Every Senator could. But there is \nsignificant taxpayer oversight in this bill, as well as benchmarks that \nthe big three must meet in order to continue to receive Government \nassistance.\n  By January 1, the car czar will develop benchmarks to determine how \nto assess each company's progress in turning its plans submitted to \nCongress into long-term restructuring plans. The benchmarks will focus \non how the big three will restructure their businesses for long-term \nviability, increased fuel efficiency, advanced technology, managing \ndebt, capitalization, and future cost requirements.\n  So to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who say: Let them \ngo bankrupt, it is better, they will restructure, we are going to make \nsure they restructure without declaring bankruptcy and without \nunloading all of the cost of that bankruptcy onto the backs of \ntaxpayers. If any of the big three fail to submit long-term \nrestructuring plans by March 31, 2009, the car czar has the authority \nto call the loan or cancel the loan commitment within 30 days, \nrequiring the loan to be paid back at an accelerated rate.\n  Taxpayers will recover the cost of these loans over 7 years at a rate \nof 5 percent for the first 5 and 9 percent thereafter. The car czar \nwill have access to all financial records of the big three and will \nhave the ability to prohibit asset sales or possible investments over \n$100 million, which will protect U.S. jobs being outsourced. The \nGovernment will have senior debt status for repayment of the loans, \nmeaning we are in the front of the line to recover loan payments \nregardless of the companies' success. Stock warrants will ensure the \ntaxpayers benefit from any future growth these companies may \nexperience. The bill prohibits golden parachutes, puts limits on \nexecutive compensation and bonus compensation to top employees, and it \nrequires the companies to divest from any private jet investments. The \npayment of dividends to shareholders will be prohibited during the loan \nperiod. In other words, there is every incentive for these companies to \nturn their companies around. They want to pay dividends to \nshareholders, they want to get bonuses, they want to get back to \nbusiness as usual. But we say: Before you do, you have to pay us back. \nThey have a lot of reasons to make this turnaround.\n  The loan program will be subject to strict auditing by the \nComptroller General and the GAO. The car czar will be tasked with \nfacilitating agreements between unions, retirees, debtholders, \ncreditors, suppliers, auto dealers, and shareholders to reduce costs \nand ensure long-term viability.\n  Again, I say to my colleagues who are saying let them go bankrupt, \ntake a look at this bill. You are saying let them go bankrupt because \nthey will have to restructure. We say restructure without the \nbankruptcy because if, in fact, there is a bankruptcy declared, 80 \npercent of the American people say they will not buy a car from a \ncompany that has gone bankrupt. I understood that. So this avoids the \nbankruptcy and allows them to restructure. If we fail to do this, we \nare playing Russian roulette with this recession. In times of crisis, \nyou have to see opportunities.\n  I believe, as a major critic of the car companies since the 1980s \nwhen I was here in the House of Representatives, they have finally \ngotten the message. It has taken them too long. They have been too \narrogant. They have not seen the world changing. They have not noticed \nglobal warming. They have been blinded to so many things that were \nhappening around them. They were hostile to California and the 19 other \nStates that want to clean up our environment and get better fuel \nmileage, have clean cars. Instead of embracing those States and working \nwith those States--by the way, those 19 States and California represent \na majority of the American people. A majority of the American people \nwant clean cars.\n  Now, it may have taken this horrific turn of events to get the \nmessage through, but clearly the message must be getting through. \nJeffrey Sachs wrote recently in the Washington Post:\n\n       American-made fuel-cell cars may be a large-scale reality \n     within a decade. Success would dramatically improve energy \n     and national security and U.S. global competitiveness.\n\n  Now, this is the opportunity. But guess what. If we do not act, if we \ndo not act and this recession keeps deepening, we will not have this \nchance. We will be the only industrialized democracy without a domestic \nauto company\n\n[[Page S10901]]\n\nand without that manufacturing base. So we have to do what is necessary \nto push Detroit toward a stronger, more efficient future. It may be \nthat at some point in the future, that industry will have a different \nlook to it. Maybe it will have a different look to it. We do not know \nthat. But what we do know now is that what has hit Detroit is far more \nthan making the wrong choices about what cars they produce. I think \nthey made those wrong choices, but it is far bigger than that because \nevery company in America and outside of America that is making cars is \nsuffering today because of the terrible recession we are in, because of \na lack of consumer confidence, because of a loss of equity in the stock \nmarket, because of home foreclosures, because of all of these things.\n  So I say you never know what could happen in the future. I am not \nable to predict it because I cannot. But I know what I have to do now. \nI have to think about those three things: jobs, jobs, and jobs. When I \nthink about that, and I recognize that just today we had more filings \nfor unemployment insurance than we have had in 26 years, I say for us \nto walk away from this without this scaled-down bridge loan would be \nplaying Russian roulette with this recession. I love my country too \nmuch to do that. With all of the problems I have with Detroit, I will \nsupport helping them in this fashion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10901-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Madam President, I stand here today holding a 500-page \nreport, a report that was sent to my office yesterday by the Army Corps \nof Engineers. I will not read the whole report, I am happy to say, but \nI want to call attention to the Senate and to the country, as well as \nto the people of Wyoming, what is contained within this report.\n  This report, at a cost of who knows how many taxpayer dollars, says \nsomething I have known and the people of Wyoming have known to be true. \nIt says the Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for the \ncontamination of the water wells of the city of Cheyenne. Now, let me \nclarify. The report does not actually say the words ``we are \nresponsible.'' Washington could never admit its faults so directly. No. \nInstead, the report states that other potential sources of \ncontamination, other potential sources of this trichloroethylene--the \ncontaminant, the chemical that is in our city's wells--it says that \nother potential sources ``may be limited.'' I guess that is \nWashington's way of saying: It was us.\n  The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality and the city of \nCheyenne found evidence of trichloroethylene in the water supply in \n1998--10 years ago. The culprit is a dormant Cold War-era nuclear \nmissile area. It is a missile site and has been there for a long time. \nThe Army Corps of Engineers admits that over 1,800 gallons of this \ncontaminant, TCE, was dumped at the Atlas 4 nuclear missile site each \nyear--each year--of the operation of the missile site, beginning in the \nmid-1960s.\n  Well, the discharge of TCE the Army Corps admits to is a mere 1 \nmile--1 mile--from the water wells of the city of Cheyenne. The Wyoming \nDepartment of Environmental Quality has claimed there is one giant \nplume of TCE emanating from the former nuclear missile site, working \nits way into and then contaminating the city's water wells. The missile \nsite is currently being cleaned up under the Superfund laws by the Army \nCorps of Engineers. Unfortunately, the Army Corps only admits \nculpability for TCE contamination directly emanating from the nuclear \nmissile site. They allege that there is actually a gap between the \nplume they admit to at the nuclear missile site and the one around the \ncity's water wells--1 mile apart.\n  Now, you might think it odd that the Department of Defense, given the \nvolume of this chemical that has been dumped year after year in rural \nWyoming, would not admit that it was the responsible party for \ncontaminating the city's wells. That would just make sense. They would \nsay: Yes, we dumped it here. It is right here, a mile away in the \nwells. It is our fault. No. It would just make sense to us that they \nwould admit it. But, in fact, the Army Corps over the last few years \nhas looked to blame almost anyone else, has looked to blame others than \nto say they are responsible for contaminating the city's wells. Well, \nsuch claims have included that there might have been a train derailment \nand the train might have been carrying TCE into the area. They said it \nmight have been from a nearby oil rig, it might have been from a local \nshooting range. The Army Corps said: Anybody but us.\n  I became involved in this issue after I felt the city of Cheyenne and \nthe Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality were being ignored by \nWashington. As ranking member of the Superfund and Environmental Health \nSubcommittee, I pushed for testing of the ground in that 1-mile area \nbetween the nuclear missile site and the water wells of the city of \nCheyenne. The Army Corps finally agreed to do the testing and said it \nwould also look into the historical use of this chemical in the \nCheyenne area to make sure there was not another responsible party for \nthe contamination.\n  The final results--all 500 pages--were finally released this week. To \nno one's surprise who lives in Wyoming, to no one's surprise who is \nfamiliar with this issue, to no one's surprise but the Army Corps of \nEngineers, the contaminating chemical, TCE, was found in the ground \nbetween the nuclear missile site and the city's water wells, right \nwhere we said it would be. The report also revealed they found no other \npublic records of TCE use in the Cheyenne area for any other reason. It \njust makes sense to us, and the cause is clear. Given these findings, \nit is time for the Army Corps to provide the funding the city needs to \nmanage and to complete the current cleanup efforts.\n  Now, let me be clear. The city of Cheyenne's water is safe. Untold \nthousands of taxpayer dollars have gone to keep TCE out of the water \nsupply. The city of Cheyenne and the State of Wyoming have implemented \nthe effective procedures to protect the folks in Cheyenne. Those \nefforts have been completely successful. But the Army Corps of \nEngineers and the U.S. Government have the responsibility to fund the \ncleanup. They have responsibility to fix the problem, and this report \nsays it is so. It is time to do so.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He has great \nwisdom. It is tempered with a wonderful personality that is most \nstudious and deliberative. Few have done as much to champion the cause \nof our men and women in the Armed Forces of the United States as John \nWarner.\n  This Senator admires him for his sense of fairness, for his mutual \nrespect of all the Members of the Senate. We know there has to be \ncivility in the Senate for it to function. There has to be mutual \nrespect. There has to be respect for the truth. There has to be respect \nfor the dignity of individuals and those Senators' families. All of \nthat is certainly apropos of the senior Senator from Virginia. Over and \nover, I have been in situations with him that could have been \nadversarial. Yet his calm judgment and reason have brought people \ntogether. Of course, that is the admonition of the Good Book: ``Come \nlet us reason together.''\n  Over and over, as I have sought his counsel on matters of some of the \nNation's highest secrets, John Warner has provided the leadership and \nthe clarity, as we have made those decisions, sometimes making those \ndecisions together.\n  So it is with a great reluctance on my part that I see our colleague, \nSenator Warner, retire after a very distinguished and long career. It \nhas been a privilege to serve with John. I will miss him as a \ncolleague. I will miss his leadership, his fairness, and his great \ncapacity as a gentleman of the Senate.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10902-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10902-S10904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY CRISIS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise today to address what I feel \nis an unfortunate omission from our economic rescue strategy to date. \nThis week, we are considering another bailout which would give $15 \nbillion in so-called bridge loans to America's struggling automakers.\n  Now, when we debated a bailout program to protect our Nation's \nfinancial system back in September, we created legislative branch roles \nand executive branch roles. We ultimately passed legislation that \nempowered the Department of the Treasury to invest up to $700 billion. \nDebate was rushed. The Treasury Secretary came to us on a Friday in \nSeptember and told leaders of both parties in both Houses that our \neconomy would collapse if we did not take immediate action. With the \nthreat of immediate financial calamity and the apparent good faith of \nSecretary Paulson, Congress moved quickly to pass the best bill we \ncould. Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut and my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Jack Reed, worked heroically, almost around the clock, \nto negotiate for taxpayer protections and several levels of oversight. \nIn the end, we created a program of congressional and executive roles \nbut no judicial role. We ignored the role that courts can play here or, \nmore correctly, that executive agencies can play when supported by \njudicial or even quasi-judicial due process. We are about to ignore \nthat role again in the auto bailout.\n  Why is this point important? This is important because under our \nAmerican system of government, there are important powers of government \nthat can only be exercised after due process opportunity for a hearing. \nThe famous Supreme Court case of Fuentes v. Shevin is on point. I \nquote:\n\n       The constitutional right to be heard is a basic aspect of \n     the duty of government to follow a fair process of decision-\n     making when it acts to deprive a person of his possessions.\n\n  That is citation 407 U.S. 67 at 82.\n  In other words, some means of restructuring require due process if \nthey involve adjusting people's financial rights and claims. When we \nfail to provide that process, we unilaterally disarm government's \nresponse, taking away its ability to restructure using those means.\n  The price of this repeated omission has been high. Going back before \nwe even got into this current mess, when there was only a subprime \nmortgage problem, Senator Durbin of Illinois proposed a bill that would \nhave empowered bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of a mortgage on a \nperson's primary residence. One needed a due process hearing such as \nthat in order to adjust the rights within that mortgage of the banks \nand the myriad investors who bought strips of that mortgage when it was \ncarved up and sold to the four winds. Our Republican colleagues stymied \nthis provision which we now see could have kept tens of thousands of \nfamilies in their homes. Because the clarity and finality of a court \ndecision on a troubled mortgage was not available, there was little \nalternative to foreclosure, and troubled mortgages, by the tens of \nthousands, cascaded into foreclosure--numbers never before seen in our \nhistory. Our fault. Bad design. And every day we don't get it right, \nevery day we don't pass Senator Durbin's bill, that foreclosure problem \nworsens.\n  Similarly, as part of the $700 billion Wall Street bailout, we could \nhave addressed lavish and indefensible executive compensation by \nproviding for some judicial power to restructure these packages. \nBecause we didn't, these grotesque liabilities remain on the books of \nthe bailed out entities as obligations to their disgraced management. \nAccording to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal, the executive \ndeferred compensation obligations of bailed out Wall Street firms \namount to more than $40 billion. Banks participating in the bailout \nprogram carried these obligations on their books, and the cash from our \nbailout is being used to pay them--or will be used to pay them. \nTaxpayer dollars will end up in the pockets of the scoundrels who \ntanked those firms. I contend we have to find ways in which the court \nsystem, due process, can be brought to bear on this problem. But again, \nthe inaction on that so far is our fault. Bad design. Unilateral \ndisarmament in the face of the Wall Street meltdown.\n  Now we have the auto bailout plan with its provision for a ``car \nczar,'' but once again, lacks a role for those due process powers of \ngovernment. Once we are committed to this deal--once we are in--the \nonly tool we will have at that negotiating table is Uncle Sam's \ncheckbook--that, and the somewhat improbable threat to walk away and \ntank the auto companies after having put $15 billion into them. So now \nwe will have to negotiate about the companies' continuing lavish \nexecutive and board compensation packages and other obligations \nimpeding a fair and rational recovery. As for looking backwards at \npreexisting obligations, as we say in Rhode Island, forget about it. \nThat requires due process. We have created no process to even invoke \ngovernment's power to review those. So the effect of all of this is to \nencourage special interests to play the holdout in the auto \nnegotiations and dare us to tank the companies. It is going to be a \nhigh stakes game of chicken and, no matter who wins, the taxpayers \nlose.\n  We created this ``hold out'' problem by not providing a judicial role \nin the restructuring. We could, for example, give the car czar the \npowers of a judicially appointed conservator or receiver--those are \nroles I have held--and the power to go to court for an order approving \nhis plan or her plan over the objections of any holdouts. If we did \nthat, it would change the bargaining position of the holdouts. This \njudicial due process would allow the strong powers of government that \nrequire due process to be brought to bear on this mess. We do this in a \nlot of different contexts.\n  Bankruptcy courts oversee restructuring all the time and so do other \nquasi-judicial bodies. For example, the FDIC has the power under \ncurrent law to place a troubled bank into receivership and wind it down \nas if in chapter 7, or put it under conservatorship to restructure it \nas if in chapter 11. The bankruptcy courts and the FDIC possess the \ntools necessary to cut through whatever Gordian knots may snarl \nrestructuring plans absent that power.\n\n[[Page S10903]]\n\nThe judicial imprimatur will also increase public confidence in the \nfairness and the propriety of these plans. There is flexibility about \nhow we do this. We don't have to have it be the FDIC. We don't have to \nhave it be a bankruptcy court to recognize the due process powers of \ngovernment.\n  Fuentes v. Shevin again, and I quote:\n\n       Due process tolerates variances in the form of a hearing \n     ``appropriate to the nature of the case,'' and ``depending \n     upon the importance of the interests involved and the nature \n     of the subsequent proceedings, if any.''\n\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize the importance of authorizing \njudicially supervised powers in these bailout plans. I pledge to work \nhard with anyone who wants to achieve this goal. It is vital, I \ncontend, to recognize that directed judicial oversight expands \ngovernment's powers and authorities to do the things the public and the \ncircumstances demand. It gives us a means to unsnarl the foreclosure \nmess on Main Street, to restructure obscene executive compensation on \nWall Street, and to force good-faith negotiations in Detroit.\n\n  We cannot ignore the judicial power in restructuring companies and \nindustries. We must not let that sword sleep in our hands. Times are \nbleak in Detroit, as they are around the country. The automobile \nindustry stands on the brink of collapse, and the jobs of thousands--\nsome say millions--of workers hang in the balance.\n  Michigan shares the sad distinction with my home State of Rhode \nIsland in having the Nation's highest unemployment rate, 9.3 percent, \nin October. Families are struggling in Rhode Island and across the \ncountry. That is the background against which we must consider whether \nto bail out yet another industry. In making such a weighty decision, I \nimplore my colleagues, we must not consider just whether but how we go \nabout doing this.\n  I contend that we should empower our Government to take steps that we \nhave, to date, foreclosed--steps that exercise the power of Government \nthat can be only exercised after due process of law. I hope we consider \nthat.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal \narticle to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [The Wall Street Journal, October 31, 2008]\n\n                    Banks Owe Billions to Executives\n\n                         (By Ellen E. Schultz)\n\n       Financial giants getting injections of federal cash owed \n     their executives more than $40 billion for past years' pay \n     and pensions as of the end of 2007, a Wall Street Journal \n     analysis shows.\n       The government is seeking to rein in executive pay at banks \n     getting federal money, and a leading congressman and a state \n     official have demanded that some of them make clear how much \n     they intend to pay in bonuses this year.\n       But overlooked in these efforts is the total size of debts \n     that financial firms receiving taxpayer assistance previously \n     incurred to their executives, which at some firms exceed what \n     they owe in pensions to their entire work forces.\n       The sums are mostly for special executive pensions and \n     deferred compensation, including bonuses, for prior years. \n     Because the liabilities include stock, they are subject to \n     market fluctuation. Given the stock-market decline of this \n     year, some may have fallen substantially.\n       Some examples: $11.8 billion at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., \n     $8.5 billion at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and $10 billion to \n     $12 billion at Morgan Stanley.\n       Few firms report the size of these debts to their \n     executives. (Goldman is an exception.) In most cases, the \n     Journal calculated them by extrapolating from figures that \n     the firms do have to disclose.\n       Most firms haven't set aside cash or stock for these IOUs. \n     They are a drag on current earnings and when the executives \n     depart, employers have to pay them out of corporate coffers.\n       The practice of incurring corporate IOUs for executives' \n     pensions and past pay is perfectly legal and is common in big \n     business, not limited to financial firms. But liabilities \n     grew especially high in the financial industry, with its \n     tradition of lavish pay.\n       Deferring compensation appeals both to employers, which \n     save cash in the near term, and to executives, who delay \n     taxes and see their deferred-pay accounts grow, sometimes \n     aided by matching contributions. In some cases, firms give \n     top executives high guaranteed returns on these accounts.\n       The liabilities are an essentially hidden obligation. Even \n     when the debts to their executives total in the billions, \n     most companies lump them into ``other liabilities''; only a \n     few then identify amounts attributable to deferred pay.\n       The Journal was able to approximate companies' IOUs, in \n     some cases, by looking at an amount they report as deferred \n     tax assets for ``deferred compensation'' or ``employee \n     benefits and compensation.'' This figure shows how much a \n     company expects to reap in tax benefits when it ultimately \n     pays the executives what it owes them.\n       J.P. Morgan, for instance, reported a $3.4 billion deferred \n     tax asset for employee benefits in 2007. Assuming a 40% \n     combined federal and state tax rate--and backing out \n     obligations for retiree health and other items--implies the \n     bank owed about $8.2 billion to its own executives. A person \n     familiar with the matter confirmed the estimate.\n       Applying the same technique to Citigroup Inc. yields \n     roughly a $5 billion IOU, primarily for restricted stock of \n     executives and eligible employees. Someone familiar with the \n     matter confirmed the estimate.\n       The Treasury is infusing $25 billion apiece into J.P. \n     Morgan and Citigroup as it seeks to get credit flowing. In \n     return, the federal government is getting preferred stock in \n     the banks and warrants to buy common shares. The Treasury is \n     injecting $125 billion into nine big banks and making a like \n     amount available for other banks that apply.\n       It's imposing some restrictions on how they pay top \n     executives in the future, such as curtailing new ``golden \n     parachutes'' and barring a tax deduction for any one person's \n     pay above $500,000. But the rules won't affect what the banks \n     already owe their executives or make these opaque debts more \n     transparent.\n       Asked about the Journal's calculation, the Treasury said, \n     ``Every bank that accepts money through the Capital Purchase \n     Program must first agree to the compensation restrictions \n     passed by Congress just last month--and every bank that is \n     receiving money has done so.''\n       Bear Stearns Cos., the first financial firm the U.S. \n     backstopped, owed its executives $1.7 billion for accrued \n     employee compensation and benefits at the start of the year, \n     according to regulatory filings. When Bear Stearns ran into \n     trouble after investing heavily in risky mortgage-backed \n     securities, the government stepped in, arranging a sale of \n     the firm and taking responsibility for up to $29 billion of \n     its losses.\n       The buyer, J.P. Morgan, says it will honor the debt to Bear \n     Stearns executives, which it said is shrunken because much of \n     it was in stock that sank in value.\n       J.P. Morgan will also honor deferred-pay accounts at \n     another institution it took over, Washington Mutual Inc. It \n     couldn't be determined how big this IOU is. J.P. Morgan's \n     move will leave the WaMu executives better off than holders \n     of that ailing thrift's debt and preferred stock, who are \n     expected to see little recovery. J.P. Morgan's share of the \n     federal capital injection is $25 billion.\n       Obligations for executive pay are large for a number of \n     reasons. Even as companies have complained about the cost of \n     retiree benefits, they have been awarding larger pay and \n     pensions to executives. At Goldman, for example, the $11.8 \n     billion obligation primarily for deferred executive \n     compensation dwarfed the liability for its broad-based \n     pension plan for all employees. That was just $399 million, \n     and fully funded with set-aside assets.\n       The deferred-compensation programs for executives are like \n     401(k) plans on steroids. They create hypothetical \n     ``accounts'' into which executives can defer salaries, \n     bonuses and restricted stock awards. For top officers, \n     employers often enhance the deferred pay with matching \n     contributions, and even assign an interest rate at which the \n     hypothetical account grows.\n       Often, it is a generous rate. At Freddie Mac, executives \n     earned 9.25% on their deferred-pay accounts in 2007, \n     regulatory filings show--a better deal than regular employees \n     of the mortgage buyer could get in a 401(k). Since all this \n     money is tax-deferred, the Treasury, and by extension the \n     U.S. taxpayer, subsidizes the accounts.\n       In addition, because assets are rarely set aside for \n     executive IOUs, they have a greater impact on firms' earnings \n     than rank-and-file pension plans, which by law must be \n     funded.\n       Bank of America Corp.'s $1.3 billion liability for \n     supplemental executive pensions reduced earnings by $104 \n     million in 2007, filings show. By contrast, the bank's \n     regular pension plan is overfunded, and the surplus helped \n     the plan contribute $32 million to earnings last year.\n       While disclosing its liability for executive pensions, the \n     bank doesn't disclose its IOU executives' deferred \n     compensation, and it couldn't be calculated. The bank's share \n     of the federal capital injection is $25 billion.\n       Bank of America has agreed to acquire Merrill Lynch & Co. \n     Merrill is a rare example of a firm that has set aside assets \n     for its deferred-pay obligation: $2.2 billion, matching the \n     liability. Morgan Stanley also says its liability for \n     executives' deferred pay is largely funded.\n       To be sure, deferred-compensation accounts can shrink. \n     Those of lower-level executives usually track a mutual fund, \n     and decline if it does. Often the accounts include restricted \n     shares, which also may lose value, especially this year. To \n     the extent financial-firm executives were being paid in \n     restricted stock, many have lost huge amounts of wealth in \n     this year's stock-market plunge.\n       The value of Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack's \n     deferred-compensation account declined by $1.3 million in \n     fiscal 2007, to $19.9 million; much of it was in company \n     shares. Mr. Mack didn't accept a bonus in 2007.\n\n[[Page S10904]]\n\n       Executives can even lose their deferred pay altogether if \n     their employer ends up in bankruptcy court. When Lehman \n     Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy last month, most \n     executives became unsecured creditors. The government didn't \n     come to Lehman's aid.\n       In assessing liabilities, the Journal examined federal \n     year-end 2007 filings by the first nine banks to get capital \n     injections, plus six other banks and financial firms \n     embroiled in the financial crisis. In many cases, the firms \n     didn't report enough data to estimate their obligations to \n     executives. As for identifying amounts due individual \n     executives, company filings provided a look at only the top \n     few, and not a full picture of what they were owed.\n       Just as banks aren't the only financial firms getting \n     federal aid amid the crisis, they aren't the only ones facing \n     scrutiny of their compensation programs.\n       Struggling insurer American International Group Inc. agreed \n     to suspend payment of deferred pay for some former top \n     executives pending a review by New York state Attorney \n     General Andrew Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo is also demanding to know \n     this year's bonus plans for the first nine banks getting \n     federal cash, as is House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry \n     Waxman.\n       Among the payouts AIG agreed not to make are disbursements \n     from a $600 million bonus pool for executives of a unit that \n     ran up huge losses with complex financial products. AIG also \n     is suspending $19 million of deferred compensation for Martin \n     Sullivan, whom AIG ousted as chief executive in June. His \n     successor as CEO, Robert Willumstad, who left when the U.S. \n     stepped in to rescue AIG in September, has said he's forgoing \n     $22 million in severance because he wasn't there long enough \n     to execute his strategy for AIG.\n       However, the giant insurer--whose total liability for its \n     executives' deferred pay couldn't be calculated--says most of \n     the managers will receive the compensation. ``Of course, \n     we'll be looking at all these to make sure they're consistent \n     with the requirement of the program,'' said spokesman \n     Nicholas Ashooh.\n       AIG isn't eligible for the government's capital-injection \n     plan, since it's not a bank, but it's getting plenty of U.S. \n     aid of another sort. The Treasury has made $123 billion of \n     credit available, a little more than two-thirds of which MG \n     has borrowed so far.\n       Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also don't get in on the \n     capital-injection plan for banks. But under a federal \n     ``conservatorship,'' the Treasury agreed to provide each with \n     up to $100 billion of capital if needed. In return, the \n     government got preferred shares in the firms and the right to \n     acquire nearly 80% of them.\n       Their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, says \n     it will bar golden-parachute severance payouts to the \n     mortgage buyers' ousted chief executives. The executives \n     remain eligible for their pensions.\n       Fannie Mae had a liability of roughly $500 million for \n     executive pensions and deferred compensation at the end of \n     2007, judging by the size of its deferred tax assets. A \n     spokesman for the firm wouldn't discuss the estimate or \n     whether the executives would get the assets.\n       At Freddie Mac, most will. ``Deferred compensation belongs \n     to the officers who earned it,'' said Shawn Flaherty, a \n     spokeswoman.\n       Indeed, in September Freddie Mac made its deferred-\n     compensation plan more flexible, allowing executives to \n     receive their money earlier than initially spelled out. \n     ``Officers were nervous about market changes,'' said Ms. \n     Flaherty. ``We wanted a retention tool for top talent.''\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I know we have an important piece of \nlegislation that we are going to vote on today. I desperately want to \nsupport that legislation. I wish to ask first and most importantly if \nanyone has the information as to whether the CEOs of Wells Fargo or \nBank of America or Citigroup have taken private jets in the last month. \nHas anyone asked the CEOs of Citigroup, Wells Fargo--all of these \nfinancial companies--to take a cut in compensation? Has anyone asked \nabout their workers and how much money they make and whether they are \noverpaid and whether they are competitive with the salaries of \ncommunity bankers across the country?\n  Every one of the institutions I named has gotten $15 billion or more \nof taxpayer money. Think about that for a minute. Citigroup has gotten \n$50 billion. Have we checked on their private jets? Have we checked on \ntheir CEO compensation? Have we checked on their work rules and whether \ntheir workers are given enough flexibility?\n  It is unbelievable to me that we are setting this double standard. \nThe thousands of jobs and families who build great American cars do not \ndeserve this incredible hypocrisy in terms of the different treatment \nthey are getting. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.\n  I say let's call in those CEOs of those big companies that have \ngotten more than $15 billion of our money and ask them when they are \ngoing to take a dollar in pay, ask them if they got here on a corporate \njet, ask them if their workers have cut their pay to $14 an hour, ask \nthem if they have talked about cutting their pension costs and their \nhealth care costs. Until we do that, we ought to be quiet about the \nAmerican autoworkers, and we ought to be quiet about these companies \nthat have reduced fixed costs, that have agreed to sell corporate jets, \nthat have agreed to cut executive compensation.\n  I want to support this bill on behalf of manufacturing in the United \nStates of America, on behalf of wonderful, hard-working families in \nMissouri. However, there is one problem that has arisen, and that is, \nunfortunately, in this bill right now, as written, is a provision to \nincrease the pay of Federal judges. Wrong time, wrong place.\n  We have unemployment numbers today that show we have the highest \nunemployment in this country we have had in decades. We have families \nall over this Nation who are scared today, who are not buying Christmas \npresents. Federal judges get lifetime appointments and they never take \na dime's cut in pay. They die with the same salary they have today. My \nphone is ringing off the hook from people who want to be Federal \njudges. I am having to have staff work overtime to handle all the phone \ncalls I am getting from people who think there may be a Federal \njudgeship opening in the eastern district of Missouri and how badly \naccomplished, wonderful, smart lawyers want that Federal appointment.\n  We are not hurting for qualified applicants for the Federal \njudiciary. Is it fair that they have not gotten a cost-of-living \nincrease like every other Federal employee? Probably not. But you know \nwhat is a lot more unfair is to give somebody with a lifetime \nappointment, great health care, no cut in pay when they actually \nretire, what is unfair is to give them a pay raise on this day in this \nbill at this time. It is not the right time. And if it is in the bill, \nI regrettably will have to vote against this legislation because I feel \nso strongly that it sends the wrong message to the United States of \nAmerica at this scary moment in our economic history.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the bill that has been filed by the \nchairman\n\n[[Page S10905]]\n\nof the Banking Committee would do for the U.S. domestic auto industry \nwhat governments around the world are doing: providing emergency \nassistance to their auto industries because their survival is \njeopardized by a worldwide recession which has resulted in plunging \nauto sales.\n  That global recession is not the making of the auto industries around \nthe world, including our own domestic industry. Past mistakes of the \nbig three are not the cause of the worldwide recession and resulting \ncredit freeze. People who want to make large purchases, such as \nautomobiles, are unable to get credit, and 90 percent of the people who \nbuy automobiles buy on credit. Many people simply are afraid to make \nlarge-scale financial commitments in these scary economic times. So the \nU.S. domestic auto industry is not alone in needing loans to make it \nthrough the global economic calamity we are in. Look at the rest of the \nauto-producing world. Here are some headlines in the news recently:\n\n  ``Facing a Slowdown, China's Auto Industry Presses for a Bailout From \nBeijing.''\n  Brazil. ``In Brazil, Whiplash on Assembly Lines.'' ``The Government \nstepped in with a $3.5 billion aid package for the auto industry by \nfunding banks to boost the amount of credit available for car loans.''\n  ``European Carmakers Get $50 Billion in Aid.''\n  ``European governments poised to help their automakers.''\n  ``Automakers in other nations get more government help. Requests for \naid made worldwide''--another headline.\n  These are all headlines in papers across the country.\n  Reuters, ``Spain to support car industry.''\n  ``France's stimulus plan includes carmakers.''\n  ``Portugal rolls out loan.''\n  ``Auto industry faces massive job losses without aid,'' according to \nthe chairman of one of the largest automobile industries--not one of \nthe big three.\n  Now, why are nations around the world stepping in to support their \nauto industries? It is because of the drastic decline in sales across \nthe industries around the world--not just domestic, not just the big \nthree--leaving no alternative to every other auto-producing country and \nits government but to support its industry. Hyundai sales are down 40 \npercent; Toyota sales are down 34 percent; Honda, down 32 percent; \nNissan, down 42 percent; Mercedes, down 38 percent. These are not the \nbig three. These are automobile makers around the country that are in \nthe same situation as the big three. But the difference, so far, is \nthat other governments are stepping in. We have not yet stepped in to \nsupport our industry.\n  In arguing against these loans for the big three, some continue to \ndescribe the domestic companies of the 1970s and 1980s when fuel \nefficiency was not high on the list of the big three as big three goals \nor achievements. Some would have us ignore dramatic gains in quality \nand vastly greater numbers of fuel-efficient vehicles now being offered \nby the big three. In the area of quality, big three autos are equal to \nor better than their foreign competitors. For example, the J.D. Power \nInitial Quality Study scores the overall quality of Buick, Cadillac, \nChevrolet, Ford, Mercury, Pontiac, and Lincoln--these are objective, \noutside studies on quality for those American brands, Buick, Cadillac, \nChevrolet, Ford, Mercury, Pontiac, and Lincoln--as high or higher than \nAcura, Audi, BMW, Honda, Nissan, VW, and Volvo. J.D. Power rates the \nChevrolet Malibu as the highest quality midsize sedan on the market, \nand both the Malibu and the Ford Fusion score better than the Honda \nAccord or the Toyota Camry.\n  On the fuel efficiency side, here are some facts that hopefully \ncolleagues will consider. Long before the credit crisis hit, GM laid \nthe groundwork to offer 15 hybrids by 2012. Thanks to investments they \nhave already made, GM already has 20 models that achieve 30 miles per \ngallon or better--twice the number of its nearest competitor. All the \nbig three are working to ensure that at least 50 percent of their \nAmerican production is capable of running on biofuels by 2012. Domestic \nautomakers produce numerous cars that have equal or better fuel \nefficiency than their foreign competitors. And again, the most fuel \nefficient Chevy Malibu gets 33 miles per gallon on the highway, which \nis 2 miles better than the best Honda Accord. The most fuel efficient \nFord Focus has the same highway fuel efficiency ratings as the most \nfuel efficient Toyota Corolla.\n  In the area of productivity, Chrysler tied Toyota as the most \nproductive automaker in North America this year, according to the \nHarbor Report on Manufacturing, which measures the amount of work done \nper employee. Eight of the ten most productive vehicle assembly plants \nin North America belong to Chrysler, Ford, or General Motors.\n  Now, there are also some who want to ignore the reduction in benefits \nthat have been taken already by UAW workers and retirees. In the \ncollective bargaining agreements negotiated in 2005 and 2007, the UAW, \nalong with GM, Ford, and Chrysler, achieved billions of dollars in cost \nsavings and set the companies on the course to bring labor costs, \nincluding benefits, in line with their foreign competitors in the \nUnited States by 2012. Wages were cut and pension and health care \nbenefits were greatly reduced as well.\n  The UAW is taking responsibility for managing its own retiree health \ncare benefits beginning in 2010 by setting up its own voluntary \nemployee beneficiary association, or VEBA. The VEBA plan will transfer \nresponsibilities for health care benefits for existing employees from \ncompanies to an independent trust. This eliminates half of the \ncompanies' liabilities for retirees' health care, with billions of \ndollars of savings.\n  The memory of mistakes made decades ago lingers and remains the \nimpression that many have of the big three despite all the facts I have \njust outlined. Beliefs are always hard to change. So the facts I have \njust shared about improved quality and more fuel efficient vehicles and \nalternative-energy vehicles being produced by the big three may not be \nreadily accepted by people who have beliefs that are to the contrary. \nBut one fact is indisputable and will hopefully influence some who are \nopen to argument: Auto industries around the world are seeking the \nsupport of their governments through loans and other methods and are \ngetting it. I went through that series of headlines, from Brazil to \nEurope, all the way to China. The Chinese automobile industry is asking \nfor loans from the Chinese Government. No other auto-producing country \nthat I know of in the world is failing to act to make sure its industry \nis alive when the deep global recession is over, and we shouldn't \neither.\n  There is also a national security aspect to the American auto \nindustry, and I wish to spend some time on this because there was \ntestimony that was prepared for delivery to the Banking Committee when \nthey met on this subject by the Director of the U.S. Army Tank \nAutomotive Research, Development and Engineering Center, called TARDEC. \nSo this is the Army R and engineering center. It is located in Macomb \nCounty, MI. TARDEC develops, integrates, and sustains the right \ntechnology solutions for all of our manned and unmanned Department of \nDefense ground vehicle systems and combat support systems in order to \nimprove force effectiveness and provide superior capabilities for the \nfuture forces of this country.\n  The Director of TARDEC is Grace Bochenek. Because of the security \nimportance of what I am going to relate, I am going to read from her \nprepared testimony, and this is going to take some time. I am going to \nread from her prepared testimony, though it wasn't actually delivered. \nIt ended up that they had too many witnesses, and so she wasn't \ninvited, but this testimony is a compelling story of the continuing \nrelationship between the big three, the domestic auto industry, and our \nU.S. Army vehicle program.\n  We all look back--some of us nostalgically--to what Detroit did \nduring World War II. That is the past. There is a present which is \ncritically important in terms of the security of this country. Some \nhave pointed out the need to have a manufacturing base in order to \nquickly expand in the case of need, and that is a powerful argument--a \nnational security argument for keeping our big three auto industry \naround the way other countries keep their auto industries around. Some \nother colleagues\n\n[[Page S10906]]\n\nhave pointed out in some detail the relationship between the suppliers \nof the big three and the suppliers of vehicles for the Army and how \nmuch trouble those suppliers would be in--these are Army vehicle \nsuppliers--if the big three did not survive, and that is another \npowerful national security argument. But I am going to focus on what \nGrace Bochenek focused on, the Director of TARDEC, which is the \nrelationships, the synergies that exist between the big three now and \nthe Army in terms of current products and current technologies which \nare inserted into our vehicles and future technologies which are being \ndeveloped as we speak.\n  I am going to quote from her testimony, and this will all be quotes \nexcept where I insert my own words, which I will try to make clear. But \nthis will be a long quote, for those who are listening to this \ntestimony and, hopefully, reading it.\n\n       The synergies between TARDEC and the U.S. automotive \n     industry and the collective challenges we face. TARDEC's \n     connection to the automotive industry dates back to 1947, \n     when the Tank Automotive Components Laboratories, now known \n     as TARDEC, was established. The level of cooperation between \n     the Army and the auto industry was strengthened by the \n     Secretary of the Army's charter of the National Automotive \n     Center, NAC, in 1992 to champion the development of dual-use \n     automotive technologies and their application to military \n     ground vehicles. Today, the NAC remains the connective piece \n     and continues to engage through many different mechanisms to \n     leverage the capabilities, skills, and facilities of the \n     automotive industry.\n\n  Referring to the Department of Defense and the domestic automobile \nindustry, she continued:\n\n       For the past 70 years, we have shared common research \n     goals, leveraged investments in technology, mutually \n     benefitted from those technical developments, and \n     collectively owned the responsibility for our Nation's next \n     generation of automotive engineers and scientists. \n     Technologies may have changed, but the importance of working \n     together to collectively drive innovation has not. The Army's \n     specific challenges are as follows: First, significantly \n     increasing fuel efficiency to reduce the logistics burden on \n     our troops. In some cases, fuel is 70 percent of the bulk \n     tonnage that we take to war. Second, substantially increasing \n     electric power available on the battlefield and developing \n     the next generation of electronic warfare tools. Third, \n     increasing soldier protection through the development and \n     application of advanced light-weight material solutions. \n     Fourth, utilizing sensor technology throughout our vehicle \n     platforms to collect prognostic data allowing for overall \n     improved reliability and reduced sustainment costs. Fifth, \n     engaging the enemy without putting soldiers in harm's way \n     through the fielding of unmanned systems.\n\n  Another word for that is robotics.\n  Continuing now with Grace Bochenek's prepared testimony.\n\n       Often the only difference between military and commercial \n     automotive technologies is a matter of scale both with regard \n     to the market (quantity) and component durability (military \n     specifications). The goals and the technologies leading to \n     their accomplishment, however, remain very similar. Our \n     motivations may differ, but our technological goals are \n     shared ones. Both the Army and the automotive industry seek \n     to achieve technical advances in the areas of power and \n     energy, vehicle intelligence, robotics, safety, advanced \n     lightweight materials and leading-edge manufacturing methods.\n\n  Then she goes into examples in each of those areas, where there is a \nworking together, a cooperation, a synergy between the American \nautomobile industry and the Army vehicle program. She continues:\n\n       In 1997, TARDEC began a commercially based tactical truck \n     program focused on leveraging GM, Ford and Chrysler's \n     commercial truck platforms to meet some of the military's \n     light tactical vehicle requirements. Chrysler and GM provided \n     hybrid electric vehicles that included start-stop operation \n     and vehicle exportable power providing TARDEC with \n     information critical to defining future requirements.\n       A Cooperative Research & Development Agreement (CRADA) \n     between Ford and TARDEC launched the development of a thermal \n     management software modeling tool. This further matured under \n     multiple Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts \n     utilizing tri-service investment. The dual use software \n     produced has been fully commercialized and is now sold \n     worldwide by one of the SBIR, recipients, resulting in a new \n     Michigan business with revenues of about $10M per year. \n     Ford's initial investment was absolutely critical in the \n     development of this world class product the application of \n     which has also become the Army, Navy, and Air Force standard. \n     This is an example of how an Automotive OEM--TARDEC \n     partnership was able to leverage resources to create jobs and \n     develop useful technologies.\n       TARDEC continues to partner with automotive industry OEMs \n     and suppliers on advanced powertrain technologies including \n     fuel cell technologies, power and thermal management, and \n     advanced automotive batteries all of which are necessary for \n     the next generation of military systems. TARDEC leverages \n     fuel cell developments primarily through the automotive \n     supplier base with companies such as Ballard, Delphi, and \n     United Technologies. TARDEC also has a longstanding \n     relationship with General Motors in the demonstration and \n     evaluation of light duty commercial fuel cell vehicles. This \n     program has allowed TARDEC to assess multiple generations of \n     fuel cell technologies.\n       Batteries are critical to implementing advanced automotive \n     powertrains. As such, there is a growing body of \n     collaborative work between TARDEC, the automotive OEMs, and \n     their suppliers. The cornerstone of TARDEC's efforts in this \n     area is the development of manufacturing technologies needed \n     to mass-produce high power and energy density Lithium-Ion \n     (Li-Ion) batteries--particularly critical for the Army's \n     Future Combat Systems platforms. Additionally, there are many \n     ongoing military battery technology development efforts that \n     leverage emerging automotive battery technology providers \n     such as Al23, AltairNano, Boston Power, GS Yuasa, \n     Inanovation, EnerDel, EnerSys, Firefly, Kokam America, \n     Quallion, and SAFT America. With the help of the Automotive \n     OEMs and the Department of Energy, TARDEC is escalating \n     efforts to define the boundaries for dual-use commercial and \n     military applications of advanced battery technologies \n     through the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium. Additionally, \n     General Motors is supporting TARDEC advanced battery \n     requirements through direct, individual collaboration through \n     a CRADA and an additional newly awarded contract.\n       TARDEC and the automotive OEMs have both identified \n     advanced automotive batteries as a key area for collaboration \n     going forward. In the support of expanding collaboration in \n     advanced batteries, TARDEC has worked with the automotive \n     OEMs and suppliers of battery technologies to assess the \n     scope of effort around establishing a robust, diverse \n     manufacturing base for advanced automotive batteries. This \n     effort recently culminated in a two-day Battery Summit, which \n     involved over 70 participants from industry and government. \n     Discussions covered the technology, policy and manufacturing \n     implications of having a domestic base for the manufacture of \n     advanced batteries. TARDEC intends to continue to work with \n     key stakeholders to identify near term opportunities in the \n     area.\n\n\n                          Vehicle Intelligence\n\n       The Army faces high operating and support costs in its \n     aging fleet of vehicles. Currently the Army reduces this \n     heavy cost burden through periodic scheduled inspections and \n     sustainment efforts. To further reduce this cost burden, the \n     Army must move towards an intelligent vehicle architecture.\n       Both the Army and the automotive industry have vested \n     interest in enhancing their platforms by providing predictive \n     maintenance enhancements through prognostic capabilities. \n     This requires equipping vehicles with computing devices, \n     sensors, middleware, and wireless infrastructure. Through \n     these enabling technologies, vehicle intelligence is made \n     possible. This could ultimately enhance operational readiness \n     and reduce lifecycle maintenance costs for ground vehicle \n     platforms by reducing the heavy cost burden of periodic \n     scheduled inspections and automating the supply chain to \n     proactively provision for part replacements to optimize the \n     maintenance repair process.\n       Vehicle intelligence is also an enabling technology for \n     Condition Based Maintenance and (vehicle) Health Monitoring \n     technologies. It is related to existing developments in the \n     commercial automotive industry such as the installation of \n     electronic control units (ECU) and electronic control modules \n     (ECM), computing devices, and sensors. These devices \n     facilitate diagnostic analysis at the vehicle subsystem \n     level. This in-vehicle network provides the ability to \n     diagnose such components as the powertrain, ABS, and critical \n     safety systems. GM Diagnostics has taken this a step further \n     by enabling cellular transmission of data off platform for \n     off-board analysis and status updates through their OnStar \n     system. The Army is working with commercial automotive \n     partners to develop this technology for military use via \n     secured communication pipelines.\n\n  Robotics--now she addresses robotics in her prepared testimony. I am \ngoing into this at some length because what has not been focused on \nenough in this debate is the security implication of the failure of the \nbig three. There has been a lot of discussion about why it is essential \nthat we not allow the big three to go under in terms of this economy. \nBut what has not yet been focused on specifically, other than general \nstatements about the connection, the current and future connection, is \nthe essential synergy between the big three and the Army particularly \nbut also the military in general.\n  People's minds tend to go back and say that was all World War II, \nthat was all the ``arsenal of democracy,'' and yes, it was, and we are \nproud of it. But\n\n[[Page S10907]]\n\nit is also 2008, 2010, 2015, 2020. What kind of equipment our troops \nwill have will depend upon whether we have the kind of connection \nbetween our military and our commercial worlds. In the area of \nvehicles, to disconnect that connection, to rip it apart, to allow the \nbig three to go under, has a massive negative security impact on this \ncountry and on the well-being and survival of America's troops.\n  She goes on:\n\n\n                       robotics, unmanned systems\n\n       The U.S. Army has a long history of working with the \n     automotive industry on the development of enabling \n     technologies for manned and unmanned systems. Unmanned \n     systems are key resources for our fighting men and women in \n     the Global War on Terrorism.\n       Many of the key technologies currently used on ground \n     robots have their start in cooperative programs between the \n     U.S. Army and the Big 3 Automotive and their tier suppliers. \n     The Army and the automotive companies have several aligned \n     activities in unmanned systems. For example, the Army has \n     several overriding objectives we are trying to achieve for \n     the development and deployment of future unmanned vehicle \n     systems. Primary among these goals are Safe Operations (Safe \n     Ops) and Total Situational Awareness (SA) around the \n     vehicles, necessary because a robot operates by sensing the \n     environment around it at any given moment. Safe Ops and 360 \n     degree SA are also critical for the safe operation of \n     passenger cars on automated highways, which means our goals \n     are aligned perfectly with the programs in the auto industry.\n       Recently, both GM and Ford participated in the series of \n     DARPA Autonomous Vehicle Grand Challenges. The 1st Grand \n     Challenge was held at the California Motor Speedway and it \n     tested the ability of vehicles to move autonomously over \n     structured roads. The 2nd Grand Challenge was a 170 mile \n     cross-country road race in the deserts of Nevada. The 3rd and \n     final challenge, called the DARPA Urban Challenge (DUC), was \n     designed to push the state-of-the-art in autonomous \n     navigation in urban environments, where each competitor had \n     to obey the rules of the road and contend with other robots \n     and driven cars. Many of these robust automotive sensing \n     methodologies are being transitioned to Army programs for \n     integration into both manned and unmanned systems.\n       In every one of these competitions both Ford and GM \n     partnered with leading universities in the U.S. to put \n     together winning teams that finished in the top 5 percent of \n     race finishers (the GM-Carnegie-Mellon team won the DUC in \n     2007). The close coupling of robotic sensors, actuators and \n     intelligence was enhanced by the collaboration of automotive \n     engineers at the OEMs.\n\n  Then she goes on with her description of safety issues.\n\n       There are multiple overlapping safety goals between the \n     commercial automotive industry and the military ground \n     vehicle fleet. Just as injury risk mitigation and thorough \n     modeling and simulation of technologies is important to the \n     commercial automotive manufacturers; these precautions must \n     be taken to reduce the impact to our Soldiers, Sailors, \n     Airmen, and Marines.\n       Automotive industry OEMs and key suppliers have worked with \n     TARDEC in the development of advanced modeling and simulation \n     efforts to characterize occupant impact during rollover and \n     side impact crashes. TARDEC recently developed ground-\n     breaking full vehicle underbody blast models and \n     methodologies to both accurately predict occupant injury \n     during an energetic event such as a mine/IED blast, and to \n     develop new countermeasures. This effort would not have been \n     possible without heavy leveraging of automotive tools and \n     methodologies from the automotive crashworthiness area. \n     TARDEC's commercial partners have also been critical in \n     advanced technology product development, testing and \n     validation, design studies, and developmental tests. Finally \n     TARDEC relies on the commercial partners for prototyping and \n     large quantity manufacturing capabilities.\n\n  Advanced lightweight materials is the next subject that she took up \nin her prepared testimony.\n\n       One of TARDEC's mandates is to research, develop, engineer, \n     and to leverage lean, agile, advanced manufacturing \n     technologies used by the U.S. Auto Industry, Academia, and \n     other segments of the U.S. Industrial Base. This is \n     accomplished through partnerships and contracts with \n     manufacturers, suppliers, and universities, taking advantage \n     of manufacturing capabilities developed to service the high \n     volume needs of the auto industry and adapt the technologies \n     for manufacturing the low volume production of military \n     components.\n       With the auto industry leading the charge, TARDEC is \n     pursuing several advanced manufacturing processes such as \n     friction stir welding, laser additive and subtractive \n     manufacturing, flexible manufacturing cells using robotics, \n     and water-based environmentally safe painting processes.\n\n  Then she addresses automotive expertise, knowledge, and education.\n\n       To maintain technological superiority now and in the \n     future, we need top quality scientists and automotive \n     engineers in our workforce. Alongside the automotive \n     industry, we have always had a shared commitment and felt the \n     collective responsibility to develop the next generation of \n     engineers, and recognized the challenge to do so.\n       TARDEC has long recognized that a scientifically and \n     technologically literate citizenry is our Nation's best hope \n     for a diverse, talented, and productive workforce. To achieve \n     this goal, we have partnered with the automotive industry and \n     universities to develop curriculum that will benefit both \n     TARDEC and the American automotive original equipment \n     manufacturers.\n       We have also been able to address this challenge through \n     our Automotive Research Center, which has created ways for us \n     to partner with universities and allow students the \n     opportunity to develop and work on relevant automotive \n     engineering challenges.\n       Over the years, the automotive industry has made \n     significant contributions to the Army through technology \n     exchange processes available in the ARC [which is the \n     Automotive Research Center]. And in recent years, an \n     increased emphasis on research involving high mileage, low \n     polluting vehicles, as well as the new high technology needs \n     for large trucks, off-road vehicles and robots has provided \n     invaluable data and resources for us towards the Army's long \n     term transformation goals and objectives.\n       In 2007 and 2008, TARDEC supported 52 ARC research projects \n     spanning Power, Mobility, Survivability, Modeling and \n     Simulation technology areas. Ford, Chrysler and General \n     Motors and at least 12 Tier-1 suppliers provided their \n     resources and expertise towards 36 of the 52 research \n     projects. The remaining projects had industry involvement \n     from Tier-2 and Tier-3 suppliers such as large software \n     companies, industry consultants and automotive small \n     businesses.\n       The fact remains [and I will conclude with this] that the \n     need for partnerships and the consistent leveraging of \n     resources is critical for continued innovation, technological \n     breakthroughs. American automotive original equipment \n     manufacturers partnership with TARDEC in events such as [then \n     she lists a whole lot of events] inspires young engineers to \n     consider careers in math and science and helps to develop \n     many needed automotive skill with applicability in DOD's \n     ``real'' workforce environments.\n       Automotive industry support has been crucial in developing \n     the educational infrastructure that has allowed the \n     development of an automotive engineering talent base here in \n     the United States. And that talent base will be central to \n     future efforts to create a safer Nation and a robust \n     manufacturing environment.\n       At this time, when we have to [these are her last words] at \n     this time, when we have to break the dependency on foreign \n     oil, provide energy security for the Nation, and increase \n     soldier protection, it becomes even more critical, [even more \n     critical] to leverage investments, exchange technical ideas \n     to drive innovation, and provide the breakthroughs that are \n     necessary to maintain the dominance of the American military.\n\n  I very much appreciate the time that I have taken to share with this \nbody the statement of the head of the organization in the Army which is \nresponsible for the technologies in current vehicles and future \nvehicles.\n  I have done this because there is kind of yet the unstated critical \nneed for the survival of the big three. The stakes for our economy \nnationally are huge. The failure of the big three would send a tsunami \nthrough this already battered economy.\n  Millions of workers would lose their jobs. Dealers in every town and \non every Main Street are already reeling from the economy's plunge. \nAutomotive component suppliers, who are in fully half our States, are \non the knife's edge already, waiting for us to act.\n  Men and women who work for steel mills and textile factories and \nglass factories and computer chip factories are waiting and hoping.\n  The financial industry would be at risk as well. A collapsed auto \nindustry would lead to defaults on over $1 billion in corporate bonds, \ncredit default swaps and other financial instruments tied to the auto \nindustry and could send the stock market into another, deeper tailspin. \nMajor additional damage to U.S. financial institution balance sheets \nwould result, throwing our credit markets into even deeper turmoil.\n  Despite these facts, there are still some who say, ``let them go \nbankrupt, let them go under,'' even though 1 in 10 jobs in this country \nare tied to the auto industry. In addition to hoping that they will ask \nthemselves why no other government is allowing that to happen to their \nauto industry, I would also hope they would listen to some experts on \nthe subject of bankruptcy for the auto industry.\n  A recent report released by J.P. Morgan titled, ``Cost of the \nAlternative,'' described the scenario where one or\n\n[[Page S10908]]\n\nmore of the Big Three are left to file for bankruptcy as ``Credit \nCrisis Part II.'' It indicated that unemployment would shoot up by 2 \npercent if one of the Big Three failed, and this failure scenario would \nrequire the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation to take over more \nthan $100 billion in obligations that the Big Three currently hold. It \nnoted that Ford and GM and their financial arms ``comprise over 10% of \nthe high-yield bond market and the auto sector represents one of the \nlargest sectors in leverage finance for banks.''\n  Another recent report by the Anderson Economic Group and BBK \ncalculated the costs in the first year following the failure of two of \nthe Big Three. Such a scenario would cost States $12 billion in tax \nrevenues; it would cost the Federal Government $40 billion in income \nand Social Security taxes, and it would cost an additional $8 billion \nin unemployment insurance and $5 billion in significantly increased \ncosts to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation. The report \nindicates a high risk that inaction by Congress would result in a \npermanent shift of manufacturing jobs out of the United States and a \ndependence on foreign technology.\n  Mr. President, these are risks we cannot take. We must pass this \nlegislation. Without this legislation, one or more of the Big Three \nwill likely collapse in the coming weeks. The U.S. taxpayers would \nprovide a bridge loan to avoid this catastrophe under this bill, but \nwith important protections for their investment, including stock \nwarrants for the Government; limits on excessive executive \ncompensation; a prohibition on golden parachutes; and a prohibition on \npayments of dividends until the loans are fully repaid. And the so-\ncalled auto czar has the ultimate power under this legislation to \nenforce compliance with the long-term plans of the auto companies that \naccept these loans: he can call or cancel the loans if he disapproves \nthe auto companies' restructuring plans.\n  We cannot afford to further destabilize Wall Street, and we cannot \nafford to allow millions of jobs on Main Streets in communities across \nthe country to disappear. The domino effect of failure would ripple \nacross our entire Nation and add untold suffering to an already dire \nsituation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation.\n  As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I wanted to focus on an \naspect of this debate that has not achieved adequate attention. That is \nthe tight, important connection between our domestic auto industry and \nthe future security of this Nation and our men and women in uniform.\n  We have no greater responsibility than that. That factor, that \nsynergy, that relationship, that connection, is an essential component \nof this debate.\n  I hope when our colleagues look at all of the factors, they will \nconsider that important reason for sustaining and supporting an \nautomobile industry in this country. Again, no other Nation is allowing \ntheir automotive industry to go down in this global economic disaster \nwe are all in. They have all taken steps to support their industry.\n  We should too, for many reasons. But one of those reasons, one of the \nmost important reasons we are here in the Senate is to make sure that \nour men and women in uniform always have the best equipment that can be \nproduced in the world. They put their lives at risk. They are entitled \nto every advanced technology we can give them.\n  Part of the production of those technologies the big three is playing \ntoday, tomorrow, and hopefully in the future, is a critical role.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator entertain a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I did not see my dear friend from Virginia come to the \nfloor. I wish I had, because I wanted to put those parts of my \nremarks--and they were lengthy, but at a time when he might be hearing \nthem either here or in his office.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we had the opportunity to speak on this \nsubject earlier today. And I reminded my good friend of the \nextraordinary chapter in American history that was performed by the \nindustrial base in your State and elsewhere across America under the \nleadership and guidance of those companies manufacturing automobiles \nafter Pearl Harbor, I mean who were in the business of manufacturing at \nthe time of Pearl Harbor. They shut those lines down very quickly and \nturned to full military production. That is a great chapter in American \nhistory. And, fortunately, I am old enough to remember it quite well as \na young man.\n  But today, it is a different industrial base in the automobile \nindustry. Whereas they had a very dominant position in the production \nof vehicles, particularly tanks, and they did some aircraft and so \nforth, that has given way to the high-tech aspects which the Senator \nfrom Michigan addresses here on the floor for the benefit of our \ncolleagues.\n  That is a great chapter in American history. I would hope this Nation \nwould never again be faced with as serious a problem as it was in World \nWar II, namely that we had let our Armed Forces get down to very small \nlevels and the equipment was old and tired.\n  You remember the pictures that they used broomsticks to practice \ntheir military maneuvers with and the Model T and Model A automobiles \nthat were used for tanks. But that chapter reflects the potential of \nnot just the companies themselves but the workers and how quickly they \ntook their knowledge and their skilled hands to swing into action and \nproduce the war materials that we needed very quickly.\n  Today our military is much stronger, well equipped, thanks to the \ndistinguished chairman and others who have served with us on that \ncommittee. I think the likelihood of our Nation ever being confronted \nwith a conflict that would have to require that enormous buildup is \nnot, hopefully not there, but nevertheless we should remember that \nchapter.\n  It documents the capabilities of the workers and the families in this \nindustry. I think you pointed with great pride to that era. I might add \nto my colleague's comment, he closed by asking all Senators to consider \nthis very carefully. As I finish up my 30 years, I have been to a lot \nof Republican caucuses. We had one yesterday at noon. We just completed \nanother. And the gravity of this issue is reflected in the gravity of \nthe careful, very careful consideration being given by every member in \nour caucus. I can tell you that without any question. I am not \nsuggesting exactly which way they are going to go. But I know that they \nhave the best interests of the country in mind, and the gravity of the \nsituation is enormous. You can detect it as you hear the colloquies \ngoing on on our side. I am sure the same is taking place the Senator's.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank my dear friend from \nVirginia. This will probably be, we keep saying, the last opportunity \nwe have to speak with each other on the floor of the Senate. It may be, \nit may not be, as it turns out. But I know of no Member of this body \nwho has put the interests of this Nation more deeply in his heart than \nthe Senator from Virginia.\n  There are others who probably share that with him; I know there are, \nbut the focus which I gave here today outlining the current \nrelationship between the big three and the technologies that are \nembedded right now in our vehicles, and the effort in a collaborative \nway between our domestic automobile industry and our Army vehicle \nindustry, to give us lighter vehicles, more survivable vehicles, \ncrashworthy vehicles, vehicles that use less gasoline, vehicles that \nhave the global positioning devices that can say exactly where they are \nand communicate that, these technologies are embedded now and will \ncontinue hopefully to always be at the forefront, at the cutting edge \nof technology to give our troops what I know the Senator from Virginia \nhas devoted his life to; that is, to giving our troops every edge we \ncan.\n  The big three not only has been part of that on the vehicles, as the \nSenator notably points out in terms of looking back, but that is the \ncurrent situation--deep connections, synergies, collaboration going on \nas we speak, and planned for the years ahead.\n  If we rip apart that connection, by allowing the big three to go \nunder, that tremendous capability they have to join with the Army on \nvehicles, particularly, will be rendered useless or will no longer \nexist. That would be a terrible tragedy for our Nation's security.\n  Again, I am glad my great friend from Virginia was able to come to \nthe\n\n[[Page S10909]]\n\nfloor to share with me some thoughts about this relationship that is \nnot only historical and one which we take great pride in as a nation, \nthat ability to quickly expand, to turn a manufacturing, an industrial \nbase into an arsenal of democracy.\n  That hopefully will not happen, as the Senator points out. Maybe it \nis less likely to happen. But we must be there when it does. That \naspect has been focused on by others, the need to be able to have a \nmanufacturing base for our national security and to have a base of \nsuppliers for our national security. I have tried to add another aspect \nto this argument that points to the relationship between the survival \nof our big three and our national security by pointing out the ongoing \nrelationship in the area of research and development, which has \nproduced critically important technologies currently in our vehicles \nand developing today the technologies which will make future vehicles.\n  Mr. WARNER. Our military vehicles.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to make that clear because that technology has \nbeen available in the open market to those manufacturers, other than \nthe oil industry, which have, in a remarkable way, taken these up-\narmored vehicles, that general category we have today, very quickly, to \nthe great credit of the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Gates, he put \ntogether a structure of five companies to get into immediate production \nof those vehicles and into those vehicles has gone the development and \ntechnology that our distinguished colleague from Michigan has \ndescribed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Thankfully, we still have a few colleagues, including the \ngreat Senator from Virginia, who have a personal connection to that \nwar.\n  Mr. WARNER. It was very minor, but it was a privilege to have been \nassociated with that generation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10909-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the House bill before us contains a \nprovision that causes me great concern. The provision would make the \nU.S. Government an active participant in an abusive tax shelter \ntransaction.\n  In the past, Congress has voted to shut that tax shelter down. And \nthis week, I sought to offer an amendment to strike the provision from \nthis bill. But I have been prevented from offering that amendment. That \nthis provision will remain in the bill makes this bill a far less \nattractive measure.\n  Section 18 of the bill requires the United States to serve as a \nguarantor of obligations incurred by domestic subway and other \ntransportation systems. These obligations arise from the systems' \nparticipation in leasing arrangements called lease in/lease out, or \nLILOs, and sale in/lease out, or SILOs.\n  LILOs and SILOs are sham transactions. The IRS has designated them as \n``listed'' tax shelters. That means that these tax shelters are among \nthe most egregious abuses of the tax law.\n  LILOs and SILOs are very complicated deals, designed to look like \nlegitimate leasing transactions. But in reality, they are shams.\n  In a SILO, a tax-exempt entity nominally ``sells'' an asset, like a \nsubway system. The other party to the deal is an investor who is \nsubject to taxation and who needs a tax write-off. The investor \nnominally ``buys'' the asset. The investor then nominally ``leases'' \nthe asset back to the tax-exempt entity.\n  In truth, the benefits and burdens of ownership never shift. And the \nsale and the lease have no economic reality.\n  These parties purport to make purchase payments and rent payments. \nBut in reality, these payments are just paper entries, facilitated by a \nbank that is in on the deal. The investor pays the tax exempt entity an \nup-front fee in exchange for its willingness to participate in the \ndeal. But other than that, no real money changes hands.\n  There is little, if any, risk to any party to these transactions. \nThat is because the deal is cooked from the beginning. It is planned so \nas to eliminate any risk.\n  But there are significant tax benefits to the investor. The investor \ngets interest and depreciation deductions. And those deductions \ngenerate tax losses. Employing these tax losses, the investor pays less \ntax on income that the investor earns elsewhere.\n  This chart illustrates how a SILO transaction works. You do not have \nto understand all the details to see how complicated the transaction \nis.\n  As Chairman of the Finance Committee, I have had these deals on my \nradar screen for quite some time. In 2003, the Finance Committee held a \nhearing with a confidential informant. The witness risked his \nprofessional reputation to tell us how abusive LILO and SILO \ntransactions are.\n  I pushed for legislation to shut these deals down. The 2004 Jobs Act \neliminated the tax benefits for most of the investors who had entered \ninto these transactions.\n  Since 2005, I have worked to shut down the remaining deals that the \nJobs Act failed to address. Unfortunately, our efforts have met with \nresistance. Some argue that shutting down these transactions would be \napplying law retroactively. But I believe that these transactions \nalways violated the law, as they lack any economic substance.\n  In the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, \nCongress imposed excise taxes on tax-exempt entities and their managers \nwho entered into tax shelter transactions. That law recognized the role \nthat some tax exempt entities, including transit agencies, played as \n``accommodating parties'' to tax shelter deals.\n  Since 1999, the IRS has devoted considerable resources to shutting \ndown these deals. The IRS has designated both LILOs and SILOs as \n``listed'' tax shelter transactions. The IRS has audited every one of \nthese transactions that it could find. The IRS has litigated four \ncases, and won every time. Recently, the IRS announced a settlement \ninitiative to shut down the remaining cases and reports an 80-percent \nparticipation rate.\n  We have been trying to stop these tax shelters for years. So how does \nthe Government end up guaranteeing this kind of tax shelter? The \ncomplicated structure of LILOs and SILOs plays a part.\n  Under the terms of the agreements, transit agencies are required to \nobtain a guarantee from an insurer. The insurer guarantees that the \nagencies will be able to buy back the subway at the end of the lease \nperiod. The agreements require that the insurer have a very high credit \nrating.\n  The current economic crisis has caused downgrades of insurers' credit \nratings. That has put the tax-exempt entities into technical default on \ntheir agreements. Under the agreements, when the tax-exempt entities \ndefault, the investors have a right to terminate the lease.\n  The investors are taking advantage of this legal opportunity. They \nare trying to cash in. The investors are attempting not just to recoup \nthe nominal purchase price of the assets. They are also demanding that \nthe transit agencies pay over the value of the tax benefits that the \ninvestor will lose as a result of the premature unwinding of\n\n[[Page S10910]]\n\nthe deal. The value of the tax benefits can be many times the putative \npurchase price.\n  This chart that I referred to earlier is an exhibit from a lawsuit, \nHoosier Energy v. John Hancock Life Insurance. In that case, the Monroe \nCounty Circuit Court in Indiana issued a temporary injunction barring \nJohn Hancock from collecting on the technical default.\n  Transit agencies do not have lots of excess money just sitting \naround. So they have come to the Congress asking for a guarantee from \nthe U.S. Government.\n  Now I do not want our Nation's subway systems to be at risk. I am \nopen to considering ways to help keep them financially sound.\n  But I am unwilling to do so at the expense of American taxpayers. The \nbill before us today asks taxpayers to put their tax dollars at risk. \nThe bill asks taxpayers to guarantee transit agencies who knowingly and \nwillfully entered into deals that had no economic substance and were \ndesigned for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes.\n  The Government has come under much criticism for actions it has taken \nto jump-start our economy. But deliberately involving the U.S. \nGovernment in a tax shelter scam would add fuel to that fire.\n  We must not add legitimacy to an abusive transaction that the \nCongress, the courts, the Treasury, and the IRS have spent years trying \nto shut down.\n  We must not undermine the good efforts of the IRS to prosecute these \ncases. We need the IRS to accomplish as much work as it can to \neliminate these and other scams.\n  We must not ask American taxpayers who struggle to pay their taxes to \nunderwrite deals set up to help wealthy investors attempting to shelter \ntheir income.\n  The approach in the bill before us today is not a solution. Stepping \nin to guarantee these deals exposes American taxpayers to ongoing risk. \nSome event could trigger a requirement that the Government pay the \ninvestors. This bill puts taxpayers on the hook for a long time.\n  In addition, I understand that this proposal applies to only 80 \npercent of the transit agencies that entered into these tax shelter \ndeals. What about the other 20 percent of the systems who are not \ncovered? What happens to them? We need a fair and balanced approach to \nresolve this issue.\n  We would do better to figure out a way to discourage investors from \nacting on the technical default simply because the insurer's credit \nrating has been downgraded. A downgrade does not mean that the insurer \nis not good for the money. I intend to explore options with this goal \nin mind. We need a solution that protects both the transit agencies and \nthe American taxpayer.\n  Finally, this is an auto bill. We should not forfeit the opportunity \nto bolster our automotive industry by cluttering up the bill with \nunrelated and controversial proposals.\n  There is a proper time and place for everything. This is neither the \ntime nor the place to divert attention from our immediate task, helping \nour automakers.\n  This provision has no business in the auto bill. The Senate should \ntake the provision out. And if the Senate does not take the provision \nout, it will only add to the burdens that are weighing this bill down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I come to the floor to back up the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Baucus, who has spoken on the very \nsame issue. We have had a close working relationship for 8 years as \neither chairman and ranking member, and those changed from time to \ntime. Part of our effort of working together has been to close down \nabusive tax shelters. So I am here to support what he said and to say, \nin my own words, my reasons for wanting this provision out of the bill. \nThe bottom line of what I am saying is the bottom line of what Senator \nBaucus has already said. This tax provision has no business being in \nthis bill.\n  There is a provision in this auto bailout bill that deals with a \nnumber of transit agencies that assisted corporations in tax shelters. \nThis provision in the auto bailout bill has nothing to do with \nautomakers. It would prop up a tax shelter that Senator Baucus and I \nshut down in the year 2004. Shutting down that tax shelter saved \nAmerican taxpayers $26.56 billion, according to the nonpartisan Joint \nCommittee on Taxation. That is real money. So we should be very \nprotective of making sure money that by subterfuge was not going to \ncome into the Federal Treasury comes back to the Federal Treasury and \nis not used in the future. This tax shelter is commonly referred to as \nsale-in, lease-out, or by the acronym SILO, or another program lease-\nin, lease-out that we refer to by the acronym LILO. This tax shelter \nbailout within the automaker bailout bill would have the Federal \nGovernment guarantee obligations that public transit agencies now face \nbecause they entered into shady deals with corporations, including \nforeign corporations, where they sold things such as the transit \nagencies' own train cars and then magically leased them back from these \ncorporations to do what they were doing all the time anyway, hauling \npeople.\n  This was not done to change the way the transit agency operated but, \ninstead, to collect a fee for assisting the tax shelter, where the \ncorporations could take advantage of the tax deduction for depreciation \nof things such as these train cars.\n  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in 2004, I worked hard to \nshut down these tax shelters as a matter of tax fairness, and Senator \nBaucus was there working closely with me to do that. The Internal \nRevenue Service has been working to recover money from these deals. If \nthis tax shelter bailout were to pass, it would interfere with the \nworking of the IRS in these efforts to collect money that should never \nhave been deducted in the first place.\n  This tax shelter bailout can change the cost-benefit analysis for \nthose tax shelter corporations that are considering settling their \ndisputes with the IRS over the SILO/LILO tax shelters. It is wrong for \nthe auto bailout bill to bail out transit agencies from participating \nin these shady tax shelters. The Federal Government should not \nguarantee the transit agencies' obligations to corporations, including \nforeign corporations, when doing so allows the tax shelter to continue \nas it did before 2004, and these corporations, including foreign \ncorporations, to continue taking tax shelter deductions for things such \nas transit agencies' train cars.\n  If the Federal Government is called upon to pay the guarantees of the \ntransit agencies' obligations to these tax shelter corporations, \nincluding foreign tax shelter corporations, then the hardworking U.S. \ntaxpayer will be sending money directly to these foreign corporations \nand others. I don't know how many, but we know foreign corporations are \nvery much involved.\n  These tax shelters were, in fact, set up so corporations were able to \ntake large depreciation deductions. However, the tax shelter needed a \nnontaxpaying entity that had large amounts of assets that could be \ndepreciated. So that is where the transit agencies come in. The transit \nagencies were paid millions of dollars to do nothing, simply sign \npapers and go about business as usual of transiting people within \ncities or between cities, as they were doing before this tax shelter \nwas ever thought up. The transit agencies are called accommodation \nparties in tax shelter lingo. They are called this because, in exchange \nfor their fee, they helped make tax shelters work for corporations that \nwere bilking the U.S. taxpayers out of billions of dollars, and those \nbillions of dollars were lost revenue to the Federal Treasury.\n  This auto bailout bill proposes to bail out the transit agencies from \nthe consequences of their bad judgment of entering into tax shelters. I \nsay ``bad judgment'' because they ought to know this doesn't make \nsense. Some lawyer might tell you: We can get by with this because we \nfound this loophole in the tax laws. But, in fact, lawyers can find \nanything. The English language is not so perfect that we write perfect \npieces of legislation that somebody who is wise can't find a way \naround. That is what happened prior to 2004, before Senator Baucus and \nI shut it down.\n  As the transit agencies have found out--and that is why they are \ncoming to the bailout bill for some help--when\n\n[[Page S10911]]\n\nyou lie down with dogs, you get fleas. Now that the transit agencies \nhave fleas due to their participation in this tax shelter scheme, they \nwant the Federal Government to be their flea remover. If this provision \nis enacted and if the Federal Government guarantees the transit \nagencies' tax shelter obligations, it will actually help these shady \ntax shelter deals stay alive longer and, who knows, encourage more of \nthis in the future. We are trying to shut down a business I consider \nillicit, people going through the Tax Code and seeing where they can \nfind a tax loophole and writing a program and go out and sell it. They \ngo out and sell it to somebody else, then flee to the woods, and some \ncorporation or individual has to defend it themselves, and they can't. \nThey get stuck with the tax bill from the IRS. We want to shut down the \ntax shelter-writing business.\n  I will not help the transit agencies avoid the consequences of their \nparticipation in these tax shelters. I do not want to put U.S. taxpayer \nmoney on the line to support tax shelters that have been stealing from \nthese same taxpayers.\n  I am aware that as early as February 2000, we had a Federal \ninitiative from the executive branch. In the year 2000, the Federal \nTransit Administration, under the Clinton administration, used to \nadvocate these tax shelter deals to transit agencies as innovative \nfinancing. The Federal Transit Administration's promotion of these tax \nshelters was shameful, and it gave a legitimacy to it. I suppose it \neven encouraged further tax shelter people to write. But in 2004, \nSenator Baucus and I said: Enough is enough. That is why the \nlegislation was passed in 2004, shutting down these and saving the \ntaxpayers that $25 billion the Joint Committee on Taxation said could \nbe saved; in other words, paid into the Federal Treasury, instead of \nsome sharp lawyer finding a way to keep it out of the Federal Treasury.\n  Going back to when these were first being instituted by the Federal \nagency or encouraged by the Federal agency, we did have the IRS \nresponding to that. So you had one agency promoting something. You had \nthe IRS issue a revenue ruling that came out against these tax \nshelters. But between that 1999 March 1 date and the time Senator \nBaucus and I finally concluded this needed to stop in 2004, we still \nhad a bunch of these deals consummated. Even if the transit agencies \nwere not aware of the IRS's position, the transit agencies should have \nrealized that getting money for essentially doing nothing ought to be \ntoo good to be true. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is \nnot the right thing to do. That is common advocacy to any consumer in \nAmerica met by some snake oil salesman who comes along to sell a \nproduct. If it sounds too good to be true, you ought to raise questions \nabout it.\n  We even have a situation where every court that has considered these \ntransactions has ruled they are abusive tax shelters and has not \nallowed the tax breaks claimed by the corporation that engaged in the \ntax shelters. Three of these court cases are BB Corporation, the \nFifth Third Bancorp, and AWG Leasing Trust. In a recent court opinion \ninvolving John Hancock Life Insurance Company, Chief Judge David \nHamilton of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nIndiana wrote that the SILO deal at issue was ``pure, abusive tax \nshelter,'' was ``rotten to the core'' and was ``a sham without economic \nsubstance.''\n  Additionally, in February 2004, Senator Baucus and this Senator sent \nletters to Washington, DC, New York City, and Chicago transit agencies \nasking for their assistance in an investigation of these abusive tax \nshelters.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these three letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 12, 2004.\n     Richard A. White,\n     CEO, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, 600 \n         Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. White: We are writing to enlist the assistance of \n     the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority in our \n     ongoing investigation of abusive tax shelters. On October 21, \n     2003, the Committee on Finance held a hearing regarding the \n     continuing proliferation of abusive tax shelters. During that \n     hearing, we learned that shelter promoters are engaging in \n     transactions with U.S. municipalities and other state and \n     local governmental units, which allow major U.S. corporations \n     to depreciate state and local infrastructure assets, such as \n     railways, subways, dams, water lines, and air traffic control \n     systems. Our subsequent investigations have disclosed that \n     federal agencies have endorsed these transactions, even \n     though the Department of the Treasury had classified them as \n     abusive tax shelters.\n       Under this scheme, municipalities are paid an up-front cash \n     fee to enter into a long-term lease of their infrastructure \n     to the tax shelter promoters. The cash received by the \n     municipality, however, pales in comparison to the federal tax \n     benefits received by the corporations, which will be able to \n     depreciate taxpayer-funded bridges, subways, and rail systems \n     as a result of the lease. As part of the same agreement, the \n     promoters will agree to simultaneously lease the assets back \n     to the municipality. The obligations of the promoters and \n     municipalities are prepaid through ``phantom'' debt, and \n     neither the tax promoters nor the municipality assumes any \n     credit or ownership risk. At the end of the lease term, the \n     infrastructure assets revert back to the municipality. In \n     reality, nothing changes regarding the ownership or use of \n     the infrastructure. One municipal manager described these \n     transactions as ``People giving him money which he never had \n     to pay back, for doing something that he was already doing.''\n       In March 1999, the Department of the Treasury under the \n     Clinton Administration initiated enforcement actions against \n     these transactions, which are called LILOs--an abbreviation \n     of their industry name ``lease-in-lease-out'' transactions. \n     We have further learned that these transactions have \n     continued, albeit in a different form, and that other federal \n     agencies may be approving these transactions. The LILO \n     transactions have now been replicated through service \n     agreement contracts and transactions called SILOs--``sales-\n     in-lease-out.'' Other variations on these transactions have \n     involved qualified technology equipment (QTEs).\n       We are certain that you share my concern that subway \n     systems, water lines, waste treatment plants, and air traffic \n     control systems constructed with taxpayer dollars are being \n     used by big corporations to shelter billions of dollars in \n     taxes through bogus depreciation deductions. In order to \n     assist us in assessing the scope and scale of this problem, I \n     request that the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority \n     submit to the Committee on Finance copies of all LILOs, \n     SILOS, QTEs, and similar transactions that have been \n     approved, funded, or otherwise reviewed by the Washington \n     Metropolitan Area Transit Authority from the year 1995 to \n     present.

Grassley,\n       Chairman.\n     Max Baucus,\n       Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have been fighting against SILO/LILO tax shelters for \na long time, as has Senator Baucus. In October 2003, the Finance \nCommittee held hearings on the status of abusive tax shelter \nactivities. During that hearing, we received anonymous testimony from a \nleasing industry executive that used the name Mr. Janet. He described \nhow U.S. corporations were able to take tax deductions for such things \nas the Paris, France, sewer lines and the New York subway system. Major \ncorporations were claiming tax deductions on taxpayer-funded \ninfrastructure located in the United States and overseas.\n  Imagine our surprise when we learned that U.S. taxpayers were \nsubsidizing the cost of electric transmission lines in the Australian \noutback. I find it hard to believe that a corporation was actually \ntaking a tax deduction for the New York City transit car pictured here. \nHowever, that is exactly what greedy corporations were doing. Just like \nthe greedy tax shelter promoters who were handing out U.S. taxpayer \nmoney to greedy corporations by selling these shady tax shelters to \nthem, the House voted last night to put U.S. taxpayer dollars on the \nline to bail out tax shelter participants and perpetuate these abusive \ntax shelters.\n  If we look at all the key congressional players on this deal, we will \nfind that, perhaps not by coincidence, nearly all of them represent \nareas where these transit shelter deals were done. These tend to be the \nbiggest cities. They tend to be the areas where the shops that hired \nthe sharpies that manufacture these tax shelters do business. Most of \nthese key congressional players for years, especially when Republicans \nwere in the majority, railed against tax shelters. Now we find that for \nthese key congressional players, the imperatives of the transit lobby \ndecisively outweigh the importance of cracking down on a tax shelter \nthat a Federal judge rightly described as ``rotten to the core.''\n  This reminds me of the Joker from the 1989 version of ``Batman,'' who \nsays: ``I'm giving out free money.'' You know the Joker, as shown on \nthis chart. You have seen him. ``I'm giving out free money.'' As we all \nknow, money is not free. Unfortunately, the joke here has been--and \nwill again be if we do not do something about it--on the American \ntaxpayer. Literally, the guarantee continues the cruel tax shelter joke \non the American taxpayers' dime.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to not allow this cruel joke to be \nplayed on the American taxpayers. I have fought against these tax \nshelters in the past, and I will continue to fight against them in the \nfuture. This provision puts taxpayers' dollars on the line and \nperpetuates an abusive tax shelter. In fact, it puts the U.S. \nGovernment in the position of guaranteeing tax benefits that \ncorporations, including foreign corporations--again, I want to \nemphasize--hope to reap from engaging in these tax shelters. So as \nSenator Baucus has just done--and I thank him for his leadership--I \nurge my colleagues to vote against this bill which contains a bailout \nfor tax shelter participants.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, are we as in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business, Senator.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on the auto bailout proposal before \nthe Senate. But before talking about any legislation, I wish to say \nthat I am very concerned, as everybody in the United States is, about \nthe state of the auto industry, not only in Detroit but other States \nthat have a great deal of auto workers and related industries.\n  As I said at the first Banking Committee hearing on this issue, I am \nnot concerned about any sense of American pride or because of the great \nhistory of the American auto industry. What concerns me is the \nworkers--the men and women who assemble our cars and trucks, who sell \nand service the vehicles, and those who work for the suppliers who keep \nthe industry running.\n  Auto manufacturing is the largest manufacturing sector in my \nCommonwealth. That is the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I know Detroit's \npain is felt in many towns and cities in Kentucky. In many counties, \njobs supplying parts to GM, Ford, or Toyota are some of the best jobs \nanywhere in Kentucky. Those jobs are in danger, and I am concerned for \nthe workers and their families.\n  The question facing Congress is what, if anything, we can and should \ndo about the industry's current problems.\n\n[[Page S10913]]\n\nAs I understand it, one of the two bills that is going to come before \nthe Senate--as soon as this afternoon--one is the bill passed by the \nHouse, and the other is a similar Senate proposal. Unfortunately, much \nlike the other bailouts we have passed, those bills rely on hopes and \npromises of future actions and do not require serious concessions. \nThose bills do not address the immediate problems facing the industry, \nwhich is a lack of funding for car loans and dealer floor plans, and \nmany other related issues.\n  While the Detroit manufacturers were forced by the economic crisis to \ncome to Congress for aid at this time, their problems are not just the \nresult of problems in our current financial markets. The companies are \nsimply uncompetitive in today's marketplace because of decades of bad \nbusiness decisions by both the corporate management and the labor \nunions. What is needed is a serious restructuring of the companies that \nbrings their costs in line with the costs of cars made by manufacturers \nsuch as Honda and Toyota and their capacity in line with the true \ndemand for new cars, not the artificially inflated demand of the last \nfew years.\n  Neither the House bill nor the Senate bill forces these companies and \ntheir stakeholders to make the changes necessary to force \nrestructuring. The so-called car czar has no real power to make the \ncompanies and stakeholders reach an agreement accomplishing the cost \nand capacity changes that must be made. Because the companies would not \nsurvive in the long term without those changes, they would be back \nbefore Congress next year asking for more money to get them through the \nnext few months, and back again and again. That is an irresponsible use \nof taxpayer dollars and would ultimately lead to the death of the \ncompanies and many thousands and thousands of jobs permanently being \nlost. Because I care too much about the workers, I cannot support \neither of these bills as they are currently written.\n  I have previously said I would support Federal assistance for \ncompanies if they undertake a chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring. \nFederal financing and warranty guarantees would enable the companies to \nemerge from that restructuring successfully and more quickly than they \nwould otherwise. Senator Shelby and Senator Ensign have an amendment to \ndo just that, and I will be supporting their amendment if they are \nallowed to have a vote on it on the floor of the Senate.\n  However, chapter 11 bankruptcy is not the ideal solution, and I know \njust the word ``bankruptcy'' causes many people whose jobs, retirement, \nand health care depend on the companies to shudder. A similar \nrestructuring that accomplishes significant changes outside of \nbankruptcy would work as well. Senator Corker has an amendment that \nwould require those significant changes as a condition of Federal \nassistance provided in the majority's bill. If the majority allows a \nvote on Senator Corker's amendment, I will support it. If the amendment \nis adopted to the Senate version of the bill, I will support passage. \nIf the majority blocks any minority amendments, as they have done for \nnearly the entire Congress, I will oppose the bill and any cloture \nmotions.\n  I will go ahead and state for the record that if the Corker amendment \npasses and the bill becomes law, I will oppose any and all attempts to \nweaken its requirements. Now, I say that knowing full well that I am \nvery concerned that come January 20, the majority might try to rewrite \nthe requirements so that the companies are not forced to make painful \nchanges that are necessary for them to survive in the long term. I hope \nthat will not be the case.\n  For these companies to survive and thrive, there must be painful \nchanges made, and we all know some jobs will be lost. However, with a \nsuccessful restructuring, the Corker amendment being included, more \njobs will be preserved for the long term than if we just prop up the \ncompanies with taxpayers' dollars for a few short months and hope for \nthe best.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, since no one else is in the Chamber, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak for less than 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10913-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10913-S10914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HOLDER NOMINATION HEARING SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to discuss Eric Holder's \nnomination to be the U.S. Attorney General. While Mr. Holder appears to \nhave the appropriate credentials and work experience, it is important \nthat the Judiciary Committee be able to fully and carefully vet the \ncandidate for this important position because this is the Nation's top \nlaw enforcement officer.\n  I was surprised to hear that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nnoticed Mr. Holder's confirmation hearing for January 8, 2009. Mr. \nHolder was only formally announced as the prospective Attorney General \nnominee on December 1 of this year. I understand the Judiciary \nCommittee has a large number of boxes of archived documents relating to \nhis employment at the Justice Department, and those materials need to \nbe reviewed. We have not even gotten Mr. Holder's questionnaire, \nnomination materials, or FBI background investigation yet. Judiciary \nCommittee members just sent a letter to the Justice Department and the \nClinton Library requesting documents relating to issues that Mr. Holder \nwas involved in during his tenure in the Clinton Justice Department. \nOnce we get these materials and once these documents come to us, it \nwill take some time for committee members to review them.\n  While it is not unprecedented for the Judiciary Committee to hold a \nhearing prior to the inauguration of a President, such as the one held \nfor former Attorney General John Ashcroft, there are significant \ndifferences. First, the Ashcroft nomination hearing was held from \nJanuary 16 to January 19, 2001, obviously giving committee members more \nbreathing room to review his record. Moreover, Attorney General \nAshcroft was a well-known quantity to us because he served as our \ncolleague in the U.S. Senate and he was a prominent member of the \nJudiciary Committee. Of course, this was all prior to his nomination \nfor Attorney General. Even then, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle insisted on 2 days of testimony from the nominee and 2 days of \ntestimony from 23 other outside witnesses, for a total of 4 days of \nhearings.\n\n  The bottom line is that the proposed January 8 hearing timetable \ndoesn't give members a full and fair chance to consider Mr. Holder's \nbackground as thoroughly as we should. We must have time to \ncomprehensively examine all of Mr. Holder's information, materials, and \ndocuments, most of which we haven't even received yet. There is no need \nto jump the gun and undermine our oversight responsibilities.\n  This is all the more important because Mr. Holder is not a nominee \nfree and clear of issues. The fact is Mr. Holder played a very key role \nin some very controversial matters, and since his nomination, a number \nof newspapers, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and \nthe Wall Street Journal, have all published articles reminding the \npublic of those controversies and raising serious questions about Mr. \nHolder's role in them. These issues need to be fully considered by \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee and eventually by the full Senate.\n  For example, red flags about Mr. Holder's judgment and independence \ninclude his role in securing pardons or clemency for an unrepentant \nbillionaire fugitive tax cheat such as Marc Rich or terrorists such as \nmembers of the FALN and Weather Underground. A lot of people--including \nthis Senator--have found these facts to be troubling. As I previously \nmentioned, a number of editorials have been written asking questions \nabout how those facts impact Mr. Holder's ability to serve as U.S. \nAttorney General. I expect to question Mr. Holder at his confirmation \nhearing about these and other controversial matters he has been \ninvolved with.\n\n[[Page S10914]]\n\n  In addition, Mr. Holder has been in private practice since he left \nthe Clinton Justice Department over 8 years ago. It is important that \nwe know what Mr. Holder has been doing in those 8 years, which cases he \nhas been involved with, and who his clients are, what speeches he has \nmade, and so forth. For example, public reports have emerged that in \n2004, the Governor of Illinois hired or sought to hire Mr. Holder. We \ncertainly need time to learn what that is all about. Mr. Holder has not \nprovided the committee with all of this information yet. Again, it is \nnot unreasonable for members of the Judiciary Committee to want to \nreceive all of these materials and have ample opportunity to study them \nbefore holding the nomination hearings. As such, I, then--this Senator, \nthen--is in support of Senator Specter's request that Chairman Leahy \nmove the hearing to a later date in January so committee members can do \ntheir duty and review Mr. Holder's nomination in a responsible manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been working, as I think the country \nknows and the Senate knows, for the last many weeks trying to come up \nwith some way to resolve the issue of dealing with Detroit and the \nautomobile manufacturers. We thought we were at a place today where we \nwould have a series of votes and we were almost there when another \nSenator submitted another idea. As a result of that, there are good-\nfaith negotiations going on as we speak. The last I heard is that they \nwould have something completed by 5:30. I kind of smile when I say \nthat, because considering the years I have spent here in the Senate, \nsometimes I don't know if they are referring to ``5:30'' meaning 10 \nminutes from now or 12 hours and 10 minutes from now, but they said \n5:30. If they are able to work that out, then the bill will \noverwhelmingly pass the Senate. I have told the House and the House \nwill have to do whatever they do with that. But right now, that is not \ndone.\n  As I indicated, they said they thought a half hour or so ago it would \nbe done by 5:30. I hope that is the case. I know it is late. I know \npeople want more definite definitions of when this is all going to \nhappen, but that isn't the way the Senate works, as much as we would \nall like it to be. So if everyone will be patient, there is still a \npossibility--and even maybe a probability--that sometime this evening \nwe would be able to vote.\n  Now, Senator McConnell and I don't know at this stage what we will be \nvoting on. If the negotiations which are going forward now bear fruit, \nthen that will be the issue that I think would pass with a significant \nmargin here in the Senate. There may be some other Senators who want to \noffer alternatives. I think there may be some suggestions for that to \ntake place. At this stage, I think it is pretty clear that there is no \nneed to vote on the House measure, because it is pretty clear there \naren't enough votes to pass that, but those decisions we will make \nshortly. I think what we are going to be voting on is a series of \ncompeting alternatives. There is not going to be an opportunity to \noffer a lot of individual rifleshot amendments to these different \nproposals, but I know that a number of Senators have one proposal. We \nhave the one we talked about we will probably vote on today, and then \nwe have the bipartisan issue that is being worked on right now. If we \nare fortunate, maybe we could wind up having three votes or maybe only \ntwo votes. But, anyway, we are doing our best to resolve this issue.\n  There is no need to talk about all of the Senators involved. We will \ndo that if we can work something out and they will get all the \naccolades they need. We have had a lot of cooperation today. That \ndoesn't mean we are going to be able to work something out, because \nthis is a very important issue. But right now, I think we are a lot \nfurther down the road than I thought we would be. I was trying to \nthink: Down the road distance, so it should be ``farther'' down the \nroad. But, anyway, I wish to alert everyone they should be patient \ntonight. We hope to have some votes before the night is out.\n  If everything falls apart, then we will be left with having a cloture \nvote on the Democratic version.

Mr. President, in a moment I will ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to passage of H.R. 7327, the pension bill. \nBefore I do that, I wish to say this is very important relief for \nseniors and for the country. The bill includes a provision that would \nallow seniors who are 70\\1/2\\ years of age not to have to make \nwithdrawals from their IRA accounts that the current law requires. \nUnder current law, if you are 70\\1/2\\ or older, you must begin to \nwithdraw significant amounts from your 401(k) accounts or IRA accounts \nand if you don't, you pay a big penalty. At these times it is not wise \nto require that, because the accounts are lower in value and they \nshould not have to make those withdrawals if they don't want to.\n  In addition, this legislation would allow companies to postpone \nmaking increased contributions to their pension plans also required by \nthe recent pension law. When we revised pension law a short while ago, \nwe were pretty strict to protect employees by requiring companies to \nmake contributions to the pension plans at a much faster rate. That \nmade sense then, but given the economic downturn, with the market \nvalues down so much lower than they were back then, it makes sense, I \nbelieve--and I think most Senators agree--that those contributions \nshould be postponed or later modified in order to keep companies \nviable.\n  A lot of companies need this to meet payrolls in these difficult \ntimes, and this will prevent them having to freeze their benefits.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 7327, which was received from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 7327) to make technical corrections related to \n     the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are living through an unprecedented \neconomic downturn. Over the past 15 months, the Dow Jones Industrial \ncompanies have lost more than one-third of their value. An end does not \nappear in sight.\n  This sharp market decline hurts more than just Wall Street. It hurts \nevery American with a retirement plan. When the market drops, so do the \nassets in pension plans.\n  Over the past 15 months, because of the current financial crisis, \nretirement accounts have lost as much as $2 trillion in assets due to \nthe current financial crisis. That is $2 trillion that disappeared from \nthe retirement accounts of American workers. And that is $2 trillion \nthat disappeared from the accounts of pension plans.\n\n[[Page S10915]]\n\n  Congress must act now to protect individual retirement accounts and \npension benefits and assets.\n  This bill provides relief for seniors age 70\\1/2\\ and older whom \ncurrent law requires to take distributions from their retirement plans.\n  Individuals would have the option to keep their retirement savings \nwhere they are. We should not force them to take out huge portions of \ntheir savings when the market is down.\n  This bill also contains a number of provisions to help ease the \nstrain on pension plans. And this bill would help to prevent the need \nfor some plans to reduce benefits or make extraordinary funding \ncontributions due to the market downturn.\n  If we fail to act and provide short-term funding relief, pension \nplans would be unable to afford their increased contributions. By one \nestimate, current law would require 350 of the Fortune 500 companies to \ncontribute an extra $100 billion or more to their pension plans next \nyear, even if the market rebounds. If these companies did this, they \nwould reduce their investment spending by $60 to $70 billion next year. \nThat is something that our economy cannot afford.\n  This bill provides relief for single-employer plans that fall below \nthe set funding target percentage set in the Pension Protection Act of \n2006.\n  And the bill provides analogous relief for multi-employer plans that \nare faced with significant underfunding due to market losses. This \nrelief would allow them to temporarily freeze their current funding \ncertification or extend the time period that they have to restore their \nfunding levels.\n  The bill also helps prevent benefit restrictions for those single-\nemployer plans that may be significantly underfunded next year due to \nthe market downturn.\n  This bill also contains a number of critical technical amendments to \nthe Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 \narguably marks the most sweeping changes to the pension laws since the \nenactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n  Like many complicated pieces of legislation, technical corrections to \nthe law must be made.\n  Technical corrections to the law are often time sensitive. That is, \nmany of them must be passed by both Houses of Congress before the \neffective date of the statute.\n  Many of the rules under the Pension Act were effective January 1, \n2008. This means that the time for passing technical corrections has \ncome and gone.\n  If we were not to act and pass these time-sensitive provisions now, \nthe pension community and the Department of the Treasury--the agency \ntasked with interpreting the statute and providing the necessary \ndetails on how the new law works--would be placed in a very tough spot.\n  That is, the Department of the Treasury would not have the necessary \ncorrections and clarifications of the original intent of the act to \nsufficiently issue the details necessary to allow the pension community \nto achieve proper compliance. This would not be fair to the pension \ncommunity or the Treasury Department.\n  Failing to pass these technical corrections would therefore be \nirresponsible.\n  Here in the Senate, we passed the technical corrections contained in \nthis act back in December 2007. We already said that these corrections \nare good pension policy.\n  Americans need real help from Congress to make sure that their \nretirement savings are safe and sound and available to them when they \nneed it. This bill contains a number of provisions that would help to \nprovide relief to individuals and pension plans and move the economy \ntoward recovery.\n  Individuals and the pension community warned that individual \nretirement account holders and pension plan participants could be \nadversely affected without the provisions contained in this bill. \nPassing this pension package sends the right message to individuals, \nplan sponsors, and pension plan participants.\n  I thank my colleagues for helping to make passage of this bill \npossible today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate, and that any statements related \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 7327) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak for just a moment about the \ncomments that Senator Specter made earlier about the process for \nconsidering the nomination of Eric Holder as Attorney General.\n  The Republican members of the Judiciary Committee have been seeking \ninformation and doing work to prepare for the hearing. But there is a \ngreat deal of information that is not yet available and a great deal of \ninformation that hasn't yet been reviewed, all to the point that it is \ngoing to take a little bit of time to prepare for the hearing in order \nto do it right. Of course, we want to do it right.\n  While there is absolutely no desire on anyone's part to slow a \nprocess down or filibuster or in any other way make it difficult for \nthe orderly process to unfold for the confirmation of the nominee of \nthe President, we do ask that we be accorded the same consideration \nthat was given to others in this situation and that there be adequate \ntime to confirm him. I see no reason, if he is qualified and if he is \nconfirmed, that he could not take office very soon after the President \nhimself takes office, perhaps as early as a week or two after that. So \nnobody is talking about a long delay, but we do need to have adequate \ntime.\n  In that regard, since the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has \nindicated he would like to begin holding hearings on January 8, which \nis literally right after we begin the swearing in of the new Members \nand the beginning of the next session, there is not adequate time for \nthe kinds of things that have to be done if that is the date that we \nmeet. This has been conveyed to the chairman by Senator Specter. He has \nasked for a reasonable amount of time to get prepared. I hope that can \nbe accommodated. It is of sufficient concern that several of us have \nindicated, through a letter to the chairman, that we are going to \ninsist on having adequate time for the consideration of his nomination.\n  I remember the nomination of John Ashcroft who was a colleague of \neveryone here, a Senator from Missouri, when he was nominated to become \nthe Attorney General; nevertheless, it took 4 days of hearings for the \nSenate to decide to confirm him. His hearings began on Tuesday, January \n16. As I said, they lasted for 4 days. The chairman of the committee \nhas, as I said, indicated that the Holder hearings would be scheduled \nfor January 8, more than a week earlier. I don't think that is adequate \nfor the things we have to do. Ashcroft was voted on by the full \ncommittee on January 30. He was confirmed on February 1. So that timing \ncertainly would be totally appropriate for nominee Holder and would not \nin any way delay the administration with respect to the office of the \nAttorney General. In fact, irony of ironies, because Senator Ashcroft \nwas not confirmed until February 1, Eric Holder himself, who was in \ncharge at the end of the Clinton administration, served as Acting \nAttorney General at the beginning of the Bush administration. Senator \nSpecter, when he was chairman, accommodated numerous requests for \nsufficient time on the part of the then-ranking Democrat, Senator \nLeahy, on, for example, the nominees of Chief Justice Roberts and \nJustice Alito. I think reciprocation would be in order.\n  Right now, we don't even have Eric Holder's questionnaire or FBI \nbackground investigation, all of which are necessary to prepare for the \nhearing.\n\n[[Page S10916]]\n\nSenator Specter noted that we currently have 86 boxes of archived \ncommittee documents relating to Mr. Holder's tenure at the Justice \nDepartment to review. There are additional documents that have been \nsought from the Department of Justice and the Clinton library which \nwould provide additional information that we will need to examine.\n  One might say this is a lot of work to do for a nominee. Bear in \nmind, this is the Attorney General of the United States, an individual \nwho has some controversy in his past. I don't know whether this \ncontroversy is sufficient to suggest that he should not be confirmed, \nbut that is what the investigation and hearings, of course, are all \nabout. We are familiar with what these items are.\n  Mr. Holder was involved in the pardons of members of the FALN \norganization by President Clinton, the pardons of Marc Rich, Pincus \nGreen, Susan Rosenberg, and Linda Sue Evans. He was also involved in a \ncontroversial raid in Miami by the Border Patrol action to take Elian \nGonzales into custody. He was involved in death penalty approvals, \nrejections, or disputes. One that troubles me--and I want to get to the \nbottom of this--was the decision of the Department of Justice not to \ndefend the power of Congress to enact a particular statute, 18 U.S.C \n3501. There was Supreme Court litigation called Dickerson v. United \nStates, including Department of Justice responses to Judiciary \nCommittee inquiries on the subject and views of U.S. attorneys and \nDepartment advisory panels on the matter. The case involved challenging \nMiranda doctrine. Paul Cassell, a competent attorney, argued that case. \nThe Justice Department, contrary to precedent and tradition, didn't \ndefend the Government's position; that is to say, the Congress having \npassed a statute and defended the power of Congress to enact that \nstatute.\n  I don't know whether any of those controversial matters are enough to \nreject the nominee, but they are well known, controversial, and I think \nwe have an obligation to look into all of these matters. I am not \nalone. Richard Cohen wrote in the Washington Post that Eric Holder \nshould not be the Attorney General. I don't know whether he is right or \nnot, but the questions he raises need to be examined.\n  Glenn Greenwald wrote in the Salon magazine that Holder's involvement \nwith the Rich pardon was ``substantial, continuous, and concerted, \nmuch, much more than `peripheral,' '' which is the way Holder himself \ndescribed it.\n  One final note. In addition to having plenty of time to review and \nprepare and review documents and the FBI interviews and background \nchecks of Eric Holder and prepare for his hearings, we will want to \nhave sufficient time also to carefully consider other top Department of \nJustice nominees, such as the Deputy Attorney General, Associate \nAttorney General, Solicitor General, and the heads of the Office of \nLegal Counsel, the Criminal Division, the Civil Rights Division, and \nthe National Security Division.\n  I hope if we set the right precedent with the Attorney General \nhimself, these other matters will be considered in due time and we \nwon't have to argue each time there is an insufficient opportunity to \nconduct the kind of examination that would be necessary for positions \nas important as these.\n  So I hope our colleague, the chairman of the committee, will \nreconsider his initial decision to schedule the hearings on January 8. \nIf we can move those back even a week, that would provide time for us \nto conduct the process properly. We are not asking for some outrageous \ndelay just for the sake of delay. I hope he can accommodate us, and \nknowing of the views of the other members of the committee on the \nRepublican side, that he would be willing to do so.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, a moment ago I had the honor of \npresiding before the distinguished Senator from Florida replaced me in \nthe chair, and I was presiding during the time the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, Mr. Kyl, came to the floor to discuss the timing of the \nnomination proceedings for the President-elect's candidate for Attorney \nGeneral, Eric Holder. I had the chance to hear the points that they \nmade, and I wish, just briefly, to respond to a few of them.\n  As the junior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am \ncertainly in no position to speak for the chairman. Obviously we heard \nSenator Kyl ask that the timing be done on a reasonable basis, and I \nthink Senator Leahy, the very distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, is nothing if not reasonable and has shown enormous \nreasonableness with the timing of all the nominees that have come \nbefore him. And I would expect this to be no different. But in \nevaluating the reasonableness of the schedule that the chairman has \nproposed, or, I should say, announced, it may be worth putting it into \nthe context of the history of these sorts of nominees.\n  If you go all the way back to President Carter, for more than 30 \nyears, whether the Senate was controlled by Republicans or Democrats, \nor the President was a Republican or a Democrat, we have had nominees \nfor Attorney General come through the process. And throughout that long \nspan of time, the average time between the announcement by the \nPresident of his choice for Attorney General and the nomination \nhearing, the average amount of time has been 29 days. And the average \namount of time until a committee vote has been 37 days.\n  So that is the background. If you average over 30 years, from the \nannouncement, 29 days to the hearing, 37 days to the vote. The schedule \nthat Chairman Leahy has proposed is 39 days to the hearing, and he \nhopes for 50 days to the vote.\n  So instead of the average that it has been over 30 years of 29 days, \nthe Republicans have 10 extra days beyond the average to do the work \nthat they assert that they need to do, and the vote may not come for 50 \ndays, which is 11 days longer than the average.\n  I think everyone in this body understands the importance of a new \nPresident having his new Attorney General in place quickly. The \nPresident is going to be sworn in on January 20, and I think it is in \nall our interests as Americans to make sure that his choice is honored \nin a reasonable timeframe so that when the President takes office, he \nhas an intact team. Certainly with the Attorney General as such an \nimportant part of the President's national security team in this time \nof national security concerns, he should have an intact team.\n  And so it seems to me that the average is a pretty reasonable place \nto start, and when the chairman has given an extra 10 days beyond the \naverage just to the beginning of hearings, and hopefully an extra 13 \ndays beyond the average for the vote, it's a pretty good signal that \nthe chairman is being very reasonable about this.\n  Most recently, some of the Attorneys General whom we have seen, \nAttorney General Mukasey had a period of 30 days from his nomination to \nthe start of the hearings. That was at President Bush's request. \nRemember, he indicated that he wanted to get him in place soon. The \nDepartment was in grave distress and we needed to act quickly. We acted \nin 30 days. We are acting here in 39 days, more than was given for \nAttorney General Mukasey. The vote hopefully will be the same as for \nAttorney General Mukasey: 50 days from the announcement to the vote.\n  It doesn't sound unreasonable. Nobody said it was unreasonable when \nAttorney General Mukasey was put through that schedule. I don't see how \nit can be unreasonable that Eric Holder should have a more generous \nschedule, and somehow that is no longer reasonable.\n  For Attorney General Ashcroft, it was 25 days to the hearing instead \nof 39; 39 days to the vote instead of the hoped-for 50. For Attorney \nGeneral Reno, 26 days to the hearing instead of 39 days; 27 days to the \nvote instead of the hoped-for 50. Nearly twice as much time as for \nAttorney General Reno.\n  So I think the point is pretty clear. It is the tradition and the \nhistory of\n\n[[Page S10917]]\n\nthis body to honor the President's request to act quickly, and in terms \nof the reasonableness of the schedule that Chairman Leahy has proposed, \nhe has proposed a schedule that is on the generous side of the average \nand of recent history.\n  With respect to the concern that there is a lot to look at in Eric \nHolder's history, well, every lawyer who is experienced and active \nenough in the profession to be a candidate to be Attorney General of \nthe United States has got a long history to look at. That is a given. \nThat is a constant. That is not something that is different about Eric \nHolder than about any of his predecessors.\n  Indeed, if anything, the opposite concern would be justified, which \nis that we have already had a lot of time to look at Eric Holder. First \nof all, he has an astonishingly distinguished record to be Attorney \nGeneral. It is remarkable--his personal story, his career. It is all \nspectacular, truly. But specific to the question of nomination, this is \na lawyer who came right after law school to the Department of Justice \nand served as a prosecutor for a decade prosecuting public corruption \ncases. So he had to be cleared by the FBI to come in as a Department of \nJustice attorney, and he served there for all those 10 years. That is \nall a matter of clear public record. Everybody has had a chance to look \nat that forever.\n  The next thing that happened, in 1988, Eric Holder was nominated by \nPresident Ronald Reagan to the bench to serve as Superior Court judge \nin Washington, DC. Again, he was confirmed by the Senate. We had a full \nlook of everything up to 1988.\n  After his service on the bench, Eric Holder was nominated by \nPresident Clinton to serve as the United States Attorney for the \nDistrict of Columbia. United States Attorney Holder and I were \ncolleagues; me in Rhode Island, him down in DC. I went through that \nprocess of nomination and confirmation. It is exhaustive. It was done \nfor him. He was confirmed at that time. So as of the date he was \nappointed United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, we had \ndone a complete Senate look of his record to that point.\n  And that wasn't the last time. In 1997, President Clinton nominated \nUnited States Attorney Holder to serve as the Deputy Attorney General \nof the United States, Attorney General Reno's No. 2 in that department. \nAnd he was then confirmed by this body, the Senate, unanimously. And, \nagain, we had that full record of his before us at that time.\n  So this is a guy who has been the subject of very public attention as \na public official, the Deputy Attorney General. There isn't a whole lot \nthat one does as Deputy Attorney General that isn't available to the \npublic, that isn't in the news media. This is not somebody who has come \nout of nowhere and who has a great, vast mysterious past history that \nwe need to have a look at. Indeed, this body has had three looks at \nhim, confirmed him three separate times. The most recent time as late \nas 1997, unanimously. So I think the notion that--with only 1997 to now \nto look through, a period of a mere decade--the idea that he is being \nshoved unreasonably rapidly through the process, when he is \nsubstantially slower than the average, simply doesn't hold water.\n  And I would urge my Republican colleagues--again, they can have \ndiscussions with the chairman that obviously are at a rank higher than \nmine--but I would urge my colleagues to consider their views in that \ncontext: in the context of a spectacularly qualified individual who has \nthrice been confirmed by this body, as recently as 1997, and who is \nbeing given more time for scrutiny than the average or the recent Bush \nappointees, and in an environment in which I think we can all agree \nthat after the Bush management of the Department of Justice, we badly \nneed a new Attorney General in there and soon.\n  So with those observations I will yield the floor. I thank my \ncolleagues for waiting while I finished my remarks. I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma on the other side of the Chamber \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague and his informed \nwords. Much of what he has stated I agree with, but there is a \nsignificant difference. No. 1 is I was not in the Senate when Mr. \nHolder was confirmed. Given the facts that played out associated with \npardons that President Clinton had, the look needs to be refreshed \nwithout any question because there is no question that Mr. Holder erred \nin his judgment and has essentially said so, in association with one \nMr. Marc Rich, a fugitive.\n  I do not doubt Mr. Holder has a distinguished record. He is well \nqualified for lots of areas. I do not think it ought to be on the floor \nthat we debate whether we have a hearing. But I can tell you that the \ninformation we have requested, both from the Clinton libraries and \nothers, will not be available to us to peruse and to study. I may in \nfact in the long term end up voting for Mr. Holder, but I am not about \nto do anything less than a very thorough job.\n  I also remind my colleagues I was the first Republican Senator in the \nmidst of the committee to call for the resignation of Attorney General \nGonzales--rightly so. The position of Attorney General, although it is \nappointed by the President, is very different than all the rest of the \nappointments because he is for all of us, every citizen in this \ncountry, the chief law enforcement officer of this land. His loyalty is \nnot to the President. His loyalty has to be to the Constitution. It has \nto be to the responsible bodies that guide this country, although if we \nin fact have hearings early, we will have to have additional hearings. \nWe will not allow a vote to occur until we have thoroughly, to each \nmember of the Judiciary Committee's satisfaction, had the record \nexamined and had the questions answered that are going to need to be \nanswered with regard to some of the events that have taken place late \nin the Clinton administration.\n  That is not to cast any aspersions on Mr. Holder. I think he is a \nfine man. But judgment is the key thing that is most important and \nthere is a red flag. So if it is insisted that we go early, earlier \nthan we are prepared so we can truly ask the questions we think the \ncountry would need us to ask, then I think we will have a difficult \ntime ever moving that nomination.\n  That should not be the case. The fact is this gentleman deserves the \nbest, the most thorough opportunity to explain himself in a way where \npeople are asking proper questions, not improper questions. More \nimportant, the American people deserve for us to do our job. That means \nwe have to be very well briefed, very well studied on the questions and \ncircumstances about which we will apply them.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to in a moment.\n  I have given positive comments to the press on Mr. Holder, so I am \nnot necessarily someone in opposition. But I can tell you I am in \nopposition to not being in a position to do my job. It is going to be \nimpossible, and I will tell my colleague that, with the schedule that \nhas been set forth. I will not be able to be prepared at the time. I \nhave one staff lawyer. For us to go through everything to my \nsatisfaction, for me to fulfill my oath, that is not a possibility \nbetween now and January 9.\n  The other thing I would say is much of the information we have \nrequested is not even going to be available to us until January 6. So \nit would be terrible to start the next Congress off having a fight \nabout a fight. My hope is we can come to a compromise so we all feel \nvery well prepared.\n  There is no intent to delay Mr. Holder's nomination. There is every \nintent to make sure we are prepared to thoroughly vet his \nqualifications of independence and judgment. It is not his \nqualifications as to whether he has the capability to fulfill the role. \nIt is whether he will demonstrate the independence and the judgment \nwith which to fulfill it.\n  As my colleague knows--he was at the hearing when I asked the \nAttorney General to resign--I am not a partisan. The President-elect \nwho nominated this man I have a great deal of respect for. But I am \ngoing to do my job. If it means holding up a nomination until I get all \nthe answers, then that is what I\n\n[[Page S10918]]\n\nwill do. So there is no reason for us to do that by not accommodating \nthe ranking member on this committee and setting the schedule with \nwhich the minority on that committee are not prepared to be prepared to \nanswer that.\n  With that, I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I appreciate that very much. I thank the Senator from \nOklahoma for his courtesy for yielding.\n  I wanted to make sure the distinguished Senator was not suggesting \nthat when the Senate allowed 26 days between Attorney General Reno's \nannouncement and her nomination hearing, or allowed 25 days between \nAttorney General Ashcroft's announcement and his nomination hearing, or \nallowed 30 days between Attorney General Mukasey's announcement and his \nnomination hearing that the Senate was then underprepared or had not \ndone its job in evaluating, or didn't have enough time to evaluate \nthose candidates. I think they probably did. They appeared to going \nforward. By comparison, the 39 days----\n  Mr. COBURN. Reclaiming my time----\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If I could finish the question----\n  Mr. COBURN. I suggest we did a poor job with Attorney General \nGonzales, that is No. 1. No. 2, I was not here then so I don't know \nwhether we did or did not. Mukasey--the difference that would lie is \nthere is a large red flag on one or two specific actions of this \ngentleman as he acted as assistant Attorney General. That requires good \nscrutiny.\n  I assure my colleague that does not mean, and I think he knows this--\nI have not made a decision on this gentleman and I will not until we \nhave gone through the hearing process. As I have said to the press, I \nam generally inclined to think he is very well qualified for this. But \nthe question of judgment will require a lot of research on associated \nissues that have been outlined here.\n  So, to me, it is not a game I am playing. I think my colleagues in \nthe Senate know I work very hard to stay informed and up to detail on \nevery issue that is before us. I would say to my colleague, to me, I \ndon't care what the time was ever. What I care about is do we do it \nright so we do not have a repeat.\n  I am sure my colleague knows he doesn't want us to have a repeat of \nmaking a mistake and not thoroughly vetting someone to the degree we \nshould.\n  My hope is the Judiciary Committee in the next Congress operates very \nsmoothly, that we stand on the principles that we spoke about as we \nwent through this last year, and that we do not see the process of \ntrying to slow down judicial appointments because it is a partisan \nissue.\n  He has my pledge that will never be anything I will pertain to or \nparticipate in. If somebody is qualified and they are this President's \nnominee and they are qualified after going through the Judiciary \nCommittee and I believe they should be voted on, I intend to vote for \nthem and not hold them up. But I think this is a very different \ninstance. There are two specific problems that have to be very well \nvetted.\n  From what we have seen so far, the vast majority and minority have \nnot met Mr. Holder. We are going to be asked to meet with him on the \nday before the committee hearing so we will not have had the time even \nafter we meet with him to be able to cross-check what we have asked him \nagainst what facts we know because we will not have all the facts in, \nbecause we will not even have all the records from the Clinton library \nat that time.\n  I suggest we ought to start it off in more of a spirit of \ncooperation. My ranking member is of the learned opinion for the years \nthat he has been here, and he is a proven expert in the law, that we \nneed more time. We hope that request would be honored.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I wanted, while the Senator from Oklahoma is still on \nthe floor, to let him know I appreciate his concern and I am grateful \nfor his kind words. I would hope the one or two red flags that he has \nmentioned are not such as to justify necessarily extending the period \nbetween nomination and confirmation hearings more than 2 weeks beyond \nwhat the Senate gave for other nominees such as Attorney General \nThornburgh, Attorney General Barr--almost 2 weeks for Attorney General \nReno, 2 weeks longer than for Attorney General Ashcroft, 1 day short of \n2 weeks longer than for Attorney General Meese. Some of these people \nhave some red flags too, but the Senate was able to do its job timely \nand I hope we will do so again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10918-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10918-S10919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we extend \nmorning business until 7:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will share a few remarks on the matter \nbefore us. I was pleased to support Mr. Holder when he was nominated to \nbe the Deputy Attorney General. He came as a Superior Court Judge in \nDC, and as a U.S. attorney. I thought he had many of the gifts and \ngraces that would be appropriate for a Clinton deputy. He might not \nhave been my top choice, but I thought he had a good background and I \nsupported that. I have considered him a friend. I tried to be \nsupportive of him throughout his tenure.\n  But I have to say there are some problems that are going to have to \nbe dealt with. I went through the very painful process of Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales and the difficulties he had. It was very painful for \nme. I am not sure he was treated fairly, to tell you the truth. But it \ncame to a point where I think he concluded, and maybe everybody \nconcluded, it was best for him to step down as Attorney General. He \nwanted to do the right thing, I believe, but made some errors. It \ndamaged the Department.\n  I spent 15 years in the Department of Justice. I was an Assistant \nU.S. attorney for 2\\1/2\\ years and U.S. attorney for 12. That is a \npretty long time; the biggest part of my professional career, for sure.\n  I love the Department of Justice. I believe it is very important that \nwe have leaders committed to following the law regardless of position \nor power or influence; that the Attorney General should set the \nexample. When I was there they did and there was no doubt about it. We \nwere encouraged to do the right thing. If you took political heat, if \nyou were right, the Attorney General would back you up, no matter what \npolitician might call or what influential contributor or friend might \ntry to intervene. You were expected to do your duty. That is the way I \ntrained my assistants and that is the way I was expected to perform.\n  So I have no more grim prospect in mind, in the beginning of next \nyear, than to have to go through a contentious hearing for the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. As I said, I have had nothing but \npersonal affection for Eric Holder.\n  I want to make a couple of points. First, I believe Senator Specter \nis justified in asking that this hearing not start so soon. President-\nelect Obama is not in office. He will not be President. President-elect \nObama will not be President at that time. He is talking about starting \nit on January 8 and that is very early. Members of the committee have \nsought a bunch of documents. I am not sure they are entitled to all of \nthose documents, but many of them are public record documents that are \nquite appropriate to be requested. These members have requested those \ndocuments and they need to be looked at because there are some \nquestions here that are going to have to be examined.\n  I note Attorney General Griffin Bell, who is one of the great \nAttorney Generals ever to serve in this country, serving under \nPresident Carter, that his hearings lasted 6 days.\n  John Ashcroft, a member of the Judiciary Committee, one of our own, \nand I believe a man of great integrity and commitment to the law, had 4 \ndays and my colleagues on the other side had 23 outside witnesses \ntestify in an effort to try and find something to complain about. \nBasically, they did not have\n\n[[Page S10919]]\n\nanything to say of importance, and he was confirmed.\n  But a confirmation hearing is not a coronation, particularly when \nthere are questions out there that need to be conducted in the right \nway. I think, first, that Senator Specter is well within propriety and \ncollegiality to ask that we not start this hearing so soon. Second, we \nneed to be sure there is enough time set aside that it can be fairly \ndiscussed. And I will not go into the allegations that are out there, \nbut I wish to say that not rushing this nomination through is not some \nsort of partisan attack, but instead a duty that must be performed.\n  Let me say that commentators and newspapers across the spectrum have \nraised questions about the nominee. The Senate has been called upon to \ndo its job and ask the kinds of questions that need to be asked and \nclear the air on some of these allegations. And I hope Mr. Holder is \nable to do so.\n  The New York Times, a strong supporter of President-elect Obama, more \nand more known to be a liberal newspaper, said this recently:\n\n       Mr. Holder . . . must answer serious questions before the \n     Senate votes on his confirmation.\n\n  They had an editorial on this subject and seemed to be troubled by \nthe nomination and flatly stated that we should look at that seriously.\n  The Wall Street Journal said this:\n\n       For a politicized Justice Department, none can compare to \n     the Clinton Administration's, and the role that Mr. Holder \n     played in it deserves the fullest airing before he is given \n     the opportunity to return.\n\n  To return--he was Deputy Attorney General under President Clinton, \nthe second in command in the Department of Justice.\n  Richard Cohen from Mr. Holder's hometown paper, the Washington Post. \nMr. Cohen, who I think it is fair to say is a liberal columnist, \ncertainly not a conservative, I think probably recognized as a \nDemocrat, had some strong words. This is what Mr. Cohen, a longtime \ncolumnist, wrote in the Washington Post:\n\n       Holder was involved, passively or not, in just the sort of \n     inside-the-Beltway influence peddling that Barack Obama was \n     elected to end. He is not one of Obama's loathed lobbyists; \n     was merely their instrument--a good man, certainly, who just \n     as certainly did a bad thing. Maybe he deserves an \n     administration job, just not the one he's getting.\n\n  Well, in October of last year, before the election and after Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales was forced to resign because really he did not manage \nhis Department well--I think little has shown that he had a malicious \nintent, but he was forced to resign, and the chairman and the ranking \nmember, Chairman Leahy, the Democrat, and the ranking Republican, \nSenator Specter, published a joint op-ed in the Politico newspaper. \nThey made clear that they expected the next nominee to be independent \nof political influence and loyal to the rule of law, and the Department \nof Justice personnel.\n  They said this:\n\n       The attorney general must hold everyone, no matter how \n     powerful, accountable to the law. Any nominee must have a \n     visceral commitment to pursuing and achieving justice, and a \n     record of doing just that.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       Finally, the attorney general must be someone who deeply \n     appreciates and respects the work and commitment of the \n     thousands of men and women who work in the branches and \n     divisions of the Department of Justice day in and day out, \n     without regard to politics or ideology, doing their best to \n     enforce the law and promote justice.\n\n  Well, I agree with that. So I would hope that in the process going \nforward, that we do take the time to analyze some of these allegations \nand dig into why Mr. Cohen, or the New York Times or the Wall Street \nJournal has expressed serious reservations about this most important \nnominee.\n  The Marc Rich pardon--let me tell you why that is troubling to me as \na longtime U.S. attorney. Very few people obtain pardons. That is just \nthe way it is. Thousands apply. I have a bunch of them who write me \nright now, and they want me to help them get their pardon. Little \npeople, who committed small drug crimes; maybe forged a check; maybe \ndid something that violated Federal law in some fashion, are convicted \nand charged, and they do not get pardons. In fact, the process is set \nup with a pardon attorney. They have to complete their time in prison, \nthey have to complete their parole, and only after a period of time of \ngood behavior, only after that does a pardon attorney even consider \ntheir application for a pardon. But the President of the United States \nis constitutionally empowered\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So the President is constitutionally empowered to do \nthe pardon.\n  So in the instance of Marc Rich, this was a major fraud case. He was \nindicted--one of the largest fraud cases in the country. He was a \nfugitive. He never reported and answered the indictment against him, as \nI understand. He was a fugitive, at least, and did not come and show up \nfor trial. For some reason, over the strong objections of the \nprosecutor involved in the case, the President of the United States, \nwith a positive recommendation from then-Deputy Attorney General \nHolder, granted that pardon. Of course, we know that through some \nmethod, Marc Rich--he, or people close to him, had been a very \nsubstantial contributor to matters of importance to the Clintons, to \nPresident Clinton personally. It was not a good deal. That was not a \ngood deal. It was wrong. And every little person who has asked for a \npardon and did not get it and deserved it 99 times more than Marc Rich \ndid has a right to be offended. The rule of law and the respect for the \nDepartment of Justice was definitely lowered by that act. I wish Deputy \nAttorney General Holder had done the right thing, which was tell \nPresident Clinton: President Clinton, you cannot do this, and if you do \nthis, my resignation will be on your desk. I cannot serve in an \nadministration that would issue this pardon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. I do not know Eric Holder, whom President-elect Barack \nObama has nominated to serve as our next Attorney General. I had an \ninteresting conversation with one of the topmost senior people within \nthe Department of Justice, serving in the current administration, who \ndescribed the nomination as ``a brilliant choice.'' So we will find out \nwhether it was.\n  Before I came here, I served for 8 years as Governor. At one time, I \nwas State treasurer, as my colleague, the Presiding Officer, was, both \ntreasurer and insurance commissioner for the State of Florida. I served \non the Board of Pardons as State treasurer for 6 years and then later \non as Governor for another 8 years to consider the recommendations of \nthe Board of Pardons as to whether people should have a sentence \ncommuted or whether they should be pardoned for some crime they had \ncommitted. I always got advice from our legal counsel, got advice from \nthe Board of Pardons itself, but in the end the buck stopped with me as \nthe Governor, and I made the decision. Whether it was well received or \nnot, I never blamed my counsel for the advice he or she had given me. \nAt the end of the day, I think that is probably the case at the Federal \nlevel as well.\n  But we look forward to receiving the nomination and having a full \nhearing, a fair hearing so that this nominee can defend himself, \npresent his case and his credentials to us. I hope what the senior \nDepartment of Justice official said to me about this nomination, that \nit was a brilliant choice, will indeed prove to be the case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10919-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10919-S10922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY LOAN\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, what I want to do is take the next 8 or 9 \nminutes to talk about the issue we are waiting for, waiting to address \nhere hopefully later this evening, and the issue is whether we are \ngoing to provide--not a grant, not a gift, not a bailout to two auto \ncompanies, GM and Chrysler, but whether we are going to provide them a \nloan.\n  Some of you recall 28 years ago when Chrysler was in difficult \nstraits and their CEO, Lee Iacocca, called on the Federal Government to \nprovide a loan. We did not do that; we provided a loan guarantee. \nChrysler made a lot of changes within the company to reduce their \ncosts, to make them a low-cost provider of vehicles, and they came back \nto health. The loan was repaid. Federal taxpayers actually made\n\n[[Page S10920]]\n\nmoney, about $300 million on the deal, because we had taken--in return \nfor taking on the risk of making that loan, we got warrants, and we \nconverted those warrants into stock, which Treasury sold and made about \n$300 million.\n  Today, I think the thing that has been dragging this process down is \nthe question of, as we think about providing a loan to Chrysler and a \nloan to General Motors, what can we do to make sure that within that \ncompany--labor, management, bondholders, lenders, dealers--how do we \nbest ensure that they are going to make the further sacrifices, shared \nsacrifices, to make GM and Chrysler a lower-cost competitor, so that \nwhen they emerge from this process and begin operating with these \nloans, how can we make sure they will be successful, not just for a \ncouple of months but how are we going to be encouraged that they will \nbe successful for years--actually, for decades, as Chrysler was \nsubsequent to our 1980 involvement.\n  The two positions that we are looking at--one is a negotiated deal by \nthe White House and by Chairman Dodd and others here in the Senate that \nsays we want to put in place a car czar--sort of like a trustee, if you \nwill, almost like a bankruptcy trustee--whose job it would be to work \nwith the relevant stakeholders, folks I already mentioned--labor, \nmanagement, lenders, bondholders, dealers and others--to ensure that \nthey make the kinds of sacrifices and reductions that will lead to \nmaking GM and Chrysler more vibrant, more competitive when the economy \nrecovers and people start buying cars, trucks, and vans again. So on \nthe one hand, that is what the administration has proposed and what \nSenator Dodd and others have negotiated with them.\n  On the other hand, we have some of our friends on the Republican side \nhere in the Senate who believe it is appropriate for the Senate almost \nto sort of stipulate the conditions of this shared sacrifice, almost \nfor the Senate to serve not exactly but kind of like the bankruptcy \njudge or almost to be the car czar itself and to put those changes in \nlegislative language.\n  So those are sort of the two positions where we are, and we have been \nsort of in a logjam for much of the day. I am encouraged that there is \nstill good will on both sides, and a lot of folks have been involved in \nthese negotiations. Hopefully, we are finally coming closer to some \nconsensus, and not one where we actually have the Congress playing the \nrole of bankruptcy judge but we do take some steps to better ensure \nthat the additional cost savings that are needed are realized so that \nthese companies will be successful for a long period of time.\n  I rode down on the train today. Before I got on the train, I ran into \nsomebody. Like our Presiding Officer, I like to work out almost every \nday. I stopped off at the central YMCA in Wilmington. While I was \nthere, this one fellow who had just bought a Chevrolet came up to me.\n  He said: Tell me that if you all are going to do something, I will \nstill have a dealer to take my car to to have it serviced and for the \nwarranty to be good.\n  I said: There is nothing I can promise you for sure, but we don't \nwant to just walk away from the industry and see these folks go down.\n  But I am convinced there are a lot of people who, frankly, would like \nto drive a car, truck, or van, and they might want to buy a product \nfrom Ford, Chrysler, or GM. Before they do that, they want to make sure \nthe dealer and the company will be around for a while, for however long \nthey will own their vehicle, so if they do have a problem and it needs \nwarranty work they will get that; if they have a problem in the years \nahead and they need parts, they can get them; if they need service, \nthey will be able to get that as well. That uncertainty is keeping \npeople from buying vehicles.\n  The other factor is the captive financing arms of the car companies--\nGMAC, Chrysler Financial, and Ford Financial. They not only help \nprovide people who want to buy cars with loans to enable them to buy \ntheir vehicles, they also help finance dealer inventory. If a dealer \nwants to finance inventory, they have to get the money from someplace. \nSometimes they can get it from the local banks, sometimes they can't. \nSometimes they get that financing from the captive finance vehicle of \neach of the auto companies.\n  The captive financing arm also will make loans and then they will \ntake those loans and bundle them and securitize them and sell them \naround the country and around the world to provide more money to be \nused to either finance auto loans or, in some cases, finance the \ninventory for dealers to put on their parking lots and showrooms. As we \ngo through this, one of the things we have to do is not only hopefully \nwork out this deal so we figure out who is going to play the role of \nthe Federal bankruptcy judge with respect to these two companies, \nwithout going into bankruptcy, so we can make sure these companies will \nbe around and provide warranty work and parts and service, but how do \nwe make sure the captive financing arms start working again as they are \nsupposed to.\n  We have a lot of banks that haven't been providing the kind of loans \nto families, small businesses for working capital, for kids to go to \ncollege and people to buy homes and cars. We have been working on that \nfor a couple months. Liquidity is freeing up a little bit. But as we \ndeal with that and with the more immediate issue of the near-term \nsurvival of Ford and Chrysler and GM, it is important that we also keep \nin mind the captive finance arms and how we can make sure they are in a \nposition, like banks being able to lend money, the financial arms of \nthe car companies are able to lend money as well. That may be a battle \nfor another day but not very far down the line.\n  I am encouraged that some progress is being made. I wanted to express \nmy thanks for the people of Delaware. We have a Chrysler plant in my \nState that has been there for about 60 years. We make the SUVs for \nChrysler. We build the Dodge Durangos and the Chrysler Aspens. They \nwere selected as the best SUVs in terms of quality by JD Powers. That \nplant will be closed in 20 days, a plant that I have worked to keep \nopen for 28 years. It is painful for me and for the people who have \nworked there, who still work there. But it is going to happen. We have \na GM plant not far from there in Wilmington where we make all the \nSaturn Skys. We not only sell those in this country, we sell them \naround the world. We export them to South Korea. We sell the Saturn Sky \nin about 15 or so countries in Europe. It is a very good vehicle. We \nare proud of the work they do. I have believed over the years in making \nsure these plants stay alive and make a good product. They do a great \njob on quality, productivity, and labor-management relations. We are \nvery proud of both plants and their workforce, management and labor \npeople, and the record they have achieved.\n  We want to make sure our Chrysler plant, as they are shut down and a \nlot of people are going to be losing jobs, we want to make sure the \nfolks who work there, the people who build the Durangos and Aspens, we \nthink those are hands that can also build windmill turbines for the \nwindmill farm we will put off the coast of Rehobeth Beach starting a \nyear or two from now. Those are hands that can build solar energy \npanels and can build homes with geothermal heating and cooling, can \nbuild a new nuclear powerplant on the other side of the Delaware River. \nThere is plenty they can do in terms of providing clean energy, in \nterms of providing us with a reduction in fossil fuels, and to enable \nus to build products that we can sell around the world to reduce our \ntrade deficit. I think it is important, as we face a very sad closure \nof our Chrysler plant in Newark, that we have in place not just in \nNewark but in all kinds of plants around the country training programs \nthat will help people who have a good work record. They want to be \ngainfully employed. They have good skills. Let's make sure they have \nthe opportunity to find jobs where they can make a real contribution.\n  I see we are joined by the Senator from Utah who may or may not want \nto speak. He is approaching the Presiding Officer. It is always good to \nwork with him. His presence always augers well for us doing something \nconstructive. Keep up the good work.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10921]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, earlier in the week I pointed out that I \nbelieve the best way for the big three automakers to reorganize, come \nout lean and aggressive and competitive, was through the reorganization \nprocedures in chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. So many companies \nhave taken advantage of it over the years. It is the regular order, as \nwe say in the Senate. It is what happens when companies are not able to \nmeet all of their debt obligations and payments. When this happens they \nseek protection under chapter 11.\n  The bankruptcy court has a desire that those companies be successful; \nthat they continue to operate; that people are not laid off; and that \nthe business is not liquidated as it would be if it had filed under \nchapter 7 of bankruptcy code. In chapter 11, every effort is made to \nhelp the company to survive; to eliminate the burdens and legacy costs \nor other problems they have that are pulling them down, making them \nnoncompetitive.\n  This week, on December 9, 2008, the Heritage Foundation published a \ndocument called ``Bankruptcy Is Best: Responding to Automakers' \nArguments Against Chapter 11 Restructuring.'' Mr. Andrew Grossman, a \nsenior legal policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, writes:\n\n       Though a bailout--\n\n  That is the Federal Government just giving money to the \ncorporations--\n\n     may be better for the automakers' current executives and \n     shareholders, restructuring in bankruptcy remains the best \n     choice for the automakers' continued viability and future \n     success.\n\n  In other words, a bankruptcy restructuring and reorganization will be \nin the best interest for American workers, employees and people who \nwant to buy American automobiles.\n  We have two cars in my home in Mobile, both of them are pushing \n100,000 miles, and both of them are American big three automobiles. I \nam very happy with them. A lot of people want these automobiles. But \nthe best way to keep the company going, experts say, is through this \nestablished legal procedure of bankruptcy, not some special bailout. We \nhave heard this argument: Bankruptcy would lead to failure and millions \nof jobs lost. The Heritage Foundation responds: ``Bankruptcy protection \nactually prevents failure.''\n\n  Mr. Grossman notes that when a person files bankruptcy, ``it does not \nmean that the business and its assets will `fail'--that is, cease \noperations. Many companies, including the bulk of the airline industry \nfollowing 9/11, have entered bankruptcy, reorganized under its \nprotection, and then emerged as stronger, sustainable businesses.''\n  That is so true and it is so important to say. Grossman and the \nHeritage Foundation went on to note:\n\n       Once a company has filed for bankruptcy, it receives an \n     automatic stay and may suspend payment of all debts, giving \n     it breathing room to take stock of its assets and situation.\n\n  Once you file bankruptcy, everybody knows about bankruptcy. I am not \nan expert, but I have been involved with it off and on. I helped write \nthe 2005 bankruptcy reform bill. But in bankruptcy, every lawsuit, \nevery claim against your money is stayed. You don't have to pay them \noff. The judge takes over and makes sure that payments are done in a \nway that is fair to everyone concerned.\n  The next argument: Automobile makers are too complex for bankruptcy. \nThe Heritage Foundation report says:\n\n       Fact: The bankruptcy process is designed to confront and \n     resolve complex problems and has successfully done so many \n     times in the past.\n\n  By chance, one of Alabama's best bankruptcy lawyers was in my office \njust yesterday. I have known him and respected him. He is totally \nindependent of the circumstance.\n  I asked him: What do you think?\n  He said: Chapter 11 is perfect for these companies. It is exactly \nwhat is needed. It is set up to handle these kind of circumstances. \nPeople keep confusing reorganization under chapter 11, like Delta \nAirlines went through, with liquidation under chapter 7 bankruptcy \nwhere there is no hope of saving the company. They are saying: If you \ngo into bankruptcy, it means the company is doomed. That is not so.\n  As to the complexity of the matter, the Heritage Foundation report \nsays: ``It is a universal feature of bankruptcy law that creditors and \nother stakeholders''--that is, creditors, people who are claiming money \nfrom GM, Ford, or Chrysler--that they can ``be forced to accept \nconcessions that are necessary to maximize the common pool. Thus some \ndebtors may see their claims transformed into equities stakes''--that \nis, stock in the company--``so that a business, free of debt, can \noperate profitably and sustainably. Others may receive pennies on the \ndollar. Collective bargaining agreements may, as described further \nbelow, be modified to put costs in line with industry norms, and other \ncontracts may be rejected. In contrast, a bailout''--that is what we \nare talking about, giving the automakers money--``fails entirely to \naddress the complexity of the automakers' problems. Unlike the finely \nhoned tools of bankruptcy reorganization, a bailout fails to provide \nany mechanism (other than money) to restructure debt, repudiate \ncontracts, or renegotiate labor agreements. In short, bankruptcy is a \nsolution to the complexity.''\n  The report goes on to say:\n\n       And these features are most valuable in large and complex \n     cases that would be impossible otherwise.\n\n  The Heritage report goes on to note that chapter 11 organizations \nhave included energy and finance giant Conseco; Delta Airlines; the \nparent corporation of United Airlines; telecom giant WorldCom, now MCI; \nTexaco; Adelphia Communications; and Global Crossing. All those have \nbeen in bankruptcy and have come out reorganized.\n  The report continues:\n\n       Despite this enormous complexity, all of these businesses \n     were able to reorganize under the protection of the \n     bankruptcy process and emerge as viable, competitive \n     businesses.\n\n  And these companies did all of this without, let me add, a penny of \nGovernment money being put into them.\n  What about the argument that you could not renegotiate labor \nagreements in bankruptcy? The Heritage Foundation and Mr. Grossman \nfound this:\n\n       Chapter 11 provides a straightforward mechanism, \n     unavailable outside of bankruptcy, to modify collective \n     bargaining agreements to adapt to economic realities.\n\n  The report sets forth some of the additional protections that labor \nhas and additional proofs that have to be made to modify a labor \ncontract, but the evidence is taken, and labor contracts can be \nmodified to help make the business viable. But do not miss the fact \nthat the law provides workers a very fair chance to defend their \nlegitimate interests.\n  The report concludes on this question:\n\n       Thus, the bankruptcy judge has significant discretion and \n     power to push the parties toward an agreement that is \n     mutually acceptable, conforms to economic realities, and \n     ensures that the business is able to return to profitability.\n\n  They go on and note about the bailout, however:\n\n       A bailout, in contrast, would likely provide no new legal \n     authority to achieve this result.\n\n  Now, there is an argument being made that restructuring in bankruptcy \nwould not work because sufficient debtor-in-possession financing is not \navailable for an automaker in the current economic climate. Let me \nexplain how debtor-in-possession financing works. If a company were to \nfile for chapter 11 protection, then a judge takes control, has \nhearings and listens to testimony, keep in mind there is a stay in \nplace that holds off the debtors making claims for money, that judge \nthen may find that for the company to survive, it may need to borrow \nmore money. The court can induce a private lender to loan the \ncorporation money, that is, financing a debtor who remains in \npossession. That lender then gets a priority over every other claim to \nthe company because it is the money that keeps the company surviving.\n  I would say that were this scenario to play out, as I just described, \nI would be quite willing to consider legitimate assistance from the \nFederal Government in a way that would provide maximum protection to \nthe taxpayer and would also provide a maximum opportunity for the \ncompany to be successful. That is the way the law provides for. That is \nthe way every corporation I know of\n\n[[Page S10922]]\n\nthat gets in trouble has to be handled. I do not see the advantage of \nproviding one special industry billions and billions of dollars bailout \nwhen we know this $14 billion is just the first installment. One \neconomist has predicted it would be $75 billion to $125 billion before \nwe are through. So this minimal, legitimate government assistance as a \nprovider of debtor-in-possession financing would be a better way to do \nit.\n  Proponents of chapter 11 for automobile companies include Luigi \nZingales of the University of Chicago and Edward Altman of New York \nUniversity's Stern School of Business. They explain how this government \nsupported debtor-in-possession mechanism operates. They note that:\n\n       This option would be superior to a nonbankruptcy bailout \n     because it would provide greater protection (bankruptcy's \n     ``super-priority'')--\n\n  To the person who puts in the money at the end to make the company \nviable--\n\n     to taxpayers, would do more to force the automakers to reform \n     their operations while providing them greater flexibility to \n     do so, and would be more likely to succeed.\n\n  I know some ideas have been floated recently; that our distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Corker from Tennessee, has proposed that we may well \nbe able to accomplish most of these things without going into \nbankruptcy. We are studying that. But his proposal has the hammer that \nif agreements are reached to modify and protect the companies from \nclaimants, then they would be required to go into bankruptcy.\n  One of the problems of Congress trying to fix the problem and the \nautomakers not going into bankruptcy is a constitutional problem. \nBankruptcy courts modify in part and sometimes invalidate in part, and \nentirely, portions of contracts. That is a great power and the \nConstitution provides for this use of bankruptcy.\n  I am not sure we in Congress can pass a law that could invalidate \ncontracts. I have argued we should go in that direction always, I hope \nmy colleagues understand, under the belief that this is the regular \norder; this is the proper legal way for a company to reorganize itself \nand survive if it is in financial difficulties.\n  We need to quit giving special privileges where they are not needed. \nSuch behavior ought to be kept to the most narrow, special benefits \noutside of the traditional free market principles that have made this \ncountry great. If we have to go around them or violate them or bend a \nbit because of the size and the number of people who might be involved, \nwell, let's do so within our heritage as much as possible, within the \nrule of law as much as possible. I think that is the best way to do it.\n  So I wished to share my thoughts with my colleagues. I would urge \nthem, if they are interested in the details, to look into the Web site \nof the Heritage Foundation to examine what this bankruptcy report study \nshows and why, according to their report: ``Bankruptcy Is Best.'' I \nbelieve it is.\n  I thank the Chair and also express my appreciation for what I \nunderstand to be some progress toward reaching a proposal we could vote \non in this body that would be much better than the one that has \noriginally been put forward by the Democratic leader and the White \nHouse. I do not think the President or the Democratic leader has it \nright. I think a lot of other Members of this body do not feel like \nthey have it right. What we need to do is to do what we can to assist \nthese companies through a very difficult period of time, to give them \nan opportunity to eliminate some of the excessive burden they have been \ncarrying so that when they enter into the race to the competitive \nmarketplace, they will be leaner and more efficient and more capable of \nbeing successful, more able to be competitive, and can restore their \nvigor and vitality.\n  We have to do that, and they have to get out from under some of these \nburdens. I personally think the best way to do that is through \nbankruptcy. It may be that some of the work Senator Corker and others \nhave worked on can get us there in a slightly different way. I am open \nto that thought and certainly am desirous of a conclusion that could \ngain bipartisan support.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10922-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10922-S10927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, approximately 20 minutes ago the negotiation \nteam broke up for purposes of having Senator Corker, who has worked \nsince 2:30 this morning on the compromise, see if we could get this \nlegislation over the finish line. It is my understanding he is making a \npresentation to the Republican caucus as we speak, to see if they will \naccept his compromise.\n  It has been a difficult negotiation, principally conducted by \nSenators Corker and Dodd. Senator Durbin has represented me in those \nmeetings.\n  I am hopeful we can finish this matter tonight. I do not know what \nthe odds are that the Republican caucus will accept the work done by \nSenator Corker and others but we should know soon. I am sorry it is \n8:30 at night and people have been here--I received a call from one \nSenator who has been here since early this morning and wishes to leave \nand come back tomorrow. There are other Senators who have flights early \nin the morning to go other places. They hope we could finish tonight. \nOne of those other places is home. They have family waiting for them.\n  I wish I could be more dictatorial and say we are going to vote right \nnow, but I do not have that ability. If everyone will be patient, we \nshould know within a half hour or so if they can work something out.\n  We are ready to go. I think with rare exception the Democrats \nunderstand this is Christmas season, that there is a lot of hardship \nout there. People are losing their jobs, losing their homes, losing \ntheir cars, and losing their patience. We Democrats believe this \nChristmas season we do not need to pile on. If we are not able to work \nsomething out, 2.5 million people are going to be directly impacted and \nmillions of others will be impacted. This is Christmastime and I hope \nwe can give the American people a gift of hope that we are going to \nwind up with an automobile manufacturing industry that will be stronger \nand more reliable. Certainly that is our desire. We hope our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, the Republicans, will recognize the good \nwork done by Senator Corker and others and finish this matter tonight.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am dismayed by the turn of events that \nhave occurred this evening.\n  Our Nation faces economic conditions not seen in decades. By \npreventing action tonight on a plan to give the auto industry a chance \nto turn itself around, the minority is playing with fire.\n  The jobs of countless workers, including thousands in Rhode Island, \nare on the line, at a time when we can ill afford more losses. \nMoreover, these companies going into bankruptcy could be far more \ncostly to the federal government. And, as economist Mark Zandi \ntestified before the Senate Banking Committee last week, if these \ncompanies are forced into bankruptcy proceedings, it would have a \ncataclysmic effect on our already fragile economy.\n  The bill that Chairman Dodd and my other colleagues worked on \ndiligently had the potential to give the industry a chance to put its \nhouse in order while preserving jobs and protecting the taxpayers. I \nregret we did not have a chance to proceed to this measure, engage in \nvigorous debate, and make a judgment on the merits.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have been very vocal in my support of \nthe U.S. auto industry and have gone on the record saying that we need \nto do whatever is necessary to help the auto industry become strong and \neconomically viable. But we need to be realistic and fiscally \nresponsible in our approach to the troubles facing this and other \nindustries. I cannot support the proposal before us today. We simply \ncannot leave the American taxpayer with a tab of tens of billions of \ndollars without some serious concessions from the industry and some \nassurance of the domestic auto manufacturers' long-term viability, \notherwise, we are just\n\n[[Page S10923]]\n\nthrowing good taxpayer money after bad business decisions.\n  I have great faith in the skills, energy and ingenuity of the \nAmerican auto worker. This crisis is not their fault. I am committed to \nmaking sure that U.S. auto workers are not left to fend for themselves. \nOurs is the finest workforce in the world, able to compete with anyone. \nI stand ready to ensure that Washington does its job so they can do \ntheirs.\n  But simply throwing money at the industry is not the way to ensure \nits long-term viability or to help stabilize our economy. As we all \nhave learned in the past few weeks, the domestic auto manufacturers are \nin much worse shape than we could even imagine, with one company, GM, \nannouncing they may not survive through this year without Federal help. \nBut why is it that Toyota sells approximately the same number of cars \nthat GM does and is profitable?\n  Clearly, the automakers will need to change dramatically the way they \ndo business if they hope to be on course for long-term profitability. \nRather than seeking an unconditional handout from the taxpayer, \nindustry leaders must first consider how they can restructure their \nbusiness models in order to fix the problem themselves and build more \ncompetitive products--including changes in management, renegotiating \nlabor agreements, and reorganizing under the bankruptcy process. And, \nthey should have been doing so months, if not years, ago. And if the \nbankruptcy laws need to be changed, then the Congress should do that.\n  The automakers need to prove to Congress and the American people that \nthey are serious about making the changes necessary to ensure their \nlong-term success before they seek further assistance from the \ntaxpayer. As noted Harvard University economics professor Martin \nFeldstein wrote: ``the goal of restructuring should not just be to \nrequire the companies to make cars that are fuel-efficient and more \nenvironmentally sound . . . although that can be included in the \ngovernment's list of requirements. The goal should be to put companies \non a course that will allow them to survive for the long term, \nproducing cars and creating jobs.'' I fully agree with Professor \nFeldstein.\n  The auto industry executives, as well as many of my colleagues, have \nargued that bankruptcy is not an option. But given what we now know \nabout their financial situation, why not? Shouldn't we be considering \nevery option possible to allow these companies to restructure their \noperations so they can keep people employed? Chapter 11 bankruptcy was \ncreated precisely for the situation in which these automakers find \nthemselves--where creditors' claims exceed a company's assets. It may \nbe the best option. The executives leading these companies have an \nobligation to their shareholders and employees to weigh carefully that \nviable option.\n  After all, filing for bankruptcy forces a company to make some very \ndifficult choices and the automakers would be no exception. The \nautomakers would be forced to renegotiate collective bargaining \nagreements to make themselves more competitive, to eliminate some \ndealership networks and car models that are underperforming, and to \nmake other difficult cost cutting decisions regarding real estate, \nmanagement compensation, personnel, and even office supplies. It seems \nthese companies may only make these difficult decisions if they file \nfor bankruptcy.\n  Additionally, bankruptcy would allow the cost cutting process to \nproceed without any political interference from Congress or special \ninterests. If Congress provides a bailout for these companies, there is \nno doubt that legislators will weigh in when the automakers attempt to \nrenegotiate labor agreements, trim dealerships in a lawmaker's home \nState or eliminate a car model manufactured in a lawmaker's district. \nBankruptcy will allow these decisions to be made purely based on \nfinancial considerations and under the supervision of a bankruptcy \njudge. Many corporations have filed for bankruptcy and emerged better \nequipped to serve consumers and face their competitors. Bankruptcy is \nnot an option that should just be written off.\n  Now, I would like to mention some of my specific concerns about the \npending proposal, negotiated by the Democrats and the White House.\n  My first concern I have already discussed, the fact that the \ntaxpayers are asked to foot the bill upfront, almost as a first \ndownpayment, without concessions or assurances of the industry's future \nviability.\n  Another troubling aspect of this bill rests with the so-called ``Car \nCzar.'' Will this individual have the authority to invalidate contracts \nlegally entered into by these companies? What in this legislation would \nprevent lawsuits from being filed due to nullified contracts? What is \nto prevent the next President, or the one after that, from firing this \ncar czar if he or she disagrees with what the car czar seeks to impose? \nAnd what in the bill gives the American people any assurances that the \ncompanies or the car czar won't enter into other obligations that \nultimately cost taxpayers even more money?\n  I fully agree that if we are to going to provide a single taxpayer \ndollar to this industry there must be very strict oversight in order to \nprotect the public's investment. Unfortunately, while this bill gives \nthe President's designee some oversight authority, it has no real \nteeth. The person appointed by the President would have no real \nauthority to insist on the fundamental changes necessary to promote the \ncorporations' viability and protect the taxpayer's investment. If we \nare going to hand over billions and billions of taxpayer dollars, we \nshould at least consider requiring Senate confirmation of an individual \nwith proven business leadership skills who will serve for a defined \nperiod of time. This would remove the possibility of the designee \nfalling victim to the political pressure often felt by those who serve \nat the pleasure of the President--allowing that person to make \ndecisions based solely on the best interest of the taxpayer--not on \npolitical considerations.\n\n  Another area of concern for me surrounds what seems to me a lack of \nreality on the part of the domestic auto manufacturers. More and more \nAmericans want to purchase energy-saving vehicles. Yet the domestic \nauto industry seems to be fighting tooth and nail against that reality. \nAnd if it does not wake up immediately, nothing Congress can do will \nhelp the industry survive. It needs to be competitive. It needs \ncustomers to buy its vehicles. And it won't have many customers if it \ndoesn't take action to build vehicles with higher fuel efficiency \nstandards that help our Nation end our crippling dependence on foreign \noil.\n  Finally, the bill includes provisions wholly unrelated to the issue \nat hand, such as language authorizing a pay raise for U.S. judges. Why \nin the world is it necessary to address this issue in this bill? I am \nnot questioning the merits of the provision--I am sure the overwhelming \nmajority of our judges work very hard and deserve a raise--but such a \nprovision has no business being addressed in this manner and at this \ntime when so many are doing more with less. This authorization should \nbe addressed in the proper way by the appropriate authorizing \ncommittee.\n  If we allow this $14 billion to be doled out to the automakers with \nso few conditions and no concessions--who comes next? And how long \nbefore they return seeking billions more? A recent editorial in the \nWashington Post noted that:\n\n     the impending collapse of General Motors presents Congress \n     and the President with a choice between two domino effects, \n     both potentially damaging to the U.S. economy if the federal \n     government does not lend GM money and the company goes \n     bankrupt, the repercussions will spread throughout the \n     country by way of the network of suppliers, dealers and local \n     businesses that depend on GM and the other car manufacturers \n     for their livelihoods. This could destroy hundreds of \n     thousands of jobs when the economy can ill afford another \n     shock. But if the federal government, frightened by these \n     possibilities, gives GM just what it wants, it will be \n     setting a precedent for even more multibillion-dollar \n     bailouts--of automakers and of other troubled companies. The \n     closure of DHL's operation in Wilmington, Ohio, is costing \n     9,000 people their jobs; Circuit City's bankruptcy means \n     about 7,800 layoffs. If Detroit and its relatively well-\n     compensated workforce qualify for Federal aid, why not these \n     firms and workers, too?\n\n  We need to be very careful here lest we slide down the slippery slope \nof a taxpayer funded bailout for every ailing business in America--\nlarge or small.\n\n[[Page S10924]]\n\n  Let me be clear. I am very sympathetic to the plight of the auto \nindustry. But the proposal before us seeks to hand over $14 billion to \ncompanies who have yet to tell the Congress and the American people--in \nany detail--how they plan to restructure their operations and become \nviable in the long-term. Their gross inaction to date causes me great \npause. And that is why I cannot support the measure before us.\n  I am pleased to see that many are working hard to find an acceptable \ncompromise. I am hopeful that we can reach a suitable agreement.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this is not a proud moment in America's \neconomic history. Our once proud automakers have come to Washington hat \nin hand asking for a loan with their future, and the future of their \nworkers, at stake. In exchange for a Government loan they are willing \nto submit to intrusive Government oversight, surrender their executive \nperks, and give the American taxpayer a stake in any future profits. As \na businessman I am stunned that it has come to this.\n  However, I am voting for the Auto Industry Financing and \nRestructuring Act because I want to see the American auto industry \nsucceed. Under this bill, $15 billion would be provided to GM, Ford and \nChrysler in short-term loans that will be paid back with interest. To \navoid bankruptcy and emerge as stronger businesses, this plan requires \nthe big three to submit long-term restructuring plans no later than \nMarch 31, 2009. If they do not then they will have their loans revoked \nand be plunged into bankruptcy. Just like other industries that are \nforced to restructure, the automakers and labor unions will need to \nmake tough choices concerning benefits, wages and pensions to ensure \ntheir long-term viability.\n  As a businessman, I am concerned about a Government appointed ``car \nczar'' who would have oversight and direct involvement over the \noperations of the automakers. I am worried that no matter how badly \nmanaged Detroit has been so far, a Government bureaucrat is unlikely to \ndo a better job. I hope that whoever is found to take this difficult \njob has the experience, drive, and business savvy to help turn around \nthis struggling industry.\n  In the end I am supporting this bill because of the 46,000 well-\npaying jobs in Wisconsin that are tied to the auto industry. With the \njobs report last week stating that the economy lost 533,000 jobs in \nNovember alone, we can't afford to put more Americans out of work. The \nGovernment has already begun to help Wall Street, now it is time to \nhelp Main Street. I am disappointed that we were not able to agree on a \ndeal tonight. I am hopeful that a bipartisan solution can be reached \nbefore it is too late.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one of the most renowned former Members of \nthis legislative body once said ``Ask not what your country can do for \nyou, but what you can do for your country.'' With bailout after \nbailout, asking what our country can do for failing companies seems to \nbe the norm. Today, it appears that our Government has become the \nbackstop to financing private companies to hope for long-term \nviability.\n  The biggest three U.S. automobile manufacturers, Chrysler, General \nMotors, and Ford, are asking Congress to provide a loan in order for \nthem to weather a recession and give them time to restructure. What we \nneed to decide is not whether we will assist, but how we will assist \nthe troubled auto industry. While I believe there are already some \nmeasures in place to assist the automakers, it would be beneficial to \nexamine whether these measures are sufficient. If these measures are \ninsufficient, we should look to what can be done to change our system \nso that it benefits both the auto industry and the taxpayer.\n  Most Americans are asking how the big three found themselves in this \nmess. The big three are victims of a financial perfect storm. Our \nfailing economy toppled an industry that was already facing stiff \nforeign competition, mounting legacy costs, government mandates, and \npoor management decisions.\n  The dramatic decline in automobile sales worldwide shows that the \ndecline of the big three is not solely the result of poor management. \nAll auto sales, both foreign and domestic, have declined significantly \nfor 13 straight months. The sales rate last month was the worst in \nnearly 30 years, since October 1982. In November, sales declined at \nrate of 36.7 percent from the same month a year ago. It was also the \nworst month on record for Asian automakers.\n  Legacy costs primarily refer to a company's obligations from pervious \nyears, such as costs the big three pay for health care and pensions \nunder defined-benefit plans for current employees and retirees. \nFurthermore, the auto industry has been forced to pay union workers for \nshifts even when those workers are not working. It is estimated that \nthe big three pay each hourly autoworker $70 an hour in wages and \ncurrent and future benefits. In October 2005, a Detroit News article \nillustrated this burden.\n  ``Ken Pool is making good money. On weekdays, he shows up at 7 a.m. \nat Ford Motor Co.'s Michigan Truck Plant, signs in, and then starts \nworking--on a crossword puzzle. Pool hates the monotony, but the pay is \ngood: more than $31 an hour, plus benefits.'' The article further \nexplains that ``Ken Pool is one of more than 12,000 American \nautoworkers who, instead of installing windshields or bending sheet \nmetal, spend their days counting the hours in a jobs bank set up by \nDetroit automakers and Delphi Corp. as part of an extraordinary job \nsecurity agreement with the United Auto Workers union.''\n  While the United Auto Workers have conceded to temporarily suspending \nthe job bank and delaying payments to their retirement and health care \nfunds for current and future employees, these costs have already \nburdened the auto industry. It might be too little too late. We need to \nenact measures that will ensure that the unions can no longer create \nunreasonable mandates on our auto industry. We need to ensure that \nthese burdens do not persist.\n  To overcome these burdens, the big three say they were already in the \nprocess of restructuring. Chrysler has eliminated 1.2 million units of \ncapacity and reduced fixed costs by $2.4 billion. It has increased its \nmanufacturing productivity by 32 percent over the past 7 years. General \nMotors has made substantial progress in narrowing the gap with foreign \ncompetition in quality, productivity, and fuel efficiency. In other \nmarkets, such as China, Latin America and Russia, GM has grown rapidly \nand outperformed the competition. Unfortunately, our failing economy \nhas prevented these companies from reaping the benefits of their \nrestructuring.\n  The normal rules of a free market economy dictate that if a company \nruns out of money, then the company must close its doors. We have \nalready changed these rules by providing bankruptcy protection. In \nancient Greece, a banker conducted business transactions on a bench. \nWhen the banker could no longer lend or meet his obligations, the \nbanker would symbolically break his bench. A broken bench in Latin is \nreferred to as ``bankus ruptus'', which is the origin for the word \n``bankruptcy.''\n  It used to be that a person who became bankrupt and could no longer \npay his debts was considered a criminal. In the United States, however, \nbankruptcy laws were established during harsh economic times when a \nmass amount of people could no longer pay their debts. Those who were \nwilling to work toward repayment of debts would be allowed to cancel \nexisting debts and be protected from creditors. In the 1980s, an \nescalating number of bankruptcies inundated our courts. A ``pre-\npackaged bankruptcy'' was developed to allow companies and creditors to \nsubmit prenegotiated bankruptcy petitions to ensure a timely and cost-\neffective bankruptcy proceeding.\n  It appears that the big three auto manufacturers have severely \ncracked their bench if not already broken it. And now they are asking \nus to change the rules of a free market economy and go beyond the \nbenefits of existing bankruptcy protections. They believe that a \nchapter 11 bankruptcy would worsen consumer confidence, thereby dooming \nthem from the beginning.\n  I am fully aware of the impact our economy could face if the big \nthree go bust. It will likely trigger catastrophic damage to the U.S. \neconomy, precipitating failures among component and logistic suppliers, \nother domestic car manufacturers, raw material suppliers, technology \nand service providers, retailers and their suppliers. According\n\n[[Page S10925]]\n\nto a study by the Center for Automotive Research, an estimated 3 \nmillion Americans could find themselves jobless within a year of an \nauto manufacturer's collapse. We would also lose enormous improvements \nthrough research and development of advanced propulsion investments in \nsupport of greatly improved fuel efficiency, emissions reductions, and \nenergy independence. It is essential that something must be done to \nhalt this impact, but we need to do something carefully and something \nthat will ensure the long-term viability of these companies.\n  I truly believe that providing unrestricted funding to the big three \nwould only delay the inevitable. I believe that the only solution is to \nprovide the resources to empower these companies to consolidate and \nrestructure. The majority's proposal provides temporary funding to \nallow employees, retirees, trade unions, creditors, suppliers, \nautomobile dealers, and shareholders to come up with a plan that would \nbe reviewed by a President-appointed designee.\n  Upon review, the designee, or ``car czar,'' would determine whether \nthe plan guarantees a viable long-term restructure, then the designee \nwould recommend further funding. This process provides funding now and \nworries about viability later. While I am not a proponent of excessive \ngovernment intervention, I believe that if we are going to provide any \nfunding to the big three that it be conditioned upon reorganizing.\n  This is not an unprecedented event. The very same issue was being \ndiscussed by the Senate in 1979 about whether we should provide \nfinancial assistance to Chrysler. Nearly 30 years ago in December, I \nstood before this body and opposed providing loans to Chrysler. Back \nthen, Chrysler faced tough foreign competition and harsh economic \ntimes. The Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979 provided \n$1.5 billion in guaranteed loans to Chrysler. However, that legislation \nrequired matching private funds.\n  If that amount were adjusted for inflation, it would equal more than \n$4 billion today, which ironically is what Chrysler and General Motors \nsays they need to survive until next year. It is also, ironically, the \nsame amount that GM spent in 2007 on health care benefits for retirees \nand active workers.\n  The bill passed in 1979 and Chrysler became profitable and paid back \nthese loans 7 years early with $300 million in equity returns to the \nAmerican taxpayers. So there is the possibility that a loan to the big \nthree could become profitable for American taxpayers. But we should not \nthrow caution to the wind. In the past 30 years, the Government has \nnever provided a financial bailout to any company other than a \nfinancial institution besides the airline industry after 9/11 and \nChrysler in 1979, both heavily unionized.\n  We need to move away from becoming a government of nationalizing \nfailing companies toward a government that provides opportunities for \nsuccess. We all agree that we want to see these companies prosper, but \nwe disagree about how we believe this should be done. Under the \nmajority proposal, we are essentially asking each and every American \ntaxpayer to invest in the future of the big three without guaranteeing \nthat they will survive past March of next year. This is a risky bet. I \nbelieve that we can reduce the risk of that bet enormously by requiring \nthe big three to reorganize. Simply put, the majority does not provide \nenough assurances that the auto industry is committed to reducing \ncosts. Furthermore, their proposal requires the auto manufactures to \nenter into a chapter 11 bankruptcy if their plan of long term viability \nis determined not to be sufficient. We all know this is a farce, \nbecause we all know that the next administration will prevent the \nnecessity of filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy by giving them more \nmoney.\n  My proposal calls for allowing the auto manufacturers and the trade \nunions the opportunity to show the American people that they are \ncommitted to reducing costs before the Government gives them any loan. \nSpecifically, it would require that any bridge loan amount would be \nconditioned upon the amount of cost reduction concessions agreed to by \nmanagement and labor. In order to receive a temporary bridge loan, I \nbelieve that these groups need to hash out a sufficient plan to show \nthat they can pay back any loan amount that we provide. The auto \nmanufacturers have stated that time is of the essence and they need the \nmoney at the end of the year. If the auto manufacturers and unions are \nreally committed toward reducing costs, I believe that they can agree \nto a temporary plan by the end of the year. Time should not be an \nobstacle for Congress and the American people. In addition, I propose \nthat if the auto industry's plan is deemed insufficient that they \nshould be forced into a binding arbitration to avoid the obstacles of \nchapter 11 bankruptcy.\n  It is hard for me to believe that the majority is really serious \nabout providing a solid plan. Their leadership refuses to allow us to \noffer amendments and they have now added provisions aimed at providing \nrelief to municipalities, something irrelevant to the issue before us.\n  Mr. President, we are entering the holiday season with our desire to \nassist the failing auto industry. While we all wanted to provide \npositive solutions, the most powerful deliberative body in the world is \nprohibited from deliberating one of the most pressing issues of our \ntime. It is unfortunate that we cannot proceed in a collaborative \nmanner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as I have mentioned, GM, Ford, and \nChrysler have a long and heralded history in our country and its \nnational security.\n  There are few in the Senate today old enough to remember Pearl Harbor \nand the commencement of our military operations that followed. As one \nof those, I was privileged to serve as a 17- to 18-year-old sailor in \nthe last year of WWII.\n  America was victorious in WWII because of those in uniform and those \nat home supporting them--particularly the industrial manufacturing \nbase. The factory floor went to war.\n  At this time, I would like to have printed in the Record historical \ninformation outlining the contributions the auto manufacturers made to \nAmerica's World War II war effort.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       General Motors:\n       With America's entry into World War II, no company \n     converted faster or more comprehensively to wartime \n     production than General Motors. It has been called the \n     greatest industrial transformation in history, with more than \n     200 plants in North America shifting to production of \n     airplanes, tanks, machine guns, and other military vehicles \n     and goods in a matter of months. General Motors alone \n     supplied the US forces with more than $12 billion in military \n     goods (several hundreds of billions when converted to today's \n     dollars), more than any other company.\n       Ford:\n       Ford Motor Company's mass production know-how was one of \n     the keys to the Allied victory.\n       By August 1941, Ford was producing huge 18-cylinder Pratt & \n     Whitney aircraft engines. By summer 1942, Ford's Rouge Plant \n     was building 805 aircraft engines a month, while Pratt & \n     Whitney's plant was building only 600 aircraft engines a \n     month. In total, Ford built 58,000 aircraft engines during \n     the war.\n       Most notably, Ford produced the B-24 ``Liberator'' bomber \n     at its Willow Run plant. With government support, Ford built \n     the Willow Run plant on about 1,750 acres of former farmland \n     near the village of Willow Run, between Detroit and Ann \n     Arbor. All together, Ford produced about 8,700 B-24s, nearly \n     half of the total built for the US military during the war.\n       Ford also played a role in the success of the US Army Air \n     Force glider program. Ford was asked to build the gliders in \n     March 1942 and production began that December. Ford \n     eventually produced 4,400 gliders during the war.\n       In addition, the US Government asked Ford to adapt its \n     aircraft engines to be used in medium tanks.\n       After 18 months of research and development at Ford's \n     expense, Ford set up a production line at the Lincoln plant \n     in Detroit and began making the tank engine. Over the course \n     of the war, Ford produced almost 27,000 of these engines.\n       The Army asked Ford to produce other tanks as well, \n     specifically the M-4 Sherman tank. Ford built almost 1,700 \n     Sherman tanks, including more than 1,000 M-10 tanks and \n     almost 13,000 armored cars.\n       The Army decided it needed a small, all-terrain vehicle, \n     and in 1940, Ford and Willys developed plans. Ford invested \n     $4 million in the program and began producing the ``General \n     Purpose,'' or ``G.P.,'' soon to be called ``jeep,'' in 1941. \n     There were 1,500 built by the spring of that year, and more \n     than 300,000 jeeps were built for the military over the next \n     four years.\n       After all of the tallies were added, the most important \n     thing that Ford contributed was the know-how and experience \n     to quickly\n\n[[Page S10926]]\n\n     mass-produce the vehicles, aircraft, and equipment which were \n     needed to win the most important war in the history of the \n     world.\n       Ford's precision in the machining of tools, and Ford's \n     ingenuity in designing an assembly line and making it work--\n     these were the biggest guns in Ford's arsenal of democracy.\n       Chrysler:\n       Chrysler's biggest contribution to the war effort was its \n     production of the M-3 tank, the Martin B-26 bomber, and the \n     40-millimeter anti-aircraft gun. By the end of the war, \n     Chrysler had developed and produced some 18,000 tanks and \n     supplied the Allies with approximately 500,000 Dodge trucks \n     and more than $3.4 billion worth of military equipment.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, hopefully, America and its Allies will \nnever face conflicts that would necessitate the defense production of \nthe foregoing magnitude. Further, the auto industrial base today, as it \nrelates to defense work, is vastly reduced.\n  But this base is the foundation of today's auto industry, which \ncould, once again, play a significant role in the defense of America.\n  I would like to conclude with remarks from my longtime friend and \ncolleague, Gen. James L. Jones, who is destined to be the National \nSecurity Adviser to President-elect Barack Obama:\n\n       The financial health of the domestic auto industry \n     suppliers is critical to national security. These suppliers \n     possess unique capabilities to design and manufacture \n     essential defense components should the United States need \n     them. We can't allow this critical piece of America's \n     manufacturing base to disappear.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today, I wish to offer my 2 cents on the \nlatest version of the Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act, or \nas most Kansans call it, the auto bailout.\n  As is often the case, the national debate over this issue has become \nmore about perception than reality. And, unfortunately, this bill seems \nto take aim at the perception of the problem rather than the actual \nproblem.\n  If this body truly wanted to help auto manufacturers and their \ndealers and their suppliers, we would force not only the management of \nthese companies to make tough choices but all involved, including their \ncreditors and labor.\n  And, Mr. President, we in Congress would need to make tougher \ndecisions as well.\n  Unfortunately, this bill offers the perception that concrete \nrestructuring plans will be made for the companies to receive \nassistance, but reality is that this bill lacks the real teeth to \nenforce the type of restructuring that so many believe is necessary to \nput this industry back on its feet.\n  If Congress were serious about turning the auto industry onto a path \nof profitability and stability, we would also need to look at our own \nactions that contributed to their current predicament.\n  This was articulated quite well in a Wall Street Journal piece \nyesterday. In recent years, Ford, GM, and Chrysler made money supplying \nvehicles that consumers wanted, and in doing so made a profit for the \ncompanies.\n  These vehicles were pickups and SUVs that met consumer needs. \nHowever, we in Congress decided that manufacturers shouldn't build many \nof these vehicles. We told the manufacturers that they should build the \nsmaller, less profitable, more fuel efficient cars that many Americans \ndon't want.\n  If you come out to my home town of Dodge City, you won't see many \nhybrids or little two-door cars that get 30 miles per gallon. No, you \nwill see Ford F-150s, Dodge Rams, and Chevy Silverados because my \nconstituents need pickups for their daily lives.\n  It is pretty hard to check your field and feed your cattle in a \nPrius.\n  But that is the direction the Federal Government has pushed these \nautomakers and continues to do so in this bill. We have pushed them \naway from the vehicles that turned a profit and created a perception of \nan alternate consumer demand.\n  Another section of this bill that takes aim at perception rather than \nreality targets business aviation. The perception this bill creates is \nthat business aircraft are some sort of excess expenditure. Because of \nthe inconsiderate actions of three auto executives, this bill wants to \ncondemn the entire business aviation industry.\n  Well, as a Senator from the State with more general aviation \nproduction than anywhere else in the world, I cannot let that claim \nstand unchallenged.\n  General aviation contributes more than $150 billion to the U.S. \neconomy each year and employs over 1.2 million people right here in the \nU.S.\n  Thirty-eight percent of the aircraft built here are exported, meaning \nthe GA industry is one of the few remaining industries in the U.S. with \na positive trade balance. Yet this bill takes the policy position that \nbusiness aviation is unnecessary.\n  If the intent of this bill is to punish the big three auto companies, \nthen let's really go after them. Let's prohibit them from flying first \nclass. You tell me what is wrong with flying coach. That is how I fly.\n  Or maybe we should just prohibit them from flying at all.\n  But that is not what this bill wants to do. As I have said, this bill \nonly takes aim at the perception of the problem. It completely neglects \nthe fact that companies, large and small, use business aircraft as a \nway to save time and money.\n  Furthermore, small towns across the country depend upon the revenue \ngenerated by local airports serving business aircraft.\n  The difficulties of the economy are not felt solely by the auto \ncompanies. Over the last 6 weeks or so, nearly 1,800 aviation workers \nhave been laid off in Wichita, KS, alone. These layoffs and a downturn \nin new orders affects their suppliers and parts manufacturers as well.\n  If these 14 lines of text condemning business aviation become the new \nbenchmark for future legislation, then the U.S. Congress will have put \nan American industry that leads the global marketplace at unprecedented \nrisk.\n  I understand the situation our automotive industry is facing. I don't \nwant to see layoffs or dealerships close or suppliers to have to cut \nproduction. But the reality is, whether Congress passes this $14 \nbillion bailout or not, these things will likely happen.\n  The question we elected officials must answer is whether or not \ntaxpayers will see a return on their investment.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us today does not provide such \nassurances.\n  I am hopeful that we can continue working towards a bill that \nprovides the necessary reform to ensure stability for the automakers \nand at the same time protects hard-working taxpayers.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will support this legislation to \nprovide financing to the U.S. auto industry because without this \nassistance millions of American jobs, and a fundamental part of our \nmanufacturing base, will be jeopardized. In these difficult economic \ntimes, with unemployment increasing, we cannot afford to see these jobs \ndisappear.\n  I understand that many people are upset about this rescue package. I, \nfor one, am not happy to be running up still more charges on the \ntaxpayers' tab. And I appreciate the arguments that have been made that \nthe automakers' troubles are of their own making. Certainly some of \ntheir troubles are indeed of their own making, but not all of them. \nSome of the problems facing domestic automakers are the direct result \nof policies enacted or ratified in Washington.\n  The collapse of the housing and credit markets clearly hit the \ncredit-sensitive auto industry hard, and we know that those problems in \nparticular were not of the auto industry's making. Far from it. They \nwere the result of two decades of the reckless disassembly of a sound \nregulatory system, combined with some unscrupulous actions by many in \nthe financial industry--a deadly combination that has now brought the \nentire economy to the brink of disaster including domestic auto \nproducers.\n  And at the same time Washington was repealing strong financial \nregulations, bipartisan majorities in Congress, led by Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents, were also advancing deeply flawed trade policies \nwhich have further disadvantaged the domestic auto industry. Currency \nmanipulation by foreign competitors, too, has put our domestic firms, \nincluding the automakers, at an enormous competitive disadvantage. \nCombine that with the failure of our major trade agreements to \nestablish reasonable standards for workers, public safety, and the \nenvironment, and the self-made problems\n\n[[Page S10927]]\n\nof domestic auto producers are greatly magnified.\n  I will not defend the mistakes made by auto executives, but a \nsignificant amount of blame lies with Federal policymakers who blindly \nembraced philosophies of deregulation and trade that undermined \nprotections for working families, public safety, and the environment. \nIn fact, some of the same people opposed to any temporary help for the \nautomakers now were the ones who helped dig the hole in which that \nindustry now finds itself.\n  More importantly, being angry at these companies' past mistakes is no \nreason to permit the auto companies to go under at this time. To allow \nthese companies to go into bankruptcy could prove to be a tremendous \nshock to our already weak economy and could end up costing the U.S. \ntaxpayers even more in pension guarantees, unemployment benefits, and \nother costs.\n  And we are not just talking about the jobs of the autoworkers at the \nU.S. auto plants, although those jobs are important. We are also \ntalking about the millions of jobs in related industries including \nsteelmakers, rubber companies, hundreds of other suppliers, parts \nmanufacturers, car dealers, and other industries that would be \nnegatively impacted if the U.S. auto companies went bankrupt.\n  Workers around Wisconsin are already struggling with the downturn in \nthe auto industry and would be even harder hit if Congress fails to \nprovide assistance to the auto industry. My hometown of Janesville, WI, \nis proud home to the oldest GM plant and for over 80 years, generations \nof Janesville men and women have built cars and trucks for GM. The \nJanesville GM assembly plant has been the core of the community and \nsurrounding area for decades by providing its workers with family-\nsupporting jobs and contributing to the lifeblood of the community. \nEarlier this year, GM announced that it would cease production at the \nJanesville plant by the end of the year. Despite this unwelcome news, \nthe State of Wisconsin and the local community, including workers, \nbusiness owners, union leadership, have all come together to propose a \nplan to encourage GM to retool the plant to build a future product \nline. I am so proud that stakeholders in Janesville and in Wisconsin \nhave come together to try to keep these jobs in Wisconsin and I will \ncontinue to do all I can, along with others in the Wisconsin \ncongressional delegation, to support their efforts to keep an auto \npresence in Janesville.\n  Janesville is not the only community in Wisconsin that is closely \nwatching what we do in Congress this week. A Chrysler engine plant \nemploys hundreds of people in Kenosha and various suppliers and related \nmanufacturers do business in communities throughout southeastern and \nsouthwestern Wisconsin. I have also heard from auto dealers \nrepresenting communities all across Wisconsin about the need to provide \nassistance to the U.S. auto industry to help ensure that their \nbusinesses continue to provide jobs in these troubling times. I \nunderstand Americans want businesses to be held accountable for bad \ndecisions they have made in the past, and I do not think the Federal \nGovernment should get in the business of bailing out every industry in \nneed of help. But in this case, failure to provide assistance to the \nauto industry could cause such a horrible shock to the American economy \nand communities all across our country that we must take action.\n  While I think the Federal Government needs to act, any rescue package \nshould not be a blank check and this particular rescue package contains \nvarious provisions to help ensure that the auto companies are held \naccountable for the Federal financial assistance they receive. Unlike \nthe Wall Street bailout that I voted against, this bill provides strict \nrules that the auto companies must follow in order for the companies to \nbe eligible for Federal assistance. The companies must negotiate with \ntheir employees, shareholders, creditors, and other parties to develop \nrestructuring plans to show how these companies are going to reform \nthemselves for the future, including improving their capacity to build \nthe fuel-efficient vehicles that Americans are demanding. These \nrestructuring plans are due within the first few months of 2009 and if \nthey are not approved by the Federal Government, the auto companies \nwill not be able to receive additional Federal funding and will have to \nrepay the Federal assistance they have already received.\n  I would have preferred this money to come from the $700 billion Wall \nStreet bailout that Congress passed earlier this year. I am \ndisappointed that the Bush administration refused to use its authority \nunder the Troubled Assets Relief Program, TARP, to provide financial \nassistance to the auto companies. Congress's investigative arm, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, testified before the Senate Banking \nCommittee last week that the Bush administration currently has the \nauthority under TARP to provide this assistance. Secretary Paulson \ncould have acted weeks ago to provide such assistance to the auto \nindustry, yet he continues to refuse to take those steps, and allocate \nwhat amounts to a small percentage of the Wall Street bailout to help \nmillions of working families in this country.\n  Because of the administration's refusal to use its existing authority \nto help the auto industry, Congress has been forced to act. \nUnfortunately, we have also been forced by the administration to take \nmoney from the Section 136 Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing \nProgram that was created last year to provide Federal funding to auto \ncompanies and manufacturers to help them as they develop more fuel-\nefficient vehicles and related technology. This bill is far from \nperfect and one of my biggest concerns is that Congress has been \ncompelled to raid the pot of money designed to help auto companies and \nparts manufacturers build more fuel-efficient cars in the future. \nDiverting the Section 136 money is going to further set back the work \nthat the auto industry is doing to make their products greener and more \nmarketable.\n  Everyone, including the U.S. auto industry, has acknowledged that \nU.S. auto companies need to start building more fuel-efficient \nvehicles. Furthermore, all of the U.S. auto companies have applied for \nloans under Section 136 and access to the Section 136 retooling funding \nis critical to their future success. Yet today we are taking this \nretooling money to pay for the short-term survival of these companies. \nThis was a false choice and if the administration had been more willing \nto work with us on this issue, we could have done both. Instead, by \ntaking from the Section 136 program today we are engaging in extremely \nshortsighted policymaking. I will work with my colleagues to help \nensure that funding for Section 136 is reinstated next year.\n  I regret that we find ourselves in this position today. I thank \nSenators Levin, Stabenow, and Dodd and their colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives for putting together this legislation in very difficult \ncircumstances. This bill is not perfect, but given the need for prompt \naction, I will support it and I urge my colleagues to do the same. We \nmust act in order to help protect millions of American jobs from \ndisappearing and to help prevent countless communities in Wisconsin and \naround the country from experiencing even more economic hardships in \nthe short term. As the new Congress gets under way shortly, I look \nforward to helping develop longer-term policies to assist American \nindustry as it responds to 21st century challenges so that it can \ncontinue to lead the world in innovation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10927-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10927-S10931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY CRISIS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to all those within the sound of my voice, \nwe have tried very hard to arrive at a point where we can legislate for \nthe automobile industry. People have worked very hard. I believe \neveryone is working in good faith. I am terribly disappointed that we \nare not able to arrive at a conclusion, but I want to say in the most \nemphatic manner how much I appreciate Senator Chris Dodd. He has worked \ngoing into months now.\n\n[[Page S10928]]\n\nWe had the housing crisis, we had the bailout of the financial \nindustry, and now the automobile industry. This man has worked day and \nnight for months. Chris Dodd is one of America's great legislators. He \nhas been here a long time. He is a veteran of the House and the Senate, \nand so I admire his patience and perseverance.\n  His counterpart, Senator Shelby, and I served together in the House, \nand he hasn't been heavily involved in these negotiations, but I like \nRichard Shelby very much. One thing about Senator Shelby, you never \nhave to guess where he stands on an issue.\n  In the last several days--and maybe I will be criticized by some on \nmy side, but I doubt that--I have been extremely impressed with Bob \nCorker of Tennessee. Now, we weren't able, based on his good work, to \narrive at something on which we could get enough Republicans to agree, \nbut he did some wonderful work, and I think the work he did is going to \npay dividends next year because even though this is a real loss--my \npersonal feeling--for the country, that we are not going to be able to \ndo something, I think the manner in which we have proceeded, led by \nSenator Corker on the Republican side, has been extremely good. I \nrepeat, I think it is going to work well next year.\n  We have a lot of work to do. We have issues like this we will be \ndealing with next year, and I think we have come to a point in the \nlegislative process in the Senate that we have to start working \ntogether and not have one side say yes and one side say no. So I hope \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle also recognize what Senator \nCorker has tried to do.\n  I certainly have no problem with others who disagreed with the \napproach we have taken, with the White House. This is not our proposal. \nWe have worked with President Bush. President Bush is President of the \nUnited States--and everyone knows, you can read my book as to how I \nfelt about the White House and what has happened--the White House has \nbeen extremely available. Josh Bolten and others in the White House \nhave worked very hard with us to come up with an agreement, and we did, \nworking with the House Banking Committee, the Senate Banking Committee, \nas I have indicated, led by Senator Dodd. But we have not been able to \nget this over the finish line.\n  So although we have worked and worked--and we could spend all night \ntonight, tomorrow, Saturday, and Sunday--we are not going to get to the \nfinish line. That is just the way it is. There is too much difference \nbetween the two sides. All of us on this side of the aisle are in favor \nof the proposal that has been negotiated with the White House and the \ntwo banking committees, but we are not going to be able to vote on that \nmore than likely.\n  The procedure now that we have in the Senate is that 1 hour after we \ncome in tomorrow morning, we can vote on cloture. And what are we \nvoting on? It is a bill that we took from the calendar to be an \ninstrument--it is a tax instrument because a lot of what we are doing \nwith this banking matter involves the Finance Committee--and we would \ntake that and move to proceed on that--cloture on that--and then as \nsoon as we got cloture on that, we would amend it with our proposal.\n  As I have indicated, we know we don't have 60 votes. There is no need \nto play around with that and cause undo hardship. So I have spoken to \nmy friend, the distinguished Republican leader, and what we propose is \nthat at about 10:30 or so tonight we will vote on cloture, just to show \neverybody where we are. Everybody should understand when this vote is \nover tonight--and I don't think we are going to get 60 votes--it is \nover with.\n  Mr. President, I dread looking at Wall Street tomorrow. It is not \ngoing to be a pleasant sight. Millions of Americans, not only the auto \nworkers but people who sell cars, car dealerships, and people who work \non cars, are going to be directly impacted and affected.\n  As I mentioned earlier today, Christmas is approaching. This will be \na very bad Christmas for a lot of people as a result of what takes \nplace tonight.\n  I want my colleagues to know that I have expressed my opinion as to \nwhat I think should happen. There are many people who have been \ninvolved in this on the other side of the aisle who in good faith \ndisagree with what I said, and I accept that and appreciate that. But I \nthink the time for talking is over. We should vote and move on to \nsomething else.\n  I am happy to yield to my distinguished colleague, Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this has been a challenging exercise \nfor everyone involved on both sides. We all remember a couple of months \nago we were called upon to rescue the American financial system. At the \nend of the day, after a few fits and starts, 74 out of 99 Senators \npresent thought it was a good idea to do that. It was a vote we all \nproudly cast from our individual seats and most of us supported it. It \nwas a broad, bipartisan vote, supported by the two Presidential \ncandidates as well.\n  Now we have moved into a very tricky and challenging area, and that \nis sort of industry-by-industry rescue. We have had before us the whole \nquestion of the viability of the American automobile manufacturers. \nNone of us wants to see them go down, but very few of us had anything \nto do with the dilemma they have created for themselves. So the \nquestion was: Is there a way out? The administration negotiated in good \nfaith with the Democratic majority a proposal that was simply \nunacceptable to the vast majority of our side because we thought it, \nfrankly, wouldn't work.\n  Into this breach stepped the junior Senator from Tennessee who, I \nmust say, has made an extraordinary impact in a very small amount of \ntime. I am hard pressed to think of another Member who has been here \nsuch a short period of time who has made such an impression on \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle by mastering an extraordinarily \ncomplicated subject and being able to explain it in a way that is \nunderstandable. He has diligently pursued an agreement that could pass, \nthat could enjoy broad support on both sides. He has made great \nprogress in that direction.\n  The sticking point we are left with is the question of whether the \nUAW is willing to agree to a parity pay structure with other \nmanufacturers in this country by a date certain. I understand their \nreluctance to do that, and so far, in the discussions Senator Corker \nand Senator Dodd and others have had, they have not been willing to \ngive a date specific by which parity could be achieved. It is upon that \nissue that we have reached an impasse for the moment.\n  At this stage I share the view of the majority leader that we should \ngo ahead and have the vote on cloture to the measure he outlined. We \ncan have it at 1 o'clock this morning or we could move it up and do it \nnow. I will be happy, I say to my friend, the majority leader, to try \nto get the vote we could have at 1 o'clock at 10:30 or 10:40, if he \nwishes me to. I think that would probably end the discussion, at least \nfor today. We all know we will be involved in this discussion in the \nfuture, but that will probably end it for today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 7005 occur at 10:40. I ask \nconsent that Senator Dodd, who has spent so much time on this, be given \n10 minutes.\n  If there is anyone who wishes to respond to that, they would have 10 \nminutes to do so.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend, I have to reserve the right to \nobject for the moment. I think I have one Member with whom I have to \ncheck to see if he can get this done in the next few moments. I can \nthink of no reason this would not be a good idea, but for the moment, I \nam going to have to object.\n  Mr. REID. So we don't lose any time, let's move to Senator Dodd, and \nwhen you come back we will move forward.\n  Thanks for everyone's patience.\n  Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the distinguished \nmajority leader and my colleagues. This has been a long ordeal. I know \nmany of the conversations I have had over the last several days have \nbeen wondering when, if ever, we might come to a conclusion of what has \nbeen a lengthy process over the last 2 weeks\n\n[[Page S10929]]\n\nnow since this matter emerged. Prior to the Thanksgiving recess, the \nmajority leader and others invited the automobile industry to present \nplans by December 2 to the Congress on how they might restructure their \nindustry in a way that would allow us to step forward and try to \npreserve them and allow them to exist for a few more weeks while a \nbroader plan could be devised that would allow them to possibly \nsurvive.\n  As my colleagues may know, over the last several weeks we have had a \nnumber of hearings on the matter. The Presiding Officer at this point \nis a member of my committee, along with others who have been very \ndiligent in sitting through long hearings, on an average of 5 or 6 \nhours apiece, to listen to all of the various ideas.\n  As the Republican leader pointed out, it is a very complex subject \nmatter to be asking this institution, in a matter of days, to try to \nunderstand with all of the ramifications of it. Given the precarious \nnature of it, I think we all appreciate at this juncture that we are \nlooking at least one, maybe two, of the three automobile manufacturers \nthat have existed for almost a century in our country--at a time of \ngreat economic peril, when the confidence and optimism in our country \nis at risk--we run the risk over these days of watching this industry \ndisappear. The blow to the American conscience and confidence and \ncapability is beyond economic terms, if that occurs.\n  I pray this evening that will not happen. No one can say with \nabsolute certainty it will. But we have been warned. We have been \ncautioned by those whose jobs it is to analyze this industry who have \ntold us that could happen.\n  Tonight we will go home for the holiday recesses, but for the \nliterally hundreds of thousands of people whose jobs depend upon this \nindustry, this will not be a joyous season, wondering whether their \njobs, their livelihoods, their homes, their children's futures are at \nrisk because we were incapable of coming up with an answer to provide a \nperiod of time here to allow intelligent, solid, good, hard-working \npeople to put together a plan to save the American automobile industry. \nIt is disheartening to me, to put it mildly, that we were unable to \ncome to that agreement.\n  Let me say very candidly, Bob Corker is someone I have come to \nappreciate immensely. He is a member of my committee. We have worked \nvery well together over this last year on many complicated issues, and \nI appreciate immensely his effort, as he did again this evening, to try \nto come to a conclusion where we could at least agree on something to \nmove forward.\n  There were three major issues my friend from Tennessee brought to me. \nI will not go into great detail in this limited time. I will wait until \ntomorrow, if time permits, to go into a longer discussion. Of the three \nissues, we agreed on two almost immediately. On the third, involving \nthe parity with compensation of the domestic automobile industry and \nthose of the foreign competitors doing business here, we could not come \nto closure. The issue simply came down to this. There was no debate, by \nthe way, from the United Auto Workers or anyone else that we ought to \nachieve parity in those wages or benefits. The question was the timing \nof it.\n\n  We are in a deep recession. People are being laid off. The Bank of \nAmerica announced today 35,000 people will be laid off. Industry after \nindustry is dropping its employees. The idea that you are going to have \nnew hires replace the active employees in a time such as this is \ndifficult, to put it mildly. So the notion somehow that within days or \nweeks after March 31 of this year that this would mandate--mandate \nparity between those wages of domestic companies and foreign companies \nwas the stumbling block.\n  The President of the United States, the other body, Democrats and \nRepublicans as well as the autoworkers, the heads of these companies, \ncame together and for 8 days we negotiated an agreement. It was \npainful. It is not perfect by a long shot. But it allowed us to get to \nnext year to begin to work on this in a way that might make it possible \nfor this industry to survive.\n  Tonight, regretfully, despite the efforts of the White House, people \nhere, people in the other body obviously, workers as well as managers, \nwe have stumbled this evening, unable to make this closure on this \nissue to allow us to go forward.\n  I am deeply saddened, but more than saddened I am worried this \nevening of what we are doing with an iconic industry. None of us here \nwas going to write a check without conditionality. This bill I have \ndrafted along with others is some 36 pages long and filled with \nconditions, establishing a czar--chosen by this President of the United \nStates, not the coming one--to oversee this and say you must meet these \nobligations if you are going to survive. His determination will \ndetermine whether the industry can go forward. If the czar were to say \nyou have not complied, bankruptcy would entail, chapter 11 and, \ncandidly, chapter 7. It would be nothing more than a liquidation of \nthis industry.\n  But we ought to try to avoid that. I thought most of us felt that was \na bad outcome. I know my friend from Tennessee believes that, as I do. \nThe outcome of that will cost the American taxpayers billions of \ndollars, by the way, and that is very well where we may end up this \nevening. I regret it deeply. I am saddened by it, worried about it, \nthat in the midst of deep and troubling times we are now going to add \nto that substantially by walking away from an issue of whether we could \nagree that parity between these wages and benefits could be achieved \nwithout slamming it down in such a way as to make it difficult for us \nto achieve the result.\n  Out of the three issues, we agreed on two and three-quarters but were \nunable to come to closure on this one which, frankly, in my view, was \nnot an economic issue but a political one, because we are not demanding \nthis of dealers, of suppliers, of anyone else. The only group we have \nasked this of is the workforce. No one else in this bill is required on \na date certain to meet any other obligations, only this one. Yet we \nfully understand economically how hard that could be, to demand that \nkind of accountability and not trust a czar or a leader working with \nthe industry and others to reach that agreement.\n  To the majority leader I say thank you, and to your staff, the \nBanking Committee staff, my friend Bob Corker, the Members of the \nHouse, Republicans and Democrats, to the White House, which has been \ntremendously helpful in these last few days on trying to put this \ntogether without all of us agreeing. Yet, despite all of that, this \nevening we will not get cloture. This will fail. We will go home. I am \nafraid our country is going to be in deeper trouble because of this \nissue. I regret that deeply.\n  I thank the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the cloture vote vote on the motion \nto proceed to H.R. 7005 occur--Senator Stabenow wants the last 5 \nminutes before the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend, at least 5 minutes for Senator \nCorker.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Shelby, 5 minutes?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would like 3 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Corker will be recognized for 5 \nminutes, Senator Shelby for 3 minutes. I said a lot of nice things \nabout you so that is about the right length of time for the speech. The \nfinal 5 minutes will be Senator Stabenow. Then we will vote on H.R. \n7005 as soon as their speeches are finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to express my deep gratitude to \nChris Dodd for all the work he has done over the last week, to Senator \nDurbin who joined us in meetings, and to all the people who have been \ninvolved in trying to reach an agreement.\n  I do want to say this is a highly technical matter. It involved \nvolunteer employed benefit accounts, it involved bonds, it involved all \nkinds of discussions that were technical in nature. We had the United \nAuto Workers representative in the room. We had three companies in \nanother room. We were talking to bondholders on the phone. We were \ncertainly talking to our colleagues. We are about three words, three \nwords away from a deal.\n\n[[Page S10930]]\n\n  What my colleagues wish to see is a date certain when something is \ngoing to occur. We offered any date in the year 2009, any date.\n  Any day. Just when will we actually get there? I think what we have \noffered is incredibly reasonable. I think there is a way for us to get \nthere. I still do. There are an awful lot of bright people in this \nroom. This is an important issue. We have solved everything \nsubstantially, and about three words keep us from reaching conclusion \ntonight.\n  Again, we offered any date in 2009. We were not able to get a \ndefinitive day. And I think there is still a way to make this happen. \nBy the way, I want to say, if this happens, this is so much better than \nwhat is before us on the floor.\n  These companies are going to be able to go forward with only one-\nthird of the debt level they now have--one-third. They are going to be \nable to pay half of their VIVA, $21 billion to GM, half of it in stock, \nso it is not cash. Those companies will be stronger than they have been \nin 40 years if we are able to reach this agreement or they will be in \nChapter 11 because there are date-certain things that have to occur.\n  This is a very responsible piece of legislation, and I think people \non both sides have acted responsibly. But we are three words--maybe \ntwo, maybe four, somewhere in that range--away from having what I \nbelieve is a landmark piece of legislation, landmark, historic, that \nwould actually allow those companies to go ahead with strength they \nhave not had in my lifetime. I regret that, but I thank all of those \nwho have been involved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have a few minutes, but first I wish to \ncommend my colleague and fellow member of the Banking Committee, \nSenator Corker, for his work in this regard, trying to forge a \ncompromise.\n  Of course, I think most of you know where I stand on bailouts. I do \nnot think they work. I do not believe this one would ever work. But \nthese companies could be saved. These companies could be saved. I have \nsaid I think they are bloated, the management is bloated. These \ncompanies either have already failed or are failing. That is a shame. \nThese are not the General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler I knew. But all of \nus in America will benefit by competition.\n  I come from the South, where we have a growing automobile industry, \nbut there are 300 million people in this country, the largest \nautomobile market in the world. There is no reason for General Motors, \nFord, and Chrysler not to be competitive, but they are not going to be \ncompetitive, folks, as long as they are operating under this business \nmodel. Whether they get money soon or next year or what, it is going to \nbe probably a lot of money.\n  But I want to tell the American people tonight, bailouts generally do \nnot work. And this is a huge proposed bailout. I fear it is just the \ndownpayment on more to come next year. So I would vote no on this \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first let me say that this is not a \nbailout this evening, this is a bridge loan of $14 billion to stop us \npotentially, if one of the companies goes under, from over $150 billion \nin taxpayer funds that we will be spending, including assuming the \ntaxpayers' cost for 775,000 pensions in a bankruptcy that will go into \nthe pension guarantee fund. So we are talking about a small bridge loan \nin a global credit crisis where every other country in the world has \nstepped up to help their auto industry because they understand it is \ncritical to their national defense, they understand it is critical to \ntheir economy, and they are trying to create the middle class we have \nhad in America. In America, if this goes down tonight, we are saying we \ndo not care about the backbone of the economy which has been and will \ncontinue to be manufacturing. Somebody has to make something in this \ncountry. We cannot all push paper on Wall Street. Somebody has to make \nsomething.\n  The reality is, this is a tough bill. I wish to thank our leaders, \nSenator Reid for his patience and diligence and leadership, and Senator \nDodd for his incredible patience, his staff being involved. It placed \none more crisis on the doorstep of Senator Dodd to have to deal with. I \nappreciate Senator Corker stepping up to try to work this out and \ncertainly Senator Voinovich and Senator Bond. Senator Levin and I have \nworked closely with them. But the reality is this: If we walk away this \nevening and do not vote to proceed with this bill, we are saying it is \nokay for a major auto company in America to go bankrupt, for 2.5 \nmillion people in this economy to lose their jobs. Over what? We have a \ntough bill that creates a restructuring mechanism where everybody comes \nto the table to restructure. We give them until March 31. If they are \nnot moving in good faith, the $14 billion can be rescinded. If they do \nnot have a viable plan by March 31, there is no more assistance.\n  Unfortunately, what my Republican colleagues have said is that the \nonly way we are going to do this, the only way we are going to do this, \nis the workers have to negotiate first with the Republican Party, with \nthe Republicans. As long as the workers were willing to take all of the \ncuts the Republican Party thinks they should before the negotiation, \nthey would be willing to step up and save the backbone of manufacturing \nin this country and 2.5 million jobs.\n  We have tried everything. We have negotiated with the White House in \ngood faith. I appreciate that. They have kept their deal. We have \nnegotiated with every party that wanted to come forward, including \ntoday, all day, focusing with Senator Corker. But the reality is, we \nare in a position where evidently the only thing that matters to the \nmajority of those on the other side of the aisle is that workers get \npaid too much in this country--somehow, workers get paid too much in \nthis country--and unless we sock it to the workers, they are not \nwilling to allow a $14 billion bridge loan to be able to save an \nindustry and save an--\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, can we have order? I would like us to at \nleast give the courtesy of listening to the Senator since we are not \ngoing to give her the courtesy of the vote.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, there are those who think they can play \ngames with this and there are no consequences. This is not, tonight, \nabout Democrats and Republicans. It is not about auto executives versus \nworkers. This is about the economy of this country. We are in serious \ntrouble, ladies and gentlemen. If one of our auto companies goes down, \nwe are going to pick up the paper and begin to see the suppliers of \nthis country go down. And they supply not only the folks in my State, \nthey supply Toyota, Nissan, and Honda. They supply the Army. The same \nfolks who make the axles for the trucks that our brave men and women \nare driving in Iraq and Afghanistan today make the axles put on our \ntrucks and our cars.\n  The reality is, our national defense and our economy and the middle \nclass of this country are hanging in the balance by this vote. Shame on \nus if we walk away cavalierly thinking that we can do this another \ntime. Now is the time. People are watching, not just in Michigan but \nall across the country, businesses large and small, families in their \nhomes, retirees who have done nothing but work hard their whole lives \nand now want to know their pensions or their health care, as part of \nsomething they worked for all of their lives, is protected. This is \nabout whether we are going to make a commitment to the middle class and \na commitment to American manufacturing. You cannot walk away from the \nAmerican auto industry and not affect every part of manufacturing in \nthis country.\n  It is not too late. I know we assume the votes are not there, but the \nvotes can be there. There are enough votes in this room. There are \nenough votes in this room to give them the chance, just the chance to \nrestructure. And if folks do not believe in the end that what they have \ncome up with, 3 months from now, is good enough, then that is it. But \ndon't 2.5 million people and the major auto presence and manufacturing \nin this country deserve 3 months, 3 months of time to be able to \nrestructure, for advanced manufacturing in the future? If we do not do \nthat, we are going to change our dependence on foreign oil for a \ndependence on foreign automobiles. We will be asking other countries to \nsend us their tanks, send us their automobiles, send us their trucks \nfor our defense. That\n\n[[Page S10931]]\n\nmakes no sense. People of good will know better.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join with us in voting for the future \nand the economy of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10931-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

They worked \nover these past 8 or 9 days literally until 2 and 3 and 4 in the \nmorning--night after night after night--in an effort to put together a \npackage here that would win the approval of our colleagues. These \nremarkable young men and women have just served our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could people take their conversations outside \nthe Chamber while the Senator from Connecticut thanks the staff.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank you.\n  I want to begin by thanking the staff director of the Banking \nCommittee, Shawn Maher. He is the father of a young 11-year-old boy, \nand I don't think he has probably seen Aidan much over the last number \nof months, let alone the last week or so, because he has dedicated \nhimself to the work of this Chamber, this body. So I begin by thanking \nShawn Maher.\n  I also thank Aaron Klein, Amy Friend, Dean Shahinian, Neal Orringer, \nand Deborah Katz; from Senator Reid's staff, Mark Wetjen; from Senator \nDurbin's staff, Brad McConnell; from Legislative Counsel, Laura Ayoud, \nwho does a remarkable job for all of us.\n  There are many others, but these are the ones who principally did the \nwork night after night, day after day, nonstop through the weekends, to \ntry to package here a proposal that would win our support. And I \napologize to them. We were not able to do it. I feel badly myself that \nmaybe their Members did not probably work as hard as maybe we should \nhave after all the effort they put in. But I want them to know, as we \ncome into this holiday season, there are many people who in this \ncountry owe a great debt of gratitude to these people who worked so \ntirelessly on their behalf but never get the credit and the recognition \nthey deserve.\n  So this evening I thank them immensely for what they have done, and \nwe will be back another day to fight again, and my hope is to make a \ndifference for people in our country.

Madam President, I will be very quick.\n\n[[Page S10932]]\n\n  Madam President, I apologize that I did not say something a minute \nago. We have had a difficult Congress. We have had the staff who are so \nvaliant, so good, who always make us look as good as we can look. \nSometimes that is not very good. However good we look, it is because of \nthe great staff we have.\n  We have been through 95 filibusters this Congress. We have had many \nserious issues. Our country is in an economic meltdown. We had a series \nof important votes here. It seemed to never end. But always our staff \nis here--always. The Democratic staff on this side of the aisle, the \nRepublican staff on the other side of the aisle, they are all very \nprofessional; the Parliamentarians, these wonderful pages, the court \nreporters. And, of course, the Capitol Police, these people--some of \nwhom are in uniform, some not--are here to protect us as well as all \nthe staff.\n  So I want everyone to know, the four of you seated in front of the \nPresiding Officer, how much I appreciate the work you do. You are all \nvery patient. You take abuse a lot of times that you should not because \na lot of times we are busy and forget that we also have to be nice to \neveryone. If I have offended any of you over the past couple years, it \ncertainly was not intentional.\n  I am so grateful that my Democratic colleagues allow me to serve in \nthe capacity I do, as amateurish as I am on occasion, but it is not \nbecause I am not trying. I have the greatest affection for every one of \nmy Democratic Senators. They are always so good to me and work so hard.\n  I look forward to the next year. We need a productive year. Our \ncountry is in big trouble. We have so many things happening to us, \nindividuals, that it does not matter where you look in America today, \nthere is very little good news economically. And what happened today is \nnot going to help that. But I talked about that before.\n  So I appreciate all that everyone does, including the Sergeant at \nArms, the Secretary. They do such good work. We have all the committee \nchairs who work so hard, subcommittee chairs. I have been fighting for \nsome words to express myself how appreciative I am. I am not \nforthcoming of them, so I will say thank you all very much for what you \ndo for us and, of course, the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, change is on the way, but it didn't get \nhere tonight. The American people said they wanted change in the \nSenate, but it is not here yet. I think it was proven tonight by this \nvote. The American people will see who stands with the middle class of \nthis country and who doesn't, who cares about working people and who \ndoesn't by this vote tonight. Anyone could have picked a number of \nreasons for voting no tonight, but as far as I am concerned, with this \neconomy in crisis, we should have voted yes.\n  All I wish to say is we are going through tough times and tomorrow \nthings are going to be a whole lot tougher for a whole lot of people, \nunless Henry Paulson does the right thing. I wish to say to my \ncolleagues, Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow--I know they are headed \nout, which is fine--that I am going to work as hard as I can to \nconvince the Treasury Secretary to take action to save these 3 million \njobs that could be on the line.\n  People played Russian roulette with this recession tonight. We don't \nknow what is going to happen, but we do know that Hank Paulson can save \nthese jobs. If he can save all those jobs in the white-collar industry, \ncertainly he can save some jobs in the blue-collar industries. Everyone \nknows I have had problems with Detroit. I think the fact that they \ndidn't listen to those of us who felt they ought to produce clean cars \nand fuel-efficient cars, the fact that they didn't listen to us led to, \nin many ways, the problems they face. To lose our manufacturing base, \nwithout even a helping hand to try and save it tonight, is shocking.\n  So, in closing, I wish to say I have a heavy heart right now. I have \n200,000 workers in my State, second only to Detroit, who depend on a \nthriving auto industry. That is 200,000 families, frightened tonight, \nbut I have a message for them: HELP is on the way. Change is on the \nway. Change is coming to this Chamber. We are going to have people who \nare here for the right reason--what I consider the right reason--which \nis fighting for the middle class, fighting to make sure we have a clean \nenvironment, a strong economy, educated kids, peace in the world, all \nthose things. That is what the election was about. This is a lameduck \nSenate, and they acted like a lameduck Senate. It is too bad. But we \ndid get a majority vote, so the message to Mr. Paulson is: Listen to \nthat. More than 51 people here voted to give a chance with a bridge \nloan, so I hope, Mr. Paulson, you are watching this, and I hope you \nwill do it. Then, when we have our new President and our new Senate and \nour new House, we can get back to work.\n  I see Senator Durbin is on the floor and is about to speak. I wish to \nthank him, Senator Dodd, and Senator Reid, all those who worked so hard \nand those on the other side who tried--who actually tried--to do \nsomething. So I yield the floor, with a heavy heart, but I know that \nthe future is going to be much brighter, much better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, just a few weeks ago on the floor of the \nSenate, we passed legislation to give $700 billion to this \nadministration to try to rescue America from its economic crisis. That \nmoney was being spent by the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Paulson, \nwhom I respect, and he made an effort to try to save a key element of \nour economy--the financial sector--investing literally billions of \ndollars and buying equity and capitalizing investment banks and other \ninstitutions, including insurance companies, in the hopes that it would \nturn this economy around. There is scant evidence of any success.\n  Many questions have been raised about the wisdom and judgment of \nthose investments, but the fact is literally hundreds of billions of \ndollars have been spent by this administration in an effort to rescue \nmany financial institutions which had made fatal errors in judgment. \nThey brought together rotten portfolios of bad investments on mortgage \nsecurities based on this subprime mortgage fiasco which we are now \npaying a bitter price for.\n  Tonight, we had an opportunity to loan money--a bridge loan--to one \nof the most important sectors in our economy: the automobile industry. \nNow, let me tell my colleagues at the outset, I buy American cars. I do \nit out of a sense of patriotic duty, and I find that most of those cars \nare good. But I expect more out of Detroit than I have seen in the past \ntwo decades. I have been disappointed--bitterly disappointed--by the \npositions the big three have taken on critical issues involving the \nenvironment, energy efficiency. They didn't seem to get it. When Toyota \ncame out with its Prius, a hybrid car with great mileage, they were \nscoffed at by the leaders in Detroit. That is a car no Americans would \nwant. Well, there is a waiting list now for those cars. When the price \nof gasoline reached $4 and beyond a gallon, many people started asking \nhard questions about the gas guzzlers Detroit put in the showrooms year \nafter year. It seems Detroit was kind of caught in this mindset that \nthey could make a profit by building more of their successful cars from \nlast year. It ran out. It reached a point where they can't sell their \ncars, and they are struggling. I have some sympathy for them but not a \nlot when it comes to management. I think they have made some technical \nand strategic errors that they have paid a heavy price for.\n  I recall about a year and a half ago when the CEOs of the big three \nwere just off this Senate floor in an office. We had a private meeting \nwith about five or six Senators. They said: Do you have any questions? \nI said: I do. I said: I buy American cars. I have bought all your \ncars--GMs, Fords, Chryslers--I have owned them all, and I am pretty \nloyal to your companies. But I have a question to ask of you: Have any \nof you ever heard of the magazine Consumer Reports? There was this \nawkward silence in the room. Finally, a few of them said yes. I said: I \nread it, and I have been wondering for 20 years why\n\n[[Page S10933]]\n\nthe Japanese continue to build cars that are more reliable and more \nvaluable at trade-in than American cars. How can that possibly be the \ncase, in a country with the best engineering schools in the world and \nin a country that founded the automobile industry? How do you explain \nit, I asked. They paused, and the man from Chrysler said: I think we \nare getting better. Well, that is a pretty weak answer. They could have \ndone better.\n  What broke down our effort this evening in trying to provide some \nsort of interim financing to the automobile companies so they will not \ngo into bankruptcy--what broke down was a negotiation over one issue, \nand here is what it was, simply stated: There are those who believe \nautomobile workers are paid too much money and get too many benefits \nsuch as health care. They think if those compensation packages were \nreduced, American cars would be more competitive against, for instance, \nNissans or Toyota or Honda, even made in the United States. Well, they \ninsisted in our negotiations that the wages of American autoworkers, \nall 130,000 of them, be brought down to the level of the workers at \nthese foreign car companies in the United States by the end of March \nnext year. A little over 3 months from now, they wanted a substantial \nreduction in salaries for these workers.\n  Now, United Auto Workers, which represents most of them, has already \nreached an agreement that as workers are bought out and retired, newer \nworkers will come in at a lower wage scale. So, eventually, their \nworkforce will have a lower wage but it will not work to the \ndisadvantage of current workers. That is the plan. The Republican side \nof the aisle rejected that and said: You have to bring down their wages \nnow. Think about that, in this economy. Think about that at a time when \nmost American families are struggling--struggling to pay utility bills \nand for gasoline when it goes up high and all the other costs of living \nwe face. The Republican answer was: Bring down those autoworkers' \nsalaries and do it in a little over 90 days. I thought that was unfair.\n\n  Alan Reuther was in the room when we talked about it. He represents \nthe United Auto Workers. He, of course, comes from the historic lineage \nof Walter Reuther, who helped found the United Auto Workers, and he \nexplained what this would mean to so many of those families who count \non those wages to put kids through college, to make sure they can get \nby and pay medical bills and things that are important to them, but we \ndidn't have much luck in persuading those on the other side of the \ntable.\n  There was an exception. Senator Corker of Tennessee--a Republican who \ndid a magnificent job today--spent 5 hours that I was with him in \nnegotiations doing his best to try to find a solution. He worked at it, \nand I admire him for it. In the end, he took his best work product to \nthe Republican caucus and it was rejected. We came to the floor tonight \nand unfortunately saw the last remaining opportunity to help the auto \nindustry die in a procedural vote that occurred a few minutes ago. It \nis going to be hard for a lot of people who voted against helping the \nautomobile companies with a $14 billion loan to avoid losing 2.5 \nmillion American jobs to explain how just a few weeks ago they voted \nfor $700 billion to bail out the biggest banks in America. They shed \ncopious tears for Wall Street but couldn't bring themselves to \nempathize or be concerned enough to help the autoworkers and give them \na vote today. I think that is unfortunate. It is beyond that. It is \ntragic. If the administration doesn't respond, through the Secretary of \nthe Treasury and others, to help this industry, we may see some \nterrible days ahead when some of the biggest names in American \nbusiness--some of the biggest employers in the American economy--are \nforced into bankruptcy. It will be a sad day.\n  I don't know if this rescue package would have worked. I am not sure. \nI don't know if it would have been enough, or whether it would have \nfailed, but I thought we owed our best efforts to try to save an \nindustry that means so much to America in so many States, whether it is \nMichigan or Indiana or Ohio or Illinois, thousands of workers, in \nMissouri, 55,000 workers; so many workers depend on this industry. We \nhad a chance to do something for them tonight and we failed. We failed \nbecause we couldn't bring over enough votes from the other side of the \naisle to come to the magic number of 60.\n  Tomorrow is another day. If the automobile companies can hang on \nuntil a new administration arrives, then perhaps we can find another \nway to help, a sensible way to give this industry a fighting chance. I \nhope they will use that time to think about the products for America's \nfuture, products that will be profitable but serve the needs of \nfamilies and businesses and individuals, products that will protect our \nenvironment, save energy, move us in the right direction in technology. \nI know they can do it. Facing the challenge, I believe they will. Those \nmanagers and people who are the scientists and engineers at each of \nthese companies can count on those men and women out there on the plant \nfloor who have stood by them year after weary year doing their part to \nbuild the cars to try to keep their companies in business. We stood by \nthose men and women tonight, those of us who voted to move forward. I \nam sorry we didn't come through.\n  I wish to especially thank my colleague, Senator Dodd, who worked so \nhard. I wish to also thank Senator Corker, as I mentioned earlier, and \nmany others who played an important role. I wish to say, as I have said \nto them personally, how sorry I am to Senators Levin and Stabenow. That \ngreat State of Michigan has taken quite a beating when it comes to its \neconomy, and tonight was not good news, but tomorrow is another day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe cloture vote and to give my reasons for voting in support of \ncloture. Before I do, however, I wish to comment about where the \nresponsibility lies for failure to invoke cloture to move this bill \nforward, and my hope that we would avoid fingerpointing and trying to \nassess blame, each on the other side, as has become the pattern in this \nbody during the course of the last 2 years of the 110th Congress and \nbeyond.\n  The Senator from Illinois said there were not sufficient votes on the \nRepublican side of the aisle. Well, there were sufficient votes on the \nRepublican side of the aisle, had they been joined with sufficient \nvotes on the Democratic side of the aisle. There were 10 Republican \nSenators who voted to invoke cloture: Senator Bond, Senator Brownback, \nSenator Collins, Senator Lugar, Senator Voinovich, Senator Warner, \nSenator Dole, Senator Domenici, Senator Snowe, and myself.\n  There are 51 Senators on the other side of the aisle. Had those 51 \nSenators--or 50 of them joined with the 10 Republican Senators, cloture \nwould have been invoked. But it would be my hope that we would leave \nthis evening without partisan blame and still seek some way to get the \nkind of economic assistance that would enable the Big Three to continue \nto operate.\n  The issue that we face has enormous potential adverse economic \nconsequences. I will read from a portion of a statement I had prepared \nin a little different direction, but this portion of the statement I \nhad prepared specifies the scope of the economic problem, which is \npotentially present if the three big automobile manufacturers do not \nstay in business.\n  A failure of the automakers could have a cataclysmic impact on the \nbroader economy. The Big Three employ 240,000 workers directly and, \nmore broadly, the U.S. auto industry represents almost 4 percent of the \ngross domestic product and impacts 1 out of every 10 U.S. jobs in some \nform, directly or indirectly. These jobs are at part suppliers, \ndealerships, banks, and many other lines.\n  According to the Center for Automotive Research, 3 million jobs would \nbe lost if the Big Three were to fail. They estimated that the \nGovernment could stand to lose up to $156 billion over 3 years in terms \nof reductions in Social Security receipts, personal income taxes paid, \nand an increase in transfer payments.\n  According to the Anderson Economic Group, if at least two of the \nthree were to file for bankruptcy, it would cost the taxpayers up to \nfour times the amount of the proposed bridge loans in\n\n[[Page S10934]]\n\nthe form of lost income and tax revenue resulting from the massive \nemployment losses. They estimate that more than 1.8 million auto-\nrelated jobs would be lost in the first year, and there would be nearly \n$70 billion less in Federal and State tax revenue over a 2-year period. \nCredit and related markets would be further disrupted, more U.S. \nmanufacturing would move overseas, and foreign automakers would gain an \neven greater advantage.\n  According to the Economic Policy Institute, a bankruptcy of one or \nmore of the Big Three would result in losses of up to 3.3 million jobs. \nThe U.S. trade deficit could rise by at least $110 billion per year as \nimported vehicles displace domestic brands, increasing the trade \ndeficit by 16 percent and putting additional downward pressure on the \nU.S. dollar and living standards. An increase in Government payments \nand tax losses alone would exceed $150 billion in the first 3 years \nfollowing bankruptcy.\n  I recite that in some detail to articulate the scope of the potential \ndevastating impact if the three major auto manufacturers in the United \nStates are unsuccessful. In voting to invoke cloture, I think it should \nbe understood that I was not voting in favor of the House bill. I think \nthe House bill needed vast improvement. But had we taken up the bill, \nthat would have given us an opportunity to offer amendments, to debate, \nand to function as the world's greatest deliberative body. The House \nbill, in my judgment, didn't give sufficient authority to the so-called \ncar czar. The House bill added to it, beyond what was agreed to by the \nDemocrats in the Senate and the White House, a provision which would \nhave terminated the litigation brought by the automotive industry \nagainst the State of California on the issue of toxic emissions.\n  I do not know who would have prevailed in that suit, but I think \nthere ought not to be congressional action to get off that litigation. \nThat is a matter for the courts. Under our well-established doctrine of \nseparation of powers, that should have been in the bill. At any rate, \nhad the Senate taken up the bill, which is what the cloture motion \nmeant--people may be watching on C-SPAN 2 and don't understand all of \nthe arcane Senate talk, but a cloture motion is a motion to cut off \ndebate on a motion to proceed. It simply means that the Senate will \nproceed to consider the issue as formulated in the House bill, as \nformulated in the vehicle laid down by the majority leader, and then \nthe Senate has the opportunity to offer amendments and to debate.\n  We have been in session, as the distinguished Presiding Officer \nknows, since 3 o'clock on Monday. We were here a good part of Monday, \nall day Tuesday, all day Wednesday, and it is now 11:36 p.m. eastern \ntime on Thursday. The first time we came to the floor to have a \ndiscussion on this matter was a short time ago. The deliberations were \ncarried on behind closed doors. Well, deliberations ought to be carried \non behind closed doors to try to work through and find compromises and \nhave free-wheeling discussion. But it would be appropriate, it seems to \nme, for the Senate to come to the floor and talk about what has been \ndecided. The discussion started on the Senate floor a little after 9 \no'clock and came to a conclusion a little more than an hour later. At \n10:45, we had the motion to invoke cloture--that is, to cut off debate.\n  We pride ourselves in the Senate as being the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. Well, why not deliberate--deliberate in public? \nThere is nobody in the galleries at the present time, but why not \ndeliberate in public? We are now carried on C-SPAN 2, on television \nacross the country, and across the world perhaps. So people can see \nwhat we are doing, and they can see what the considerations are.\n  The Senator from Illinois made a statement that it was required under \nthe proposal of the Republicans to have the concessions made on wages \nwithin a little more than 90 days in March. The Senator from Tennessee, \nwho has been applauded in this body for the outstanding work he has \ndone, said any time during the year 2009. Well, had the two Senators \nbeen on the floor and been discussing the matter, perhaps we would know \nexactly what went on behind those closed doors, what the arrangement \nwas.\n  I compliment my colleagues for the hard work that went into the \nefforts to try to reach a compromise. They did work hard. But it seems \nto me that we all ought to be working harder. We have more time. As the \nSenator from Tennessee outlined the situation, we were very close, as \nhe put it, with three words separating the parties. Perhaps if we \ndebated the issue, somebody would have changed a position a little. \nSenator Corker was correct that there didn't need to be a very big \nchange. Also, when you make the arguments in public, you are under a \nlittle more scrutiny than making them in a back room behind closed \ndoors where very few people can hear what you are saying, a few people \ncan evaluate what you are saying, and there is little room for \ncriticism, as opposed to making it on the floor of the Senate where \neverybody can see and hear what you are doing and you have to stand \nbehind what you are doing. Or perhaps the parties who could not come to \nan agreement by tomorrow morning overnight would change their \npositions.\n  It seems to me that there would be nothing to be lost by invoking \ncloture and by debating the matter further and by seeing if we can't \ncome to some compromise and some adjustment. There is simply too much \ninvolved as the facts that I have cited earlier in this brief statement \nreflect on the potential economic destruction and losses.\n  I concur with the Senator from Illinois about the hardship on the \nworkers and the loss of salary and the loss of opportunity to support \ntheir families and pay tuition and monthly payments on the mortgage, et \ncetera, et cetera. No doubt about that. It is my view that we have a \nduty to go beyond the cloture vote and to take up the matter. I have \nnot given up hope that something may yet be done. The President had \nbacked--and I think still would--the bill that was submitted for \nconsideration--the House bill--absent the issue with respect to the \nlitigation, and perhaps there will be a way yet to find these bridge \nloans. Certainly, the amount of money involved, while not \nunsubstantial, is not enormous compared to the other bailouts that have \noccurred, compared to the total amount which the Congress authorized--\nthe $700 billion figure. In supporting the legislation which Senators \nLevin, Stabenow, Bond, Voinovich, Brown, and I had proposed back on \nNovember 20, that was an effort to try to have some deliberation. I was \nnot committed to that bill.\n\n  I am certainly not committed to any of the proposals that have yet \nbeen offered. But it would have been my hope that in the course of the \ndebate and discussion, and an opportunity by others and myself to offer \namendments, that we could have worked the will of the Senate to find \nour way through to move ahead on a short-term basis, a plan could be \nconstructed that was realistically calculated to succeed.\n  I am not in favor of throwing good money after bad. I believe \nphilosophically as a matter of public policy that the Government ought \nnot to pick winners and losers. That ought to be the decision of the \nmarket. The Government ought to intervene on economic aid or bailout \nonly where the consequences are potentially so disastrous that they \nwould deviate from that principle.\n  As we conclude this situation, I think this Senate could have done \nconsiderably better. I know many of us will continue to work with the \nadministration and with the parties involved.\n  I convened on December 2 a meeting in Philadelphia with high-ranking \nexecutives from Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, and labor leaders in \nPennsylvania, the United Auto Workers, the AFL-CIO statewide, and the \nPhiladelphia Labor Council; and auto dealers and suppliers and \neconomists and bankers came together to describe the scope of the \nproblem.\n  We had a meeting in the Lehigh Valley to grapple with the issue. \nCertainly, the impact on my State as a microcosm reflects the \ntremendous potential impact on the Nation as a whole. So we need to \ncontinue to work to do our best to find some answer administratively to \navoid the potential disastrous consequences which I have enumerated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I salute my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor joining us in voting for cloture. He\n\n[[Page S10935]]\n\nwas 1 of 10 Republicans who did this evening. They were Senators Bond, \nBrownback, Collins, Dole, Domenici, Lugar, Snowe, Specter, Voinovich, \nand Warner. The motion required 60 votes. It had 53. It was seven votes \nshort. The Senator from Pennsylvania took exception to my \ncharacterization earlier that the Republicans could have done more and \nhelped us pass that. I want the Record to reflect that on the final \nvote, before Senator Reid changed his vote for procedural reasons, 43 \nof the 46 Democrats voted in favor of the motion. Ten Republicans voted \nin favor.\n  It is clear we could have had more, certainly, but it would not have \nbeen enough to make up the seven-vote deficit. When less than a third \nof the Republicans voted in favor of it, it is pretty clear that most \nof those on the other side of the aisle did not support that motion, \ndespite the heroic vote by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10935-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. KERRY.

Madam President, my good friend Senator Ernest Hollings \ncontacted me and asked if I could have printed in the Record a \nstatement he has written about U.S. trade and manufacturing policy. It \nis my pleasure to do so.\n  Senator Hollings was a longtime chair of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee and a champion of American manufacturing. His statement \ncontains some insightful and provocative thoughts of his and I \nencourage all of my colleagues to read it.\n  Madam President. I ask unanimous ocnsent to have printed in the \nRecord Senator Hollings' statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Economists and Free Trade\n\n             (By former Senator Ernest F.

The \n     crowd that advised on deregulating the financial industry. \n     And the crowd that, after over stimulating the economy for \n     the past eight years to the tune of $5 trillion of deficit \n     spending, is now calling for, you guessed it, even more \n     financial stimulus!\n       According to the Congressional Budget Office, last year's \n     deficit or financial stimulus was $1.035 trillion. And as the \n     economists try to decide on the amount of stimulus sufficient \n     to jolt our clearly broken economy, we have already spent \n     $691 [12/5/08] billion on additional financial stimulus just \n     since October 1st--and it is not working.\n       To really prime the pump of the economy, it should be \n     ``billions for immediate infrastructure--and not much more \n     for financial stimulus.''\n       The need now is to create jobs and to stop increasing the \n     interest costs on the federal debt, costs that already \n     exceeds $500 billion a year--$500 billion which we should be \n     spending on universal health care and not on economic \n     steroids. More of the wrong kind of stimulus will only serve \n     to stimulate more production in China, at the expense of more \n     jobs being lost here at home.\n       Of course, the economists for the global financial \n     institutions and the big multinational corporations know \n     this, but because their loyalties are more to their \n     institutions and less to our nation, they continue their \n     calls for ever more ``free trade'' and for continuing U.S. \n     trade and current account deficits.\n       The irony is that economists learn in their very first \n     class in school that it was a trade war which brought us our \n     initial freedom as a country, and that semi-protectionism \n     later helped build the United States. England started a \n     ``trade war'' with the Colonies by adopting the Navigation \n     Act of 1651 that required all trade be carried in British \n     vessels. Manufacturing was forbidden in the Colonies, even \n     the printing of the Bible, and then the Townsend Acts drafted \n     by Adam Smith placed heavy import duties on a wide range of \n     items. All of this precipitated the Boston Tea Party that \n     started the Revolution.\n       While we obtained our freedom in 1776, it wasn't until 1787 \n     that we empowered Congress, in Article I, Section 8, of the \n     Constitution, to regulate commerce, both domestic and \n     foreign. President George Washington's first message to the \n     first Congress in 1789 warned that, ``A free people should \n     promote manufactories to render them independent of \n     essential, particularly military, supplies.'' Thereafter, the \n     United States was financed and built for 100 years with semi-\n     protectionism, and we didn't even pass the income tax until \n     1913. At the advent of the Transcontinental Railroad, it was \n     suggested that the needed steel be obtained from England--but \n     President Abraham Lincoln strongly objected and required the \n     steel to be produced in the United States. And Edmund Morris, \n     describes how the U.S. won the trade war with England in his \n     remarkable book ``Theodore Rex'' about President Teddy \n     Roosevelt. President Roosevelt exclaimed at the time, ``Thank \n     God I am not a free trader.''\n       Under the new phenomenon called ``globalization'', the so-\n     called ``comparative advantage'' which underpinned the early \n     centuries is no longer God-given or determined by the \n     weather, as was the case, two centuries ago, with David \n     Ricardo's English woolens and Portuguese wine. Now commercial \n     success is largely created, or not, by government policies, \n     and the United States government refuses to compete for such \n     success, even though, as The Economist magazine reported \n     recently, ``Business these days is all about competing with \n     everyone from everywhere for everything.''\n       Right after World War II, Japan started its trade war by \n     competing in international trade for market share rather than \n     profit. Japan closed its domestic market and sold its exports \n     at cost, making up the profit in its closed market. It \n     subsidized production and targeted certain items in trade--\n     first textiles, then electronics, machine tools, robots and, \n     finally, automobiles. As a consequence, Toyota is today #1 as \n     General Motors, Chrysler and Ford struggle just to survive.\n       China's post-WWII trade war began when it closed its \n     domestic market to articles domestically produced, but opened \n     it to foreign production in exchange for research and \n     technology. General Motors, Intel and Microsoft, among \n     others, have established major research facilities in China, \n     and the U.S. is now running well more than a $1 billion per \n     month trade deficit with China in just advanced technology \n     products. China has accumulated dollar reserves in excess of \n     $1.3 trillion, and it is now far and away the world's \n     superpower in trade.\n       These behaviors by Japan, China, India and others are \n     manifest in almost all of America's imports, but they are \n     most manifest in automobiles, where the focus and the \n     consequences are crystal clear.\n       The United States Congress looks at the BMW plant in South \n     Carolina, my home State, and the Nissan plant in Mississippi \n     as examples of relative success and wonders what's the matter \n     with Detroit?\n       Yet BMW received a tax deferral benefit of $100 million to \n     locate in South Carolina and Nissan received over $300 \n     million to locate in Mississippi. And all Detroit got--Ford, \n     GM and Chrysler alike--was tax incentives to leave the \n     United States and offshore its jobs and production.\n       The supervisory personnel from Germany and Japan who run \n     BMW's and Nissan's plants have health care and retirement \n     benefits paid for by Germany and Japan. Detroit has to pay \n     for the health care and retirement benefits of its \n     supervisory personnel.\n       BMW and Nissan have deductible health care for its \n     employees. Detroit has to pay full health costs on its \n     employees.\n       BMW and Nissan hire forty-five year olds and under in order \n     to minimize health costs. Detroit has a lot of senior people \n     and legacy costs.\n       The major parts that BMW and Nissan use to assemble cars in \n     the United States are produced 19% cheaper in Germany and 5% \n     cheaper in Japan because BMW's and Nissan's VAT taxes are \n     rebated when parts are shipped for assembly in the United \n     States. Detroit pays all local, state and federal taxes on \n     its parts.\n       Nissan, with a largely closed domestic market, does not \n     have to make a profit, and thus located in the United States \n     for market share. Detroit needs to make profits.\n       BMW and Nissan high-ball the costs of their imported parts \n     so as to minimize profits and taxes to the United States. \n     Detroit has to pay taxes on its profits.\n       And now, no surprise, the U.S. has a net deficit of $10 \n     billion a month in foreign car imports, or more than $1 \n     trillion in the last eight years, all because of highly and \n     in some cases illegally subsidized competition with Detroit.\n       And yet some influential economists still call this ``free \n     trade''.\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid charged Ford, General \n     Motors and Chrysler ``to get their act together [and] to come \n     up with something.'' But Detroit can't do it alone. The new \n     President and Congress must come up with something at the \n     same time for Detroit to recover long-range. Using his \n     authority to protect our national security, President John F. \n     Kennedy instituted his seven-point policy of protection for \n     textiles in 1961. Under Section 201 of the Trade Act, \n     President Ronald Reagan threatened quotas on automobile \n     imports in order to get Voluntary Restraint Agreements from \n     Japan. So clearly the authority is there for President-elect \n     Obama and Congress to impose quotas on imported cars so that \n     Detroit can recover long-term long-range.\n\n[[Page S10936]]\n\n       Of course, it is not just jobs and production we are \n     offshoring, but also research and development, high-end \n     services and critical military materials.\n       Thus, Congress must also vigorously (re)assume its \n     responsibility under Article I, Section 8, of the \n     Constitution for regulating trade in general. It must protect \n     our important production and standard of living. And it must \n     make it profitable to invest and produce in the United \n     States.\n       A value added tax is in order, and long overdue in fact. \n     Every industrialized country except the United States has a \n     value added tax, which is levied on all imports and rebated \n     to manufacturers whenever they export. Today, however, \n     imports into the United States come without any taxes being \n     imposed on them, and U.S. manufacturers not only must pay all \n     corporate taxes but the VAT on their exports.\n       A U.S. VAT would immediately remove a tremendous \n     disadvantage to production in the United States and begin to \n     deter outsourcing, and the revenues from it would help \n     eliminate both our massive fiscal and trade deficits. Since \n     it would take a year for business and the Internal Revenue \n     Service to gear up for a VAT, in the meantime, we should \n     institute a 10% surcharge on imports as President Nixon did \n     so successfully in 1971.\n       We must also activate the Commerce Secretary's list of \n     materials critical to our national security. By placing \n     tariffs or quotas on items necessary to our national security \n     and producing them in-country, we will not only be better \n     prepared to defend ourselves but we can put American workers \n     back to work. In 1991, Admiral William Crowe, who was then \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned against the \n     outsourcing of military supplies. In Desert Storm we had to \n     await Japanese flat-panel displays before invading Kuwait. We \n     had to await Swiss crystals before invading Iraq. Now we \n     can't produce planes unless we get certain parts from India, \n     and helicopters unless we get parts from Turkey. This \n     nonsense has got to stop.\n       Of course for years economists have told us not to worry \n     about the loss of manufacturing jobs, because the United \n     States would simply and easily become a high-end service \n     economy. But as Robyn Meredith writes in her wonderful book \n     ``The Elephant and the Dragon'': ``As China has famously \n     become the factory to the world, India is becoming the \n     world's back office . . . As many as 300,000 American jobs \n     each year will move overseas [to India] for the next thirty \n     years--nine million jobs in all.''\n       So then the economists told us to ``educate.'' But if they \n     are referring to skills, South Carolina instituted a skilled \n     training program forty-seven years ago, and BMW in \n     Spartanburg, S.C. is now producing a better quality car than \n     BMW produces in Munich, Germany. And South Carolina's \n     technical training program is now being mimicked by Intel in \n     Ireland. But no State and not the United States can educate \n     their way out of unfair competition.\n       Then there was NAFTA. I voted for NAFTA with Canada because \n     Canada has a free market. A country must have a free market \n     to have free trade. Mexico doesn't have a free market. I \n     counseled the trade policy of the European Union. The EU \n     requires that, before being admitted to the European Union, a \n     country must have developed the entities of a free market \n     like property rights, labor rights, a minimum wage, anti-\n     trust provisions, an independent judiciary, etc. Countries of \n     the European Union taxed themselves $5 billion for five years \n     to develop a free market in Greece and Portugal before \n     admitting them to the EU. Mexico still doesn't have labor \n     rights. U.S. corporations are known to sign up for a union \n     before locating in Mexico, but only pro forma--no business \n     agent at the Mexican facility, and the Mexican workers never \n     hear of having a union. Under Mexican law, if one tries to \n     organize a plant that already has a union, you're fired. On a \n     visit to Tijuana I met with 12 workers who were fired because \n     they tried to organize a union not knowing the plant had one. \n     NAFTA superimposed U.S. subsidized corn on two million small \n     scale Mexican corn farmers putting them out of business. The \n     Mexican farmers headed for the border for work. NAFTA not \n     only exacerbated immigration, but the United States lost jobs \n     and Mexico's workers are paid less today than before NAFTA. \n     We still ought to try the European Union approach in Mexico. \n     With the money we spend on fences, Border Patrol, \n     immigration, prosecutors, courts, jails, deportation, etc., a \n     mini Marshall Plan for Mexico could clean up the corruption \n     and drug problem and develop a free market in Mexico. This \n     will help solve our immigration problem.\n       As a last stand, the economists raise the specter of Smoot-\n     Hawley. The late Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania ``belled \n     that buzzard'', passing a protectionist trade bill in the \n     United States Senate twenty years ago. Smoot-Hawley \n     restricting imports did not cause the depression. It was \n     enacted eight months after the crash. At the time, 1930, \n     international trade amounted to only 1.3% of our economy. \n     Cordell Hull had us back with a plus balance of trade in 1933 \n     with his famous reciprocal free trade policy. The economists' \n     free trade policy (without reciprocity) has caused a \n     hemorrhaging of American jobs, production, research, \n     technology, investment and development to China and India.\n       Henry Ford not only developed mass production of \n     automobiles, but he also greatly contributed to the \n     development of the middle class in America, which is the \n     strength of our democracy. Ford doubled the minimum wage and \n     provided health care and retirement benefits for labor. He \n     strengthened communities with the Ford Foundation, and \n     business was diligent to keep America's economy strong. And \n     we in Congress got in the habit of following business's lead \n     on the economy, adopting Corporate America's suggestions for \n     production, marketing and competition.\n       But in globalization, Corporate America's leadership for \n     trade and a strong economy has been ``outsourced.'' The \n     industrial icon, Jack Welch, once announced at GE's annual \n     meeting that GE suppliers had to move to Mexico to produce a \n     less-costly product or no longer be considered a GE supplier.\n       Well, I worked with Corporate America to protect America's \n     investment and production.\n       When I was in the Senate, I worked with Corporate America \n     to keep our textile industry strong by passing a \n     protectionist trade bill in 1968. President Lyndon Johnson, \n     however, had Wilbur Mills, the powerful Chairman of the House \n     Ways & Means Committee, block the measure. Again with the \n     assistance of Corporate America, I helped pass four \n     protectionist trade bills through both Houses of Congress \n     only to see each of them vetoed--one by President Jimmy \n     Carter, two by President Ronald Reagan, and one by President \n     George H. W. Bush.\n       Presidents back then were anxious that capitalism defeat \n     communism in the Cold War and weren't worried about our \n     economy. Denied protection by Democratic and Republican \n     administrations, Corporate America began outsourcing and \n     offshoring. Now Corporate America opposes our government \n     competing in globalization with chants of ``free trade,'' \n     ``protectionism,'' ``don't start a trade war.'' Now, our \n     nation's business leaders and their economists, use every \n     trick in the book to mislead on ``protectionism.'' They form \n     organizations like The Trilateral Commission and The Business \n     Roundtable, they promote books like ``The World is Flat'' to \n     warn against protectionism, and even the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce is more interested in commerce on Main Street, \n     Shanghai than on Main Street, Spartanburg. The truth is \n     globalization has become nothing more than a trade war, with \n     the U.S. AWOL. And all the while, some major economists \n     oppose any measure to protect our domestic production and \n     economy, and they have become a ``fifth column'' in the trade \n     war.\n       As Sir James Goldsmith testified before the Committee of \n     Commerce in the United States Senate in 1994: ``It must \n     surely be a mistake to adopt an economic policy which makes \n     you rich if you eliminate your national workforce and \n     transfer your production abroad, and which bankrupts you if \n     you continue to employ your own people.''\n       But sadly, that's our policy today. Only the President and \n     Congress can change it!\n       As President Lincoln said: ``As our case is new, we must \n     think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves [from \n     free trade economists] and then we shall save our country.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10936-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10936-S10937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WILLIAM WILBERFORCE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yesterday, on the 60th anniversary of \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Senate and House passed \nan important and comprehensive human rights bill: the William \nWilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. \nI was a cosponsor of this bill in the Senate and celebrate its passage. \nI commend the leadership of Senators Biden and Brownback, \nRepresentatives Howard Berman and Chris Smith, and their staffs, for \nworking with Federal agencies and service providers to craft a \nconsensus, bipartisan bill that will enhance our national and global \nfight against the scourge of human trafficking. The TVPRA will \nstrengthen the Federal Government's ability to prosecute traffickers, \nprotect trafficking victims, and prevent future crimes.\n  It is impossible to discuss Congress's efforts to address the issue \nof human trafficking without acknowledging the invaluable contributions \nmade by the late Paul Wellstone and the late Tom Lantos. Senator \nWellstone was the moral conscience of the Senate, and he was the \ndriving force behind the initial antitrafficking legislation passed by \nCongress in 2000 and signed into law by President Clinton.\n  Representative Lantos, who introduced the first version of the TVPRA \nin 2007, passed away earlier this year after nearly three decades of \ndistinguished service in the House of Representatives. He was the only \nHolocaust survivor ever to serve in Congress, and this experience as a \nvictim of the 20th century's gravest human rights atrocity made him one \nof the leading voices in our time on human rights.\n\n[[Page S10937]]\n\n  Passage of the TVPRA is a tribute to the leadership and legacies of \nSenator Wellstone and Representative Lantos.\n  I am pleased that the authors of the TVPRA included two of my human \nrights initiatives from the 110th Congress. First, the TVPRA contains a \nlaw enforcement initiative I introduced with Senator Coburn called the \nTrafficking in Persons Accountability Act, which will allow Federal \nprosecutors to investigate and prosecute traffickers found in the \nUnited States even if their trafficking crimes were committed abroad. \nThis initiative, which I discussed in more detail in a Congressional \nRecord statement on October 1, 2008, makes an important statement about \nthis nation's intolerance for human rights abuses wherever they occur.\n  The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, working with other \nDOJ components and with U.S. attorney's offices around the country, \nbrought a record number of trafficking prosecutions in fiscal year \n2008, and the TVPRA provides the Justice Department with additional \ntools--including the Trafficking in Persons Accountability Act--to \ncontinue its vigorous fight against human trafficking.\n  The TVPRA also includes another human rights initiative of mine--the \nChild Soldier Prevention Act--to deter the use of children as soldiers \nin armed conflicts around the world. Each day, up to 250,000 children \nare exploited in state-run armies, paramilitaries, and guerilla groups \naround the world. These child soldiers serve as combatants, porters, \nhuman mine detectors, and sex slaves. Their health and lives are \nendangered and their childhoods are sacrificed. The lasting effects of \nwar and abuse may also remain with them long after the shooting stops.\n  The Child Soldier Prevention Act, which I introduced with Senator \nBrownback in 2007, is designed to encourage governments to disarm, \ndemobilize, and rehabilitate child soldiers that are being used and \nabused in government forces and government-supported militias. Using \nthe State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights as a barometer, \nthis bill limits the provision of U.S. International Military Education \nand Training, Foreign Military Financing, and other defense-related \nassistance in our foreign operations programs for countries that use \nchild soldiers. Countries that are identified in a Human Rights Report \nas recruiting or using child soldiers in government armed forces or \ngovernment-supported paramilitaries or militias in violation of \ninternational standards would lose their eligibility for substantial \nU.S. assistance.\n  Ishmael Beah made a compelling case for the urgent need for this \nlegislation in his testimony last year before my Senate Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, and in his firsthand account \nof his years as a child soldier in Sierra Leone in his book ``A Long \nWay Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier.'' In his testimony before my \nsubcommittee, Mr. Beah said:\n\n       As I speak to you, there are thousands of children from \n     ages 8 to 17--in Burma, Sri Lanka, Congo, Uganda, Ivory \n     Coast, Colombia, just to name a few places--that are being \n     forced to fight and lose their childhoods and their families. \n     They are maimed and lose their humanity, and these are the \n     fortunate ones. Those who are less fortunate are killed in \n     the senseless wars of adults.\n\n  There are credible reports that children are again being recruited to \nfight in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country that has suffered \na recent horrific surge in violence after years of being ravaged by \nwar, and a country that receives U.S. military assistance. The United \nNations Children's Fund reports that the forced recruitment of children \nas soldiers in Congo is widespread and on the rise. Since the most \nrecent outbreak of violence in August, more than 250,000 people have \nbeen displaced. According to the U.N., children who flee their homes \nare often separated from their families, and therefore left unprotected \nand vulnerable to warring parties that force them into their armies.\n  The use of child soldiers directly contravenes U.S. policy and the \nOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the \nInvolvement of Children in Armed Conflict, which the United States \nratified in 2002. The United States has a moral obligation to avoid \nfunding armed forces that use child soldiers. I am proud that with the \npassage of the TVPRA, we have taken an important step to try to stop \nthis abhorrent practice.\n  Finally, I want to highlight an important provision in the TVPRA that \nwill crack down on foreign diplomats in the United States who abuse \ntheir domestic employees. At a Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee \nhearing I chaired in 2007 regarding human trafficking, we heard \ntestimony from a distinguished human rights lawyer, Martina Vandenberg, \nwho represents several trafficking victims in lawsuits against their \ntraffickers. Due to the doctrine of diplomatic immunity, a legal \nprinciple that exempts certain government officials from the \njurisdiction of U.S. courts, Ms. Vandenberg indicated that such \nlawsuits are routinely dismissed.\n  A July 2008 GAO report, which Senator Coburn and I requested, \nrevealed that there have been 42 documented allegations in the United \nStates of unlawful abuse, exploitation, or human trafficking by foreign \ndiplomats with immunity since 2000, and that the Justice Department has \nopened 19 criminal investigations of foreign diplomats in the past \nthree years alone. These are not isolated incidents.\n  The TVPRA requires the Secretary of State to suspend the issuance of \nA-3 and G-5 visas--used for the hiring of non-U.S. citizens as domestic \nworkers--with respect to foreign diplomats employed by a country or \ninternational organization that has a record of tolerating the abuse or \nexploitation of domestic workers. The act also prevents such visas from \nbeing issued or renewed unless the domestic worker meets personally \nwith a U.S. consular official outside the presence of the employer to \ngo over their employment rights and protections. And the act contains a \nrobust reporting requirement that will help keep Congress informed \nabout future incidents of abuse of A-3 and G-5 visa holders, as well as \nabout options to ensure that victims receive appropriate compensation \nif their rights are violated but they are prevented from seeking a \nremedy in court due to the assertion of diplomatic immunity.\n  Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery. President-elect \nBarack Obama has called it ``a debasement of our common humanity.'' \nWith the passage of the TVPRA--the fourth major antitrafficking bill \npassed by Congress in the past 8 years--Congress has once again \nexercised its moral leadership on one of the most urgent human rights \nchallenges of our time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10937-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10937-S10939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ANNOUNCING CHRISTOPHER JAMES DUFFIELD\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise today to announce to the Senate the \narrival of another Duffield in this world. Christopher James Duffield \nwas born to his parents, Steven and Cara, on the third day of November. \nChristopher's father Steven served as the executive director of the \nPlatform Committee at this year's Republican Convention in Minneapolis. \nPrior to that, Steven served as a senior policy advisor and chief \ncounsel to me at the Republican Policy Committee and the Senate \nRepublican Conference. Christopher's mother, Cara, is a partner at the \nlaw firm of Wiley Rein.\n  Christopher joins us at what is a tumultuous and difficult time for \nboth the Nation and the Republican Party. On November 4, we Republicans \nfared poorly in Federal elections, losing the Presidency and deepening \nour deficit in the House and Senate. The new majority promises to cure \nthe Nation's economic ills with a Keynesian spending spree of the type \nthat worked so brilliantly in the 1930s, and pledges that it will \nreduce taxes for 95 percent of Americans, while only increasing them \nfor some other guy. Many fear that the coming years will put the test \nto Alexis de Tocqueville's warning that ``the American Republic will \nendure, until politicians realize they can bribe the people with their \nown money.''\n  Meanwhile, since September of this year, the United States has \nexperienced a severe financial crisis, precipitated by the collapse of \nbanks that have been overwhelmed by the weight of unsound mortgages \nthat they acquired. Many established and storied financial institutions \nhave disappeared in bankruptcies and mergers during the last few \nmonths. As lending has tightened, unemployment has increased, and\n\n[[Page S10938]]\n\nthe Nation appears to be headed into a deep recession. And on November \n26, as if to remind us that the other problems confronting our nation \nhave not receded, a group of Islamic terrorists attacked innocent \ncivilians in the Indian city of Bombay, killing 171 people. Those \nattacks reminded many of us of the evil that this Nation faced on \nSeptember 11, 2001, and of the long war that still lies ahead of us.\n  And yet--and yet, things are not so bad. The United States is about \nto complete another peaceful democratic transition, and has just \nelected its first African-American President, giving hope to many that \nthe Nation will yet overcome its racial divisions. The current credit \ncrisis is not unlike ones that we have survived in the past, and our \nunderstanding of the financial system and how to fix it certainly is \nmuch deeper than it was in 1929. And, had you asked Americans 7 years \nago, very few then would have dared to guess that the United States \nwould not suffer any foreign terrorist attacks on its soil during these \nensuing 7 years.\n  The Republican Party, though currently unloved, will return to its \nroots and eventually regain the confidence of the American people. And \nthough Republicans will be out of power in the political branches, the \ncurrent President, with a little help from his friends, has made two \nvery fine appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court, restoring a semblance \nof the rule of law to that branch of government for the first time in \nmany years.\n  The Republicans' loss of the Presidency may even have some salutary \neffects. Already, there are signs that with a Democrat coming to the \nWhite House, our Nation's liberal press may relent in its 8-year \nassault on the authority of the executive branch. On the day that \nChristopher was born, I and many others picked up the New York Times \nand nearly spilled our coffee when we came across a front-page article \nthat was titled: ``Next President Will Face Test on Detainees--Some at \nGuantanamo Called Serious Risks.'' I will ask that a copy of this \narticle be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  For at least 5 years now, anyone who relied on the New York Times as \na source of information about the world was liable to come away with \nthe impression that the men held by our military at the Guantanamo \nNaval Station are detained there purely out of spite or out of some \nother even less pure motive. News stories about Guantanamo have \ncredited every accusation made by the detainees and their lawyers, no \nmatter how implausible, but would treat with great skepticism any \nevidence that the Guantanamo detentions are necessary--that is, on the \nrare occasion when the papers could even be bothered to report such \nevidence.\n  And yet just as a Democratic Presidential victory began to seem \ninevitable, the New York Times treats us to this article. We learn \ntherein that many of the detainees have participated in terrorist \nattacks against Americans, are skilled in bombmaking and other \nterrorist arts, or have announced that they would like nothing better \nthan to return to killing innocent people. For some of us, it is not \nnews that the men detained at Guantanamo are dangerous. I would invite \nmy colleagues to review the minority views that I and others submitted \nfor Senate Report 110-90, or Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion in the \nBoumediene case. And on November 3, for the first time, such \ninformation is not news even to those who trust the New York Times.\n  Public-relations victories like this one are important, for \nultimately our enemies do not expect to defeat us on the battlefield. \nRather, they seek to win by sowing fear, by demoralizing us, and by \nweakening our will to defend ourselves. Their particular brand of \nmedieval barbarism will never sustain a civilization capable of \ndefeating us in a conventional battle, but even a powerful nation such \nas ours must be willing to fight if it is to prevail against such an \nenemy.\n  I know that Steven and Cara will instill in young Christopher, and \nhis sister Laura, an appreciation and respect for our Nation, its \nunique institutions, and its open and democratic culture. It is just \nsuch people, who understand this country and its virtues, who \nultimately will ensure that the American way of life continues and even \nthrives. And it is thus with hope for the future that I welcome young \nChristopher James Duffield to this world.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following news article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 3, 2008]\n\n               Next President Will Face Test On Detainees\n\n\n                Some at Guantanamo Called Serious Risks\n\n               (By William Glaberson and Margot Williams)\n\n       They were called the Dirty 30--bodyguards tor Osama bin \n     Laden captured early in the Afghanistan war--and many of them \n     are still being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Others still at \n     the much-criticized detention camp there include prisoners \n     who the government says were trained in assassination and the \n     use of poisons and disguises.\n       One detainee is said to have been schooled in making \n     detonators out of Sega game cartridges. A Yemeni who has \n     received little public attention was originally selected by \n     Mr. bin Laden as a potential Sept. 11 hijacker, intelligence \n     officials say.\n       As the Bush administration enters its final months with no \n     apparent plan to close the Guantanamo Bay camp, an extensive \n     review of the government's military tribunal files suggests \n     that dozens of the roughly 255 prisoners remaining in \n     detention are said by military and intelligence agencies to \n     have been captured with important terrorism suspects, to have \n     connections to top Al Qaeda leaders or to have other serious \n     terrorism credentials.\n       Senators John McCain and Barack Obama have said they would \n     close the detention camp, but the review of the government's \n     public files underscores the challenges of fulfilling that \n     promise. The next president will have to contend with \n     sobering intelligence claims against many of the remaining \n     detainees.\n       ``It would be very difficult for a new president to come in \n     and say, `I don't believe what the C.I.A. is saying about \n     these guys,'' said Daniel Marcus, a Democrat who was general \n     counsel of the 9/11 Commission and held senior positions in \n     the Carter and Clinton administrations.\n       The strength of the evidence is difficult to assess, \n     because the government has kept much of it secret and because \n     of questions about whether some was gathered through torture.\n       When the administration has had to defend its accusations \n     in court, government lawyers in several cases have retreated \n     from the most serious claims. As a result, critics have \n     raised doubts about the danger of Guantanamo's prisoners \n     beyond a handful of the camp's most notorious detainees.\n       But as a new administration begins to sort through the \n     government's dossiers on the men, the analysis shows, \n     officials are likely to face tough choices in deciding how \n     many of Guantanamo's hard cases should be sent home, how many \n     should be charged and what to do with the rest.\n       The Pentagon has declined to provide a list of the \n     detainees now being held or even to specify how many there \n     are beyond offering a figure of ``about 255.'' But by \n     reviewing thousands of pages of government documents released \n     in recent years, as well as court records and news media \n     reports from around the world, The New York Times was able to \n     compile its own list and construct a picture of the \n     population still held at Guantanamo. Much of the analysis is \n     based on records of hearings at Guantanamo about individual \n     detainees, which have been made public since 2006 as a result \n     of an Associated Press law suit. The Times has posted those \n     documents on its Web site arranged by detainee name.\n       The analysis shows that about 34 of the remaining detainees \n     were seized in raids in Pakistan that netted three men the \n     government calls major Qaeda operatives: Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi \n     bin al-Shibh and Al Hajj Abdu Ali Shargawi. Sixteen detainees \n     are accused of some of the most significant terrorist attacks \n     in the last decade, including the 1998 American embassy \n     bombings, the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, and \n     the Sept. 11 attacks. Twenty others were called Mr. bin \n     Laden's bodyguards.\n       The analysis also shows that 13 of the original 23 \n     detainees who arrived at Guantanamo on Jan. 11, 2002, remain \n     there nearly seven years later. Of the approximately 255 men \n     now being held, more than 60 have been cleared for release or \n     transfer, according to the Pentagon, but remain at Guantanamo \n     because of difficulties negotiating transfer agreements \n     between the United States and other countries.\n       Two of those still held, government documents show, were \n     seen by Mr. bin Laden as potential Sept. 11 hijackers. The \n     case of Mohammed al-Qahtani, whom the government has labeled \n     a potential ``20th hijacker,'' has drawn wide notice because \n     he was subjected to interrogation tactics that included sleep \n     deprivation, isolation and being put on a leash and forced to \n     perform dog tricks.\n       The other detainee deemed a potential hijacker, whose \n     presence at Guantanamo has gone virtually unmentioned in \n     public reports, is a Yemeni called Abu Bara. The 9/11 \n     Commission said he studied flights and airport security and \n     participated in an important planning meeting for the 2001 \n     attack in Malaysia in January 2000.\n\n[[Page S10939]]\n\n       The Guantanamo list also includes two Saudi brothers, \n     Hassan and Walid bin Attash. The government describes them as \n     something like Qaeda royalty. Military officials said during \n     Guantanamo hearings that their father, imprisoned in Saudi \n     Arabia, was a ``close contact of Osama bin Laden'' and that \n     his sons were committed jihadists.\n       Walid bin Attash is facing a possible death sentence as a \n     coordinator of the Sept. 11 attacks. Hassan bin Attash was \n     alleged to have been involved in planning attacks on American \n     oil tankers and Navy ships.\n       Hassan bin Attash's lawyer, David H. Remes, said the \n     government's claims about the detainees were not credible. He \n     and other detainees' lawyers say that the government's \n     accusations have been ever-changing and that much of the \n     evidence was obtained using techniques he and others have \n     described as torture. ``You look at all of this stuff, and it \n     looks terribly scary,'' Mr. Remes said. ``But how do we know \n     any of it is true?''\n       The extensive use of secret evidence and information \n     derived from aggressive interrogations has led critics around \n     the world to conclude that many detainees were wrongly held. \n     Nearly seven years after Guantanamo opened its metal gates, \n     only 18 of the current detainees are facing crimes charges.\n       While both presidential candidates have said they would \n     close the detention center, they have not said in detail how \n     they would handle the remaining detainees.\n       Mr. McCain has said he would move the Guantanamo detainees \n     to the United States but has indicated that he would try them \n     in the Pentagon's commission system established after 9/11. \n     After the conviction at Guantanamo, last summer of a former \n     driver for Mr. bin Laden, Mr. McCain said the verdict \n     ``demonstrated that military commissions can effectively \n     bring very dangerous terrorists to justice.''\n       Mr. Obama has said that the Bush administration's system of \n     trying detainees ``has been an enormous failure'' and that \n     the existing American legal system--trials in either civilian \n     or military courts--was strong enough to handle the trials of \n     terrorism suspects.\n       But in a speech on the Senate floor in 2006, Mr. Obama \n     suggested that the allegations against many of the detainees \n     needed to be taken seriously. ``Now the majority of the folks \n     in Guantanamo, I suspect, are there for a reason,'' he said. \n     ``There are a lot of dangerous people.''\n       Some of the remaining prisoners have appeared determined to \n     show how dangerous they are. ``I admit to you it is my honor \n     to be an enemy of the United States,'' said a Yemeni \n     detainee, Abdul Rahman Ahmed, a hearing record shows. \n     Officials said Mr. Ahmed had been trained at a terrorist camp \n     ``how to dress and act at an airport'' and to resist \n     interrogation.\n       A Saudi detainee, Muhammed Murdi Issa al Zahrani, was \n     described by Pentagon officials as a trained assassin who \n     helped plan the suicide-bomb killing of Ahmed Shah Massoud, \n     the Afghan rebel leader, on Sept. 9, 2001.\n       ``The detainee said America is ruled by the Jews,'' an \n     officer said at a hearing after interviewing Mr. Zahrani, \n     ``therefore America and Israel are his enemies.''\n       One man caught with Abu Zubaydah insisted on his innocence \n     but described a training camp outside Kabul, Afghanistan, \n     where, according to information he gave to interrogators, men \n     were given ``lessons on how to make poisons that could be \n     inhaled, swallowed or absorbed through the skin.''\n       Mr. bin al Shibh was caught with a group of six Yemenis, \n     all of whom are still held, after a two-and-a-half-hour gun \n     battle. The records of those detainees include allegations \n     that some were ``a special terrorist team deployed to attack \n     targets in Karachi.'' One of the men, Hail Aziz Ahmad al \n     Maythal, was trained in the use of rocket-propelled grenade \n     launchers, machine guns and ``trench digging, disguise \n     techniques, escape methods, evasion and map reading,'' \n     according to the military's allegations.\n       The records include many of the murky cases that typify the \n     image of Guantanamo, where detainees take issue with their \n     own supposed confessions and, sometimes, their identities. \n     And those doubts too are to be part of a new administration's \n     inheritance.\n       ``I was forced to say all these things,'' an Algerian \n     detainee, Adil Hadi al Jazairi bin Hamlili, said at his \n     hearing when confronted with his confession to murder and \n     knowledge of a plot to sell uranium to Al Qaeda. ``I was \n     abused mentally and psychologically, by threatening to be \n     raped,'' he said, adding, ``You would say anything.''\n       Abdul Hafiz, an Afghan accused of killing a Red Cross \n     worker at a Taliban roadblock in 2003, told a military \n     officer that he had the perfect alibi. ``The detainee states \n     again that he is not Abdul Hafiz,'' the officer reported to a \n     military tribunal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10939-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10939-S10940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                              Gordon Smith\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would like to pay tribute today to the \nservice of Senator Gordon Smith, who has served the people of Oregon \nand his country with honor. I have had the pleasure of serving with \nSenator Smith during his two terms here in the Senate, and during that \ntime he, and his wife Sharon, have been become dear friends. Marcelle \nand I have often enjoyed traveling with Senator Smith and his wife \nSharon, including a couple of trips to Davos, Switzerland, for the \nWorld Economic Forum.\n  Senator Smith began his political career in 1992 when he was first \nelected to the Oregon State Senate. There he served as Minority Leader, \nand the President of the Senate during his first term in office. Since \nhis election to the United States Senate, Senator Smith has always been \nwilling to reach across the aisle to bring our colleagues together and \nhis leadership has produced a list of impressive legislative \naccomplishments.\n  During his two terms here in the Senate, Senator Smith has committed \nhimself to efforts on behalf of the people of Oregon, supporting both \ncriminal justice reform and expansion of youth services. Following the \ntragic death of his son Garrett, Senator Smith worked tirelessly as an \nadvocate for the early intervention and prevention of youth suicide, \nestablishing a grant program for youth mental health programs through \nthe Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act which was signed into law by \nPresident Bush in 2004. I also appreciate the partnership that we \nforged in advancing the Innocence Protection Act, a package of modest \nprocedural reforms relating to the death penalty, which I introduced in \n2000, and much of which was enacted several years later.\n  Marcelle and I have valued his friendship and wish Gordon and Sharon \nall of the best.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Madam President, for most of my time in the Senate it has been my \nprivilege to serve alongside one of its most respected members, the \nsenior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner. As he prepares to retire from \nhis Senate service, I would like to pay tribute to him as a leader, a \nlegislator, and as one of my closest friends in this body.\n  John Warner is a living emblem of the finest the Senate has to offer. \nHe is a skilled policymaker who actively contributes to the civility \nthat helps the Senate function as the Founders intended.\n  Senator Warner has represented the Commonwealth of Virginia with \nvision, persistence and wisdom. He has helped lead the Senate through \ndebates on some of the most nettlesome national security issues of our \ntime. Always a gentleman, he has carried himself with the utmost \nintegrity and honesty. He is a Senator of his word. We have worked \ntogether on many issues, and I am going to miss his counsel and his \nfriendship.\n  John Warner came to the Senate in 1979, after early service in the \nU.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corp's, which led to his successful \ntenure as the Secretary of the Navy. He quickly made his mark on one of \nCongress's most important committees for steering our national security \napparatus, the Senate Armed Services Committee. He rose quickly in \nseniority and has served as the committee's chairman, ranking member, \nand chairman emeritus.\n  He formed a now legendary partnership with Senator Sam Nunn of \nGeorgia, and together they worked to fundamentally restructure the \nNation's war-fighting organization in the mid-1980s. He has worked \nclosely with the committee's current chair, Senator Levin, and with \nranking member Senator John McCain, to support our troops through the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a member of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I have seen how the two key defense committees have come \ntogether to make that extensive and crucial department work better. \nJohn Warner has been an important part of this superb working \narrangement, and it was fitting that the fiscal year 2007 Defense \nAuthorization Bill was named in his honor.\n  Senator Warner is an accomplished advocate for Virginia--the home to \na wide variety of military installations, as well as to rural and urban \ncommunities of varied needs. He has tackled the difficult \ntransportation challenges of the Washington, DC, metropolitan area, \nmaking a real difference in the lives of millions. As a part time \nresident of Virginia I have always called him my Senator away from \nhome.\n  Marcelle and I have enjoyed the friendship and company of John and \nhis wife Jeanne, including on the Senate's delegation to the recent \n60th Anniversary of D-Day. Foreign leaders know Senator Warner \nextremely well;\n\n[[Page S10940]]\n\nthey see him, as we do here in the Senate, as a man of great stature \nand wisdom.\n  I thank John for his service and for his friendship, and Marcelle and \nI join all Members of the Senate in wishing John and Jeanne all the \nbest in their future endeavors.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Madam President, I rise to acknowledge the work and commitment of a \ncolleague whom I have had the pleasure of serving with for the last 12 \nyears here in the U.S. Senate. Senator Chuck Hagel joined the Senate in \n1997 after an already successful career in business and public service, \nboth in his home State of Nebraska and here in Washington, DC.\n  While in the Senate, Chuck has been a strong independent voice for \nall Nebraskans and citizens of this country. He is not afraid to share \nwhat is on his mind and he is certainly not afraid to reach across the \naisle to work with all Senators. In one of his first acts of \nbipartisanship, Senator Hagel joined me as a cosponsor of the Landmine \nElimination Act of 1997. I worked with Chuck, who was himself injured \nby landmines while in Vietnam, to ban new deployments of antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  Senator Hagel has demonstrated an incredible alacrity on defense and \nforeign policy issues. While it was not popular within his own party, \nhe made the difficult decision to support a timeline for the withdrawal \nof troops from Iraq. This is just one example of many stances he has \ntaken in Washington that demonstrates how Chuck Hagel was an \nindependent voice that Nebraska is proud to call their own.\n  I am also pleased to know Chuck and Lilibet as wonderful travel \npartners. The last trip we took together, in May 2007, was to the \nMiddle East to assess regional conflicts in Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and \nthe West Bank. Trips like these provide the opportunity to get to know \nSenators and their spouses beyond the day-to-day encounters in \nWashington and I cherish the time we had to together.\n  I am pleased to call Chuck a friend and voice of reason in the U.S. \nSenate. I will miss him as both a friend and colleague. Marcelle and I \nand wish him and Lilibet well in whatever way he will next serve \nNebraska and our Nation.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Madam President, I would like to pay tribute to the senior Senator \nfrom New Mexico, a dedicated public servant, a respected lawmaker and a \nman I am proud to call my colleague, Pete Domenici.\n  From his first days in the Senate in the 93rd Congress, to now 35 \nyears later, Senator Domenici has earned a reputation as a powerful \nchampion for New Mexico. While he and I have not agreed on some issues, \nI have never questioned his commitment to do what he believed was right \nfor this country and the State of New Mexico. However, I might question \nwhich of our Italian grandmothers made a better meatball, but then \nagain I wouldn't want a fight to break out here on the Senate floor.\n  Senator Domenici has too many accomplishments to list here today. \nSenator Domenici has had a long and distinguished career in the U.S. \nSenate. However what stands out most to me is his unending drive to \nenact Mental Health Parity legislation which he worked on so closely \nwith our late colleague Paul Wellstone. I believe it was a fitting \ntribute to enact this legislation in the closing days of the 110th \nCongress.\n  I know it can sound repetitive when people hear Senators make remarks \nsuch as these about our colleagues as they are leaving the Senate. But \nI think it is important for the public to know that despite all the \nsquabbling that goes on in Washington, there is the deep respect, \naffection, and caring that goes on among the Members of this body. \nAfter an incredible 35 years of service New Mexico and the whole United \nStates are grateful, and I consider myself fortunate to have served 33 \nyears with Pete Domenici in the U.S. Senate. Marcelle and I wish Pete \nand Nancy the best.\n\n\n                              Gordon Smith\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, when the Founders envisioned this \nSenate, I believe they hoped it would be a place where strong opinions, \nestablished life skills and varied experience would come together to \nserve the nation. Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon has matched that \nstandard and the whole nation has benefited.\n  I have always been encouraged and inspired by Senator Smith's \nforward-looking mind and his energetic advocacy of a better life for \nall Americans. He has fought for better schools for our children. He \nconfronted the reality of America's ``drop-out culture'' and fought for \nindividualized attention for at-risk kids.\n  We have worked together to ensure that the Medicaid Program fulfills \nits promise to America's less fortunate, and to extend the excellent \nquality of American health care to a broader and broader share of the \npopulation.\n  It has been an honor to work with Gordon Smith on the Aging Committee \nin particular. His tireless advocacy to ensure that our seniors are \nafforded the dignity and respect they deserve has been an inspiration.\n  Gordon Smith has also been a strong voice for Oregonians on the \nenvironment and the natural treasures in their State. And he turned \npersonal tragedy into a nationwide effort to prevent suicide.\n  On issue after issue, Gordon Smith has demonstrated a boundless \nenthusiasm for the process of reform, and a confidence that we can \nalways make government programs more responsive, more relevant and more \neffective for the American people.\n  Like the modern day Oregon pioneers he represents, Gordon Smith has \nalways demonstrated both a fierce independence and a strong belief that \nthere is a better way--if we dream big, work hard and stick together, \nthere is no problem too big for America.\n  In ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' Hollywood memorialized the \ncommonsense man, of impeccable character, as the ideal Senator. Gordon \nSmith would have fit the part perfectly. I will dearly miss his \nintegrity, his enthusiasm, and his friendship in this place. But I am \nexcited for what the next chapter of his leadership will mean to Oregon \nand this country. I hope we can all bring more of his can-do spirit and \npositive energy to the urgent challenges we face in the days ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10940-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10940-S10941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TUCKER SHUMACK\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Tucker \nShumack's dedicated service to the Senate Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship over the past 3 years. An integral part of the \ncommittee staff, Tucker always performed his duties with the livelihood \nand success of small business owners in mind.\n  Tucker began his Capitol Hill service in the office of Senator Paul \nCoverdell from his home State of Georgia. After attending law school, \nTucker returned to Washington to work for the Congressman, and later \nSenator Johnny Isakson, also from Georgia. When he came to the Small \nBusiness Committee in the fall of 2005, Tucker was well-grounded in the \nways of Capitol Hill. From day 1, Tucker was proactive in efforts to \nmitigate the often unfair tax structure that small business owners \nface. Tucker's insights on these subjects have proven immensely \ncritical to me over the years.\n  Tucker has had many legislative successes helping me forge \ncommonsense bills that appeal to Members on both sides of the aisle. \nJust last year, Tucker was invaluable in helping me develop provisions \nto extend the Work opportunity tax credit, to expand small business \nexpensing and enhance the refundable child tax credit. These vital \nextensions give more people a chance at gainful employment and allow \nthousands of small businesses to succeed and thrive.\n  Whether it was extending the new markets tax credit, advocating for a \nfairer and simpler Tax Code, or confronting the mess known as the \nalternative minimum tax, Tucker consistently brought colleagues \ntogether to find reasonable and sound solutions to the myriad tax \nproblems facing Americans. His ability to forge lasting relationships \nhas made him a key player on Capitol Hill, and his diligence and \nperseverance have made him a trustworthy ally. My legislative \npriorities have been well served because of Tucker's talents and \nexpertise.\n  Always the Southern gentleman, Tucker is easy to get along with \nbecause of his charm, grace, and wit--the latter of which Tucker is \nmost famous\n\n[[Page S10941]]\n\nfor. His ability to make others laugh cannot be overstated! He has \ncertainly had a lasting impact on those with whom he has worked over \nthe years, and his cordial demeanor and welcoming smile will be missed \nin the Halls of the Capitol complex.\n  On a personal note, Tucker and his wife Kristine recently welcomed \ntheir first child, Tucker, Jr., into the world in August.

Madam President, earlier this summer, when gasoline \nprices were topping $4 a gallon, I asked the GAO to analyze potential \nsavings from the establishment of a national speed limit. I did not \nprescribe what that speed limit should be, merely asked the GAO to \nconduct an analysis at which speeds vehicles were most fuel efficient \nand make a determination as to whether a national speed limit would \nhave positive impacts on the conservation of gasoline.\n  My interest in this approach to gas conservation was spurred by a \ndesire for a measure that would provide immediate relief to the \noverstretched budgets of households across America. I was also dusting \noff a solution used in the past, specifically, the number of barrels of \noil saved when a national speed limit was imposed in 1974 in response \nto the Arab oil embargo.\n  Last week, I was pleased to meet with the GAO and hear their findings \non the relationship between vehicular speed and fuel economy as well as \nhow reducing the speed limit might affect fuel use and perhaps cost.\n  While the days of my service in the U.S. Senate are numbered, it is \nmy hope that these findings by the GAO can serve as a useful tool to my \ncolleagues who will return in the next Congress, as I know the \ninterlinked issues of energy, transportation, and climate change are \ngoing to remain the focus of much debate and policy making in the \ncoming years.\n  Mr. President, I thank the GAO for its work, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that GAO analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Energy Efficiency: Potential Fuel Savings Generated by a \n         National Speed Limit Would Be Influenced by Many Other \n         Factors\n       In response to Senator Warner's interest in obtaining \n     information on the possibility of using a national speed \n     limit to reduce fuel consumption, the Government \n     Accountability Office reviewed existing literature and \n     consulted knowledgeable stakeholders on the following:\n       What is the relationship between speed and the fuel economy \n     of vehicles?\n       How might reducing the speed limit affect fuel use?\n       Due to a limited time frame of two months to complete the \n     work, to address these objectives, we limited our analyses to \n     light-duty vehicles, such as cars, sport utility vehicles, \n     and pickup trucks and relied on the expertise of GAO and \n     knowledgeable stakeholders to identify the most relevant \n     economic and transportation literature. We provided a draft \n     to the three agencies whose officials we consulted for our \n     analyses--the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the \n     Department of Energy (DOE), and the Department of \n     Transportation (DOT)--and incorporated relevant technical \n     comments. We did not examine other aspects of implementing a \n     national speed limit, such as potential safety impacts. In \n     summary, we found the following.\n     According to Literature and Stakeholders, Reducing a \n         Vehicle's Speed Can Potentially Increase Its Fuel \n         Economy, Depending on the Vehicle's Characteristics\n       For a vehicle traveling at high speed, reducing its speed \n     increases fuel economy. In general, at speeds over \n     approximately 35 to 45 mph, if a vehicle reduces its speed by \n     5 mph, its fuel economy can increase by about 5 to 10 \n     percent, because air resistance, or drag, increases \n     exponentially as a vehicle goes faster. Conversely, air \n     resistance diminishes more rapidly as a vehicle slows down, \n     thus increasing its fuel economy.\n       According to existing literature and knowledgeable \n     stakeholders, there is no single speed that optimizes fuel \n     economy for all vehicles. Optimal speed for fuel economy for \n     individual vehicles ranges widely, but is generally between \n     30 and 60 mph, depending on a vehicle's characteristics. For \n     example, according to the most recent published data--a 1997 \n     study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, commissioned by the \n     Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), that examined fuel \n     economy at different speeds for nine automobiles and light \n     trucks from model years 1988 through 1997--the optimal fuel \n     economy for a 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee, a sport-utility \n     vehicle, would be about 26 miles per gallon at a steady 40 \n     mph. In contrast, in a 2008 internal study by the Argonne \n     National Laboratory for the Department of Energy (DOE), \n     examining four vehicles, the optimal fuel economy for a 2005 \n     Toyota Echo, a subcompact car, is about 69 miles per gallon, \n     achieved when traveling at a steady 30 mph.\n       However, a vehicle's fuel economy also depends on other \n     factors besides air resistance. Factors that enhance fuel \n     economy include engine efficiency enhancements (e.g., fuel \n     injection), electronic and computer controls, more efficient \n     transmissions, and hybrid technology. However, other factors, \n     such as increased vehicle weight, decrease fuel economy.\n       In general, over the last 2 decades, fuel economy gains \n     resulting from advances in automotive technologies have \n     largely been offset by increases in vehicle weight, \n     performance, and accessory loads. Specifically, vehicles are \n     heavier than in the past, because they are larger and include \n     more technologies. For example, average vehicle weight has \n     increased from 3,220 pounds in 1987 to 4,117 in 2008, \n     according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In \n     addition, trends show that recent vehicles, on average, have \n     bigger, more powerful engines that yield better performance--\n     i.e., acceleration and greater speed--at the expense of fuel \n     economy. For example, according to the same EPA report, \n     average horsepower has increased from 118 to 222 over the \n     same period. Further, increased accessory loads, such as air \n     conditioning and electronics, have also reduced fuel economy. \n     According to EPA, from 1987 through 2004, on a fleetwide \n     basis, technology innovation was utilized exclusively to \n     support market-driven attributes other than fuel economy, \n     such as performance. Beginning in 2005, however, according to \n     EPA's analysis of fuel economy trends, technology has been \n     used to increase both performance and fuel economy, while \n     keeping vehicle weight relatively constant.\n     According to Literature and Stakeholders, a Reduced Speed \n         Limit Is Only One of Many Factors That Could Affect Total \n         Fuel Use\n       Lowering speed limits can potentially reduce total fuel \n     consumption. According to literature we reviewed examining \n     the impact of the national speed limit enacted in 1974, the \n     estimated fuel savings resulting from the 55 mph national \n     speed limit ranged from 0.2 to 3 percent of annual gasoline \n     consumption. According to DOE's 2008 estimate, a national \n     speed limit of 55 mph could yield possible savings of 175,000 \n     to 275,000 barrels of oil per day. This range is consistent \n     with estimates of the impact of the past national speed \n     limit. According to the Energy Information Administration, \n     total U.S. consumption of petroleum for 2007 was about 21 \n     million barrels of oil per day.\n       However, other factors, including drivers' compliance with \n     a reduced speed limit, would affect the actual impact of a \n     lower speed limit on the amount of fuel savings. Reducing the \n     speed limit does not necessarily mean that drivers will \n     comply. In fact, in 1975, under the previous national speed \n     limit, about half of the states reported more drivers \n     exceeding the national speed limit of 55 mph than complying \n     with it. States may vary in their ability to enforce the \n     reduced speed limit, in part due to cost and limited \n     resources, affecting driver compliance. Moreover, a national \n     speed limit would not affect many of the miles driven in the \n     United States, such as those in urban areas, where most \n     vehicles are already traveling at lower speeds due to lower \n     speed limits or congestion. According to FHWA, fewer than one \n     quarter of the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the United \n     States would likely be directly affected by a changed speed \n     limit. In addition, congestion forces some vehicles to travel \n     slowly, no matter what the speed limit, meaning a reduction \n     would have little or no impact on fuel consumed on congested \n     roads.\n       Other external conditions also affect fuel economy, such as \n     road conditions, including whether a road is steep or flat, \n     and weather conditions, including wind speed and direction. \n     Finally, other aspects of driver behavior may also affect \n     fuel consumption. For example, driver behavior may be \n     affected by fuel prices. Higher prices may cause people to \n     drive less or purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles. \n     Similarly, driving at a consistent speed can reduce fuel \n     consumption. In contrast, aggressive driving such as \n     accelerating or stopping quickly can increase fuel \n     consumption. In addition, proper vehicle maintenance--\n     including regularly changing automobile fluids and filters \n     and properly inflating tires--improves fuel economy.\n       The speed limit is only one tool among many for potentially \n     conserving fuel. Certain realities such as congestion on our \n     nation's roads, how people drive and maintain their vehicles, \n     and emerging technologies are other potential considerations \n     as the nation looks for options to conserve fuel.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10942-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10942-S10943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10942]]\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       We farm close to 200 acres. We are young farmers (under \n     30), and we are trying to succeed in what seems to be a dying \n     occupation.\n       A huge blessing right now is that commodity prices are \n     high. Yet ridiculously high fuel prices is causing our \n     overhead to skyrocket. This year we are paying at least $70 \n     more per acre on fertilizer, due to the cost of fuel. Today I \n     paid our most recent bill for farm diesel, at $4.409 per \n     gallon. On ag diesel! Being farmers, we of course live \n     outside of town, so driving into town is cost-preventive. We \n     are wondering if there is any end in sight to the rise of \n     fuel prices. Will we be able to continue farming if the costs \n     keep rising? How high will they go? There are so many \n     questions. There has got to be an alternative to being at the \n     mercy of foreign oil suppliers. They are crippling our \n     society.\n\n     Troy and Krista, Caldwell.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for providing this outlet to vent. I find it \n     absolutely abhorrent that Venezuela and China can drill 60 \n     miles off the Florida coast but the U.S. cannot because of \n     the incredible power of the environmental lobby. (One \n     Senator) a few weeks ago said that even if we drilled in \n     ANWR, it would only affect the pump price of gas by a penny. \n     Yet when the President went to visit Saudi Arabia, (that same \n     Senator) said if the President could convince them to \n     increase output of 1 million barrels a day, it should drop \n     the price of gas by $.50. That is the same output potential \n     from ANWR, and yet he and other obstructionists on Capitol \n     Hill continue to get away with such duplicity and idiocy. If \n     we had started drilling there in the `90s when it first \n     passed Congress, we would now have more control over our own \n     energy destiny. Instead, we continue to find ourselves over \n     an Arab ``barrel.''\n       Energy is literally the fuel that drives our economy. It is \n     imperative that we take control of our future by placing \n     national interests ahead of the environmental extremists who \n     exert such control over our nation.\n     Richard, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the chance to tell you how the high energy \n     prices have affected our family. I am a stay-at-home mom of \n     two, ages 8 and 6. My husband and I have a lot of family who \n     lives in Utah who we use to travel and visit at least once a \n     month. Due to the high gas prices, we are only able to travel \n     down about every four months. We live just outside Idaho \n     Falls and use to drive where we needed to go without much \n     thought. Now my husband rides his bike to work and only \n     drives if the weather is terrible, and the kids and I have to \n     bike to run our daily errands. That would not concern me as \n     much but the roads we have to travel are very busy and do not \n     have bike lanes, sidewalks, or much of a shoulder so they are \n     dangerous for us to ride on. The kids and I, when we have to \n     bike, usually go about 10-15 miles round trip.\n       I would like to see us be able to increase our own oil \n     production and expand nuclear research. We need to be able to \n     stand on our own and not be dependent on foreign oil \n     especially from countries that are in constant turmoil and \n     not friendly to the U.S.\n       Thank you for taking the time to listen and for standing up \n     for Idahoans.\n     Shaleen.\n                                  ____\n\n       This may be the perfect opportunity to stand up for market \n     economics! We Americans are addicted to oil. The pain we are \n     now feeling may just be the kick in the pants we need to get \n     the collective will to do something about it. With gas so \n     expensive, alternatives become much more attractive. If \n     government must act, please do not sacrifice our last \n     remaining wilderness, or oceans, or air, to satisfy our \n     filthy addiction. Act to help us kick our dependence on this \n     stuff that is causing so many of our problems.\n     James.\n                                  ____\n\n       With a continuing rise in energy prices, our family is not \n     only effected at the gas pump but with an increase in grocery \n     and utility bills as well. Because of the great distances \n     between his clients, my husband drives over a 1000 miles a \n     month for his work. This has put a tremendous amount of \n     stress on the family budget. Our only hope before our family \n     hits financial ruin is that the federal government will think \n     more of the people they represent and less of special \n     interest groups.\n     Rebecca.\n                                  ____\n\n       We have let the environmental agenda highjack our country \n     and many [conservatives] are allowing it to happen. If we do \n     not start drilling in ANWR and using coal in place of \n     petroleum, we are going to be in a world of hurt. Alternative \n     energy sources are going to be great when they get here, but \n     that is a generation away. As a country trying to stave off \n     the jihadist and Latin dictators, we had better be self-\n     dependent on our own energy. I hope Congress understands \n     their [role] in this mess. How about a reduction in fuel \n     taxes? If the American people continue to be pressed, they \n     will react. There are unintended consequences that may be \n     very surprising to some. Thanks for your service to Idaho.\n     Wade.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have to travel 26 miles one way to work. With the price \n     of gas, it does not pay for me to drive back and forth to \n     work. I like my job but with everything else going up it \n     would be cheaper for me to stay home. I make around $11 per \n     hour and a tank of gas costs me about $50 to fill up a week. \n     That is $200 a month that really bites. I do not know how \n     long I can last without going in the hole and losing my home \n     and cars. If it were not for my wife's job, we would be on \n     welfare or in the streets. Thanks for all your help.\n     Henry.\n                                  ____\n\n       My wife and I live in Idaho and work in Spokane Washington. \n     We are part of a large group that must commute 35 mile one \n     way 5 or 6 days a week in order to pay our bills. My wife and \n     I spend in excess of $500 per month in fuel just for \n     transportation. This is an immense burden on us and will \n     cause a ripple effect in our ability to do other things.\n       The part that is most upsetting to us is that we all knew \n     that energy prices would increase dramatically at some point \n     and our elected officials chose to do nothing to prepare for \n     it. For more than 25 years, Congress has chosen to ignore the \n     need to force automakers to improve fuel economy and we have \n     seen the U.S car manufacturers overtaken by the Japanese in \n     part because the Japanese understood fuel mileage and \n     reliability go hand in hand. Congress has consistently chosen \n     to cut Amtrak funds and to not fund commuter rail and bus \n     lines.\n       The American public needs leadership. We do not need to \n     have the latest poll results re-read to us--again. This and \n     other crises facing the U.S. will require leadership and \n     sacrifice. Not Laissez-Faire political inaction.\n       Mass transit, enforced CAFE standards, funding for \n     alternatives in transportation, wind, solar and wave \n     generation. No more subsidies for oil companies. These must \n     be the priorities for Congress.\n       Nuclear energy is not clean, it is not safe in the long \n     term and it only lines the pockets of the major construction \n     firms.\n       Take a risk and lead from the front for a change.\n     Mark.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have always ridden my bike or walked around town to do my \n     errands, instead of using my vehicle. But when I have to work \n     15 miles away, I have to drive, plus driving is part of my \n     job.\n       I can no longer drive to see my 93-year-old aunt; it would \n     cost way too much. Yesterday, here in Hailey, a half tank of \n     gas cost me over $45. I can no longer afford to drive to \n     visit friends or go sightseeing.\n       I now have to buy cheaper quality foods and have to eat a \n     lot more starch than I desire to do. Forget beef! That is \n     totally out of the question.\n       I do not have air conditioning, so I am not using extra \n     energy there. I am very careful about leaving lights, TVs, \n     computers, etc. off when I am not using them. I run my washer \n     at night and hang my clothes on the line outdoors in good \n     weather, indoors on a drying rack in bad weather. And I have \n     always done this; I have always tried to save energy, but I \n     still get screwed because most people do not.\n       I have recycled for many years, and yet there are many \n     places in Idaho where recycling is not mandatory, so people \n     do not bother doing it. This includes well-to-do, educated \n     people, who just do not care, but would change their habits \n     if it were the law.\n       The price of everything has gone up, but my salary has gone \n     down, and I am frequently out of work. These are not good \n     times; pretty soon it will be a choice of gasoline or my \n     medications. Alternative fuel vehicles should have been \n     available for the general public at least 30 years ago. We \n     all know the technology is there.\n       Sign me as Disgusted in Idaho\n     Gloria, Hailey.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are changing our lifestyle! We are driving less. I \n     simply have stopped all but the most absolutely necessary \n     trips into town. We are moving appointments to coincide with \n     the one day a week we go to town, including attending a \n     Friday night worship service instead of making another trip \n     into town on Sunday to attend. We have quit participating in \n     activities such as extracurricular lessons and sports as the \n     added driving necessary to do these activities is now \n     unaffordable.\n\n[[Page S10943]]\n\n       Increased energy prices are being reflected in increased \n     food prices at the grocery store and at restaurants. We have \n     stopped eating out at restaurants completely, and have made \n     major adjustments to our eating habits, and to portions \n     served during meals at home. We are going back to a simpler \n     and less varied diet, and just trying to keep the staples \n     like beans, rice, milk, bread, eggs and cheese.\n       These changes we have made as a family do have an effect on \n     our local economy, as we are holding on to more of our \n     dollars, and not spending them in the community, the local \n     community businesses suffer--it is noticeable because there \n     are a lot of families like ours who are doing the same thing \n     we are because we simply have to in order to survive.\n       Our country is in a real predicament with the way the \n     government has managed our agricultural production as it ties \n     in with energy production. Ethanol is a poor solution as it \n     requires an imbalance in our crop production, and now wheat \n     prices are sky-high and production is behind. Corn uses a lot \n     of water, which requires fuel to pump and irrigate with, so \n     the net result of ethanol production to use is worse than \n     with pure fossil fuel.\n       I am not so concerned with the rising cost of fuel, as we \n     truly do have lower fuel costs than most of the rest of the \n     world, and there is nothing wrong with changing our \n     lifestyles to be less consumptive of our resources. What does \n     anger me is that fuel companies are recording record profits \n     quarter after quarter, while the cost of fuel is sending our \n     entire economy into a crisis, and causing our nation to be \n     weakened as a whole.\n     Kristine, Spirit Lake.\n                                  ____\n\n       First off, I would like to thank you for taking action on \n     our country's current energy crisis. I was starting to think \n     that most of our country's politicians were either simply \n     ignoring the issue or were not taking it seriously. I am so \n     glad to know that you are taking the initiative to look for \n     answers to the problem, and I am even more impressed that you \n     are actively looking for answers among the people you \n     represent. This does more to win my [confidence] than any \n     [action] could ever do.\n       My husband and I enjoy traveling, and the rise in prices \n     has definitely cut down on our travel this summer. We are \n     staying home more often and eating out less. My husband is a \n     student in the nursing program at ISU in Pocatello, and we \n     are concerned about trying to pay for gas as he travels \n     between Idaho Falls and Pocatello on a daily basis this fall. \n     In a more specific example, my husband's mother has \n     Alzheimer's disease, and since our time left with her is \n     limited, we planned a family reunion this year to give her at \n     least one more chance to have all of her children and \n     grandchildren around her. Some of my husband's family live \n     far away, and as airline prices continue to increase, it has \n     really strained their budgets to try to buy plane tickets to \n     come to Idaho. As a family, we have all pitched in to help \n     pay needed travel expenses, but it has been tough. I hate to \n     sound like a whiner, vacationing and eating out are things I \n     can, in the long run, live without, but the problem is that \n     energy prices just keep getting higher, and I do not see any \n     light at the end of the tunnel. I am starting to worry that I \n     will not be able to afford to heat my home this winter. This \n     last winter we used an electric blanket so we could turn our \n     heat off at night and save energy, and we kept our thermostat \n     low and dressed in warm clothes during the day, but Idaho \n     winters are cold, and there is not much more we can do to \n     conserve. We have to have energy to heat our homes and \n     transport us to work and school, and we are getting to the \n     brink of not being able to afford it.\n       As for answers to the problem, I am no expert on this \n     stuff, but I have done a little reading, and the best answers \n     I can find are as follows:\n       (1) Build coal to oil plants. Our country has a lot of \n     coal, and we can produce oil from coal for cheaper than we \n     are buying it right now.\n       (2) Make a push to build more nuclear power plants in the \n     US, and get to work on building them NOW!--they take a long \n     time to build and we are running out of time. I realize there \n     is a strong minority in our country that is good at halting \n     any effort toward starting new nuclear energy plants, but I \n     think if the American public were better educated on the \n     benefits, safety, and cleanliness of nuclear power, the \n     public would stand up against those minorities that are \n     stopping nuclear power in the US. That is why I think that \n     along with trying to build more nuclear power plants, we also \n     need to educate the public.\n       (3) Drill ANWR. I think that speaks for itself.\n       (4) I have been really disappointed that our President does \n     not seem to be saying much on the energy crisis. I think he \n     needs to address the American people and make it clear that \n     he sees this as a national crisis. I think he needs to \n     outline for the public what options are being debated in \n     Washington, and what the road blocks are we face. I really \n     think that if he would address this problem directly and \n     publically, it would capture the public's attention and get \n     people more active in standing up and working together to \n     help fix the problem. When 9/11 happened and our country \n     faced a huge crisis, the people of this country came together \n     to help those in need. I think that if we had a leader that \n     let the public know what was going on with the energy \n     crisis--i.e., why we are having such a huge energy crisis and \n     what our options are to fix things--then the people of this \n     country would band together to find answers. Personally, I \n     would like to see the American public band together to fight \n     against all the minority groups out there that stand in the \n     way of things like nuclear power and drilling for oil in \n     places like ANWR, but that just might be me.\n       Thanks for your efforts. I am glad to know someone in \n     Washington is working on this.\n     Lalove, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I believe getting a handle on energy prices is of utmost \n     importance for our economy. If we do not get it under \n     control, I believe we are headed for a depression the likes \n     of we have never seen before. With the trade imbalance \n     growing along with the cost of oil, at some point something \n     is going to break because we cannot keep a deficit growing at \n     this rate. It is vital that we look into alternative energy \n     sources but that is years away and we need to solve this \n     problem now. It also bothers me that a lot of the money being \n     spent is going to countries that support terrorism. That just \n     seems so backwards.\n       We need to develop the resources we have. It is so ironic \n     that the activists that are preventing the development of our \n     resources may in fact actually destroy the things they are \n     trying to preserve. I am in favor of protecting the \n     environment but we need to do it in the right way. When \n     energy prices reach a certain point, the majority of the \n     population will demand that these resources get developed any \n     way possible and that would probably end up destroying the \n     environment worse than if we do it the right way now. You can \n     not stop development of it forever and I think we need to do \n     it now when we can control how it is done. In other words, I \n     believe there is a point where the resources will be \n     developed without concern for the environment. I do not think \n     were are far from that.\n       In summary, I think we need to start developing our oil \n     resources now and continue to work on alternative energy \n     (including nuclear). If we delay I believe it will be \n     economically and environmentally disastrous for us.\n     Brent, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       Speed limits 55 mph national.

Madam President, I ask my fellow colleagues to \njoin me in honoring the memory of a dedicated educator and innovator, \nClemson University president emeritus Robert Cook Edwards. After a \nlifetime of unprecedented service to his students as Clemson's longest \nserving chief executive, Dr. Edwards passed away in Seneca, SC, on \nDecember 4, 2008, at the age of 94.\n  Dr. Edwards will be remembered for his legendary leadership, strength \nin business negotiation, and passion for Clemson football. Known as a \ngiant in the history of Clemson University and affectionately referred \nto as ``R.C.'' by his students, he led the institution through a period \nof peaceful integration and phenomenal growth to become a thriving, \ncoeducational, and diversified university.\n  Born and raised in Fountain Inn, SC, Dr. Edwards attended Clemson \nCollege at the young age of 15. He went on to graduate with a bachelor \nof science degree in textile engineering in 1933, and after a \nsuccessful career in the textile industry, he returned to Clemson as \nthe university's first vice president for development in 1956. Dr. \nEdwards became acting president in 1958, after the death of President \nRobert F. Poole, and was eventually elected president on April 9, 1959, \nby the board of trustees. He became the eighth chief executive of \nClemson and the second alumnus to hold the position.\n  Dr. Edwards peacefully led the university through racial integration \nwhen its first African-American student was enrolled in 1962. Despite \nthe recurring turmoil of racial tensions during the 1960s, President \nEdwards handled those challenging times without incident. His brave \nactions resulted in progress and advancement of equal civil rights \nthroughout the State of South Carolina.\n  By the time of his retirement in 1979, Dr. Edwards had awarded over \n28,000 diplomas, which represented more than 70 percent of all the \nundergraduate degrees and doctorates awarded in Clemson's history to \ndate, the student body had grown to 11,000 students, 4 schools had \nbecome 9 colleges, and the students could choose from over 60 majors. \nBecause of Dr. Edwards's oversight, leadership, and enthusiasm for \ngrowth, his influence has stretched beyond the gates of the university \nto impact the lives of men and women all over the country.\n  Dr. Edwards was predeceased by his wife Louise Odom Edwards, who died \non July 29, 2008. She was affectionately referred to as ``Moon Pie'' by \nClemson students and alumni and was said to be a perfect compliment to \nher husband, ``R.C.''\n  Robert Cook Edwards's legacy will live on not only in the hearts of \nhis students and fellow educators, but through the developments and \nachievements he has accomplished at one of our Nation's finest \ninstitutions. I ask that the Senate join me in commemorating Dr. \nEdwards's lifelong dedication to higher learning and to the State of \nSouth Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10944-4", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10944-5", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10944-6", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10944-S10945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:21 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 7321.

A bill to assist in creating substantive culture change in \nlong-term residential care by establishing a small house nursing home \nloan program to provide for the establishment, renovation, and \nconstruction of small house nursing homes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Promoting \nSmall House Nursing Homes Act. This is a bill I expect will play a \nsignificant role in the way we care for our older citizens in this \ncountry. I also hope and expect this bill to make an important \ncontribution to the framing and substance of the landmark health care \nreform we anticipate in the coming year. Moreover, because our current \neconomic problems are interwoven with out-of-control health care costs, \nthis bill will contribute to a revitalization of our economy and the \ncreation of new jobs. Finally, it will establish solid criteria for \nlong term residential care that will not only improve the quality of \nlife of older citizens, but save money through cost-effective, \ncomprehensive and coordinated long term and health care.\n  This bill provides a dramatically different approach to long term \nresidential care for older citizens than is offered by the traditional \nnursing home model.\n  The Promoting Small House Nursing Home Act incorporates the \nprinciples of person-centered care as a cornerstone of all aspects of \nlong term residential care. What do we mean by person-centered care? \nThe philosophy is simple: Our older citizens deserve to live lives of \ndignity and respect through all stages of life. About 10 years ago, the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer reported, ``Life can have quality and meaning \neven until the very last breath.'' Our older citizens have a profound \nright to be decision-makers in their own care--to be at the center of \ntheir own care, with a partnership of family and providers. Our older \ncitizens are critically important to the overall health and well-being \nof our society. I quote a well known expert in person-centered care, \nDr. Bill Thomas, who says, ``People of all ages will live better lives \nwhen we succeed in bringing elders back to the heart of our society.''\n  My bill translates this profound philosophy into a specific policy \nprescription by doing the following: creating a low-interest loan fund \nfor building new or renovating existing long term care facilities that \nfollow articulated small house nursing home model guidelines; \netablishing clear and specific program requirements and guidelines that \nbuild upon existing programs that have successfully implemented \nsubstantial culture change and person-centered care; creating a home-\nlike and non-institutional model of care for long term care residential \nfacilities that is based upon the principles of: collaborative \ndecision-making; respect; and significantly improved quality of life \nfor residents and staff alike.\n\n  We currently have an estimated 38 million Americans over the age of \n65, and that number is expected to double within the next 20 years. In \nthe midst of this, health care costs are rising exponentially, the \nquality of outcomes is not consistent, and older citizens are often \nabandoned to navigate a confusing and complex health care system. Older \ncitizens also report extremely low levels of satisfaction with life in \nnursing homes. This $122 billion industry includes 16,000 nursing homes \nand significant concerns persist about maltreatment and neglect of our \nolder citizens in 20 percent of these homes. As I know from my work in \nState government, most nursing homes provide quality care but that 20 \npercent is what we hear most about. However, a recent survey by the \nAARP found that fewer than 1 percent of individuals over 50 with a \ndisability want to move to a nursing home. There has to be a better \nway, and in fact there is.\n  Person-centered care provides that better way. It is a \nstraightforward concept and yet it has taken years of hard work to get \nconcrete initiatives underway. We have a long way to go and much to \nlearn. But in order to succeed, we must pass legislation like the bill \nI have introduced today.\n  Traditional nursing facilities require residents' lives to revolve \naround institutional schedules for waking, bathing and dressing. \nTraditional facilities far too often identify residents by their health \nconditions, vulnerabilities and room numbers rather than their unique \nstrengths and gifts. Staff members are attracted to the field of direct \ncare service because they want to help older citizens but they are just \nas ill-served by this institutionalized culture as are the residents. \nWorkers are minimally trained, over-worked and carry patient loads that \nmake it impossible to engage in any personal time with residents--in \nfact, such relationships are often discouraged. They have little or no \nsay in decision-making, relegated--like the residents--to the fringes \nof a system that places the needs of the institution over those of the \nhuman beings in it.\n\n[[Page S10948]]\n\n  In July of this year, I chaired a hearing for the Aging Committee \nthat examined this small house nursing home model. One of our witnesses \nwas a nursing assistant who previously worked for a traditional nursing \nhome and now works in a small house nursing home in Pennsylvania. She \nrecounted the difference, saying, ``Looking back on it, now, I realize \nthat while we offered our residents excellent nursing care, that did \nnot always translate into a high quality of life.'' She described \nhandling a wider range of duties now, yet having more time to spend \nwith individual residents and really getting to know--and even love--\nthem because the staffing is consistent and the turnover is almost non-\nexistent. Another witness at our July hearing was the daughter of a \nwoman who moved from a traditional nursing home to a small house \nnursing home. She summed up the dramatic change in her mother with this \nsimple phrase, ``Suddenly, life mattered again.''\n  It should be a given that ``life matters'' to every person. While \nevery citizen has this fundamental right, our older citizens who have \nworked hard their whole lives truly deserve to enjoy their later years \nin homes that offer them comfort, respect and autonomy. I strongly \nbelieve the Promoting Small House Nursing Homes Act will make this \npossible and I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this \neffort in its own right as well as the significant role it can play in \nthe larger issues of comprehensive health care reform and revitalizing \nour economy. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3732\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nto hold at least 1 public hearing before issuance of a permit affecting \npublic or private land use in a locality; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak on \nlegislation I am introducing that will require the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission to hold at least one public hearing before \nissuance of a permit affecting public or private land use in a \nlocality.\n  Increasing demand for electricity throughout the Northeast is putting \na strain on energy infrastructure in my state, necessitating new \ntransmission lines and natural gas pipelines and the expansion of \nexisting ones. In Southwestern and Northeast Pennsylvania transmission \nline expansions are planned over hundreds of miles of private property, \nwhile in the Southeast natural gas pipeline expansions are underway.\n  There is no doubt these projects can be invasive, and rarely do they \nfail to be controversial. I make a point of touching all of \nPennsylvania's 67 counties each year. In traveling Pennsylvania this \nfall I heard a lot of complaints from constituents who oppose these \ninfrastructure projects, and who felt their concerns were being ignored \nby the energy companies and by FERC.\n  I realize there will always be some opposition to large \ninfrastructure projects. What is unacceptable, however, is for the \nvoices of Pennsylvanians to be ignored. It may be the case that these \nprojects are necessary to meet increased energy demand. Nonetheless, \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must seriously consider and \nevaluate local concerns in a sensitive manner.\n  To ensure citizens throughout the commonwealth have a voice in the \ndevelopment of energy infrastructure, my legislation will mandate that \nFERC hold an open hearing in the affected communities. State Public \nUtility Commissions, who have a great say in these matters, are beyond \nCongress' reach. But where the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is \ninvolved we can take steps to ensure that our constituents' concerns \nreceive due consideration. Holding a hearing may not lead to all sides \nagreeing on the proper route forward, but at the very least my \nPennsylvania constituents will come away with the satisfaction of \nhaving publicly aired their grievances.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 3735. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the eligibility of computer technology and equipment development \nbusinesses for enterprise zone incentives; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on \nbehalf of a program which I believe has been extremely helpful in \nhelping\n\n[[Page S10950]]\n\nrural/urban communities in my state of Louisiana. I would also like to \ndiscuss a commonsense improvement to the program which I believe will \nallow these and other communities nationwide to be at the cutting edge \nof 21st century innovation and research. In particular, to help spur \neconomic development in distressed communities, the Congress enacted \nthe Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community, EZ and EC, Program in \n1993. In 2000, the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act further expanded \nthis initiative by authorizing 40 Renewal Communities, RCs, and 9 more \nEZs. Overall, the RC/EZ/EC Initiative provides these designated \ncommunities with tax incentives, grants, loans, and technical \nassistance to encourage investment in communities that have experienced \nsevere economic decline. According to the U.S. Department of Housing \nand Urban Development, HUD, which oversees the RC and EZ program, RC \ntax incentives are worth approximately $5.6 billion to eligible \nbusinesses of all sizes in Renewal Communities. EZ tax incentives are \nworth approximately $5.3 billion to small and large businesses in \nEmpowerment Zones. In general, the tax incentives encourage businesses \nto open, expand, and to hire local residents. The administrative \nleaders of each Renewal Community and Empowerment Zone work closely \nwith the Federal Government, business, and local community \nrepresentatives to implement strategic plans to improve social/economic \nconditions throughout the designated areas.\n  As I mentioned, this program is of particular interest to Louisiana \nas we have two Urban Renewal Communities, in New Orleans and Ouachita \nParish, and also have two Rural Renewal Communities, in central \nLouisiana and in northern Louisiana. These designations have been \nextremely helpful in attracting businesses to these areas of my state \nand in encouraging existing businesses to expand their operations. \nHowever, the designations are set to terminate in December 31, 2009. I \nremain committed to work with my Senate colleagues next year to update \nand reauthorize such programs as this program. That is because this \nprogram helps distressed communities nationwide and is a key engine to \nspur public-private partnerships in rural/urban areas.\n  While we often think of technology companies locating in areas such \nas Silicon Valley, California or the Research Triangle in North \nCarolina, Congress should not forget the role that rural small \nbusinesses and universities play in fostering innovation and \ndevelopment. In Louisiana, we have multiple universities participating \nin these cutting edge research programs and collaborating with local \nsmall businesses. Louisiana Technical University in Ruston, Louisiana, \nfor example has grown into a leader in scientific research at a crucial \ntime for the region. This is because the Barksdale Air Force base \nlocated in Shreveport, which is 70 miles from Ruston, is looking to \nsecure the permanent Cyber Command. This command would protect the \nUnited States from cyber warfare. All of the universities, colleges, \nand parishes in this area, including the University of Louisiana--\nMonroe, Grambling State University, and Louisiana State University--\nShreveport are collaborating on securing this command, which could mean \nthousands of jobs for the region. So big cities are not the only areas \nin the country that have growing technology sectors--rural communities \nalso have these industries and would benefit from this commonsense \ncorrection to the program. Many of these rural communities are located \nin RC areas so it is important to support this program.\n\n  In the next Congress, as I mentioned, we will work to reauthorize the \nRC/EZ program. As we do this, I believe that, among other corrections, \nwe must address one glaring problem with these programs. That is the \nreason why I am filing this legislation today as it makes an important \ncorrection to this program. I am pleased that my colleague, Congressman \nRodney Alexander is introducing the companion bill in the House of \nRepresentatives. All three programs share the definition for a \n``qualified business'' used for an EZ Business, which is Section 1397C \nof the Internal Revenue Code. For the EC and RC programs, this was \nlegislated by Congress by the use of a substitution of ``Renewal \nCommunity'' or ``Enterprise Community'' for ``Empowerment Zone'' in the \nrelevant section of the Internal Revenue Code, which is Section \n1394(b)(2)(A) for the EC program and Section 1400G for the RC program. \nUnder this definition, generally any trade or business can be a \nqualified business; however, there is an exception for a business that \nconsists primarily to develop or hold intangibles for sale or license. \nThis clear distinction between businesses that trade ``tangibles'' \nversus those that trade in ``intangibles'' seems to be made as the \nintent was to encourage quality, high-wage manufacturing jobs in these \nareas. Businesses that trade in ``intangibles'' include companies that \ndevelop such things as patents, formulas, processes, copyrights, \nliterary/musical works. However, businesses which manufacture computer \nsoftware and computer or peripheral equipment are also included in this \ngroup of category of businesses which trade in ``intangible'' products. \nI feel that this excludes an industry that provides high-wage, highly \nskilled jobs in communities which could most benefit from these types \nof employers. This apparent oversight from Congress seems to discourage \nsoftware/technology companies from locating in these distressed \ncommunities and does not reflect the fact that many of our rural/urban \nhave excellent infrastructure to support them. Lastly, as an original \ncosponsor of the America COMPETES Act of 2007, I know how essential it \nis to promote U.S. technology competitiveness and innovation. By \nallowing software/technology companies to locate or expand operations \nin RC/EZ/EC communities, this would promote U.S. competitiveness and \nfully realize the intent of the program--to spur economic development \nin these distressed areas.\n  To address this issue, the bill I am introducing today would clarify \nthat companies which manufacture technology/software development are \neligible for these RC/EZ incentives in taxable years after enactment of \nthe bill, provided they meet other requirements for the RC/EZ program. \nIn particular, Section 1397C(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nis amended to specify that businesses that trade in ``intangibles'' are \nexcluded, with the exception of computer and software development \ncompanies. I would highlight that we are not creating a new definition \nfrom scratch or making new rules for the Internal Revenue Code, instead \nthe bill uses the definition for computer and software companies that \nalready exists elsewhere in the Internal Revenue Code. This definition, \nSection 170(e)(6)(F)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code, includes the \nfollowing industries: computer software (as defined in section \n197(e)(3)(B)), computer or peripheral equipment (as defined by section \n168(i)(2)(B)), and fiber optic cable related to computer use.\n  Furthermore, my staff has reviewed the Congressional Record and \ncommittee testimony since 1985 and could not find a clear Congressional \nintent to exclude software  or technology development companies from \nthe definition of a ``qualified business'' for this program. On the \nother hand, Congress specifically prohibited the following businesses: \nprivate or commercial golf courses, country clubs, massage parlors, hot \ntub facilities, suntan facilities, racetracks or other facilities used \nfor gambling, and liquor stores. Despite this specificity in relation \nto what industries may/may not qualify, the law is silent on software/\ntechnology development companies. As I mentioned, this industry is \nsimply caught up in an effort to not include companies that deal \nstrictly in intellectual property, such as copyrights or patents. I \nbelieve that this warrants correction as we should not exclude \nindustries that are key drivers of economic development and those which \nare also essential to U.S. competitiveness.\n\n  Let me give you another example of how the current setup of this \nprogram is really discouraging further job creation and economic \ndevelopment. As currently structured, the renewal community employment \ncredit provides a 15 percent credit for the first $10,000 of wages per \nyear paid to each renewal community employee. So a bar in a RC/EZ \ncommunity would receive a tax credit for hiring another bartender but a \nsoftware development company would currently not receive any incentive \nto hire another engineer. Not only\n\n[[Page S10951]]\n\ndoes this discourage technology companies from locating in these areas \nbut it is a disincentive for students graduating from universities or \ncolleges in RC/EZ areas. I do not have a specific problem with \nincluding bars or restaurants in this program as the hospitality sector \nis also important to Louisiana's economy. However, I believe that \ncomputer/software companies should be given the opportunity to take \nadvantage of these benefits that are already available to other \nindustries, provided they meet the other requirements for qualified \nbusinesses.\n  In closing, I would like to note that while I understand that this \nwould allow businesses currently not eligible for the program to \nreceive benefits moving forward, it is my sincere belief that this \ncorrection would follow congressional intent with the program. This is \nbecause, in my view, the bill would further improve the ability of the \nRC/EZ program to spur economic development in distressed areas. It \nwould accomplish this goal by ensuring that high-wage, high technology \nindustries are eligible to participate in the program. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this commonsense legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3735\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 664\n\n       Whereas, on February 28, 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt \n     signed into law the act entitled ``An Act to provide a union \n     railroad station in the District of Columbia, and for other \n     purposes'', and Daniel Burnham, a noted architect from \n     Chicago, Illinois, was chosen to design the building;\n       Whereas, on October 27, 1907, Union Station officially \n     opened at 6:50 a.m. when the Baltimore and Ohio Pittsburgh \n     Express pulled in to the station;\n       Whereas the building was ultimately completed in 1908;\n       Whereas, in 1924, 5,000 cheering fans met the victorious \n     Washington Nationals at Union Station after they defeated the \n     Boston Red Sox to capture the American League pennant;\n       Whereas, in 1951, President Harry Truman dedicated the \n     Presidential Suite at Union Station as a ``home away from \n     home'' for members of the Armed Services;\n       Whereas, in 1968, in preparation for the bicentennial of \n     the United States, the decision was made to transform the \n     building into a National Visitor Center;\n       Whereas Congress then passed the Union Station \n     Redevelopment Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-125; 95 Stat. 1667) \n     to return Union Station to its original use as a \n     transportation center;\n       Whereas, in 1983, the Union Station Redevelopment \n     Corporation was created to oversee the development of the \n     station into an operating railroad station, to restore the \n     architectural and historical elements of the structure, to \n     explore collaboration with the private sector in the \n     commercial development of the station, and to withdraw the \n     Federal Government from active management of the station;\n       Whereas the renovation and restoration of Union Station \n     began on August 13, 1986, with the ringing of an old train \n     bell;\n       Whereas the restoration of Union Station was the largest \n     public-private restoration project accomplished in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the restoration took 2 years and the grand \n     reopening was held on September 29, 1988;\n       Whereas, in 2008, Union Station includes more than 210,000 \n     square feet of retail space, including 50,000 square feet of \n     restaurant space;\n       Whereas Union Station is the corporate headquarters for \n     Amtrak and contains 200,000 square feet of Amtrak passenger \n     and baggage facilities;\n       Whereas 32,000,000 people visit Union Station annually; and\n       Whereas Union Station is the most visited tourist \n     destination in Washington, District of Columbia: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the centennial of Union Station in \n     Washington, District of Columbia;\n       (2) applauds the efforts of the people who worked to \n     preserve this national treasure; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to continue \n     to visit and learn about Union Station and its storied \n     history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10957-4", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10957-S10958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NATIONAL TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION WEEK\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        NATIONAL MENTORING MONTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. 710\n\n       Whereas 1 in 11 adolescents reports being a victim of \n     physical dating violence;\n       Whereas dating violence occurs more frequently among black \n     students (13.9 percent) than among Hispanic (9.3 percent) or \n     white (7 percent) students;\n       Whereas 1 in 5 teenagers in a serious relationship reports \n     having been hit, slapped, or pushed by a partner;\n       Whereas more than 1 in 4 teenagers have been in a \n     relationship where a partner is verbally abusive;\n       Whereas 30 percent of teenagers in a dating relationship \n     have been text messaged 10, 20, or 30 times per hour by a \n     partner attempting to find out where they are, what they are \n     doing, or who they are with;\n       Whereas 40 percent of the youngest ``tweens'', those \n     between the ages of 11 and 12, report that their friends are \n     victims of verbal abuse in dating relationships;\n       Whereas nearly 3 in 4 tweens say that dating relationships \n     usually begin at age 14 or younger;\n       Whereas 29 percent of girls who have been in a relationship \n     said that they have been pressured to have sex or to engage \n     in sexual activities that they did not want;\n       Whereas 69 percent of all teenagers who had sex by age 14 \n     said they have experienced 1 or more types of abuse in a \n     dating relationship;\n       Whereas 1 in 5 teenagers (20 percent) between the ages of \n     13 and 14 say their friends are victims of dating violence;\n       Whereas in 2003, in a national survey of over 14,000 high \n     school students conducted by the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention, just over 8 percent of boys and girls \n     reported physical dating violence victimization and were more \n     likely to engage in risky behaviors including sexual \n     intercourse, attempted suicide, episodic heavy drinking, and \n     physical fighting;\n       Whereas Native American women experience higher rates of \n     interpersonal violence than any other population group;\n       Whereas violent relationships in adolescence can have \n     serious ramifications for victims, putting them at higher \n     risk for substance abuse, eating disorders, risky sexual \n     behavior, suicide, and adult revictimization;\n       Whereas the severity of violence among intimate partners \n     has been shown to be greater in cases where the pattern of \n     violence has been established in adolescence;\n       Whereas more than 3 times as many tweens (20 percent) as \n     parents of tweens (6 percent) admit that parents know little \n     or nothing about the tweens' dating relationships;\n       Whereas a majority of parents surveyed either believe \n     dating violence is not an issue or admit they do not know if \n     it is an issue; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Teen Dating Violence \n     Awareness and Prevention Week will benefit schools, \n     communities, and families regardless of socio-economic \n     status, race, or sex: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of February 2 through February 6, \n     2009, as ``National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and \n     Prevention Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States, high \n     schools, law enforcement, State and local officials, and \n     interested groups to observe National Teen Dating Violence \n     Awareness and Prevention Week with appropriate programs and \n     activities that promote awareness and prevention of the crime \n     of teen dating violence in their communities.\n\n                              S. Res. 728\n\n       Whereas mentoring is a longstanding tradition in which a \n     dependable, caring adult provides guidance, support, and \n     encouragement to facilitate a young person's social, \n     emotional, and cognitive development;\n       Whereas continued research on mentoring shows that formal, \n     high-quality mentoring focused on developing the competence \n     and character of the mentee promotes positive outcomes, such \n     as improved academic achievement, self-esteem, social skills, \n     and career development;\n       Whereas further research on mentoring provides strong \n     evidence that mentoring successfully reduces substance use \n     and abuse, academic failure, and delinquency;\n       Whereas mentoring, in addition to preparing young people \n     for school, work, and life, is extremely rewarding for those \n     serving as mentors;\n       Whereas more than 4,200 mentoring programs in communities \n     of all sizes across the United States focus on building \n     strong, effective relationships between mentors and mentees;\n       Whereas approximately 3,000,000 young people in the United \n     States are in solid mentoring relationships due to the \n     remarkable vigor, creativity, and resourcefulness of the \n     thousands of mentoring programs in communities throughout the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas, in spite of the progress made to increase \n     mentoring, the Nation has a serious ``mentoring gap'', with \n     nearly 15,000,000 young people in need of mentors;\n       Whereas mentoring partnerships between the public and \n     private sectors bring State and local leaders together to \n     support mentoring programs by preventing duplication of \n     efforts, offering training in industry best practices, and \n     making the most of limited resources to benefit young people \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the designation of January 2009 as National \n     Mentoring Month will help call attention to the critical role \n     mentors play in helping young people realize their potential;\n       Whereas a month-long celebration of mentoring will \n     encourage more individuals and organizations, including \n     schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith \n     institutions, and foundations, to become engaged in mentoring \n     across the United States; and\n       Whereas National Mentoring Month will, most significantly, \n     build awareness of mentoring and encourage more people to \n     become mentors and help close the mentoring gap in the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of January 2009 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'';\n       (2) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the \n     millions of caring adults and students who are already \n     volunteering as mentors and encourages more adults and \n     students to volunteer as mentors; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     National Mentoring Month with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities that promote awareness of, and volunteer \n     involvement with, youth mentoring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/11/senate-section/article/S10958-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
