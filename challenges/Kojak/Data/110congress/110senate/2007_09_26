Mr. President, there is disheartening news coming out \nof Burma this morning. Last night, following yet another day of massive \npeaceful protests demanding political reform in Burma, the repressive \nBurmese regime imposed a nighttime curfew and banned all public \ngatherings of more than five people. Despite this brazen effort to \nmuzzle freedom of expression, reports indicate that thousands of \nBuddhist monks and other protestors courageously defied the prohibition \non public assembly and marched again in Rangoon. In response, reports \nindicate that the security forces of the State Peace and Development \nCouncil responded with typical brutality, beating and arresting scores \nof these brave protestors. It was reported that one person was shot to \ndeath and five received gunshot injuries.\n  Back in 1988, the regime responded to similar peaceful protests by \nmassacring thousands of its own citizens. But the Burmese regime should \nknow that things have changed in the intervening years. Modern \ntechnology has permitted photographs of those heroic protesters to be \ntransmitted via the Internet around the entire world. Whereas before \nthe news could be easily muzzled by the junta, today that is no longer \nthe case. The world is watching, and any brutal steps taken in Rangoon \nare instantly made known in places such as New York, New Delhi, and \nBeijing. These moving images of heroism have certainly reached us here \nin Washington, DC.\n  As I have said before to the regime in Burma, we are watching you. To \nthe people of Burma, we stand with you.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, would the Republican leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  I want to ask a question based on the Senator's statement. First, I \ncommend the Republican leader for his statement on the situation in \nBurma. It is my understanding now that we anticipate this military \njunta is likely to engage in repressive tactics against the Buddhist \nmonks and the people of this country. I thank the leader for his \nstatements because I think they validate our mutual concern that first \nan\n\n[[Page S12078]]\n\nelection, which came up with a good result, finally be implemented so \nthe people of Burma have a representative government and that those \npolitical dissidents--most notably, Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi--be \nreleased from house arrest. She has suffered enough.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing this up to the floor. I want him to \nknow his sentiments are felt on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may just add, my friend from \nIllinois is absolutely correct. This is a regime which I have been \nfollowing for a long time, having introduced the first Burma sanctions \nbill some 4 to 5 years ago.\n  He is absolutely right. They engaged in this kind of activity back in \n1988, killed a significant number of Burmese citizens simply seeking to \nhave an opportunity to express themselves, which they subsequently did \nin the 1990 election, which Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League \nfor Democracy won overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly, after which she was \nplaced under house arrest and has been there virtually the entire time \nsince then, since 1990. She was under house arrest while her husband \npassed away in London.\n\n  This is a pariah regime. Had they had nuclear weapons, I think the \nrest of the world would have been a lot more interested in this regime, \nas we have been, for example, in North Korea and in Iran. But they are \nnow revealing their true colors once again. Technology is much better \ntoday than it was back in 1988. They will not be able to engage in \nthese kinds of abuses with no one noticing.\n  I commend my friend from Illinois for making clear that all of us \nhere in the Senate, regardless of party affiliation, condemn this \nbehavior and look forward to the day when the election of 1990 is \nfinally honored.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12078-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, against all odds, the long-suffering people \nof Burma have risen against one of the world's most repressive regimes. \nWhat began a month ago as modest, impromptu protests has now mushroomed \ninto a nationwide peaceful democratic groundswell. Tens of thousands of \nstudents have joined Buddhist monks in the streets, marching and \nchanting in unison against Burma's brutal military rulers. I met with \nsome of those rulers a number of years ago when I went to Burma. I also \nhad a chance to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi in her home where she has \nbeen under house arrest.\n  It is an extraordinary division that is growing and growing in Burma, \nwhere the military junta, unbelievably unpopular, nevertheless clings \nto power through the force of the military which it controls. The \nriches of the country are exclusively being diverted to their spoils, \nwhile Burma remains now and increasingly becomes poorer and poorer.\n  The Burmese people need to know that the courage they are \ndemonstrating today and what they are fighting for is being watched by \npeople all over the world, that we admire what they are attempting to \nachieve, and that we stand in awe of their commitment, of their \ncourage. Their actions follow in the venerable footsteps of Mahatma \nGandhi, Nelson Mandela, Lech Walesa, and all of those heroes who \nunderstand that nonviolent resistance is humanity's greatest weapon \nagainst tyranny and injustice. We, with all of the tools available to \nus, need to make certain the people of Burma understand that their \ncourage is breaking through and that this moment is one we share with \nthem.\n  What is happening today in the streets of Rangoon is, however, as \ntenuous as it is unexpected. Just this morning, we learned that warning \nshots were fired and tensions are escalating. I do not know how many \npeople realize it, but the Government of Burma, the junta, moved to its \nown sort of private capital and has created this almost surreal exiled \ngovernment where they feel safe, as if living in a bunker within the \nisolation of Burma itself. Just this morning, we also learned that the \ncabal of generals that is pillaging Burma under the guise of governing \nit could easily meet these nonviolent protests with a bloodbath, just \nas they did in 1988. So it is important that none of us allow the \nscrutiny on Burma to be diminished. This could conceivably become \nanother Tiananmen Square moment, if it does.\n  No one should doubt the Burmese junta's potential for brutality and \nlarge-scale violence. Since taking power, they have killed tens of \nthousands of Burmese, and they have razed more villages than have been \ndestroyed in Darfur. Over half a million people have been internally \ndisplaced, and an additional 1 million refugees have fled the country. \nThe tyrannical thugs who run the country are engaged in the systematic \nuse of forced labor, human trafficking, forcible recruitment of child \nsoldiers, torture and rape--an appalling laundry list of human rights \nviolations. Yet, despite such grave danger, the people of Burma have \nstood strong in the face of this extraordinary evil. They demand \nDemocratic reforms and basic human rights, and they have done so with \ndignity, and they have done so peacefully.\n  The United States and the rest of the free world must find more ways \nto make it clear that we stand with the people of Burma. The \nPresident's decision yesterday to target the top general for financial \nsanctions is a step in the right direction, but it will not solve the \nproblem, and it is not enough.\n  The massive prodemocracy demonstrations in Burma represent the best \nopportunity for genuine political change in nearly years. Burma's \nSaffron Revolution is also an excellent chance for America to finally \nshow greater diplomatic leadership on the world stage.\n  The United States needs to lead the international community in \npressuring the military junta to release all political prisoners, \nstarting with the venerable Nobel Prize laureate and opposition leader, \nAung San Suu Kyi, and take steps down the path from there to more \nthorough political change.\n  This week's gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General \nAssembly is ready made. It is a forum waiting to be utilized properly. \nMy hope is that the United Nations will take the necessary steps to \nmake even more clear the world's condemnation but, more importantly, to \ncreate real pressure, and that includes pressure from places such as \nChina, which has been playing a clearly duplicitous game because of \ntheir deep investments, their proximity, and other occasional \nsimilarities in the way in which they have dealt with democracy \nuprisings. From the halls of the United Nations to the headquarters of \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the message to the Burmese \nmilitary needs to be clear: The world is united behind the people \nmarching in your streets. Do not meet peaceful protest with still more \nbutchering. We are prepared, all of us--and we must make this clear--to \nact in concert against you unless you immediately embark on serious \nnegotiations toward sharing power with the people of Burma.\n  Showing diplomatic leadership on Burma also requires that we demand \nbetter from those countries that have propped up this brutal regime and \nare thus the best equipped to help pressure it. India and, in \nparticular, China can make a significant difference in this outcome. \nThe President and the United Nations must engage in strenuous diplomacy \nwith Beijing, which carries the most sway with Burma's generals, and \nurge the Chinese to press for reform. China has in its grasp a \nmomentous opportunity to demonstrate leadership commensurate with its \ngrowing power and status. Beijing can host the 2008 Olympics as an \nenabler of cruelty and repression or it can do so as a responsible \nstakeholder in the world community. The Olympics will not\n\n[[Page S12079]]\n\nmasquerade or cover up for its absence from this challenge. This is an \nimportant test. The world is watching.\n  As the international community exerts greater pressure on the \nmilitary junta, it must also reach out more aggressively with \nhumanitarian assistance for the Burmese people. The people of Burma \nhave suffered not only the bullets and bayonets of the current regime \nbut also from decades of misrule that have transformed their resource-\nrich nation into one of the poorest in Asia. All you have to do is go \nto YouTube, and you can watch footage of the wedding of the general's \ndaughter, one of the junta general's daughters, laden in diamonds the \nsize of pebbles, an example of the excesses of their coercion of power \nwhile the country gets poorer and poorer and people suffer as a \nconsequence.\n  Many of Burma's 52 million people live in abject misery. About one-\nthird are mired in poverty. Nearly half of all the children never get \nto go to school. Malaria and tuberculosis are widespread. Mortality \nrates in Burma are among the highest in Asia. At least 37,000 died of \nHIV/AIDS in 2005 and over 600,000 are infected with HIV. Burma's \nsuffering destabilizes southeast Asia--heroin and methamphetamines, \nHIV/AIDs, and other infectious diseases, as well as hordes of refugees \nspilling across Burma's borders into neighboring countries. The \ninternational community must respond to this ongoing tragedy by \nproviding humanitarian aid to a desperate and deserving people.\n  Current levels of international assistance are simply woefully \ninsufficient. We need a network of public and private donors to fund \nhealth, education, and infrastructure projects. The resilient and brave \nBurmese people have shown that they are more than worthy of our support \nand compassion. They are fighting for democracy. We need to join that \nfight.\n  I close by offering a final word of warning. We dare not forget \nBurma's last great democratic uprising. It occurred in 1988. It was \nbrutally crushed by the military at the cost of over 3,000 innocent \nlives. That day and the repression that followed show the horrible \nhuman toll of our collective failure to act. A peaceful prodemocratic \noutcome in Burma is actually within reach, if the international \ncommunity were to seize this moment. The United Nations, ASEAN, India, \nand especially China must stand with the United States in solidarity \nwith the Burmese people. All of us must not fail the people of Burma \nagain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12079-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12079-S12080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CHIP REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I applaud my colleagues who have come to \nthe floor this morning to speak out about the injustices in Burma and \nto remind us to not lose sight of the discourse and the injustices that \noccur across the globe, that we must keep a vigilant focus on those and \nspeak out against them. I also think it is important to lead by example \nin our country. That is why I come to the floor today in such strong \nsupport of the Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization, the \nCHIP Reauthorization Act of 2007, and urge my colleagues to support the \nincredible bipartisan compromise we have all come together to \nnegotiate, to set the example of what our values are so that other \ncountries might see that working together, the values we share and the \nmoral obligation we have to our children can be met as we take these \ntypes of steps. That kind of leadership by example is critical not just \nin our country but to the example we set for the rest of the world.\n  I have to say, as a working mother, I know all too well the \nimportance of reliable health insurance coverage for all children. I \nfeel blessed that as a Federal employee, I have access to quality \ncoverage. When I am up late at night with a sick child, as I was last \nweek, I have been blessed as a Federal employee to have that access and \nto be able to know that when the Sun comes up, I can call my doctor. I \ncan get my child the kind of medical care I believe he needs. Having \nhealth insurance coverage gives me peace of mind. But that peace of \nmind should not only belong to those families that can afford private \nhealth insurance, it should also belong to the working families that \nare struggling to make ends meet. That is why Democrats and \nRepublicans worked so hard together to come up with a compromise on a \nbill this important. I commend my colleagues in this body and in the \nHouse of Representatives from both sides, both parties, who have worked \ndiligently to come to this agreement.\n\n  Since the inception of SCHIP 10 years ago or, as we call it in \nArkansas, ARKids First, because it is a Federal and State partnership \nto provide this health insurance for our children, the number of \nchildren without health care coverage has been reduced by one-third. \nDuring that time, I am proud that Arkansas has become a national leader \nin reducing its number of uninsured children from over 20 percent in \n1997 to 10 percent today. Now nearly 65,000 of Arkansas's children \ncurrently receive coverage through the ARKids B part of ARKids First.\n  The bill before us is an important and responsible step forward in \nreaching the millions of children who remain uninsured. It applies the \nlesson of the past 10 years and builds upon the success of the program \nby giving States more of the tools they need while preserving their \nflexibility to strengthen their programs and ultimately cover more \nchildren. In doing so, it would provide an additional $35 billion over \n5 years that will allow our States to preserve coverage for children \ncurrently enrolled while reaching an additional 3.8 million uninsured, \nlow-income children. This proposal would also provide much needed \nfunding to States for outreach and enrollment efforts to reach many of \nthose currently uninsured but eligible, making sure we are reaching \nout. For those who are eligible, as we get them on the rolls, it makes \na tremendous difference. Because as we begin to bring into the fold \nthose who can be insured, those who are eligible, we begin to mitigate \nthe risk and the balance of the entire cost of what we need to do in \ncovering children. In addition, it takes steps to ensure that they get \na healthy start by providing care for expectant mothers and \nestablishing pediatric quality measures to improve the effectiveness, \nsafety, and efficiency of the care they receive. For years we have been \nputting quality measures into Medicare and other programs. Now we are \ngoing to put those same quality measures into pediatric care and \nchildren's care so we cannot only be reassured that our children are \ngetting the best of care, but we are going to also see the benefits \neconomically of those quality measures.\n  Our plan would also invest in the development of evidence-based \nquality measures for children's health care and provide access to much \nneeded dental care for lower income children. I am sure many of my \ncolleagues have done as I have, visited Head Start facilities or other \nplaces where children are learning dental hygiene. It is absolutely \nessential, because when you visit the places where they are not getting \ndental care and dental hygiene, you see children who have rotting \nteeth, who can't pay attention in school, who are malnourished because \nit hurts to eat when they get the opportunity. Dental care is essential \nbecause those children who do get it are going to be paying attention \nin class. They will be getting better at their education, and they will \nbe healthier individuals because they will be receiving nutrition. They \nare going to be on a pathway to a healthier lifestyle.\n  We ensure that children enrolled in this CHIP would also be able to \naccess mental health care that is on par with the level of medical and \nsurgical care they are currently provided. Earlier this month I hosted \nforums across the State of Arkansas to discuss renewal of this vital \nprogram. We had a wonderful opportunity to meet with health care \nprofessionals, parents, single working mothers, business individuals \nwho see the productivity of their employees better when they know those \nparents have that peace of mind when their children are getting health \ncare, others who emphasize just how crucial this program is to \nArkansas. They are anxious for us to get this program reauthorized. We \nhave the opportunity, and we must seize it. They know the clock is \nticking. If we don't act in some form or fashion by September 30, we \ncould endanger the coverage of 6.6 million children currently receiving \ncare.\n  Further, those I spoke to wanted to see tolerance. They wanted to see \nus\n\n[[Page S12080]]\n\nworking together. They had little tolerance, quite frankly, for the \npolitical posturing by our President, making this a political issue. \nThey are frustrated that he doesn't seem willing to budge in terms of \ncost when what we spend in Iraq in only 41 days would provide health \ncare coverage for 10 million children each year. And they, like me, \nbelieve that providing health care to our children is not only an \ninvestment in our Nation's most precious of resources, but it is a \nmoral issue and, quite simply, the right thing to do.\n  In Washington we sometimes get in the business of debating policy \nspecifics and losing sight of what it is all about. During my recent \ntrip to Arkansas, I was reminded of what this will mean for real \npeople. It is about a wonderful, hard-working, home-based educator from \nBenton, Jennifer Brown, and her 6-year-old daughter Elizabeth. Because \nElizabeth had a digestive problem that required treatment, her mother \nwould have been forced into the position of choosing between care for \nher sick child or choosing to feed her family if CHIP were not \navailable. Placing families in that position is completely \nunacceptable. They deserve so much more. I am proud that CHIP was there \nfor Jennifer and Elizabeth. As Jennifer told me:\n\n       Without ARKids First, I don't know how we could have made \n     it.\n\n  It is also about a young working mother and a grandmother, Amy Main \nand Jackie Deuerling, who spoke to me about their daughter and their \ngranddaughter Emily, a 4-month-old blessing I was able to hold in my \narms. What a treasured blessing to that family and to this country. \nWithout ARKids First, Emily's family would be unable to provide her \nwith the care she desperately needed. As Amy told me:\n\n       The health care coverage provided by ARKids First allows me \n     to feed the kids, afford diapers, and pay for Emily's \n     brother's school supplies. I can make sure the kids have \n     everything they need. If I was paying the medical bills [and \n     if it was me and me alone], we wouldn't be able to afford all \n     of those necessities [or the proper medical treatment].\n\n  We cannot lose sight of that. We should all agree that providing \nhealth care for our children is certainly one area where partisan \npolitics should be placed aside. These working mothers who were there, \nthe working families who were represented in these town hall meetings \nwere saying what an important thing it was to them, as a value, to be \nable to make sure their children were able to get the health care they \nneeded. But they also felt it was a value of who we are as Arkansans \nand as Americans.\n  I am very proud the Senate has seen the case we have presented. The \nmembers of the Senate Finance Committee, of which I am a member, worked \nhard in a bipartisan spirit to find a common ground to improve this \nprogram. Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley, Senators \nRockefeller and Hatch, took the challenge. All of us, working together, \nand others, helped in multiple meetings to produce a bill of which \neveryone can be proud. Their leadership and vision should be commended \nby this entire body.\n  That is why it is so unfortunate the President and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services feel so differently. In fact, their proposal \nto increase CHIP funding by only $5 billion over the next 5 years falls \nwell short of the funding needed to simply maintain coverage for those \ncurrently enrolled in the program. That is not right.\n  In fact, the message sent to me during my meetings in Arkansas was \nthat moving backwards--moving backwards--when it concerns the health \ncare of our children is absolutely unacceptable. Instead of forcing \nnearly 1.5 million children to be dropped from their current health \ncare providers, shouldn't we all agree, at the very least, absolutely, \nno child should lose coverage as a result of reauthorization?\n  The President has been adamant about leaving no child behind when it \ncomes to their education. But shouldn't that also apply to their health \ncare? How you choose to spend your money for your families or for your \ngovernment most definitely reflects your values and your priorities. I \nask my colleagues today, what could be a bigger priority than the well-\nbeing of our children--all of our children, the Nation's children, our \nAmerican family?\n  In a time when more and more Americans are struggling to find \naffordable health care, CHIP has been a success story that has allowed \nus to make coverage more accessible for millions of children in working \nfamilies. I urge each and every one of my colleagues to explore your \nconscience, to set aside partisan influences, and to support this \ncritical effort to invest in the health care of our children--not only \nfor the future of our Nation but for the well-being of millions of \nchildren and working families. They are depending on us, and it is time \nto fulfill our commitment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to \nexpand health care coverage for the children of our American family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. KLOBUCHAR).

Madam President, we are today going to vote on what is \neuphemistically known as the SCHIP bill. It is clearly incorrectly \nidentified because under that reading one would think it was for \nchildren, but it is actually a bill that also covers adults. I think \nthere is a general consensus and no disagreement about the fact that \nchildren who are at or near poverty--even considerably above poverty--\nfamilies who have that type of fiscal constraint should be covered. \nThere is agreement on that.\n  The issue is whether we should take a program which covers children \nin poverty, or near poverty, up to 200 percent of the poverty level--\nwhich, if we define poverty, it is twice as much as what poverty is--\nwhether we should cover children who are in families who have incomes \nwell above 200 percent of the poverty level and adults who have no \nchildren at all, and whether we should do that extra coverage through a \nnationalized system.\n  That is what is at issue. The issue is not whether children who come \nfrom families who are not that well off--not necessarily poor families \nbut are not well off--those children are covered under the President's \nproposal, under proposals which I would support, children from families \nwith incomes up to 200 percent of poverty.\n  The issue is whether we should have States, for example, such as New \nJersey, where families who make $71,000 a year--$71,000 a year--should \nbe able to be covered under a federally, totally subsidized, taxpayer-\npaid-for health care plan, and whether families that are not even \nfamilies--because they are two adults with no kids--should also be able \nto be covered under that federally subsidized health care plan, where \nthe taxpayers pick up all the costs, and whether those plans should be \nstructured in a way that they are single-payer, Government-directed, \nnationalized health care plans.\n  What is the practical implication of taking a program, which is \nsupposed to be directed at children who come from low-income families, \nand expanding it radically in the way that the bill we are going to get \ndoes?\n  Well, the first practical implication is it spends a heck of a lot of \nmoney: $71 billion over 10 years in additional spending--$71 billion--\nto cover children in families with up to $71,000 in income. In fact, \nthey go up to 400 percent of the poverty level, with families who make \nup to $80,000 a year, and they cover adults who do not have children. \nYet they claim it is a children-in-need health care program.\n  So you are going to increase the Federal Government and the size of \nthe Federal Government and the spending of the Federal Government--\nwhich, remember, comes from taxpayers--by $71 billion under this \nproposal.\n  The President has proposed increasing spending in this area over the \nbaseline--which is about $25 billion--by an additional $5 billion over \n5 years. Some of us have proposed we even go a little higher so we make \nsure every child in that category of 200 percent of poverty can be \ncovered.\n\n  But to expand this program to a $71 billion increase is a huge \nexplosion in the Federal program, in the size of the program, and in \nthe cost to the taxpayers. Remember this: Another effect\n\n[[Page S12081]]\n\nof this policy of covering families who make up to $80,000 a year with \nthis federally taxpayer-paid health care insurance is that families \nthat presently have their children insured by the private sector are \ngoing to move their insurance from the private sector, which is paying \nfor the cost--the business they work for--over to the public sector.\n  In fact, it is estimated, under the proposal before us, 4.4 million \nchildren will be covered who are not covered today by this new SCHIP \nprogram which covers families up to $80,000 and spends an extra $71 \nbillion. However, what people do not tell you--at least folks from the \nother side do not tell you--is 2.4 million of those children who are \ngoing to be picked up by this plan are already covered--they are \nalready covered--by private insurers.\n  So we are basically shifting the burden from the private insurance \nover to the public side, which means the taxpayers--average working \nAmericans--are going to have to pay more to cover kids who are already \ncovered by the private sector through their taxes.\n  Does that make sense? Of course it does not make sense. Why would you \ndo something like that? Why would you set up a program like that? Why \nwould you expand a program to families that make $80,000; to adults who \ndo not have children; to children who already are insured and draw them \nout of the private insurance into the public insurance? Why would you \ndo something like that?\n  Well, the answer is pretty obvious. This is part of the effort of the \nother side of the aisle to move us toward a single-payer, nationalized \nsystem of health care. There is no hiding that fact. That has been \nstated as the purpose, even by the chairman of the Finance Committee. \nSo the goal is not necessarily to bring more kids under insurance who \nneed to be insured because they come from families of less means. That \nis going to be done under either program. The goal is to radically \nexpand the size of a public insurance program to families that are \nreally doing quite well, families making up to $80,000 that may not \nhave children or the children may already be insured by the private \nsector because you want to move more people onto the public insurance \nsystem because you want to have a nationalized system.\n  Now, I do not happen to support a nationalized system of health care. \nBut I think if we are going to have a nationalized system of health \ncare, we should not do it through the back door. We should not do it \nthrough this bait-and-switch approach that this bill represents. We \nshould do it in a very open, honest statement, much as what Senator \nClinton proposed back in the early 1990s: We are going to nationalize \nthe health care system of this country. There is going to be one payer. \nIt is going to be the Federal Government. And all your health care will \nbe provided for by the Federal Government, with the cost being picked \nup by the American taxpayer.\n  I oppose that type of an approach for a variety of reasons: first and \nmost honestly because in every other nation that has tried that, it has \nled to dramatic rationing of care. Depending on your age, you simply \nare not able to get certain types of care, treatment. You go to Canada, \nand you wait for months, sometimes years for certain types of \nprocedures or you go to England and you wait for months, years, and you \ncannot even get certain types of procedures. So you get rationing.\n  Secondly, you undermine research. You do not get people investing in \ncreating new products and new ways to make people healthy because the \ncost is not reimbursed.\n  Thirdly, if you take the private sector out of providing health care, \nyou immediately create huge inefficiencies because you reduce \ncompetition, you reduce the forces for cost control that private \ninsurance brings into play.\n  So I do not support a single-payer plan. But I especially find it \ninappropriate that the way the other side of the aisle is trying to get \nto a single-payer program is through this surreptitious back door of \ntaking one chunk of the population--kids who are already insured by the \nprivate sector--and moving them over to the public sector in the name \nof protecting children who are from lower or moderate-income families.\n  All the proposals that are pending around here--the proposal by the \nPresident, the proposal I would support--protect children in families \nat 200 percent of poverty or less.\n  One of the ironies, of course, is that as they expand to higher \nincome families, in States such as New Jersey, for example, where \npeople making up to $71,000 are covered under the single-payer plan, \nthey actually leave out low-income kids. For example, in New Jersey, \nthere are about 19,000 kids who are in families that are under 200 \npercent of poverty and are not covered under the New Jersey plan.\n  Wouldn't it make a lot more sense, if we were honestly trying to \naddress low-income kids, to put in place a plan which actually covered \nkids who were in family situations where the income was less than 200 \npercent of poverty and make sure everybody was covered? That was the \nproposal from our side of the aisle, by the way, but it was rejected in \nthis rush toward trying to get a big bite on the apple of \nnationalization, single-payer proposals.\n  So that is the policy problem with this bill. But there are a lot of \nother problems. Call them technical, if you want, but they are pretty \nbig technical problems. For example, there is the problem that there is \na scam going on, a scam in this bill as to how it is paid for.\n  You can see this chart I have in the Chamber. This reflects the \nincreased costs of the bill as it goes forward. But in order to make \ntheir own budget rules, which they claim so aggressively to be \nfollowing, such as pay-go, they have to take the program, in the year \n2013, from a $16 billion annual spending level down to essentially \nzero. In other words, they are zeroing out this program in the year \n2013. They are not spending any money on it at all so they can hit \ntheir budget numbers. That is called a scam. That is called a scam. It \nis a budget scam. And it is being played against a background of \nclaiming they are going to do all these wonderful things with all of \nthis extra money, such as nationalize the system for people making \n$80,000 or less, but they are simply not going to claim how they are \ngoing to pay for it. This big, white area in here, they have no idea \nhow they are going to pay for that. None. None. I will tell you how \nthey are going to pay for it: by raising taxes on the rest of working \nAmericans. That is how they are going to pay for it. Working Americans \nare going to pay for it so they can nationalize the system.\n\n  Then, on top of that, they have set up a verification system which \nuses Social Security numbers which the Social Security Administration \nsays will lead to illegal immigrants being the people who get the \nbenefit of this program, primarily--or not primarily but in part--\nbecause the Social Security Administration is incapable of accurately \nmonitoring whether these numbers are correct. So you are going to have \na lot of illegal immigrants getting coverage, claiming they are legal, \nbecause the system has been set up to accomplish that. Maybe this was \nthe back-door approach toward some level of amnesty or something, but \nif it was going to be done, it should have been done more openly than \nthe system that is being used in this bill. This is a fundamental flaw \nof this bill. It is a bill which, in its present form, is not paid for \nand has a huge cap.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, it has a huge gap in the way it is paid \nfor. Secondly, it sets up a system of verification which the Social \nSecurity system says it can't accomplish, and, therefore, presumes that \na large number of people who are in this country illegally will end up \nin this program.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the response of \nthe Social Security Administration on this point and a letter to Jim \nMcCrery, who is a Congressman and the ranking member of the Ways and \nMeans Committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S12082]]\n\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n                                Washington DC, September 21, 2007.\n     Commissioner Michael J.

Specifically, I would request that the Social \n     Security Administration provide technical assistance to \n     explain the impact of Section 301 of H.R. 976, which was \n     passed by the Senate on August 2, 2007.\n       Concerns have been raised that the implementation of this \n     provision could make it easier for illegal aliens to qualify \n     for government funded healthcare programs including SCHIP and \n     Medicaid. In order to better assess the accuracy of these \n     claims, I would request that you provide answers to the \n     following questions by no later than the evening of Monday, \n     September 24, 2007.\n       1. If implemented as written, would the name and Social \n     Security number verification process in section 301 of the \n     Senate SCHIP bill allow the Social Security Administration \n     (SSA) to verify whether someone is a naturalized citizen?\n       2. Would Section 301 require SSA to perform any \n     verification of a person's status as a naturalized citizen?\n       3. Would the implementation of this provision detect and/or \n     prevent a legal alien who is not a naturalized citizen (and \n     therefore generally ineligible for Medicaid), from receiving \n     Medicaid?\n       4. Would the name and Social Security number verification \n     system in Section 301 verify that the person submitting the \n     name and Social Security number is who they say they are?\n       5. Would the name and Social Security number verification \n     system in Section 301 prevent an i1legal alien from \n     fraudulently using another person's valid name and matching \n     Social Security number to obtain Medicaid or SCHIP benefits?\n       6. Would the name and Social Security number verification \n     system in Section 301 prevent an individual who has i1legally \n     overstayed a work visa permit from qualifying for Medicaid or \n     SCHIP?\n       7. Based on the accuracy of your database, please comment \n     as to the volume of false positives or false negatives that \n     could occur under the Social Security number verification \n     process in section 301 of the Senate SCHIP bill.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

The Office of Management and Budget advises that \n     there is no objection to the transmittal of this letter from \n     the standpoint of the President's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael J. Astrue,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n       1. If implemented as written, would the name and Social \n     Security number verification process in Section 301 of the \n     Senate SCHIP bill allow SSA to verify whether someone is a \n     naturalized citizen?\n       No, the name/SSN verification process only indicates \n     whether this information matches SSA's records. Our \n     understanding of Section 301 is that it would provide States \n     with the option of using a match as a conclusive presumption \n     that someone is a citizen, whether naturalized or not. Since \n     we have no data specific to this particular population, we \n     have no basis for estimating how many non-citizens would \n     match if this language were passed by Congress.\n       2. Would Section 301 require SSA to perform any \n     verification of a person's status as a naturalized citizen?\n       Section 301 would not provide for verification of \n     citizenship but would create a conclusive presumption based \n     on less reliable data that a person is a citizen. As we read \n     Section 301, it would not require use of DHS data to make a \n     verification of citizenship.\n       3. Would the implementation of this provision detect and/or \n     prevent a legal alien who is not a naturalized citizen (and \n     therefore generally ineligible for Medicaid), from receiving \n     Medicaid?\n       No. Our current name/SSN verification procedures will not \n     detect legal aliens who are not naturalized citizens.\n       4. Would the name and Social Security number verification \n     system in Section 301 verify that the person submitting the \n     name and Social Security number is who they say they are?\n       No.\n       5. Would the name and Social Security number verification \n     system in Section 301 prevent an illegal alien from \n     fraudulently using another person's valid name and matching \n     SSN to obtain Medicaid or SCHIP benefits?\n       No.\n       6. Would the name and Social Security number verification \n     system in Section 301 prevent an individual who has illegally \n     overstayed a work visa permit from qualifying for Medicaid or \n     SCHIP?\n       The name/SSN verification system in Section 301 would not \n     identify individuals who have illegally overstayed a work \n     visa permit.\n       7. Based on the accuracy of your database, please comment \n     as to the volume of false positives or false negatives that \n     could occur under the Social Security number verification \n     process in section 301 of the Senate SCHIP bill.\n       Due to a lack of data specific to this particular \n     population defined in section 301, we have no basis for \n     projecting how many ``false negatives'' or ``false \n     positives'' would be produced by enactment of Section 301, \n     but they will occur.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, to summarize, everybody around here is \nsupportive of a plan which would fully fund what is necessary to take \ncare of children whose families make 200 percent of poverty or less. \nBut what we on our side don't want to see is an expansion of this \nprogram as a method of taking people out of private insurance and \nputting them on the public system, creating a single-payer plan and, as \na result, moving down the road toward the nationalization of the entire \nhealth care industry. It would be at a cost of $71 billion to the \nAmerican taxpayer, a cost which isn't accounted for in this bill and \nwhich is not paid for. The program has a fundamental flaw in it as to \nhow they verify who is participating so we don't even know if we are \ngoing to have citizens participating in this program versus illegals. \nIt is a bill which is flawed. It should be opposed, and it should be \nvetoed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12082-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12082-S12083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I rise to express my grave concern about \nthe misplaced agenda we appear to be pursuing in the Senate: Taking us \noff of a Defense authorization bill that we have spent 15 days on--more \nthan 2 weeks--to take up special interest legislation that has nothing \nto do with providing the equipment and the pay raises and the dignified \ntreatment to our wounded warriors that the Defense authorization bill \nis designed to provide.\n  Unfortunately, we see the distinguished majority leader has now \nintroduced an amendment relating to hate crimes on a Defense \nauthorization bill. We are told the majority whip now plans to \nintroduce a bill with regard to immigration, the so-called DREAM Act.\n  I would submit there is a time and a place for everything. This is a \ndeliberative body, where we are happy to talk about and debate and air \nour differences on any piece of legislation any Senator might want to \npropose that comes to the floor, but there is a time and a place for \neverything. This is not the time and not the place to divert our \nattention from the important provision of pay raises, the important \nprovision of equipment, and the important public policy changes with \nregard to how we treat our wounded warriors.\n  One of the Hill newspapers has reported that today, a Government \nreport is being released that concludes the wounded warriors from Iraq \nand Afghanistan are still getting the runaround from the Pentagon and \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, despite big promises of change made \nafter last February's revelations about the scandalous conditions at \nWalter Reed Army Medical Center. As a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I am proud of the work we have been able to do on a \nbipartisan basis to move legislation forward that would address the \ncauses for concern first uncovered as a result of those sad and \nembarrassing revelations at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\n  Today, it is reported the Government Accountability Office, the \ninvestigative arm of Congress, says that delays for disability payments \nfor veterans still average 177 days--nearly 6 months--with no \nindication that any dramatic improvement is in the offing. The General \nAccounting Office also\n\n[[Page S12083]]\n\nfound continuing frustrations and shortfalls in care for the increasing \nnumber of military returnees from Iraq. Delayed decisions, confusing \npolicies, and the perception that the Department of Defense and \nVeterans' Administration disability ratings result in inequitable \noutcomes and have eroded the credibility of the system, according to \nthe General Accounting Office. Thus, it is imperative, the GAO \nconcludes, that the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs take \nprompt steps to address fundamental system weaknesses.\n  Well, I agree. This is intolerable. That is the reason why we need to \npass the Defense authorization bill, which has previously been pulled \nfrom the floor for consideration and has returned and now is being \nhijacked for special interest legislation that has nothing to do with \nproviding help to our men and women in uniform during a time of war.\n  Let me talk briefly about what the Defense authorization bill would \ndo if we ever get it passed. It would authorize increases in end \nstrengths to the Army and U.S. Marine Corps. As my distinguished \ncolleague from Arkansas knows, that has been one of the major concerns \nwe have all had about the stress and strain on our military that is too \nsmall for the challenges we have today, resulting in lengthy \ndeployments and absences away from family members. This bill would \nauthorize an increase of 13,000 in end strength for the Army and 9,000 \nfor the Marine Corps. But what do we do instead of passing the \nlegislation that would provide that additional authorization? We hijack \nthis Defense authorization bill to talk about hate crimes and perhaps \nimmigration and other unrelated issues. This bill authorizes a pay \nincrease of $135 billion for our men and women in uniform, people who \ndeserve everything we can do for them when it comes to providing for \nthem or reducing some of their financial burdens. This bill authorizes \n$135 billion in additional pay.\n  But what does the majority leader do? He says we are going to take \nanother timeout after 15 days and we are going to talk about hate \ncrimes, potentially immigration, and who knows what else, further \nburdening this bill with amendments which may jeopardize our ability to \npass it in the end.\n  This bill also provides for a 3.5-percent increase in pay for all our \ntroops. To the point of the GAO report, which I cited that has been \nreported in one of the Hill newspapers today, this bill would authorize \n$24.6 billion for the Defense health program, including a $1.9 billion \nadjustment to fund TRICARE benefits for fiscal year 2008.\n  That is exactly what we ought to be doing. I, similar to my other \ncolleagues, have visited our wounded warriors at Walter Reed and \nBethesda, places such as the Brooks Army Medical Center in San Antonio, \nand places such as Darnall Medical Center at Fort Hood and Killeen. We \nneed to make sure we do everything in our power to take care of \nour wounded warriors. But what are we doing? We are apparently taking a \ntimeout from that important work that is urgently needed and diverting \nour attention to other matters that have nothing to do with taking care \nof our troops.\n\n  What else would this Defense authorization bill do? Well, it would \nauthorize $4 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. As \nmy colleagues know, these are the V-shaped hull vehicles that have a \nway of dispersing improvised explosive device attacks in a way that \nwill save lives and protect our troops from further injury as a result \nof improvised explosive devices. But what do we do? We dillydally \naround after 15 days of not taking care of our business and divert our \nattention to other unrelated matters that have nothing to do with \nprotecting our troops. I think it is shameful.\n  Further evidence the agenda is misplaced in the Senate is the fact \nthat we will, this week, have to consider a continuing resolution. That \nmeans passing legislation to keep the doors of Government open until \nNovember 16 because this Congress has not passed, nor has the President \nsigned, appropriations bills to pay Congress's bills. Now, this is not \na surprise. September 30 we know is the end of the fiscal year. What \nwould happen if we were a small business--or a big business, for that \nmatter--that didn't take care of its affairs and didn't pay its bills? \nWell, it would shut down. But not the Federal Government, because we \nhave the power to wave a magic wand and pass a continuing resolution. \nBut 13 appropriations bills affecting the lives of each and every one \nof 300 million Americans in this country has simply been neglected, \npushed to the back burner, because we are diverting our attention to \nmatters that we should leave for a later date.\n  So I implore the majority leader, I implore the new management of \nthis Senate that was elected to the majority status after the last \nelection, let's take care of business. Let's take care of our troops. \nLet's take care of our military families that, in an all-volunteer \nmilitary, are absolutely essential to our ability to protect and defend \nthe United States. I think it is shameful we are changing the subject \nto take care of special interest legislation at a time such as this, \nwhen it is so critical, at a time of war. I implore the majority leader \nto reconsider his misguided agenda for the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

Madam President, I wish to shift the discussion, while \nI concur completely with the Senator from Texas and his assessment of \nfloor management time, and I do believe we need to get about the \nbusiness of a Defense authorization bill and not be sidetracked by \nother side issues.\n  I wish to talk about another important issue that is coming before \nthe Senate, which is the SCHIP program, one that I support, one that I \nwant to see reauthorized, and one that I want to see expanded. To my \ncolleagues on the other side of this debate, let's talk about expanding \nSCHIP. I support a $5 billion expansion. If that is not enough to cover \nthe children this program is intended to cover, let's talk. Let's \ndiscuss what amount would cover these children: $5 billion, $10 \nbillion; I am in favor of opening that discussion.\n  What I am against, what I oppose is expanding this program beyond the \nneeds of the poor.\n  The bill before us today expands the program beyond its original \nintent. It expands it to the point where we are making Government-\nsponsored health care available beyond the intent and to include those \nin the middle class.\n  For those who claim otherwise, let me read a quote from the chairman \nof the Senate Finance Committee. The chairman recently noted:\n\n       Everyone realized that the goal of this legislation moves \n     us a giant step further down the road to nationalizing health \n     care.\n\n  Nationalizing health care. Let's call it what it is. This is not a \ndebate over whether we are going to provide health insurance for our \nNation's low-income children--because we all agree we should do that--\nthis is a debate over whether we should nationalize health care.\n  This is a significant ideological debate. Do we in this body--in this \nNation--want a system of government versus private health insurance? Is \nit right to dramatically expand this program to middle-class families \nfor the sake of being able to say we are insuring more? I support \nSCHIP. I support the program with the original mission of covering low-\nincome children who do not have health insurance. This bill we are \ndebating today is not that program; it is not even close. It is bad \npolicy. To take a program designed to help poor children and create a \nnew entitlement for middle and upper income families, especially when \nthis group already has access to private coverage, money set aside for \nlow-income children should be used to cover low-income children.\n  Make no mistake. This bill takes us down a one-way path. The bill \ntakes the money intended for SCHIP and uses it as money to begin a \nprogram of socialized health care. For this reason, I cannot support \nthis bill.\n  Beyond the ideological shift of socializing health care, the funding \nportions of this bill will essentially eliminate health coverage for \nlow-income children after 5 years.\n\n[[Page S12084]]\n\n  Under this plan, SCHIP outlays increase every year for the next 5 \nyears. But in the year 2013, they drop dramatically--to levels that \nwill not sustain even the existing population of kids on SCHIP.\n  The proposal, as written, will require the Government to either drop \nmillions of children from health care in 2013 or impose a new tax to \nraise the $41 billion needed to sustain the increased levels of \ncoverage.\n  Additionally, this bill sets us up to cover an unintended population \nof adults. This plan would allow New York to expand their SCHIP program \nto cover middle-class families earning $82,600 per year, which is four \ntimes the Federal poverty level.\n  Ironically, this means many families in New York will receive a \ngovernment subsidy for insuring their children at the same time they \nare subject to the alternative minimum tax, a tax specifically designed \nto target wealthy Americans.\n  By expanding coverage further up the income scale and to new \npopulations, this bill takes away needed resources from those most \nvulnerable, low-income children.\n  Several recent analyses show that for every 100 children made newly \neligible for SCHIP, half of those would either lose or forgo private \ncoverage they currently have. So why are we using taxpayer dollars to \ncover children who have insurance at the expense of those who don't?\n  I truly believe this bill represents a fork in the road. We can \neither move toward a health care system that is patient focused, with a \nchoice of providers, or one that leads us toward a Cuban-style health \ncare system, with rationing of care, long waiting lines and, worse yet, \nno choice.\n  Let me reiterate, the dispute is not whether children should have \naccess to affordable health insurance; we all believe children should \nhave that access. The dispute is how we should achieve that goal.\n  SCHIP reauthorization in its current form will transform the program \ninto a middle-class entitlement.\n  A real compromise needs to be reached, one that keeps in the spirit \nof SCHIP; one that finds children currently eligible and signs them up \nfor insurance; a compromise that doesn't simply broaden the program's \neligibility so people on private health insurance all of a sudden have \nan option to move to Government-sponsored health insurance.\n  Congress also needs to work on legislation that will help make \ninsurance more affordable.\n  Since the President has signaled his intention to veto this version \nof SCHIP reauthorization, it is essential we talk about viable \nalternatives--plans that would ensure the reauthorization of SCHIP that \nexpand rather than diminish private health insurance and coverage for \nchildren.\n  I have been working with some of my colleagues on such a plan--one \nthat would bring a viable alternative to the debate we are currently \nhaving. This alternative would be composed of two elements: First, a \nfull reauthorization of SCHIP. SCHIP should continue to cover children \nin families with incomes at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel. But we should also work to enhance outreach for those eligible \nbut not signed up.\n  We know there are poor children out there without health insurance. \nWe may not agree on the number of them, but let's work harder to find \nthem and sign them up for coverage.\n  The second part should consist of a child health care tax credit. \nRather than putting more people on a government-run program, let's \nadvance tax credits to families with incomes between 200 percent and \n300 percent of the poverty level. This would cover the population \ntargeted by this bill, but instead of forcing them to drop their \ncurrent coverage, it would provide assistance to keep them in the \ncurrent insurance plan. It would help families with employer-based \ninsurance to add their children to their existing policies.\n  If a family doesn't have insurance, this credit will provide the \nresources necessary to go out and purchase health care.\n  I think this is something we can all agree to. These concepts are \nsupported by both the left and right, from the Heritage Foundation to \nFamilies USA. So I urge my colleagues to reject the proposal before us \ntoday and, instead, come together and work to ensure access to health \ncare for all low-income children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. WHITEHOUSE). The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise now somewhat in dismay, I \nsuppose, but certainly disappointed in hearing the debate from the \nother side. When we first started SCHIP 10 years ago, what a great \nbipartisan effort it was. Under this administration, so many waivers \nhave been granted for childless adults and for other different \ncategories of individuals to be covered.\n  What we have tried to do, in a bipartisan way in putting together the \nreauthorization of this bill, is rein in those waivers. I heard my \ncolleague and friend from New Hampshire--he and I have talked often \nabout our own children--say we are going to cover illegal immigrants. \nWe are not only not going to cover them in this bill, we don't even \ncover those who have stood in line and go through the proper process to \ncome here as legal residents until there has been certain proof of how \nlong they have been here and the contributions they have made.\n  I have great confusion about this effort to portray this \nreauthorization as something that is expanding. We are actually reining \nit in.\n  I have to say, in listening to my colleagues talk about covering 200 \npercent of poverty, I hope the American people understand that when we \ntalk about 200 percent of poverty--my colleague from New Hampshire \ntalked about it as if it was a lot of money. When you talk about 200 \npercent of poverty, you are talking about a family of four trying to \nlive on $41,300. Eighty percent of the people in the State of Arkansas \nwhom I represent have an adjusted gross income of less than $50,000. As \na parent myself, being blessed with two incomes coming into our \nhousehold, a family raising and caring for a family of four on $41,300 \na year--talking about what you are paying for rent, for food, for \nutilities, and then to say that we as a Nation don't want to support \nyou in caring for your children and seeing that they get good health \ncare, that their health care needs are met; no, go into the private \nmarketplace where the most expensive piece of health insurance you can \npurchase is in the private single-payer marketplace of health \ninsurance----\n\n  I have been disappointed by those comments we have heard this \nmorning.\n  I hope that as we look forward, in this bill, we prohibit any new \nwaivers, waivers that were a part of the first piece of legislation 10 \nyears ago, and this administration granted many of those waivers. My \nState of Arkansas has been a beneficiary of many of those waivers. But \nthe fact is that we rein them in. We prohibit waivers on childless \nadults, and as those childless adults are phased out of the program, \nthe States can choose to put them in a block grant program and cover \nthem in a much less percentage than what they are covered now. But they \nare not going to be in a children's program or a program designed for \nchildren.\n  So I hope our colleagues will look at all the hard work and effort \nthat has been put into this bill, to rein in much of the excess that \ncame through those waivers from this administration, and will look at \nhow we can focus on bringing about compromise and making sure we focus \non the hard-working families that make up the fabric of this great \nNation and do need the help and the support of all of us in making sure \ntheir children get the most basic of needs in health care coverage.\n  I thank the Chair and look forward to the debate and encouragement \nfrom all our colleagues to bring about a bipartisan bill that moves \nthis Nation forward in recognizing our greatest asset--our children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, has the time for morning business expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for morning business expires in 120 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this afternoon, I will be attending a \nhearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Secretary of \nDefense will\n\n[[Page S12085]]\n\nbe there, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will be there, as will \nsomeone from the State Department, and they will be here supporting a \nproposal by the President to the Congress that we supply up to $200 \nbillion in additional funding for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan--all \nof it declared ``emergency,'' none of it paid for, and that is $200 \nbillion for this year. That will take us to almost three-quarters of a \ntrillion dollars, with respect to the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, all \nadded to the Federal debt as a result of a request by the President \nthat it be emergency spending.\n  I mention that only because we have been talking out here on the \nSenate floor about something called the children's health insurance \nprogram. It is a fraction of what we will be discussing this afternoon \nas emergency funding. The children's health insurance bill is fully \npaid for. That which came out of the Senate Finance Committee on a \nbipartisan basis to address the issue of health insurance for children \nand do so in a way that fully pays for it. It is a very different \ncircumstance than exists with the President's request for war funding, \nfor example.\n  But it is interesting to me that the loudest moans in the Chamber of \nthe Senate come when we take the floor of the Senate to talk about \ntaking care of things here at home, taking care of basic things in this \ncountry.\n  What is more basic than taking care of children and the health care \nof children? If it is not in first place, tell me what is in first \nplace among your concerns about life. I am talking about the health of \nour children. If that doesn't rank No. 1, tell me what does. It ought \nto rank No. 1, front and center. Everybody individually, I think, would \nsay the most important thing in my life is my children and my \nchildren's health. Yet we bring a bill to the floor of the Senate \ndealing with children's health, paid for, and it provides expanded \ncoverage, coverage to those children who don't have coverage--millions \nof children whose health is now a function of how much money their \nparents have in their checkbook, and who, in some cases, are lying in \npain, walking with a limp, suffering through agony but cannot go to a \nhealth care facility because their folks cannot take them because they \ndon't have any money or insurance. Does anybody here believe we should \nnot aspire to address that? And we have. We have a piece of legislation \nthat is fully paid for----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Compared to what we will hear this afternoon, a request \nfor $200 billion of emergency funding for the war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, none of it paid for, and this is a fraction of that to \nreach out to try to provide health insurance to America's children, \nparticularly America's poor children.\n  I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On the point the Senator makes about this being a matter \nthat is paid for, it is not effectively costing the taxpayers any \nresources. As I understand it, it is going to mean an increase in the \ncigarette tax, and the implication of the increase in the cigarette tax \nis the fact that less children will be smoking; so you have a double \nvalue here, where we are not only getting coverage for the children but \ndiscouraging children from smoking, which will help and assist and make \nsure future generations are going to be healthier as well. I know the \nSenator is familiar with that argument. Does he think the \nadministration has missed that point?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I believe they have. It is a fact that this is paid for \nwith revenue coming from the sale of cigarettes. It is also a fact that \nabout 3,000 children a day will begin to smoke and become addicted to \ncigarettes, and 1,000 of them will ultimately die from that choice. The \nonly chance you have to hook someone on cigarettes is to do it when \nthey are kids. Does anybody know of anybody who is around 30 or 40 \nyears old sitting in a La-Z-Boy recliner and watching television and \nthinking, what have I missed in life? What have I not yet done that I \nshould do? And they come up with the answer that I ought to start \nsmoking. Does anybody believe that would happen? Of course it doesn't.\n  We know now that smoking has dangerous health effects. The only \nchance you have to get someone to smoke, get them addicted for a \nlifetime, is to get kids addicted. So I think that which we do to \npersuade children not to smoke is something very important in our \nlives. It is also a contributor to a healthy lifestyle.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Effectively, when the administration says this is going \nto be additional kind of spending, they leave out the fact that it is \ngoing to be funded--children's health--with a cigarette tax. Is the \nSenator familiar with the fact that the procedure, the process by which \nthe children actually get the health insurance in the State is \nbasically identical to what the administration asked on their \nprescription drug program? It is using the private sector in terms of \nthe contract, and in terms of an individual getting coverage for their \nchildren. The worker will find out there are several alternatives from \nwhich they can make a choice. They are all based on the private sector.\n\n  Therefore, I ask the Senator, is he somewhat troubled by the \nadministration's opposition, since we have effectively tracked the \ndelivery system that the administration has asked and it is being paid \nfor independently from spending programs by the Federal Government and \nthat the total expenditure, as the Senator I am sure has pointed out, \nis some $35 million over 5 years as compared to $120 billion dollars \nfor the war in Iraq in a single year?\n  Mr. DORGAN. In fact, the request before the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee this afternoon for the war in Iraq is two requests: $145 \nbillion that now exists for this year, and we expect another $50 \nbillion on top of it. That is nearly $200 billion in one single year, \ntotaling about three-quarters of a trillion dollars, over time none of \nit paid for. This program to provide health insurance to children is $7 \nbillion a year fully paid for.\n  What bothers me about this issue is this clearly is an issue of \ntrying to take care of things here at home. What is more important than \ntaking care of a young child who is sick? It is interesting to me, we \nvoted a while back about making English the national language. It is a \nreasonable request. If you want to become an American citizen, you \nought to aspire to learn the language, English. Yet I come to the floor \nand I hear a foreign language. I don't understand what they are talking \nabout: ``socialized medicine,'' ``Cuban-style, government-run health \ncare.'' It seems to me they ought to speak English. I get so tired of \npeople using these terms, such as ``socialized medicine.'' Yes, there \nis a government aspect to this issue. But as my colleague said, much of \nthis is the private sector as well implementing it.\n  I am so tired of people saying the Government can't do a thing. How \nabout those firefighters climbing the World Trade Center and giving \ntheir lives as those buildings came down? You know what, they were on \nthe public payroll, were they not? Public service, that is what they \nwere doing. Government workers. How about the teachers taking care of \nour kids today in the classroom? Government workers; yes, they are. How \nabout Dr. Francis Collins working at NIH, who gave us the owners manual \nfor the human body with the mapping of the genome code? Are we proud of \nhim? Government worker.\n  I am a little tired of this language--``socialized medicine,'' \n``Cuban-style system.'' What a load. That is thoughtless rather than \nthoughtful debate. This is not some massive socialized medicine \nprogram.\n  I say to my colleagues, look a 4-year-old child in the eye who is \nhurting and say to them: You know what, we made a decision that the \nquestion of whether you get to see a doctor or get to go to a clinic or \nget to go to a hospital today is a function of how much money your \nparents have, and if they don't have the requisite amount of money, I \nam sorry, youngster; tough luck. I am sorry. Just bear the pain. We \nshouldn't do that. As a country, we shouldn't do it.\n  What is a higher priority than our children and our children's \nhealth? How on Earth, given what we are doing, spending money in this \nChamber, a $200 billion request this afternoon before the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, none of it paid for, on an emergency basis, \n$200 billion, and now\n\n[[Page S12086]]\n\nwe come with a $35 billion request fully paid for to address the issue \nof children who do not get health care, children who, when they get \nsick, do not have adequate health care--what is more important for this \ncountry?\n  I don't understand. I have said from time to time, we have all these \nevents in the Olympics for running and jumping. If ever there were an \nevent for sidestepping, I have some gold medal candidates in this \nChamber. Sidestepping the important issue--they don't want to talk \nabout the question of why do you not want to address the health care of \nchildren. They want to talk about other issues--socialized medicine. It \nis a foreign language to me, but maybe not to some.\n  I guess I would ask this question: Can we--not just on this subject \nbut other subjects as well--can we come to the floor of the Senate and \ntake some pride in taking care of business at home? My colleague from \nOregon and I offered the only amendment that cut down a bit the $20 \nbillion--yes, with a ``B''--$20 billion this Congress passed for \nreconstruction in Iraq. A massive amount of it was wasted. Talking \nabout health care, guess what. We gave a $243 million contract to a \nprivate contractor to rehabilitate 142 health care clinics in Iraq. An \nIraqi doctor went to the Health Minister of Iraq and said: I would like \nto see the health clinics that were rehabilitated. The money is all \ngone. The Iraqi Health Minister said: In many cases, those are \nimaginary health clinics. The money is gone. Reconstruction in Iraq--\nhow about taking care of things at home? How about doing first things \nfirst? And you tell me what is in second place. The first place, in my \njudgment, is taking care of America's kids, and we don't do this \nthrough some massive Government program, through some socialized health \ncare system, some Cuban-style system of Government programs. We do this \nin a thoughtful way, and we do it in a way that works.\n  How do we know it works? Because this program has existed and been an \nexemplary program, and it has given low-income families an opportunity \nto believe that when their kids get sick and they don't have money and \nare having a tough time, they can still take their kids to a doctor. \nGod bless them for knowing that and God bless the Congress and the \nPresident for doing something about it in past years.\n  It is very different now. We are trying to expand the program to \nmillions of additional kids, and we are told somehow this is a program \nthat is unworthy, it cannot be done this way, it is some sort of big \nbureaucratic mess. Nothing could be further from the truth--nothing.\n  I hope when the dust settles this week and we do the conference \nreport, I hope we understand that this conference report is \nbipartisan--Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, Senator Hatch, Senator \nKennedy, and so many others have advanced this legislation on the \nfloor, Republicans and Democrats. Let's pass this legislation, and \nlet's hope the small amount of opposition in this Chamber will not \ndeter us from doing what we know is best for the country. And, second, \nlet's expect this President to sign it. I know he has threatened to \nveto the bill. Let's expect him to sign it because it is taking care of \nbusiness at home and doing first things first.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12086-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12086-S12090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HATE CRIMES\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I believe the pending amendment is the hate \ncrimes amendment to the national Defense authorization bill. I rise \ntoday to once again discuss the need to enact hate crimes legislation. \nFor the fifth consecutive Congress, I have introduced this legislation \nwith my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy.\n  The Senate knows well the substance of what we have debated. We have \ndone it in every Congress of my tenure. A majority of Senators have \nrepeatedly supported this legislation. Two years ago, under a \nRepublican-controlled Senate, we overwhelmingly passed hate crimes \nlegislation on the National Defense Authorization Act by a vote of 65 \nto 33. In 2000, the Senate voted 57 to 42 in favor of the bill. In \n2002, we had 54 votes.\n  Hate crimes legislation, in my view, is the most important civil \nrights issue before this Congress. The House has already passed this \nlegislation. They have done so and we will do so, I hope, because \nAmerica needs it.\n  America is one of the most diverse societies on the planet, and I can \nthink of no other country in world history that has achieved the same \ndegree of diversity as the United States of America. Our diversity is, \nin part, our Nation's heritage. It is part of our political and social \nfabric. It is a source of our strength, and it should be protected from \nthose who try to systematically victimize whole classes of individuals \nbased on their beliefs, their practices, or their race.\n  The bedrock of our civil rights laws is founded on our collective \nbelief that minorities should be protected from discrimination. But the \ncivil rights struggle is far from over. Every election brings a new \nchapter in our efforts to get it better.\n  As we fight the war on terrorism abroad, we must not forget that we \ncontinue to have injustices on our home shores. Americans continue to \nbe harassed, victimized, and denied equal opportunities simply because \nof their race, religion, color, disabilities, or sexual orientation.\n  As a nation that serves as a beacon of freedom and liberty throughout \nthe world, we simply cannot tolerate violence against our own citizens \nsimply because of their differences. We cannot fight terror abroad and \naccept terror at home.\n  For the last 7 years, I have entered into the Congressional Record a \nhate crime almost every day. I have entered hundreds upon hundreds of \nindividual hate crimes into the Record to demonstrate the need for this \nlegislation. Many of these crimes are extremely brutal, some even \nresulting in the death of the victim. I do this to raise awareness. I \ndo it to demonstrate the severity of these attacks and to show the \nfrequency of these violent crimes. I also do it to remember these often \nnameless victims and to give a human face to these senseless acts of \nviolence.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about the horror of these attacks. \nOpponents of this measure will say every crime should be treated \nequally. But those who perpetrate crimes out of bias, against sexual \norientation, are unusually and especially savage. One rarely, if ever, \nreads about a hate crime resulting from a single bullet or errant \npunch. Hate crime victims will be beaten dozens of times with an iron \ncrowbar, they will be stabbed over and over, or they will be stomped to \ndeath. These prolonged, vicious beatings are more akin to punishment \nand torture and manifest themselves in ways that are most evil.\n  This year, Senator Kennedy and I have decided to rename our \nlegislation the Matthew Shepard Act. We do so with the permission of \nhis mother. We do so to put a human face on the issue of hate crimes \nlegislation. In addition, we did it in remembrance of a young hate \ncrime victim who has left an indelible mark upon our Nation's \nconscience. His name is Matthew Shepard.\n  Judy Shepard, Matthew's mother, is a dear friend of mine. Judy \nexperienced a parent's single worst tragedy: the loss of her child. But \ninstead of retreating into her own pain for solace, Judy has brought to \nnational attention the need for hate crimes legislation. She is our \nNation's strongest advocate for this issue.\n  For those of you who do not know Matthew Shepard's story, it is truly \nheartbreaking. Matthew was a 21-year-old college student at the \nUniversity of Wyoming when he was attacked. Shortly after midnight on \nOctober 7, 1998, Matthew was kidnapped, beaten, pistol whipped, lashed \nto a lonely stretch of fence, and left to die alone.\n  Almost 18 hours later, Matthew was found alive but unconscious. His \ninjuries were deemed too severe for surgery, and Matthew died on \nOctober 12. Matthew was murdered by two men simply for who he was, \nbecause he was gay. To think that such virulent hatred of another \nperson's sexual orientation drove another to commit such a heinous act \nis truly unthinkable. Sadly, this case is not isolated.\n\n[[Page S12087]]\n\n  One may ask why Senator Kennedy and I have offered this legislation \nagain on the Defense authorization bill. As I have said in the past, \nthe military is not immune to the scourge of hate crimes in our \ncountry. In 1992, Navy seaman Allen Schindler was brutally murdered by \nhis shipmate Terry Helvey in Okinawa, Japan. Schindler was beaten and \nstomped to death simply because he was gay. His attack was so vicious \nthat almost every organ in his body was destroyed. His own mother could \nnot have identified him but for the remains of a tattoo on his arm.\n\n  In another tragic case, PFC Barry Winchell was beaten by another army \nprivate with a baseball bat. He was beaten with such force and his \ninjuries were so severe that he died shortly thereafter. He was only \n21, the same age as Matthew Shepard.\n  To those who say we don't need a Federal hate crimes bill, I say they \nare wrong. This is a national problem that deserves national attention. \nOur hate crimes legislation would strengthen the ability of the \nFederal, State, and local governments to investigate and prosecute hate \ncrimes based on race, ethnic background, religion, gender, sexual \norientation, disability, and gender identity.\n  Furthermore, it would strengthen State and local efforts by enabling \nJustice to assist them in the investigation and prosecution of hate \ncrimes and assist in funding of these prosecutions.\n  The legislation would also allow the Federal Government to step in, \nif needed, but only after the Department has certified that a Federal \nprosecution is necessary. If this can be done locally or at the State \nlevel, it should be, but hate crimes should be prosecuted.\n  Current law does not provide any authority for Federal involvement in \nthese types of hate crimes, even when State or local law enforcement is \ninadequate because relevant law is nonexistent or resources are \ninsufficient. Without this legislation, the tools for battling hate \ncrimes at the Federal level will remain limited.\n  I have also heard it argued that we shouldn't punish a hate crime any \ndifferently than any other crime. I believe that is flat wrong. Hate \ncrimes tear at the very fabric of our Nation. They seek to intimidate \nentire groups of Americans and, as such, divide our people. Hate crimes \ndo more than harm one victim; they terrorize an entire society. They \nsend an ominous message of hate and intolerance to all Americans. Those \ncrimes must be punished proportionately.\n  As to the constitutionality of hate crimes statutes, which is \nquestioned by some, it shouldn't be. The Supreme Court has already \nresponded to their legitimacy. Motive has always been a factor in \ndetermining whether a crime has in fact occurred.\n  Mr. President, when you and I went to law school, took a class in \ncrimes, one of the first things we learned you have to do to establish \nthe commission of a crime is intent and motive, and speech is one of \nthose legitimate areas of inquiry. This was made very clear by Chief \nJustice William Rehnquist, not exactly a liberal, who wrote the \nmajority opinion in Wisconsin v. Mitchell, where the Supreme Court \nunanimously upheld the constitutionality of a Wisconsin hate crimes \nstatute. Statutes which provide for an enhanced sentence, where the \ndefendant is intentionally selected because of his race, his religion, \ncolor, disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry, \ndoes not violate the first amendment, the Court found.\n  Rehnquist wrote in Mitchell:\n\n       The first amendment does not prohibit the evidentiary use \n     of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove \n     motive or intent.\n\n  In fact, you can't have a crime unless you prove motive and intent, \nand speech is one of the legitimate areas of inquiry.\n  Lastly, I have heard concerns from my religious brothers and sisters \nwho fear passage of hate crimes legislation will have a chilling effect \non our Nation's churches and pulpits. This is unfounded. I find it \ndisconcerting that many ministers of religion, for whom I have the \nutmost respect, would preach such messages from the radio, from \ntelevision, and from sacred church pulpits. A hate crime does not \ncriminalize thoughts, moral views, and religious beliefs. What it does \nsay is we cannot go out and do violence to our fellow Americans simply \nbecause we find another's mere existence offends our beliefs. You have \nto act. Thought and speech are insufficient to prove a hate crime, and \nit is disingenuous and fallacious to say otherwise.\n  And I would say, as an aside, that if I believed what they charge, I \nwould not be here in support of this amendment in Congress after \nCongress. I know the law, however, and I know what is being said about \nthis amendment is simply wrong.\n  I accuse no one, but what I find of great comfort is a story from the \nNew Testament on this issue, and I think it is applicable. It is a \nstory from the Book of John, and I will share it with you, because I \nthink it teaches us all how we should behave toward one another, \nsinners all, in the public square. It reads as follows, from Chapter 8:\n\n       And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and \n     all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught \n     them.\n       And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman \n     taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,\n       They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in \n     adultery, in the very act.\n       Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be \n     stoned: but what sayest thou?\n       This they said, tempting him, that they might have to \n     accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote \n     on the ground, as though he heard them not.\n       So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, \n     and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him \n     first cast a stone at her.\n       And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.\n       And they which heard it, being convicted by their own \n     conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, \n     even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the \n     woman standing in the midst.\n       When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the \n     woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine \n     accusers? hath no man condemned thee?\n       She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do \n     I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.\n\n  That occurred in the public square. Jesus risked his life to save her \nlife. He didn't excuse it nor did he condemn her. He saved her life and \nrisked his own. I don't believe Federal law should do any less than \nthat, and I believe it is high time for us to do what many States, most \nof the States in America have done, and that is add the category of \nsexual orientation to our Federal statutes.\n  No churchman, no preacher, no adherent of religious faith need fear \nthis, but they ought to follow that and understand that what we are not \ntrying to do here is to somehow inhibit the free exercise of religion. \nWe are trying to protect people, American people, from the most brutal \nkinds of terrorist acts on our own shores.\n  Finally, there is a memorial in Casper, WY, sculpted by Chris \nNavarro, dedicated to the memory of Matthew Shepard. It is named the \nRing of Peace. The circular design of the ring symbolizes both the \nindividual and the ideals of social unity. The bell, supported by a \nring, stands for liberty, and the ring for the promise of tomorrow. \nWhite doves flying out of the bell are a symbol of peace. They are \nflying as a unified group and their wings symbolize hope and freedom.\n  At the base of the sculpture there is a simple poem that reads:\n\n       If you believe in hope, and the need for peace, step up and \n     ring the bell, for it will sing, for a promise of tomorrow.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, as many as have done \nso in the past, to vote in favor of this amendment. We cannot be \ncomplacent or tolerate such acts of hatred. We all need to step up and \nvote for legislation that promises all Americans a better tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope our friends and colleagues had a \ngood opportunity to listen to the excellent, extraordinary, compelling \npresentation my friend from Oregon has made on this issue. I have had \nthe good opportunity to work with him for a good number of years. I \nalways find that when he speaks on this issue, as he does on other \nissues of war and peace, he is able to get to the heart and the soul of \nthese matters. Today, he has described the moral requirements presented \nto us on the issue of hate\n\n[[Page S12088]]\n\ncrimes, and he has done that in a very thoughtful and sensitive way, \nbesides explaining in a very detailed way not only the underlying \nlegislation but the compelling reasons for it at this time. One can say \nthat, on this legislation, now is the time, to repeat those wonderful \nwords of Dr. King; that now is the time for action.\n  Senator Smith has reminded us why this legislation is so important \nnow on the Defense authorization bill. We cannot let another day, \nreally hours, go by without this legislation. It reminds us of not only \nthe moral compulsion but also why it is necessary to put this as an \namendment onto the Defense authorization bill. As we are facing \nterrorism abroad, we also want to deal with terrorism here at home; and \nas we are looking at the values those serving abroad are fighting for \nagainst the terrorist elements abroad, it is important to reaffirm them \nand make them consistent with our best instincts. I commend the Senator \nfor his presentation on this issue.\n  We are hopeful, Senator Smith and I, we will have the chance to \nactually vote on this measure. As he has pointed out, this is not a new \nissue or question for this body. This is one of those issues we have \nhad a chance to debate, debate, debate, and debate. The House of \nRepresentatives has taken a very clear and compelling stand. We have \nvoted, the majority of the membership of this body, Democrat and \nRepublican, in Republican Senates and Democratic Senates, to take \naction on this proposal. We don't need a great amount of time to deal \nwith this issue, but it is appropriate that we lay out this case for \nit, and I welcome the chance to make some comments on it today. I am \nhopeful we will have the opportunity to proceed to it.\n  I was in the Senate when we passed the first hate crimes legislation \nin 1968, after the death of Dr. King.\n  We started off with strong legislation. It was cut back and cut back, \nso now we find that basically it is ineffective in dealing with hate \ncrimes for a number of the reasons the Senator has outlined, because of \nthe kinds of restrictions that have been placed on it. Again we are \nreminded of the need for this legislation. With the passage of this \nlegislation, we will be, hopefully, a safer and more secure nation.\n  Legislation has real implications when it is effective. I believe \nthis legislation is effective. I can remember years ago, when we had \nthe series of church burnings in the southern part of our Nation, we \npassed here at that time--it was Lauch Faircloth and myself--additional \nresponsibility for investigation and working with the prosecution by \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation in these circumstances and enhanced \nsupport for local law enforcement and State law enforcement in the \nprosecution of these church burnings. We saw a dramatic alteration and \nchange in the pattern of church burnings.\n  My Governor now, Deval Patrick, was the head of the division in the \nJustice Department during this period of time, when I had a chance to \nmeet him. We find when we take action, when we are serious, we are \nsaying to the American people we are going to fight hate crimes and \nviolence with both hands instead of one hand tied behind our backs, as \nwe are doing now with the restrictions we have, using all our crime-\nfighting ability, we will be a more fair and safer land. That is what \nthis legislation is about.\n  I am going to take a few minutes to remind the Senate about why this \nis a particular issue in the military. It is also outside the military, \nbut I will just mention some of the incidents. The Senator from Oregon \nmentioned some, but I wish to take a few moments to elaborate on this \nquestion.\n  At a time when our ideals are under attack by terrorists in other \nlands, it is more important than ever to demonstrate that we practice \nwhat we preach, and that we are doing all we can to root out the \nbigotry and prejudice in our own country that leads to violence here at \nhome.\n  Crimes motivated by hate because of the victim's race, religion, \nethnic background, sexual orientation, disability, or gender are not \nconfined to the geographical boundaries of our great Nation. The \ncurrent conflicts in the Middle East and Northern Ireland, the ethnic \ncleansing campaigns in Bosnia and Rwanda, or the Holocaust itself \ndemonstrate that violence motivated by hate is a world-wide danger, and \nwe have a special responsibility to combat it here at home.\n  This amendment will strengthen the Defense Authorization Act by \nprotecting those who volunteer to serve in the military. The vast \nmajority of our soldiers serve with honor and distinction. These men \nand women put their lives on the line to ensure our freedom and for \nthat, we are truly grateful.\n  Sadly, our military bases are not immune from the violence that comes \nfrom hatred--and even though members of the military put their lives on \nthe line for us every day--they have not been immune from hate-\nmotivated violence. Just last month, the FBI arrested members of the \n82nd Airborne Division in Fayetteville, NC, and charged them with \nselling stolen military property to an agent they believed was a white \nsupremacist. The pair allegedly sold drugs and bulletproof vests, and \nwere also reportedly interested in selling an Army Humvee and weapons. \nOfficials said the two men had been seen at a white supremacist rally. \nOne of them had a page on the Web with photos of him posing with \nmilitary weapons, statements about his Nazi heroes, and racist rants \nfrom his network of friends.\n  In December 2006, a Coast Guard procurement officer was given a bad \nconduct discharge and sentenced to a year in a military brig for \nposting Ku Klux Klan recruitment fliers on a white supremacist web \nsite, illegally possessing weapons and explosive powder and grenade \nparts, lying to investigators, and other charges.\n  In December 1995, two paratroopers in a skinhead gang at Fort Bragg \ngunned down a black couple in a random, racially motivated double \nmurder that shocked the Nation and led to a major investigation of \nextremism in the military. The killers were eventually sentenced to \nlife in prison, and 19 other members of their division were \ndishonorably discharged for neo-Nazi gang activities.\n  As Senator Smith points out, in 1992, Allen Schindler, a sailor in \nthe Navy was viciously murdered by two fellow sailors because of his \nsexual orientation. Seven years later, PFC Barry Winchell, an infantry \nsoldier in the Army, was brutally slain for being perceived as gay. \nThese incidents prompted the military to implement guidelines to \nprevent this type of violence, but there is more that we can do. We \nhave to send a message that these crimes won't be tolerated against any \nmember of society.\n  These examples clearly demonstrate the relevance of this amendment to \nthe military. We can't tolerate hate-motivated violence and must do all \nwe can to protect our men and women in uniform.\n  A disturbing trend has also been discovered in the military. Last \nyear, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported that members of hate \ngroups have been entering into the military. As recruiters struggle to \nfulfill their quotas, they are being forced to accept recruits who may \nbe extremists, putting our soldiers at higher risk of hate motivated \nviolence. This can't be tolerated. We must stem the tide of hatred and \nbigotry by sending a loud and clear message that hate crimes will be \npunished to the fullest extent of the law.\n  Since the September 11 attacks, we have seen a shameful increase in \nthe number of hate crimes committed against Muslims, Sikhs, and \nAmericans of Middle Eastern descent. Congress has done much to respond \nto the vicious attacks of September 11. We have authorized the use of \nforce against terrorists and those who harbor them in other lands. We \nhave enacted legislation to provide aid to victims and their families, \nto strengthen airport security, to improve the security of our borders, \nto strengthen our defenses against bioterrorism, and to give law \nenforcement and intelligence officials enhanced powers to investigate \nand prevent terrorism.\n  Protecting the security of our homeland is a high priority, and there \nis more that we should do to strengthen our defenses against hate that \ncomes from abroad. There is no reason why Congress should not act to \nstrengthen our defenses against hate that occurs here at home.\n  Hate crimes are a form of domestic terrorism. They send the poisonous \nmessage that some Americans deserve\n\n[[Page S12089]]\n\nto be victimized solely because of who they are. Like other acts of \nterrorism, hate crimes have an impact far greater than the impact on \nthe individual victims. They are crimes against entire communities, \nagainst the whole Nation, and against the fundamental ideals on which \nAmerica was founded. They are a violation of all our country stands \nfor.\n  Since the September 11 attacks, the Nation has been united in our \neffort to root out the cells of hatred around the world. We should not \nturn a blind eye to acts of hatred and terrorism here at home.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft put it well when he said:\n\n       Just as the United States will pursue, prosecute, and \n     punish terrorists who attack America out of hatred for what \n     we believe, we will pursue, prosecute and punish those who \n     attack law-abiding Americans out of hatred for who they are. \n     Hatred is the enemy of justice, regardless of its source.\n\n  Now more than ever, we need to act against hate crimes and send a \nstrong message here and around the world that we will not tolerate \ncrimes fueled by hate.\n  Hate is hate regardless of what nation it originates in. We can send \na strong message about the need to eradicate hate crimes throughout the \nworld by passing this hate crimes amendment to the Defense Department \nauthorization bill. The hate crimes amendment we are offering today \ncondemns the poisonous message that some human beings deserve to be \nvictimized solely because of their race, religion, or sexual \norientation and must not be ignored. This action is long overdue. When \nthe Senate approves this amendment, we will send a message about \nfreedom and equality that will resonate around the world.\n  According to FBI statistics, nearly 25 people are victimized each and \nevery day because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnic \nbackground, or disability. Some argue that hate crimes are actually \ndecreasing because the total number of hate crimes in 2005 was slightly \nlower than in 2004. But the FBI data reflects only a fraction of hate \ncrimes, because so many of these crimes routinely go unreported. The \nSouthern Poverty Law Center estimates the total number of hate crimes \nper year is close to 50,000. Every hate crime is one too many. We need \nto strengthen the ability of Federal, State and local governments to \nprevent, investigate and prosecute these vicious and senseless crimes.\n  The existing Federal hate crime statute was passed in 1968, a few \nweeks after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It was an \nimportant step forward at the time, but it is now a generation out of \ndate. The absence of effective legislation has undoubtedly resulted in \nthe failure to solve many hate-motivated crimes. The recent action of \nthe Justice Department in reopening forty civil-rights-era murders \ndemonstrates the need for adequate laws. Many of the victims in these \ncases have been denied justice for decades, and for some, justice will \nnever come.\n  Our bill corrects two major deficiencies in current law. Excessive \nrestrictions require proof that victims were attacked because they were \nengaged in certain ``federally protected activities.'' And the scope of \nthe law is limited, covering hate crimes based on race, religion, or \nethnic background alone.\n  The federally protected activity requirement is outdated, unwise and \nunnecessary, particularly when we consider the unjust outcomes of this \nrequirement. Hate crimes now occur in a variety of circumstances, and \ncitizens are often targeted during routine activities that should be \nprotected.\n  For example, in June 2003, six Latino teenagers went to a family \nrestaurant on Long Island. They knew one another from their involvement \nin community activities and had come together to celebrate one of their \nbirthdays. As they entered the restaurant, three men who were leaving \nthe bar assaulted them, pummeling one boy and severing a tendon in his \nhand with a sharp weapon. During the attack, the men yelled racial \nslurs and one identified himself as a skinhead.\n  Two of the men were tried under the current Federal hate crimes law \nand were acquitted. The jurors said the Government failed to prove that \nthe attack took place because the victims weren't engaged in a \nfederally protected activity--using the restaurant did not qualify \nunder current law. That case is only one example of the inadequate \nprotection under the current status quo. Our bill will eliminate the \nfederally protected activity requirement. Under this bill, the \ndefendants who left the courtroom as free men would almost certainly \nhave left in handcuffs through a different door.\n  The bill also recognizes that some hate crimes are committed against \npeople because of their sexual orientation, their gender, their gender \nidentity, or their disability. It is up to Congress to make sure that \ntough Federal penalties apply to those who commit these types of hate \ncrimes as well. Passing this bill will send a loud and clear message. \nAll hate crimes will face Federal prosecution. Action is long overdue. \nThere are too many stories and too many victims.\n  In October 2002, two deaf girls in Somerville, MA, one of whom was in \na wheelchair from cerebral palsy, were harassed and sexually assaulted \nby four suspected gang members in a local park. Although the alleged \nperpetrators were charged in the incident, the assaults could not be \ncharged as hate crimes because there is no Federal protection for a \nhate crime against a disabled person.\n  In 1999, four women in Yosemite National Park were attacked by a man \nwho admitted to having fantasized about killing women for most of his \nlife. The current law did not apply to this horrific crime, because \nenjoyment of a Federal park is not a Federally protected right.\n  Current law must also be strengthened to deter horrific mass \nshootings where women are singled out as victims because of their \ngender.\n  Crimes against individuals based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity also cause immense pain and suffering. In 1993, Brandon Teena \nwas raped and beaten in Humboldt, NE, by two male friends. The local \nsheriff refused to arrest the offenders, and they later shot and \nstabbed Brandon to death.\n  In 2001, Fred C. Martinez, Jr., a Navajo, openly gay, transgender \nyouth, was murdered while walking home from a party in Cortez, CO. The \nkiller, Shaun Murphy, had traveled from New Mexico to Colorado with a \nfriend in order to sell illegal drugs. He met Fred at a carnival that \nnight, and the next morning, while driving, he saw Fred walking down \nthe street. Shaun and his friend offered Fred a ride and dropped him \noff close to home. Shortly thereafter, Shaun attacked Fred and beat him \nto death with a large rock. His body was discovered several days later. \nThe attackers bragged about this vicious crime, describing the victim \nwith vulgar epithets.\n  The killer could not be charged with a hate crime, because no State \nor Federal law protecting gender identity existed. He received a 40 \nyear sentence under a plea agreement, and will be eligible for parole \nin 25 years. His victim did not live long enough to see his 20th \nbirthday.\n  These examples graphically illustrate the senseless brutality our \nfellow citizens face simply for being who they are. They also highlight \nthe importance of passing this legislation.\n  The vast majority of us in Congress have recognized the need for this \nlegislation since it was first introduced--nearly 10 years ago. With \nthe support of 31 cosponsors, Senator Smith and I urge your support of \nthis bipartisan bill.\n  The House has come through on their side and passed the bill. Now it \nis time for the Senate to do the same. This year, we can get it done. \nWe came close twice before. In 2000 and 2002, a majority of Senators \nvoted to pass this legislation. In 2004, we had 65 votes for the bill \nand it was adopted as part of the Defense authorization bill. But--that \ntime--it was stripped out in conference.\n  This year, we have an opportunity to pass it in both the Senate and \nthe House, and enact it into law. We can't afford to lose this \nopportunity. We must do all we can to end these senseless crimes.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during the course of the deliberation on \nthis Defense authorization bill, it has been my intention to offer an \namendment to the so-called DREAM Act. The DREAM Act is a narrowly \ntailored, bipartisan measure that would give a select group of \nundocumented young people in America the chance to become legal \nresidents if they came to this country as children, are currently long-\nterm U.S. residents, have good moral character, no criminal record, and \nare willing to either enlist in the U.S. military or to attend college \nfor at least 2 years.\n  The cosponsors of this amendment include Senators Hagel, Lugar, \nHatch, Bingaman, Boxer, Cantwell, Clinton, Feinstein, Kerry, Leahy, \nLieberman, Menendez, Murray, Nelson of Florida, and Obama. It is a \nbipartisan measure; it has been from the start. It says to a select \ngroup of immigrant students who grew up in our country: America is \ngoing to give you a chance. We will give you the opportunity to earn \nyour way to legal status if you meet each and every one of the \nfollowing requirements: You came to the United States before the age of \n15; you have been continually present in the United States for at least \n5 years; you are 29 years or younger when the DREAM Act becomes law, \nhave good moral character, have not engaged in criminal activity or \nterrorist activity of any kind, not participated in alien smuggling; \nyou have graduated from a U.S. high school; and you will serve in the \nmilitary or attend college for at least 2 years.\n  This bill means a lot to me, but it means even more to a lot of young \npeople across this country. Time and again I run into these young men \nand women. Some of them came to America as toddlers, as infants. They \nwere brought into this country by their parents, certainly with no \nvoice in the decision, and they grew up here. They attended our \nschools. Now they have reached a point in their lives where they want \nto go forward to make decisions about their careers. They are \nfrustrated because they have no legal status.\n  I have run into specific cases time and again, and since I introduced \nthis bill I have met so many of these students. It strikes me as \ninteresting that we are at a point in American history that we say we \ndo not have enough skilled workers, so we have to have H1-B visa \nholders come in from overseas; engineers, scientists, doctors, nurses \nwho come in for 3-year periods of time to supplement America's \nworkforce because we do not have enough skilled people. And here we \nhave a group of people who are graduates of high school, prepared to go \nto college or serve in our military, who, under our law as currently \nwritten, are being told: Leave. We do not need you. We do not want you.\n  If you meet these people, you will come to understand the potential \nthey bring to America's future: the young Korean-American woman I met \nthrough my office, who is an accomplished pianist, plays classical \npiano in symphonies and has been accepted at the most prestigious music \nschool in America to forward her career in music; a young Indian girl \nwho is studying to be a dentist at a university in Illinois; a young \nHispanic male who has just completed his graduate degree at an Illinois \nuniversity in microbiology whose goal is to be a researcher for either \na government agency or a pharmaceutical company, looking for cures for \ndiseases.\n  Future nurses, future teachers, future doctors, scientists, and \nengineers, I have met them. They are the valedictorians of their high \nschool classes, they are the role models for kids in their communities, \nthey are people with an extraordinary wealth of talent looking for a \nchance to prove themselves.\n  Each and every one of them is without a country, without a country \nbecause they were brought to the United States as children by their \nparents with, as I mentioned earlier, no voice in that decision. And \nthis is all they know. This is what they want. This is the country they \nidentify with, the country they want to be part of.\n  That is why I introduced this bill some 5 years ago and have worked \non it ever since. People ask: Why would you offer the DREAM Act as an \namendment to the Defense authorization bill? Well, there are pretty \ncompelling reasons for doing that. We are having trouble recruiting and \nretaining soldiers for our Army. We are accepting more applicants for \nthe U.S. Army who are high school dropouts, applicants who have low \nscores on the military aptitude test, and even some with criminal \nbackgrounds.\n  Under the DREAM Act, thousands of well-qualified potential recruits \nfor the military would become eligible for the first time, and many are \neager to serve in the Armed Forces, to stand up for the country they \nlove and the country they want to be part of.\n  Under the DREAM Act, they have a strong incentive to enlist because \nit gives them a path to permanent legal status. Most people do not know \nthat in the ranks of the military today we have about 40,000 men and \nwomen who are not citizens of the United States. They are legal \nresidents, but they are not citizens.\n\n  I met some of them when I went to Iraq and went to a Marine Corps \ncamp. One in particular sticks in my memory: a young man who, as I \nwalked through the ranks of Illinois marines, handed me a brown \nenvelope and said: Senator, can you help me become a citizen? I would \nreally like to vote someday.\n  You do not easily forget that kind of a request from a young man who \nlater that day would strap on his body armor, his helmet, take his \nweapon, and go out and fight alongside American citizens who were also \nmembers of the Marine Corps. The same is true in the Army; the same is \ntrue in many of our military services. We do not make it a condition of \nmilitary service that you be a citizen, only that you currently be a \nlegal resident.\n  Of course, we know, sadly, that if that soldier or another one like \nhim was killed in combat, we would award them citizenship posthumously. \nDoes that sound right? Does it sound right that someone who is willing \nto serve, defend our country, take an oath of loyalty to our Nation, \nrisk his life, perhaps be injured, does it make sense for us to say to \nthem: Well, you are good, good enough to serve in the military but not \ngood enough to be an American citizen?\n  Now, think of those young people, many of whom would step forward \ntoday, raise their hand, and proudly serve in the military. Now, this \nbill, the DREAM Act, does not mandate military service. I would not do \nthat. We have a volunteer military, and I want to keep it that way. A \nstudent who is otherwise eligible could earn legal status by attending \ncollege as well. That is consistent with the spirit of a volunteer \nmilitary force, that we do not force young people to enlist as a \ncondition of status.\n  But there is a strong incentive for military service. Those who \nanalyze it say, you know what. These young people who would be eligible \nto serve in the military through the DREAM Act are exactly the kind of \npeople we want. A 2004 survey by the Rand Corporation found that 45 \npercent of Hispanic males, 31 percent of Hispanic females between the \nages of 16 and 21, were likely to serve in the Armed Forces. That is 45 \npercent of Hispanic males compared to 24 percent of White males; 31 \npercent of Hispanic females compared to 10 percent of White women.\n  It is important to note that immigrants have an outstanding tradition \nof service in the military. About 8,000 enlist each year, those with \nlegal status but not in the DREAM Act category.\n  Last night, like many Americans, I watched a documentary prepared by \nKenneth Burns called ``The War,'' about World War II. There was an \nespecially touching part of it about one of our colleagues, Senator \nDanny Inouye of Hawaii, a man of Japanese ancestry, who enlisted in the \nArmy from Hawaii when our Government decided to take a chance on these \nJapanese Americans and see if maybe they would stand up for America, \neven to fight our enemies, which included the nation of Japan. \n\n[[Page S12091]]\n\nThey hoped to get 1,500 draftees out of Hawaii.\n\n  When Danny Inouye, our colleague, volunteered and enlisted, he was \none of 10,000 who stepped forward to serve. He told this touching story \nof taking the streetcar with his dad, off to catch the boat for \nmilitary training, and how his dad reminded him how good this country \nhad been to him and to his family and urged him to serve with honor and \nnever dishonor his family's name.\n  Danny Inouye told that story like no one else could because, of \ncourse, he served and became an officer in the U.S. Army. During an \ninvasion in Italy, he was gravely wounded, lost his left arm, and was \nawarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for the valor he showed in \ncombat. People worried at that time whether they should take a chance \nwith Japanese Americans. Could we really trust them? Would they really \nfight for America and be loyal? Danny Inouye and thousands of others \nproved that they would.\n  The same question is being raised about these young people. These are \nyoung people who are undocumented. They don't technically have \ncitizenship. They certainly don't have one in America. They are asking \nfor a chance to serve. We are told they want to serve in greater \nnumbers than most others.\n  A recent study by the Center for Naval Analyses concluded ``non-\ncitizens have high rates of success while serving [in the military]--\nthey are far more likely . . . to fulfill their enlistment obligations \nthan their U.S.-born counterparts.''\n  The Pentagon recognizes the merit of the DREAM Act. Bill Carr, Acting \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy, recently said \nthat the DREAM Act is ``very appealing'' to the military because it \nwould apply to the ``cream of the crop of students.'' Mr. Carr \nconcluded that the DREAM Act would be ``good for readiness.''\n  The DREAM Act is also supported by a broad coalition of military \nexperts, education, business, labor, civil rights and religious leaders \nfrom across the political spectrum and around the country. Last week, I \nreceived a letter supporting the DREAM Act from over 60 national \norganizations: the American Federation of State and County Municipal \nEmployees, the American Federation of Teachers, the Anti-Defamation \nLeague, the American Baptist Churches, Asian-American Justice Center, \nthe Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, Episcopal \nMigration Ministries, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, U.S. Hispanic \nChamber of Congress, the Jesuit Conference, the Jewish Council for \nPublic Affairs, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Lutheran \nImmigration and Refugee Services, National Council of Jewish Women, \nNational Council of La Raza, National Education Association, Service \nEmployees International Union, and UNITE HERE.\n  Thomas Wenski is bishop of Orlando, FL. He issued a statement on \nbehalf of the U.S. Catholic Bishops supporting the DREAM Act. I would \nlike to read it into the Record:\n\n       For those who call this legislation an amnesty, I say shame \n     on you. These are children who were brought to this country \n     illegally through no fault of their own . . . The United \n     States is the only country and home many of them know.\n       Are we to deport some of our future leaders to a country \n     they do not know in the name of an unjust law? Should we \n     forsake these young people because we lack the political will \n     and courage to provide them a just remedy?\n       Our elected officials should resist the voices of \n     dissension and fear this time and vote for the DREAM Act. By \n     investing in these young people, our nation will receive \n     benefits for years to come. It also is the right and moral \n     thing to do.\n\n  Last week, John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, issued a \nstatement. He said:\n\n       [The DREAM Act] will go a long way in remedying the \n     injustices that these hard-working and law-abiding children \n     face. We strongly support passage of the DREAM Act . . .\n       Students who qualify for the DREAM Act are graduating at \n     the top of their class; they are honor roll students, star \n     athletes and valedictorians. They have lived in the United \n     States most of their lives; this is the only country they \n     know. These children are as committed to their communities \n     and to this country as their American-born classmates. Yet, \n     because they lack legal status, they do not have the same \n     opportunities to education or to a decent job.\n\n  This is the choice the DREAM Act presents to us. We can allow a \ngeneration of immigrant students with great potential and ambitions to \ncontribute more fully to our society and national security or we can \nrelegate them to a future in the shadows, which would be a loss for all \nAmericans.\n  Since I introduced this bill about 5 years ago, I have run into many \nof these same students. Life goes on for them. They don't qualify for \nFederal loans, for grants. They are trying to make it through college. \nThey borrow the money and try to come up with it, delay their \neducation, if they can. Occasionally, in the few weeks when I get back \nin their neighborhoods, they will come and see me. They will walk up to \nme and say: Senator, what is new with the DREAM Act? It isn't just an \nidle question of someone who might follow legislative activity; this is \na question which will decide their lives for them. It will decide \nwhether we cast them aside, reject them, say we don't need their talent \nand dreams and their idealism or whether we will vote for this bill and \ngive these young people a chance.\n  When I hear some describe this as amnesty, I wonder, if someone is \nwilling to risk his or her life to serve in our military in a combat \nzone, is that a giveaway? Is that citizenship for nothing? I don't \nthink so. It has really been fundamental that we don't hold children \nresponsible for the errors and crimes of their parents. Why, then, \nwould we hold these children responsible?\n  When I hear some of the critics talk about the millions who will \nbenefit from this, those numbers don't match up to reality. To qualify \nfor this, you have to graduate from high school. Fifty percent of \nHispanic students don't graduate from high school. So already these \nstudents have beaten the odds. Then how many of these same Hispanic \nstudents go on to finish the first year of college? An even smaller \npercentage. The numbers go down. So we are talking about an elite group \nof students with great potential who can make this a greater nation, \nand we are talking about an elite group of undocumented students \nwilling to risk their lives for America.\n  I ask my colleagues to cast aside some of the rhetoric which is \ndivisive and sometimes unfair about these young people. Take the time \nto meet them. Sit down and talk to them. You will see in their faces \nand in their conversation the kind of idealism, the kind of aspiration \nfor a greater America we can only hope for from the next generation.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 10 years ago the Senate created the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program to help States provide health \ncoverage for low-income kids across America. It is known as CHIP. It \nprovides cost-effective health coverage to millions of kids. It is \ntruly the biggest success story in health care in America in the past \ndecade. We have reduced the number of uninsured children in our Nation \nby one-third. With the help of the CHIP program, my State of Illinois \nlaunched a statewide initiative to cover all kids, setting an important \nprecedent for other States to follow. Over 300,000 kids in Illinois \nhave insurance, but there are still thousands more we need to reach.\n  The 15 million uninsured children in America in 1997 are now 9 \nmillion nationwide. That is still far too many. Unfortunately, the Bush \nadministration does not view the Senate bill as the carefully crafted \ncompromise it is but sees it as a threat--in their words, ``a step down \nthe path of government-run health care for every American.'' Let me \nassure them, this bill falls far short of anything resembling universal\n\n[[Page S12092]]\n\ncoverage. It leaves millions of kids still without health insurance and \nmillions of working parents and working adults in a similar uninsured \nstatus. But it is progress.\n  The President's proposal to add just $5 billion over the next 5 years \nisn't enough. At that level, hundreds of thousands of people will \nlikely lose coverage. At that level, we start moving backward, pushing \nkids and families out of coverage and increasing the number of \nuninsured. This is no surprise. This President has seen a dramatic \nincrease of uninsured children for the first time since 1998, since he \ntook office. The number of uninsured children rose to 8.7 million in \n2006, up from 8 million in 2005--a 9-percent increase in 1 year.\n  It is time to reauthorize the children's health program before it \nexpires in a few days. What this bill does is strengthen a successful \nbipartisan program.\n  It allows States to cover more than 9 million children who do not \nhave health insurance. The compromise bill will allow 6.6 million \nchildren to maintain coverage and allow States to reach almost 4 \nmillion more. The House and Senate have worked out a delicate \nbipartisan compromise. We know it is time to put party labels aside and \ndo something about health care, particularly for our children.\n  How do we pay for it? It is an honest question, and a good one. The \ninvestment in the Children's Health Insurance Program is paid for by \nincreasing the Federal tax on cigarettes, with proportional increases \nfor other tobacco products.\n  I know there are some people who think this is unfair to smokers. But \nI have to tell them, their habit, their addiction to nicotine and \ntobacco comes at great expense not only to them personally but to this \nNation. We know higher tobacco prices will make it less likely kids \nwill use tobacco products. So it is a win-win situation. You see, if \nthese tobacco companies do not hook our kids at an early age, while \nthey are still kids and have not thought it through, they might never \nget them addicted.\n  So you see, the vast majority of smokers today started smoking before \nthe age of 16. The addiction starts, and it doesn't end until one out \nof three of them die from this tobacco addiction.\n  What stops a kid from smoking? Well, sometimes good parental advice \nor more--and a high price. When tobacco costs a lot of money, kids \ndon't buy it. It is a simple fact. It is economics. If there is one \nthing you want to do to stop kids from becoming addicted to tobacco, \nraise the price of the product. Each time you raise it a nickel or a \ndime or a quarter or 50 cents, you end up with fewer kids smoking. That \nis what is going to happen. So we will not only raise money from the \ntobacco tax to pay for health insurance for kids, we will have fewer \nkids addicted to tobacco.\n  In a poll conducted for the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, two-\nthirds of those interviewed--67 percent--favor this tax increase across \nAmerica; 28 percent oppose it. Moreover, nearly half--49 percent--\nstrongly favor it. Only 20 percent strongly oppose it.\n  It is the right thing to do for our kids' health and for the public's \nhealth. We have had good, bipartisan cooperation on this measure. It \nhas been our highest priority since the Democrats took control of \nCongress at the beginning of this year. We have tried to work together, \nand we have worked together successfully.\n  I want to especially salute, on our side of the aisle, Senator Max \nBaucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, who has been working on this \nvery closely with Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. \nSenator Grassley, Senator Hatch, and others have really shown \nextraordinary political courage in coming together to support this \nmeasure.\n  Now we have to convince the President. The President said in his \nstatement last week:\n\n       Members of Congress are putting health coverage for poor \n     children at risk so they can score political points in \n     Washington.\n\n  Well, I am sorry to say I disagree with the President on this. We are \nworking with the President's party, many Republicans in the Senate and \nin the House, to improve this important program.\n  Last night, on the House floor, there was a vote on this program, 265 \nto 159. Forty-five Republicans joined almost all of the Democratic \nHouse Members in support. It is a shame the President refuses to \nconsider the needs of millions of families who would be benefited from \nadditional children's health insurance coverage.\n  Let me close by saying a word about the cost of this program. This \nprogram is likely to cost us $6 billion a year. Mr. President, $6 \nbillion is a substantial sum of money to add more children to health \ninsurance coverage. Measure that $6 billion a year against this war--a \nwar that costs us $12 billion a month, a war for which this President \nwill come and ask $200 billion in the next 2 weeks.\n  But this measure that costs $6 billion a year is an amount of money \nthat pales in comparison with what the President is going to ask us to \ncontinue to spend on the war in Iraq. His request will be near $200 \nbillion. Mr. President, $200 billion for a war in Iraq, $200 billion \nfor helping the people of Iraq, the President believes we can afford. \nBut he argues we cannot afford $6 billion for more health insurance for \nAmerica's children.\n  I believe a strong America begins at home. It begins with strong \nschools and strong families and strong communities and strong \nneighborhoods. And it begins with health care--health care to bring \npeace of mind to parents who otherwise worry that tomorrow that earache \nmay turn into something worse, or a strep throat or a child struggling \nwith asthma or diabetes.\n  These are kids who need basic health protection and do not have it \ntoday. They are not the poorest of the poor. Those kids already have \nhelp from our Government. These kids I am talking about are the \nchildren of working families, working families who, unfortunately, have \nno health insurance at their workplace. We are trying to expand the \ncoverage of health insurance.\n  The President says it is unfair to private health insurance companies \nfor us to expand this program. I could not disagree more. Private \nhealth insurance companies are doing quite well. They do not need any \nmore help from us. The fact that these kids do not have health \ninsurance suggests these private health insurance companies either \ncannot or will not provide them the coverage they need.\n  I urge my colleagues, when the measure comes over from the House of \nRepresentatives--which it should momentarily--that we should support \nit, and I hope with numbers that say to the President: Please, for the \nsake of this country, for the sake of our families, and for the sake of \nthe kids--the millions of kids who will have health insurance \ncoverage--please, do not veto this important children's health \ninsurance bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FEDERALISM IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Iraq continues to experience a self-sustaining cycle of \n     sectarian violence.\n       (2) The ongoing sectarian violence presents a threat to \n     regional and world peace, and the longterm security interests \n     of the United States are best served by an Iraq that is \n     stable, not a haven for terrorists, and not a threat to its \n     neighbors.\n       (3) A central focus of al Qaeda in Iraq has been to turn \n     sectarian divisions in Iraq into sectarian violence through a \n     concentrated series of attacks, the most significant being \n     the destruction of the Golden Dome of the Shia al-Askariyah \n     Mosque in Samarra in February 2006.\n       (4) Iraqis must reach a comprehensive and sustainable \n     political settlement in order to achieve stability, and the \n     failure of the Iraqis to reach such a settlement is a primary \n     cause of violence in Iraq.\n       (5) Article One of the Constitution of Iraq declares Iraq \n     to be a ``single, independent federal state''.\n       (6) Section Five of the Constitution of Iraq declares that \n     the ``federal system in the Republic of Iraq is made up of a \n     decentralized capital, regions, and governorates, and local \n     administrations'' and enumerates the expansive powers of \n     regions and the limited powers of the central government and \n     establishes the mechanisms for the creation of new federal \n     regions.\n       (7) The federal system created by the Constitution of Iraq \n     would give Iraqis local control over their police and certain \n     laws, including those related to employment, education, \n     religion, and marriage.\n       (8) The Constitution of Iraq recognizes the administrative \n     role of the Kurdistan Regional Government in 3 northern Iraqi \n     provinces, known also as the Kurdistan Region.\n       (9) The Kurdistan region, recognized by the Constitution of \n     Iraq, is largely stable and peaceful.\n       (10) The Iraqi Parliament approved a federalism law on \n     October 11th, 2006, which establishes procedures for the \n     creation of new federal regions and will go into effect 18 \n     months after approval.\n       (11) Iraqis recognize Baghdad as the capital of Iraq, and \n     the Constitution of Iraq stipulates that Baghdad may not \n     merge with any federal region.\n       (12) Despite their differences, Iraq's sectarian and ethnic \n     groups support the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.\n       (13) Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated on \n     November 27, 2006, ``[t]he crisis is political, and the ones \n     who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of \n     innocents are the politicians''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should actively support a political \n     settlement in Iraq based on the final provisions of the \n     Constitution of Iraq that create a federal system of \n     government and allow for the creation of federal regions, \n     consistent with the wishes of the Iraqi people and their \n     elected leaders;\n       (2) the active support referred to in paragraph (1) should \n     include--\n       (A) calling on the international community, including \n     countries with troops in Iraq, the permanent 5 members of the \n     United Nations Security Council, members of the Gulf \n     Cooperation Council, and Iraq's neighbors--\n       (i) to support an Iraqi political settlement based on \n     federalism;\n       (ii) to acknowledge the sovereignty and territorial \n     integrity of Iraq; and\n       (iii) to fulfill commitments for the urgent delivery of \n     significant assistance and debt relief to Iraq, especially \n     those made by the member states of the Gulf Cooperation \n     Council;\n       (B) further calling on Iraq's neighbors to pledge not to \n     intervene in or destabilize Iraq and to agree to related \n     verification mechanisms; and\n       (C) convening a conference for Iraqis to reach an agreement \n     on a comprehensive political settlement based on the \n     federalism law approved by the Iraqi Parliament on October \n     11, 2006;\n       (3) the United States should urge the Government of Iraq to \n     quickly agree upon and implement a law providing for the \n     equitable distribution of oil revenues, which is a critical \n     component of a comprehensive political settlement based upon \n     federalism;\n       (4) the steps described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) \n     could lead to an Iraq that is stable, not a haven for \n     terrorists, and not a threat to its neighbors; and\n       (5) nothing in this Act should be construed in any way to \n     infringe on the sovereign rights of the nation of Iraq.\n       At the end of subtitle C of title XV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1535. SENSE OF SENATE ON IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) General David Petraeus, commander of the Multi-National \n     Force-Iraq, stated in testimony before a joint session of the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 10, \n     2007, that ``[i]t is increasingly apparent to both coalition \n     and Iraqi leaders that Iran, through the use of the Iranian \n     Republican Guard Corps Qods Force, seeks to turn the Shi'a \n     militia extremists into a Hezbollah-like force to serve its \n     interests and fight a proxy war against the Iraqi state and \n     coalition forces in Iraq''.\n       (2) Ambassador Ryan Crocker, United States Ambassador to \n     Iraq, stated in testimony before a joint session of the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 10, \n     2007, that ``Iran plays a harmful role in Iraq. While \n     claiming to support Iraq in its transition, Iran has actively \n     undermined it by providing lethal capabilities to the enemies \n     of the Iraqi state''.\n       (3) The most recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, \n     published in August 2007, states that ``Iran has been \n     intensifying aspects of its lethal support for select groups \n     of Iraqi Shia militants, particularly the JAM [Jays al-\n     Mahdi], since at least the beginning of 2006. Explosively \n     formed penetrator (EFP) attacks have risen dramatically''.\n       (4) The Report of the Independent Commission on the \n     Security Forces of Iraq, released on September 6, 2007, \n     states that ``[t]he Commission concludes that the evidence of \n     Iran's increasing activism in the southeastern part of the \n     country, including Basra and Diyala provinces, is compelling. \n     . . It is an accepted fact that most of the sophisticated \n     weapons being used to `defeat' our armor protection comes \n     across the border from Iran with relative impunity''.\n       (5) General (Ret.) James Jones, chairman of the Independent \n     Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq, stated in \n     testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate on September 6, 2007, that ``[w]e judge that the \n     goings-on across the Iranian border in particular are of \n     extreme severity\n\n[[Page S12094]]\n\n     and have the potential of at least delaying our efforts \n     inside the country. Many of the arms and weapons that kill \n     and maim our soldiers are coming from across the Iranian \n     border''.\n       (6) General Petraeus said of Iranian support for extremist \n     activity in Iraq on April 26, 2007, that ``[w]e know that it \n     goes as high as [Brig. Gen. Qassem] Suleimani, who is the \n     head of the Qods Force . . . We believe that he works \n     directly for the supreme leader of the country''.\n       (7) Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, the president of Iran, stated on \n     August 28, 2007, with respect to the United States presence \n     in Iraq, that ``[t]he political power of the occupiers is \n     collapsing rapidly. Soon we will see a huge power vacuum in \n     the region. Of course we are prepared to fill the gap''.\n       (8) Ambassador Crocker testified to Congress, with respect \n     to President Ahmedinejad's statement, on September 11, 2007, \n     that ``[t]he Iranian involvement in Iraq--its support for \n     extremist militias, training, connections to Lebanese \n     Hezbollah, provision of munitions that are used against our \n     force as well as the Iraqis--are all, in my view, a pretty \n     clear demonstration that Ahmedinejad means what he says, and \n     is already trying to implement it to the best of his \n     ability''.\n       (9) General Petraeus stated on September 12, 2007, with \n     respect to evidence of the complicity of Iran in the murder \n     of members of the Armed Forces of the United States in Iraq, \n     that ``[t]e evidence is very, very clear. We captured it when \n     we captured Qais Khazali, the Lebanese Hezbollah deputy \n     commander, and others, and it's in black and white . . . We \n     interrogated these individuals. We have on tape . . . Qais \n     Khazali himself. When asked, could you have done what you \n     have done without Iranian support, he literally throws up his \n     hands and laughs and says, of course not . . . So they told \n     us about the amounts of money that they have received. They \n     told us about the training that they received. They told us \n     about the ammunition and sophisticated weaponry and all of \n     that that they received''.\n       (10) General Petraeus further stated on September 14, 2007, \n     that ``[w]hat we have got is evidence. This is not \n     intelligence. This is evidence, off computers that we \n     captured, documents and so forth . . . In one case, a 22-page \n     document that lays out the planning, reconnaissance, \n     rehearsal, conduct, and aftermath of the operation conducted \n     that resulted in the death of five of our soldiers in Karbala \n     back in January''.\n       (11) The Department of Defense report to Congress entitled \n     ``Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq'' and released on \n     September 18, 2007, consistent with section 9010 of Public \n     Law 109-289, states that ``[t]here has been no decrease in \n     Iranian training and funding of illegal Shi'a militias in \n     Iraq that attack Iraqi and Coalition forces and civilians . . \n     . Tehran's support for these groups is one of the greatest \n     impediments to progress on reconciliation''.\n       (12) The Department of Defense report further states, with \n     respect to Iranian support for Shi'a extremist groups in \n     Iraq, that ``[m]ost of the explosives and ammunition used by \n     these groups are provided by the Iranian Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force . . . For the period of \n     June through the end of August, [explosively formed \n     penetrator] events are projected to rise by 39 percent over \n     the period of March through May''.\n       (13) Since May 2007, Ambassador Crocker has held three \n     rounds of talks in Baghdad on Iraq security with \n     representatives of the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran.\n       (14) Ambassador Crocker testified before Congress on \n     September 10, 2007, with respect to these talks, stating that \n     ``I laid out the concerns we had over Iranian activity that \n     was damaging to Iraq's security, but found no readiness on \n     Iranians' side at all to engage seriously on these issues. \n     The impression I came with after a couple rounds is that the \n     Iranians were interested simply in the appearance of \n     discussions, of being seen to be at the table with the U.S. \n     as an arbiter of Iraq's present and future, rather than \n     actually doing serious business . . . Right now, I haven't \n     seen any sign of earnest or seriousness on the Iranian \n     side''.\n       (15) Ambassador Crocker testified before Congress on \n     September 11, 2007, stating that ``[w]e have seen nothing on \n     the ground that would suggest that the Iranians are altering \n     what they're doing in support of extremist elements that are \n     going after our forces as well as the Iraqis''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) that the manner in which the United States transitions \n     and structures its military presence in Iraq will have \n     critical long-term consequences for the future of the Persian \n     Gulf and the Middle East, in particular with regard to the \n     capability of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     to pose a threat to the security of the region, the prospects \n     for democracy for the people of the region, and the health of \n     the global economy;\n       (2) that it is a critical national interest of the United \n     States to prevent the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran from turning Shi'a militia extremists in Iraq into a \n     Hezbollah-like force that could serve its interests inside \n     Iraq, including by overwhelming, subverting, or co-opting \n     institutions of the legitimate Government of Iraq;\n       (3) that the United States should designate Iran's Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist \n     organization under section 219 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act and place the Islamic Revolutionary Guards \n     Corps on the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, \n     as established under the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act and initiated under Executive Order 13224; and\n       (4) that the Department of the Treasury should act with all \n     possible expediency to complete the listing of those entities \n     targeted under United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     1737 and 1747 adopted unanimously on December 23, 2006 and \n     March 24, 2007, respectively.\n       Insert prior to section (6) the following:\n       (16) Ambassador Crocker further testified before Congress \n     on September 11, 2007, with respect to talks with Iran, that \n     ``I think that it's an option that we want to preserve. Our \n     first couple of rounds did not produce anything. I don't \n     think that we should either, therefore, be in a big hurry to \n     have another round, nor do I think we should say we're not \n     going to talk anymore . . . I do believe it's important to \n     keep the option for further discussion on the table.''\n       (17) Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated on September \n     16, 2007 that ``I think that the administration believes at \n     this point that continuing to try and deal with the Iranian \n     threat, the Iranian challenge, through diplomatic and \n     economic means is by far the preferable approach. That's the \n     one we are using . . . we always say all options are on the \n     table, but clearly, the diplomatic and economic approach is \n     the one that we are pursuing.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees on the Biden amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Biden will control the time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n\n\n                    Constitutional Review Commission\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have discussed with the Senator from \nDelaware modifying his amendment expressing the sense of Congress on \nFederalism in Iraq.\n  My concern with the wording of the amendment stems from the fact that \nthe Iraqi Sunnis did not participate fully in the drafting of the \nconstitution of Iraq and the Sunni community voted overwhelmingly \nagainst it but were unable to prevent its adoption in a referendum. As \na result of their dissatisfaction with the constitution, an agreement \nwas made to convene a Constitutional Review Commission to review the \nconstitution and to make recommendations for changes to the Iraqi \nCouncil of Representatives for submission to the Iraqi people. One of \nthe benchmarks that the Iraqi political leaders agreed among themselves \ncalled for the Constitutional Review Commission to be formed by \nSeptember 2006; for the Commission to complete its work by January \n2007; and for a constitutional amendments referendum to be held, if \nrequired, in March 2007.\n  The Constitutional Review Commission has not completed its work \ndespite several extensions of time; the most recent extension being \nuntil the end of this year. In recognition of the agreement to have a \nConstitutional Review Committee, the legislation establishing \nprocedures for the creation of new federal regions in Iraq will not go \ninto effect until 18 months after enactment of the legislation, which \nis April 2008.\n  Accordingly, I appreciate the modifications that Senator Biden is \nmaking to his amendment to reflect that the political settlement \nregarding federalism referred to in his amendment should be based upon \nthe ``final'' provisions of the Iraq constitution. This will allow for \nthe possibility of changes being made as a result of the work of the \nConstitutional Review Commission. I also appreciate Senator Biden's \nmodifying the amendment to note that whatever the political settlement \nis, be it pursuant to the current or revised constitutional provisions, \nit should be based on the ``wishes of the Iraqi people and their \nelected leaders'' as we don't want to suggest that we are trying to \nimpose anything on the Iraqis.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Michigan \nfor his suggestions. I believe that federalism and the creation of \nfederal regions would be in the best interest of the Iraqi people and \nholds great promise for a political settlement among the Iraqi \npolitical leadership. I know that my friend is particularly concerned \nabout the opposition of the Sunni community to the constitution. I \nagree with him that, at, the time of\n\n[[Page S12095]]\n\nadoption of the constitution, the Sunnis were opposed to many aspects \nof it including those provisions relating to federalism among others. \nBut in my last visit to Iraq, my conversations with key Sunni leaders \nreveals a sea change in thinking. There is a growing recognition by the \nSunni leadership that Sunnis will not get a fair shake if they are at \nthe mercy of a strong central government controlled by their rivals in \nthe Islamist Shiacamp. One key leader told me that he now understands \nthat federalism is the best option for the Sunnis. Nonetheless, it is \nnot my intention to forego the possibility that the Iraqi \nConstitutional Review Commission may recommend changes to their \nconstitution nor that the United States should seek to impose a \nsettlement on the Iraqis. I would note, however, at in the last draft \nproposed by the commission on May 23, 2007, none of the proposed \nchanges would revoke any of the provisions of the constitution which \npermit the creation of federal regions. However, in deference to the \nSenator's concerns, I have amended the language to account for the \npossibility of the issue of regions being reopened by the Iraqis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am checking to see if there is anybody on \nour side who wishes to speak for any amount of time.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the Biden amendment, as amended.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 75, the nays are \n23. Under the previous order, requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthe amendment, the amendment is agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3017\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3017, offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, very briefly, this amendment is a sense \nof the Senate introduced by Senator Kyl and me. The findings document \nthe evidence that shows that Iran, working through its Islamic \nRevolutionary Guard Corps, has been training and equipping Iraqi \nextremists who are killing American soldiers--hundreds of them.\n  This sense of the Senate calls on the administration to designate the \nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, allowing \nus to exert economic pressure on those terrorists who also do business \nand to stop them from killing Americans.\n  Because some of our colleagues thought paragraphs 3 and 4 of the \nsense of the Senate may have opened the door to some kind of military \naction against Iran, Senator Kyl and I have struck them from the \namendment. That is not our intention. In fact, our intention is to \nincrease the economic pressure on Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary \nGuard Corps so that we will never have to consider the use of the \nmilitary to stop them from what they are doing to kill our soldiers.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will oppose the Kyl-Lieberman amendment \nfor one simple reason: this administration cannot be trusted.\n  I am very concerned about the evidence that suggests that Iran is \nengaged in destabilizing activities inside Iraq. I believe that many of \nthe steps the Senators from Connecticut and Arizona suggest be taken to \nend this activity can be taken today. We can and we should move to act \nagainst Iranian forces inside Iraq. We can and we should use economic \npressure against those who aid and abet attacks on our forces and \nagainst Iraqis. The administration already has the authority to do \nthese things and it should be doing them.\n  Arguably, if we had a different President who abided by the meaning \nand intent of laws we pass, I might support this amendment. I fear, \nhowever, that this President might use the designation of Iran's \nRevolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist entity as a pretext to use \nforce against Iran as he sees fit. While this may sound far-fetched to \nsome, my colleagues should examine the record in two particular \ninstances.\n  First, is the misuse of the authority that we granted the President \nin 2002 to back our diplomacy with the threat of force. My colleagues \nwill remember that, at the time, we voted to give the President a \nstrong hand to play at the U.N. to get the world to speak with one \nvoice to Saddam: let the inspectors back in and disarm or be disarmed. \nWe thought that would make war less likely.\n  But in the 5 months between our vote and the invasion of Iraq, the \nideologues took over. The President went to war unnecessarily, without \nletting the weapons inspectors finish their work, without a real \ncoalition, without enough troops, without the right equipment, and \nwithout a plan to secure the peace.\n  The second example is the administration's twisting of our vote on \nthe Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 as an endorsement of military action \nagainst Iraq. Let me quote the Vice President from November 2005:\n\n       Permit me to burden you with a bit more history: In August \n     of 1998, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution urging \n     President Clinton take `appropriate action' to compel Saddam \n     to come into compliance with his obligations to the Security \n     Council. Not a single senator voted no. Two months later, in \n     October of '98--again, without a single dissenting vote in \n     the United States Senate--the Congress passed the Iraq \n     Liberation Act. It explicitly adopted as American policy \n     supporting efforts to remove Saddam Hussein's regime from \n     power and promoting an Iraqi democracy in its place. And just \n     two months after signing the Iraq Liberation law, President \n     Clinton ordered that Iraq be bombed in an effort to destroy \n     facilities that he believed were connected to Saddam's \n     weapons of mass destruction programs.\n\n  The Vice President made this argument despite this explicit section \nof the Iraq Liberation Act: ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \nauthorize or otherwise speak to the use of United States Armed \nForces.''\n  These examples are relevant to the debate today.\n  The Authorization for the Use of Military Force approved in September \n2001 would appear to limit the scope of authority it contains to the \nterrorists who conducted or aided the attacks of 9/11, or harbored \nthem. But the President and his lawyers have frequently argued for a \nbroad reading of this law,\n\n[[Page S12096]]\n\nand believe they are fighting a ``global'' war on terrorism. In letters \nto Congress under the war powers resolution, the President has stated \nthat he will ``direct additional measures as necessary'' in the \nexercise of self-defense and ``to protect U.S. citizens and interests'' \nas part of this global war.\n  I do not think the suggestion that the President designate an arm of \nthe government of Iran as a ``terrorist'' entity provides any authority \nto do anything. After all, it is a nonbinding measure. But this \nadministration already has an unduly broad view of the scope of \nexecutive power, particularly in time of war. I do not want to give the \nPresident and his lawyers any argument that Congress has somehow \nauthorized military actions. The lesson of the last several years is \nthat we must be cautious about acting impulsively on legislation which \ncan be misconstrued, and misused to justify actions that Congress did \nnot contemplate.\n  With a different President who had a different track record, I could \nvote to support this amendment. But given this President's actions and \nmisuse of authority, I cannot support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I have grave concerns about this amendment. \nI spoke at length on the floor yesterday about them. We have never \ncharacterized an entity of a foreign government as a foreign terrorist \norganization. If we are saying that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is \nconducting terrorist activities, what we are saying, in effect, is that \nthe Revolutionary Guard is conducting military activities against us. \nThis has the danger of becoming a de facto authorization for military \nforce against Iran.\n  We have not had one hearing. I recommended yesterday that the \namendment be withdrawn so we can consider it in the appropriate \ncommittees. I oppose passage at this time in the hope that we can get \nfurther discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, today we have an important opportunity \nto do some good-government. It is so hard in the context of the \nconflict in Iraq to get beyond some of the political posturing that \nhas, frankly, been inevitable. As campaigns have occurred, and we have \ncampaigns looming next year, there has been a tendency for this body to \nseparate at the middle and not find common ground.\n  We have an opportunity this afternoon to find common ground, and my \njob over the next few minutes is to try to convince my colleagues that \nthis attempt to create a War Contracting Commission is not about \npolitics, it is about reform.\n  It would be hard not to notice the scandals that have occurred in \nrelationship to war contracting. I come to this as a student of history \nand a huge fan of Harry Truman. I am honored to stand at his desk as I \nspeak today. I am honored to follow in his tradition when he said: War \nprofiteering is unacceptable, especially when you realize it is \nskimming away and denying the men and women who are fighting resources.\n  In a very modest fashion, at a time that he, frankly, was not \nsupporting his President, who was of his party, he was saying to the \nPresident: We need to do some reform here, even though the President \nwas a Democrat, just as he was, and he began looking at war \nprofiteering. Frankly, that is where Harry Truman first made his mark \nin the history books of this country. It was because he realized this \nwas so much bigger than being a Democrat or Republican; it was about \nhow we behave when we place men and women in danger on behalf of our \nNation. In that vein, this amendment is going to try to take the \npolitics out of the issue of war contracting and try to make things \nbetter. Let me first summarize what the amendment is going to do.\n  It will establish an independent and bipartisan eight-member \nCommission--bipartisan eight-member Commission, four Republicans and \nfour Democrats. They will study and investigate Federal agency \ncontracting for reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, Federal funding \nand contracting for the logistical support of coalition forces in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, Federal contracting for the performance of security \nand intelligence functions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and will expand the \nspecial inspector general's role to include the responsibility of \nlogistical support and security and intelligence functions.\n  Currently, the special inspector general, Stuart Bowen, only has \njurisdiction over reconstruction funds in Iraq. Clearly, frankly, as I \nmet with contracting officials on my trip to Iraq and Kuwait, where I \nspent most of my time talking to the people who have taken \nresponsibility for issuing these contracts and monitoring these \ncontracts, as I talked to all of them, I mean at every meeting I kind \nof just went: Oh, my gosh, this is so bad--except when I met with the \nSIGIR.\n  When I met with the people who worked for the special inspector \ngeneral, I was so comforted as an auditor. These were professional \nauditors, and they were on top of it. They were identifying the \nproblem, they saw the shortcomings, whether they were in the way \ncontracts were distributed or let or, frankly, not competed or whether \nthey were in the monitoring of those contracts, the definitization of \nthose contracts, the oversight of those contracts, or the way we \nactually pay bonuses on some of those contracts. All of those issues \nhave been looked at by the SIGIR. They have been limited because their \njurisdiction was limited. This will expand their jurisdiction and, most \nimportantly, efficiently, it partners them with the Commission. So we\n\n[[Page S12099]]\n\ndo not have to hire a huge staff for this Commission; they can utilize \nthe work of SIGIR, the work of the Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction, to come to conclusions about how we can do better.\n  Honestly and sincerely--I know Senator Webb and I have talked about \nthis at great length--this is not about ``gotcha,'' this is about \nturning the corner, because, let's be honest, will there ever be a time \nwhere we are not contracting at this kind of level? Will we ever go \nback to a time when we have Active military peeling potatoes and \ncleaning latrines? Will we ever go back to a time where we have Active \nmilitary driving all of the supply trucks? Will we ever go back to a \ntime where we have Active military providing all of the security needs? \nI am not sure we will because our struggle is to maintain a Volunteer \nmilitary but provide them all the support they need in terms of \nlogistics.\n  Frankly, there are some efficiencies that could be gained if we were \ncontracting in a way that took care of the taxpayer dollars. I do not \nargue that contracting might be necessary--in fact, better in some \ninstances--but not the way we are doing it now.\n  Now, you say: Well, there are a lot of people looking at this. That \nmay be true. There have been a lot of journalists who have looked at \nit. We have certainly had various parts of the Department of Defense \nand the military, various inspectors general, and we certainly have \nSIGIR. But let me just point out one thing. As one of the generals said \nto me when I was in Iraq, sheepishly: You know, everything you are \nseeing in terms of mistakes that have been made, most of them were made \nin Bosnia. And by the way, there was a lesson learned after Bosnia, \nexcept there was one problem: They forgot to learn the lesson.\n  So if we are going to elevate this problem to where we really \nacknowledge that it is systemic, it is overarching, and it is \ninteragency, what do we have if we do a congressional hearing? Well, \nfirst of all, we are going to have a committee that has more Democrats \nthan Republicans on it, so we have at the very outset the allegation \nthat it is political. We also have battling turf. Is it Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs? Is it Armed Services? Is it Foreign \nRelations? Because all of the problems swirl around all of those \ncommittees. How do we get above the interagency issue if we do not have \nthis kind of commission?\n  The makeup of the Commission would be as follows: eight people--two \npeople appointed by the majority leader in the Senate, two people \nappointed by the Speaker in the House, one person appointed by the \nminority leader in the Senate, one person appointed by the minority \nleader in the House--that gets you to six--and then one person \nappointed by the President of the United States and one person \nappointed by Secretary Gates at the Department of Defense.\n  Now, are we going to have a long bureaucratic commission that just \ndoes a lot of testimony and we do not get to the end? No. They must \nfinish their work within 2 years. And they must, as I mentioned before, \npartner with the SIGIR, partner with the Special Inspector General of \nIraq Reconstruction, in a way that they can efficiently take the work \nthat has been done by a number of different agencies and a number of \ndifferent oversight entities, a number of different auditors and bring \nit together and identify how do we, in a contingency, contract in a way \nthat takes care of taxpayers' money?\n\n  Now, we have an election coming up. I have to tell you, I have talked \nto a couple of my friends across the aisle, and I am concerned about \nthe vote on this amendment because there is a knee-jerk reaction. If we \nare talking about war contracting, this is political. This is a \npolitical witch hunt. It is the D's versus the R's. Let me say that I \ndo not think they have taken time to look at how bipartisan this is \nbecause if they did, I think it would assure them that this is not an \nattempt to do this. We have to fix this, and we have to fix it as \nquickly as possible. It has to do the work within 2 years.\n  We have modified the amendment to reassure my friends across the \naisle that, first of all, if one of the President's appointments or if \none of the other appointments who would represent the Republican Party \non this Commission were to quit or for some reason not be able to \ncontinue to serve, someone of the same party must be appointed. So we \nare never going to get to a situation if we have a new President that \nthe new President could say: I am going to appoint two. If the new \nPresident were a Democrat, you would end up with six to two.\n  The other thing that is important to remember is we have modified the \namendment so the report of this Commission will come out after next \nyear's election, January of 2009. What a great way to start a new \nCongress and a new Presidential term. The new President and the new \nCongress can look at these recommendations--very similar to the 9/11 \nCommission, very similar to the Baker-Hamilton Commission--and realize \nthere are systemic institutional problems with the way we have been \ncontacting and get it fixed.\n  I have met with the special inspector general for Iraq, Mr. Bowen, \nand he has indicated his support for this approach. This is not about \nin any way diminishing the role of the special inspector general for \nIraq--just the opposite. It is going to give the special inspector \ngeneral a voice that is above the political din in order to issue \nrecommendations. They are going to have their capping report ready next \nMarch. That will be a great starting point for this Commission, to look \nat SIGIR's capping report of all of their work on Iraq reconstruction.\n  Let me give you a list of some of the groups that have supported this \namendment, and we have had many, many groups that have come to the \nsupport of this.\n  First, the Project on Government Oversight is very strongly in favor \nof it. POGO particularly supports the independent and bipartisan nature \nof this Commission and the recommended collaboration and consultation \nwith the special inspector general and the expansion of the role of the \nspecial inspector general.\n  OMB Watch, a Government transparency, fiscal policy, and regulatory \nwatchdog nonprofit, wants to applaud the Commission on War Contracting \nEstablishment Act; that is, in fact, this amendment.\n  The Government Accountability Project also has indicated their \nsupport.\n  The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America have indicated their \nsupport.\n  The Taxpayers for Common Sense has weighed in with their strong \nsupport of this amendment.\n  The Federation of State PIRGs, public interest research groups, has \nweighed in with their support also, and Common Cause has indicated this \nis a good government, bipartisan way to fix a serious problem. I may \nreturn later to talk about some of the scandals. There have been many, \nmany scandals. Some of them are heartbreaking. Some of them make you \nwant to tear your hair out; whether it is the way some of the \nwhistleblowers have been treated, whether it is contracts that have \nballooned out of control, whether it is paying bonuses to companies \nthat haven't done their work, $200 million in bonuses to companies that \nhave not done their work. We obviously have issues with the security \ncompany Blackwater and who has authority over them and to whom are they \naccountable when they take action in the war zone. It is heartbreaking \nthat some in our active military--unfortunately, more than a few--have \nbeen charged and pled guilty to actually taking bribes, tens of \nmillions of dollars in their pocket. The Department of State IG, there \nare problems with whether the investigations have been conducted.\n  Whether you agree that the investigations have occurred in the State \nDepartment or they have not, why not do a bipartisan commission that \nwill look at this fairly under the light of transparency and good \ngovernment, without the cloud of politics and accusations by one \npolitical party or another?\n  I am especially proud of the fact that this is an amendment that was \ncosponsored by the nine freshmen Democrats who arrived here in January. \nWe, frankly, probably are not as well versed or schooled in some of the \nturf fights that occur between committees. It will be a long time \nbefore any of us need to worry about whether our committee, as chairman \nor ranking member, has the ability to have a hearing. We look at it \nwith the eyes of the general public. We come here fresh from\n\n[[Page S12100]]\n\nspeaking with thousands and thousands of people we represent. We hear \ntheir frustration that billions of dollars have been lost, tens upon \nmillions of dollars have been stolen, and an incredible amount of money \nwasted in the name of contracting. We also have 20 cosponsors on this \namendment which we believe is very important. I welcome the support.\n  I do emphasize that we can behave today like people probably expect. \nWe can have a 50-50 vote, and the American public is going to sit back, \nif we have a 50-50 vote, and they are going to say: What in the name is \ngoing on? How do you get a 50-50 vote on an effort, with four \nRepublicans and four Democrats, to get a handle on war contracting? How \ndoes that happen? We all sit around and talk--I know the Republicans \ntalk about it; we talk about it--about our approval ratings and why our \napproval ratings are not higher. This is our chance. This is our chance \nto say to the American public: We are spending your money wisely, \nmaking sure the men and women who fight get the armor they need and the \nMRAPs they need on their humvees, instead of billions being wasted on \nwar profiteering. This is our chance to show them we can come together \nand overcome the politics of this place for the good of our national \nsecurity and the strength of our military.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to add to the comments made by \nmy colleague from Missouri about the Truman Commission follow-on that \nwe have jointly introduced, along with other freshmen Members on the \nDemocratic side, the Independent side, and with a total of 27 \ncosponsors as of this morning.\n  I don't think there is a more important or volatile issue, in terms \nof Government accountability, than the issue of the expenditures that \nhave gone into Iraq and Afghanistan and the accountability of not only \ncontractors but of the quasi-military forces operating there. We have \nput a great deal of effort into designing a wartime commission that was \ninspired by the Truman Commission in World War II but has its own \nuniqueness, given the issues of today. I am very proud to be one of the \noriginal sponsors on this amendment. I hope Members on both sides of \nthe aisle can support it.\n  We are attempting, in a fair way, with experts in the field--not \nsimply a group of Senators forming a panel, bringing in experts from \nthe areas, experts in competence from the areas they would be looking \nat in a short period of time, 2 years--to examine the amounts of money \nthat have been spent, where this money has gone, to try to bring some \naccountability into the system and to make their reports, in some cases \nwith legal accountability, and then to wrap it up and go home. This is \nnot an attempt to create a permanent standing organization but, rather, \none that can come in with the right people, take a look at what went \nwrong, make a report to the American people and, in some cases, give \nthem their money back, since all of these now nearly a trillion dollars \nhave been spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without a lot of \naccountability--that is taxpayer money--to try to find out how it was \nspent.\n  In most cases, it has been spent properly. But in those cases where \nit has not, we want to get people their money back and get \naccountability to the people who did not spend it back. This is about \nimproved transparency. It would be forward looking in terms of looking \nat systemic problems and attempting to address them.\n  It is more than that. This amendment is supported by nearly every \nmajor taxpayer watchdog group. We are now, with the present state of \nthe Department of Defense and of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \noutsourcing war in ways that we have never seen before in our history. \nHundreds of billions of dollars have been allocated for reconstruction \nand for wartime support, creating a strong potential for fraud, waste, \nand abuse. This commission will ensure financial accountability in \nthose areas where there has been fraud, waste, and abuse with \nprovisions that allow for legal accountability in cases of wrongdoing.\n  It also will look at such organizations as Blackwater, which has \nrecently been in the news for the alleged series of wrongful killings \nof Iraqis and excessive use of force. This is an area that has slid \npast us as a representative government which is a cause for great \nconcern for anyone who has been involved in national security affairs \nover the years. We now have in Iraq 180,000 contractors working in a \nwar where there are 160,000 troops. They are doing a whole panorama of \nchores that traditionally have been done by military people, all the \nway from operating the mess halls to providing security for even, on \nsome occasions, General Petraeus himself. There is no accountability, \nnone, in terms of legal accountability for actions that have been taken \nthat result in inappropriate use of force and, in some cases, wrongful \ndeaths of people in the area. This committee would help address that.\n\n  We are also looking at basic contractor accountability. As one \nexample, not long ago the Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction reported that of the $32 billion at that time that had \nbeen spent on reconstruction and relief funds--this is State Department \nprograms--$9 billion was unaccounted for. We need desperately to have \nan independent, fair, objective analysis of what has happened, what is \nhappening, not only for accountability but also to help us design a \nstructure for the future. Again, we are not trying to create a new \nbureaucracy. The commission will rely on the inspectors general in \nagencies that already exist for most of the analysis. We are sunsetting \nthe provision at 2 years. We are very comfortable with SIGIR's \nexcellent performance in uncovering waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq of \nreconstruction projects. We believe that is proof of the ability to do \nthis on a more comprehensive and thorough level.\n  I strongly urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to lay \naside political differences and come together with the reality that all \nof us have an obligation to put accountability into the system for the \nAmerican people and, in some cases, to give people back the money they \nspend in tax dollars for programs that were wrongfully carried out or, \nin some cases, not carried out at all.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2196\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have an amendment pending. This is a \nstraightforward amendment. Over the last 10 years, we have spent a \nhalf-billion dollars of Defense Department money on a program run by \nthe Justice Department that has achieved probably the least of any \nprogram in the entire budget of the Department. This is the National \nDrug Intelligence Center. It came into being initially through directed \nspending on a Defense appropriations bill. The reason for adding this \namendment to the authorization bill is to preclude any further money on \nspending on this intelligence center and only allowing money to shut it \ndown and have it consolidated with other intelligence centers.\n  If we think about what $500 million could be doing for us now in the \nDefense Department in the true defense of our Nation and then look at \nthe history of this center, this isn't about trying to direct things \nagainst any group of people or any Congressman or Senator. It is about \nthe commonsense view that we ought to be spending money in a \nprioritized way that gets us results.\n\n  By any measure--anyone's measure--including the Justice Department, \nall the other national drug intelligence centers--all of the others--\nthe former directors of this intelligence center, and the directors of \nothers, this intelligence center has been looking for a mission and has \naccomplished very little.\n\n[[Page S12101]]\n\n  Of the two things they have accomplished, one is highly expensive and \nnot accurate. The other is the investigation of intelligence \ninformation captures on drugs and could be well done at any other \nfacility we have.\n  The Department of Justice believes the drug center's operations are \nduplicative and reassigning their responsibilities would improve the \nmanagement of counterdrug intelligence activities and would allow for \nfunds to be spent on the additional hiring of more drug enforcement \nofficers. So we are going to have anywhere from $30 million to $40 \nmillion a year continued to be spent on this center. What this simply \nis, in the authorization, is a prohibition that we will not do this.\n  When the Department of Justice, which is charged with running this \ncenter, says it does not work, it is not effective, it is not \naccomplished, and should be consolidated, we have to ask the question: \nWhy does it continue? It continues through the force of directed \nspending in the Defense appropriations bill.\n  Now, how is it we have drug enforcement funded through the Defense \nDepartment to give the money to the Department of Justice to run a \nprogram they say is ineffectual? The whole purpose for this amendment \nis to not castigate anyone but to say: Shouldn't we be spending the \nmoney more wisely? Shouldn't we be accomplishing, with that $500 \nmillion we already spent, something of value to the American taxpayer \nrather than something not of value?\n  This amendment would protect Defense dollars from being misspent and \nimprove the management of our counterdrug intelligence efforts by \neliminating the wasteful spending. It would also direct the necessary \nfunds to close the NDIC. It also would say any activities that might be \nperformed by the center that are deemed necessary, which are minimal--\nlet me emphasize that again: minimal in terms of all the experts we \nhave throughout the rest of the Government--that they would, in fact, \nbe transferred to the appropriate agencies.\n  In 2002, this intelligence center received $42 million--$39 million, \n$44 million, $39 million, $38 million, $39 million--for a total of $509 \nmillion since its inception. It is duplicative, it is unnecessary, and \nit is unworkable.\n  Even the former director said: Most of the time the work was shoddy, \nof poor quality, and quite often wrong. This is the same director who \nis no longer there--a Mr. Horn--who was admonished by the Department of \nJustice for his excessive spending while he was there, on travel, on \ninternational things that had nothing to do with the NDIC's goals or \ndirection.\n  Mr. President, there have been numerous articles written, two of \nwhich I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, one being \na complete dossier on this agency from US News & World Report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the U.S. News & World Report, May 9, 2005]\n\n                         A Drug War Boondoggle\n\n                           (By Bret Schulte)\n\n\n the white house wants to kill it, but a little government agency may \n                           manage to live on\n\n       It merits only the briefest of mentions in the president's \n     new budget, but those few lines of type could represent the \n     final chapter in a long and twisted Washington saga. Stashed \n     away on Page 1,181 is a paragraph that would effectively kill \n     the little-known National Drug Intelligence Center, located \n     in Johnstown, Pa., the site of the famous flood of 1889. \n     Bush's budget proposes that the center's $40 million annual \n     budget be slashed to $17 million--just enough to facilitate \n     ``the shutdown of the center and transfer of its \n     responsibilities. . . to other Department of Justice \n     elements.''\n       If President Bush has his way, the center would be one of \n     154 programs eliminated or cut as part of his promise to curb \n     federal spending. But as any veteran of Washington's budget \n     wars will tell you, closing even a single federal program can \n     be a herculean task. Perhaps no example is more illuminating \n     than the NDIC, which, in its 12 years, has cost taxpayers at \n     least $350 million. The facility has run through six \n     directors, been rocked by scandal, and been subjected to \n     persistent criticisms that it should have never been created \n     at all.\n       Pork? In the beginning, the Johnstown center did have some \n     friends in the White House. With the blessing of President \n     George Herbert Walker Bush, then drug czar William Bennett \n     proposed the creation of the NDIC in 1990. Its mission: to \n     collect and coordinate intelligence from often-feuding law \n     enforcement agencies in order to provide a strategic look at \n     the war on drugs. But the Drug Enforcement Administration, \n     worried that its pre-eminent role in the drug war was \n     slipping away, openly fought the idea. So did many on Capitol \n     Hill, arguing that the new center would duplicate the efforts \n     of existing intelligence centers, notably the El Paso \n     Intelligence Center, operated by the DEA. With little support \n     in the law enforcement community, the NDIC looked all but \n     dead. Enter Congressman John Murtha. The Pennsylvania \n     Democrat, who chaired the House Appropriations Subcommittee \n     for Defense, tucked the enabling legislation for the center \n     into a Pentagon authorization bill, with the caveat that it \n     would be placed in his district.\n       The center was troubled from the start. Murtha's new drug \n     agency was funded by the Pentagon, but the Department of \n     Justice was authorized to run it--an arrangement bound to \n     cause problems. ``All of us wanted the NDIC,'' says John \n     Carnevale, a former official with the Office of National Drug \n     Control Policy, as the drug czar's office is known. ``But \n     none of us wanted it in Johnstown. We viewed it as a jobs \n     program that Mr. Murtha wanted [for his district].''\n       Murtha bristles at implications that the Johnstown center \n     is a boondoggle. ``They say anything we do is pork barrel,'' \n     he fumes. The congressman argues that the federal government \n     should spread its facilities around the country, citing the \n     security risk of a centralized government and cheaper \n     operating costs elsewhere. But ``obviously,'' he says, ``I \n     wanted it in my district. I make no apologies for that.''\n       Headquartered in a renovated department store downtown, the \n     center has brought nearly 400 federal jobs to Johnstown, a \n     struggling former steel-mill town. Law enforcement agencies, \n     ordered to send employees to the new center, had trouble \n     finding skilled analysts or executives who would agree to \n     live in Johnstown. Even the bosses didn't want to go. The \n     first director, former FBI official Doug Ball, traveled back \n     and forth from his home near Washington. His deputy, former \n     DEA agent Jim Milford, did the same and made no bones about \n     it. ``I've never come to terms,'' Milford says, ``with the \n     justification for the NDIC.''\n       In 1993, when the NDIC officially opened, the congressional \n     General Accounting Office issued a damning report citing \n     duplication among 19 drug intelligence centers that already \n     existed. And many involved in the process said the idea of \n     gathering information from other law enforcement agencies for \n     strategic assessments on drug trafficking just wasn't \n     workable. In some cases, federal law prevented agencies from \n     sharing sensitive intelligence; in others, rival agencies \n     simply refused to give up proprietary information. ``The \n     bottom line,'' Milford said, ``was that we had to actually \n     search for a mission.''\n       Stonewalled, the NDIC began operating, effectively, as an \n     extended staff for other drug agencies, working on projects \n     too cumbersome, peripheral, or time-consuming for their own \n     teams of intelligence analysts. The center was costing about \n     $30 million a year, but, as a former official of the drug \n     czar's office put it bluntly, ``we saw nothing'' from it.\n       Former DEA official Dick Canas, who took over the NDIC in \n     1996--one of the few bosses who actually moved to Johnstown--\n     was determined to elevate the facility's status. He began \n     collating and analyzing ``open-source information''--\n     intelligence already available to the public--and pulling it \n     all together in one place. The plan was ``nonthreatening'' to \n     other agencies, Canas argued, and would at least provide \n     policymakers with a general overview of the war on drugs. \n     That project morphed into an annual report called the \n     National Drug Threat Assessment, which officials say is of \n     some real value.\n       The Johnstown center racked up one other success. Its \n     ``document exploitation'' program regularly dispatched \n     analysts into the field to process files seized by other law-\n     enforcement agencies using software it developed called RAID \n     (real-time analytical intelligence database). Johnstown \n     analysts used the software to organize data and help law \n     enforcement agencies develop investigative leads.\n       Cronyism? In 2000, the Clinton administration tried to \n     define the center's role more sharply by releasing the \n     General Counterdrug Intelligence Plan, which restricted the \n     reach of the Johnstown center to domestic intelligence only. \n     Canas, gone by 1999, was replaced by another DEA executive, \n     Mike Horn, who was the fifth interim or permanent director in \n     six years; Horn kept an apartment in Johnstown but traveled \n     back to a home in the Washington area on weekends.\n       Horn's tenure made everything that came before it seem \n     placid. Despite the NDIC's domestic mandate, Horn and his \n     assistant, Mary Lou Rodgers, made frequent trips abroad to \n     promote a new version of the RAID software in places like \n     Hong Kong, London, and Vienna, racking up nearly $164,000 in \n     travel expenses in less than four years. A Justice Department \n     investigation in 2003 admonished Horn for ``unprofessional \n     conduct in. . . dealings with Ms. Rodgers,'' but that wasn't \n     the end of it. A letter-writing campaign by NDIC employees \n     accused Horn of continued travel abuse and cronyism, \n     prompting another review by Justice lawyers last year. It was \n     also discovered that the new\n\n[[Page S12102]]\n\n     version of the RAID software promoted by Horn had yet to be \n     developed. Many NDIC insiders say morale was poor.\n       In March 2004, Associate Deputy Attorney General David \n     Margolis suspended Horn's power to authorize travel for \n     Rodgers. In June 2004, Margolis fired Horn. The Justice \n     Department won't comment on the matter. Horn claims all \n     travel was approved and says he has not been made to pay \n     restitution. Horn blames the low morale on malcontents who \n     resented the quality of work he demanded. ``I recognized that \n     a lot of reports were God-awful, poorly written, poorly \n     researched, and, in some cases, wrong,'' he says. Some \n     insiders say that under Horn, the center got as close as it \n     ever would to producing some truly strategic intelligence \n     reports. Not surprisingly, in light of the morale and other \n     problems, others disagree.\n       Either way, the White House appears to have had it with the \n     NDIC. In its budget report, the Office of Management and \n     Budget says ``the proliferation of intelligence centers \n     across the government has not necessarily led to more or \n     better intelligence, but rather more complications in the \n     management of information.'' For the Johnstown center, it's \n     an ironic coda, then, that the White House is simultaneously \n     supporting a new program--the multiagency Drug Intelligence \n     Fusion Center. Blessed by the DEA, the fusion center will be \n     located in the Washington area. It has already received $25 \n     million from Congress in start-up costs and is slated to open \n     its doors later this year. The idea that a different agency \n     can do the job the NDIC failed to do has left some shaking \n     their heads. ``You have to ask, `What is the master plan?' '' \n     said a former official in the office of the drug czar. ``The \n     answer is there is no master plan.'' Proponents say the new \n     agency will succeed because its location makes sense.\n       That doesn't mean the NDIC is finished. It has supporters \n     in state and local law enforcement, and even some federal \n     officials have come to respect its document exploitation \n     division. The NDIC's biggest supporter, though, is Murtha. \n     ``I can assure employees that the NDIC won't be closed,'' he \n     said in a public statement after Bush's budget was released. \n     While Murtha is no longer chair of the House Appropriations \n     Subcommittee on Defense, he remains the ranking Democrat and \n     a backroom dealer with few equals. In the Senate, \n     Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter will fight to keep the \n     center open from his seat on the Appropriations Committee. \n     The showdown could come as soon as next month, when \n     appropriations subcommittees begin tackling the budget.\n       To paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of Johnstown center's \n     death may be premature. ``Barring another flood,'' says a \n     former law-enforcement official, ``I doubty you'll see it go \n     anywhere.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Centre Daily News, Sat., June 30, 2007]\n\n      Official: Disputed Pa. Facility Plays Vital Part in Drug War\n\n                          (By Daniel Lovering)\n\n       For years, the National Drug Intelligence Center has \n     operated quietly on the upper floors of a former department \n     store, with scores of employees authorized at the highest \n     levels of government security.\n       But the Justice Department facility, which blends into the \n     landscape of this once-thriving mill town 60 miles east of \n     Pittsburgh, has long caught the attention of critics in \n     Washington.\n       Watchdog groups and lawmakers have blasted it as a pet \n     project of U.S. Rep. John Murtha, whose special funding \n     requests--or earmarks--have sustained the center since it \n     opened in his home district in the early 1990s.\n       It has been derided as a product of pork barrel spending \n     and an unnecessary outgrowth of the war on drugs that \n     duplicates work done elsewhere. The Bush administration has \n     tried to close it, requesting millions to cover shutdown \n     costs.\n       The latest salvo came last month, when Rep. Mike Rogers, R-\n     Mich., tried to remove an earmark for the center, drawing \n     Murtha's ire.\n       But the NDIC has persisted, despite lingering questions \n     about its effectiveness in coordinating the efforts of \n     federal authorities to collect and analyze intelligence on \n     the domestic trafficking of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine \n     and other drugs.\n       Acting director Irene S. Hernandez insists the center plays \n     a critical and unique role in the nation's anti-drug effort, \n     and that its mission has evolved from an initial focus on \n     trafficking syndicates to its current emphasis on broad \n     trends.\n       ``We can do an independent assessment of the drug \n     trafficking situation, and we can say this is what's \n     happening,'' Hernandez told The Associated Press in an \n     exclusive interview. ``There's nobody else positioned to do \n     what we do.''\n       She said the center differs from other agencies, which may \n     be preoccupied with tactical operations, and informs policy \n     makers.\n       Over the years, directors have come and gone, in one case \n     under a cloud of scandal. The current director, Michael F. \n     Walther, an army reservist and former federal prosecutor, is \n     currently serving in Iraq.\n       The center's funding has been precarious--a factor that has \n     impeded hiring efforts, officials say. With a budget of $39 \n     million annually, the center's survival again appears \n     uncertain as a spending bill moves through Congress.\n       The NDIC conducts what it calls strategic assessments of \n     illicit drug trends. It analyzes evidence for federal \n     investigators and prosecutors, gathers intelligence, trains \n     law enforcement officers and produces a raft of reports. Some \n     of its work is classified.\n       Its 268 employees have top secret security clearance and \n     include 121 intelligence analysts with backgrounds as diverse \n     as real estate, chemistry, banking and law. It also uses \n     contractors, some of whom are retired federal agents. In \n     their midst are a small number of analysts from the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration and other agencies.\n       Hernandez, who joined the agency in 2004 after a 27-year \n     DEA career, points to the center's ability to cull \n     information from seized evidence--including ledgers, phone \n     and real estate records, computers and cell phones--and \n     funnel that data to investigators and prosecutors, helping \n     them build cases against suspects. The center has developed \n     its own software, including a program currently used by U.S. \n     military investigators in Iraq.\n       It works with a broad range of law enforcement agencies, \n     from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the Internal \n     Revenue Service, and supports the National Counter terrorism \n     Center's efforts to sever ties between drug traffickers and \n     terrorists.\n       The NDIC assisted in an operation that led to the arrest of \n     one of the world's most hunted drug traffickers, Pablo Rayo \n     Montano, and helped detect growing abuse of the painkiller \n     OxyContin, officials said.\n       Its marquee report, the National Drug Threat Assessment, \n     charts patterns of drug production, availability and demand. \n     Some law enforcement officials and academics praise the \n     report, but former drug officials question its value as a \n     policy instrument.\n       Gary L. Fisher, a professor at the University of Nevada-\n     Reno, called the report objective and independent. ``It \n     really accurately reflects how futile the (drug) supply \n     control efforts have been,'' he said. ``You'll find the DEA \n     reports are much more biased to fit their agenda.''\n       Another professor, Matthew B. Robinson of North Carolina's \n     Appalachian State University, said he and a colleague used \n     the report to challenge assertions by the Office of National \n     Drug Control Policy, the White House agency responsible for \n     the drug war.\n       The data showed illicit drugs are cheaper and purer today \n     than they were in the 1980s and 1990s, said Robinson, co-\n     author of ``Lies, Damned Lies, and Drug War Statistics: A \n     Critical Analysis of Claims Made by the Office of National \n     Drug Control Policy.'' Some local law enforcement officials \n     lauded the reports, saying they circulated them among their \n     analysts.\n       But John Carnevale, a former ONDCP official who worked \n     under three administrations and four drug czars, said the \n     center's work was of no value to him when he was in \n     government, though he has since used its reports.\n       ``I had access to the data well before they did,'' said \n     Carnevale, now a Maryland-based consultant. ``So I pretty \n     much ignored them.''\n       Eric Sterling, president of the Criminal Justice Policy \n     Foundation, an advocacy group based in Maryland, said: ``In \n     many respects it seems that their stuff is out of date. . . . \n     I would describe it as a tool of limited value.''\n       Critics have also questioned the center's location 140 \n     miles from Washington, citing political maneuvering by \n     Murtha.\n       ``I know what their capabilities are, I know what they can \n     do, but that didn't need to go to Johnstown, Pennsylvania,'' \n     said James Mavromatis, a former director of the El Paso \n     Intelligence Center, a Texas-based DEA agency.\n       He said the center could have been housed at the El Paso \n     facility, closer to the U.S. border with Mexico, where most \n     illicit drugs enter the country. The NDIC had considered \n     moving a team there, he said.\n       The NDIC's document analysis differs completely from EPIC's \n     work, he added, despite criticism they overlap completely.\n       NDIC officials and others contend that the center's \n     Johnstown address is hardly a hindrance. It may be an asset, \n     they say, as its low cost of living appeals to job \n     candidates.\n       Asa Hutchinson, a former DEA head and a former Republican \n     congressman, said he was ``a fan of folks performing \n     important government services, and not necessarily in \n     Washington.'' But he conceded the center may need \n     adjustments.\n       ``I think it is underutilized,'' he said. ``I think they \n     can expand their mission, and I think that should be \n     examined.''\n       An activist group, Citizens Against Government Waste, \n     recently chided Murtha for threatening fellow congressman \n     Rogers with legislative reprisals after Rogers tried to \n     strike a $23 million earmark for the center.\n       ``We're not saying there shouldn't be an NDIC,'' said David \n     Williams, the group's vice president for policy. ``What we're \n     saying is, why should one member of Congress be able to set \n     up a field office like this?''\n       Rogers said he believed the El Paso center was supposed to \n     be the main drug intelligence agency.\n       ``I strongly believe it is not a good use of very valuable \n     intelligence resources,'' he told The Associated Press, \n     adding that $23 million amounted to the salaries of hundreds \n     of DEA agents.\n       The Bush administration evidently agrees. Sean Kevelighan, \n     a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, said the \n     center has ``been slow to delineate a unique or useful role \n     within the drug intelligence community.''\n       For that reason, the OMB's 2008 budget request ``fully \n     funds all shutdown costs'' of about $16 million he said.\n\n\n[[Page S12103]]\n\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I quote from the Centre Daily News of this last June:\n\n        . . . the NDIC has persisted, despite lingering questions \n     about its effectiveness in coordinating the efforts of \n     federal authorities to collect and analyze intelligence on \n     the domestic trafficking of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, \n     and other drugs.\n\n  What is at stake here? Running this center means we will not have \nenough DEA agents--and we do not. Running this center continues to \nspend $30 to $40 million a year that could do great things for our \nmilitary. Why would we not want to redirect or at least prohibit the \ncontinued funding through this Defense authorization bill?\n  Now, there are going to be some claims: Why are you doing this here? \nWhy aren't you doing it on an appropriations bill when it comes \nthrough? We cannot have it both ways. We heard in the debate on WRDA \nthat authorizations matter, and it is important for us to have \npriorities. So the claim is you should not be doing this here on the \nDefense authorization but, rather, on the appropriations bill. The \nauthorization is the place to do this, to limit the expenditure of \nfunds on something that does not pass muster by anybody's standard.\n  So it is my hope that consideration will be given to this amendment, \nand that we will truly have the courage to make a vote to spend money \nwisely. To continue to spend money on this center means we are going to \ncontinue to throw $40 million away, according to the Department of \nJustice, which runs this center, in something that will not give them \nany benefit.\n  I cannot think of a greater thing we could do than to start doing \nthis and look at every program such as this that is not accomplishing \nany goals. There are no metrics to measure it, other than what the \nDepartment of Justice says.\n  There will be claims saying it has programs that work. They have some \nprograms, but they are highly expensive. They are not as efficient, and \nthey are always late. So over the 12 or 13 years this center has \nexisted, only two of those programs have been successful, and they are \nnot as successful as the other programs within the Department of \nJustice in this very area. So it is hard to justify the basis for this \ncenter.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2999\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to spend a minute talking about the \nWebb amendment. One of the things we know is that we do not do a good \njob on contracting. I know some of the Members on my side of the aisle \nperceive the potential for this commission to be used in a political \nframework. I am not worried about that. I do not think it is intended \nto be used in a political framework. I think it is intended to hold the \nagencies accountable for how they spend the money and whether we are \ngoing to get a handle on our contracting procedures, both through the \nState Department and the Defense Department so we can see we actually \nget value for the money we spend.\n  I am highly supportive of the amendment because I think it is going \nto give us transparency, it is going to give us recommendations, and it \nis going to make clear where we have confusion now in how we contract \nand whether we get value for our money.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3035\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an amendment that we \nwill have a cloture vote on at some point today or tomorrow, Senator \nKennedy's and Senator Smith's Hate Crimes Prevention Act--a vote by \nwhich I hope the Senate will succeed, in a robust way, to invoke \ncloture and to move forward.\n  Nine years ago, a young man sat in a bar having a good time, like \nmany young men throughout America. Not unlike thousands of young adults \nat bars across America, this young man needed a ride home from the bar. \nSo he asked two people he had befriended for a ride. They agreed. On \nthe way home, they robbed him, they pistol whipped him, and tied him to \na fence, leaving him for dead. They committed this brutal crime for one \nreason--and one reason only--because the victim was gay.\n  Since that time, the Congress has been struggling to enact the \nMatthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act--a \nbill I am proud to cosponsor. It has received bipartisan support in \nboth the House and the Senate. But for some reason, we have been unable \nto make the bill a law. Today--as soon as this vote takes place--I hope \nthat will change.\n  Hate crimes violate every principle upon which this country was \nfounded. When our Declaration of Independence proclaimed that ``all men \nare created equal''--of course, I would take that to mean today all men \nand women are created equal--it did not go on to say, however, ``except \nMuslim or Sikh or homosexual Americans.'' It had no exceptions to the \nrights and liberties Americans had under the Constitution and that \nDeclaration. The freedoms we often take for granted--freedom of speech, \nfreedom of association, freedom of religion--become empty promises if \nwe do not protect all those who seek to exercise these freedoms under \nthe Constitution.\n\n  Sadly, right now we are not protecting all of our citizens. This is \nnot, by the way, about providing special rights. It is about ensuring \nconstitutional rights.\n  Local, State, and Federal governments need additional resources and \nauthority to investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on race, \nethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability, and gender \nidentity. That is exactly what this bill will do. It will allow the \nDepartment of Justice to assist in these investigations and \nprosecutions, and it will provide grants for State and local \ngovernments struggling with the costs and logistics of prosecuting \nthese crimes.\n  Some people may not think hate crimes are a real problem in this \ncountry. They are absolutely mistaken. In 2005--the most recent year we \nhave data on--8,380 hate crimes were reported. Of the single-bias \nincidents, 54.7 percent were racially motivated; 17.1 percent were \nmotivated by religious bias; 14.2 percent resulted from sexual \norientation bias; 13.2 percent by ethnicity or national origin bias; \nand a little under 1 percent by disability bias.\n  My home State of New Jersey experienced at least 756 bias incidents, \n47 percent of which were based on racial bias, 36 percent were based on \nreligious bias, and 11 percent were based on ethnic bias. I say ``at \nleast 756 bias incidents'' because we do not know how many of these \nvile attacks have gone unnoticed and unprosecuted due to the scarce \nresources currently available to local law enforcement.\n  Now, I am proud to have been the author of New Jersey's landmark bias \ncrimes law when I was in the State legislature. We said then we could \nnot eradicate hate or bigotry in New Jersey with a single law, but we \ncould send a strong societal message that such acts would not be \ntolerated. With this law, we can do the same for our great Nation.\n  Of course, you do not need to rely on my numbers or my experiences to \nknow that hate crimes are alive and well in the United States. All you \nhave to do is watch television.\n  Last Thursday, thousands of protesters descended on the small town of \nJena, LA, to protest the treatment of six young African Americans. The \ntown was a picture of racial tension, all of which came to the surface \nmonths ago when three nooses were hung from a ``whites-only'' tree at \nthe Jena High School. Perhaps if we had stronger hate crimes \nenforcement, this original action which provoked such violence and \nstarted the town down its path would have been properly handled and \nwould have never escalated to the degree it did.\n  Make no mistake about it, hate crimes are a serious problem in the \nUnited States--a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.\n  Some may protest that this is not the time or place to be debating \nhate crimes legislation. I disagree. For some, it never seems to be the \nright time or the right place.\n  Members of our military are not immune from hate crimes. To the \ncontrary, hate crimes can happen anywhere there are emotions, anywhere \nthere are people with the capability to hate. In 1992, a Navy sailor, \nAllen Schindler, was murdered by two fellow sailors because of his \nsexual orientation. In 1999, PFC Barry Winchell was similarly killed \nbecause his attackers believed--believed--he was gay. The military has \nrecognized that hate\n\n[[Page S12104]]\n\ncrimes are a problem and sought to prevent them, but more can and must \nbe done.\n\n  It is absolutely appropriate to protect members of our Armed Forces \nfrom the vicious attacks that constitute hate crimes while we are \ndebating the Department of Defense authorization bill. It is absolutely \nthe right time to enact this hate crimes legislation. After all, what \nare our men and women doing in uniform? They are fighting for us around \nthe world to preserve our way of life and to promote democracy, and all \nof them take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. Let the \npreservation of the rights of all Americans be the essence of what they \nare fighting for.\n  I will vote to invoke cloture on the hate crimes amendment offered by \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Smith, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2999\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes in \nsupport of the Webb-McCaskill amendment that would establish a \ncontracting commission relative to contracting in Iraq, but it also \ndoes another very important thing, which is it broadens the \njurisdiction of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, \nor SIGIR. Over the last 4 years, the United States has spent more than \n$20 billion on reconstruction contracting in Iraq. In report after \nreport, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, SIGIR, \nhas demonstrated that this effort was poorly planned, inadequately \nstaffed, and poorly managed.\n  For example, the special inspector general has reported that plumbing \nwas so poorly installed at the Baghdad Police College that dripping \nsewage not only threatened the health of students and inspectors but \ncould have affected the structural integrity of the building.\n  The special inspector general reported that the security walls built \nfor the Babylon Police Academy in Hilla were full of gaps and \ndeficiencies, some of which were filled with sandbags; lighting systems \nand guard towers called for in the contract were never installed. As a \nresult, the academy was vulnerable to attack.\n  The special inspector general reported that a prison in Nasiriyah was \noriginally supposed to house 4,400 inmates, but the scope was reduced \nto the point where it would only house 800. After most of the available \nmoney had been spent, the contract was terminated due to schedule \ndelays and cost overruns.\n  He reported that neither the government nor the contractor could \nverify the status of a new oil pipeline from Kirkuk to Baiji because \nproject monitoring was very limited and sporadic. However, at least 25 \npercent of the welds on the pipeline was defective, and one major canal \ncrossing was only 10 percent complete. The failure to complete this \nproject resulted in the loss of as much as $14.8 billion in oil \nrevenues to the Iraqi Government.\n  He reported that after the Army Corps of Engineers spent $186 million \non primary health care centers throughout Iraq, the contract was \nterminated with only 6 health care centers completed, 135 partially \nconstructed, and the remainder ``descoped.'' The special inspector \ngeneral determined that the contractor had lacked qualified engineering \nstaff, failed to check the capacity of its subcontractors, failed to \nproperly supervise the work, and failed to enforce quality control \nrequirements.\n  The Department of Defense has spent even more money on logistical \nsupport contracts for U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. There have \nbeen numerous indications of fraud, waste, and abuse in these contracts \nas well. For example, recent press reports indicate that the Department \nof Defense contracting officials in Iraq and Kuwait received millions \nof dollars in kickbacks, tainting several billion dollars of DOD \nlogistics support contracts. Similarly, the Armed Services Committee \nheld a hearing in April on Halliburton's LOGCAP contract for logistics \nsupport in Iraq. Our committee learned that the company was given work \nthat appears to have far exceeded the scope of the contract. All of \nthis added work was provided to the contractor without competition. The \ncontractor resisted providing us with information that we needed to \nmonitor and control costs. There are almost $2 billion of overcharges \non the contract, and the contractor received highly favorable \nsettlements on these overcharges.\n  Unfortunately, the special inspector general does not have \njurisdiction over Department of Defense logistic support contracts, and \nthe Department of Defense inspector general who does have jurisdiction \nrefused for several years to send auditors to Iraq and is now playing \ncatchup. As a result, billions of dollars have been spent on these \ncontracts without sufficient oversight.\n  In addition, there have been numerous reports of abuses by private \nsecurity contractors operating in Iraq. More recently, the Iraqi \nGovernment has complained about an incident in which employees of \nBlackwater, Inc., allegedly opened fire on innocent Iraqis in Baghdad. \nThis incident is apparently the latest in a long series of similar \ncases in which Blackwater employees were alleged to have used excessive \nforce.\n  Unfortunately, the special inspector general does not have \njurisdiction over private security contractors. The DOD inspector \ngeneral does not have jurisdiction over State Department contractors \nlike Blackwater either. Published reports in the last few weeks \nindicate that the State Department inspector general has systematically \navoided looking into allegations of contract abuse in Iraq.\n  In short, despite almost 5 years of allegations of waste, fraud, and \nabuse in Iraq contracting, we continue to have huge gaps in our \noversight of these activities. The Webb-McCaskill amendment will \naddress these gaps by, first, establishing an independent commission to \nlook into Federal agency contracting for reconstruction, logistical \nsupport, and the performance of private security and intelligence \nfunctions in Iraq and Afghanistan; and, second, expanding the \njurisdiction of the special inspector general to logistical support \ncontracts and contracts for the performance of private security and \nintelligence functions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n  Under this provision, the special inspector general, in collaboration \nwith other relevant inspectors general, would conduct a comprehensive \nseries of audits of logistical support contracts and private security \ncontracts in Iraq and Afghanistan comparable to the audits the special \ninspector general has already conducted for Iraq reconstruction \ncontracts. The commission would review these materials, conduct \nhearings, and issue a report identifying lessons learned and making \nspecific recommendations for improvements that should be made in future \ncontracting.\n  So the Webb-McCaskill amendment would ensure that we finally have \nappropriate oversight over the full range of contracting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It will ensure that we are in a position to learn from the \nmistakes we have made, and we will be better positioned to avoid making \nsimilar mistakes in the future. I hope there will be a broad bipartisan \nvote for Webb-McCaskill, just the way there is already broad bipartisan \nsponsorship for their amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could ask my distinguished chairman \nand longtime colleague a question, I read this amendment, and it seems \nto me it has laudatory goals. But it is--we are outsourcing the work of \nthe Congress, and, most specifically, outsourcing the work of our Armed \nServices Committee. That is the thing that concerns me.\n  We have two very distinguished sponsors, our colleague from Virginia \nand our other colleague on our committee. But I find it difficult to \nrationalize how this commission would function at the same time in a \nmanner that literally outsources the responsibilities of our committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his question. Our \ncommittee, as the Senator knows perhaps better than any other Member of \nthis body, has a huge responsibility month\n\n[[Page S12105]]\n\nafter month, year after year, on the authorization bill. Most of our \nfocus is on that bill in terms of staff assignments.\n  We also from time to time do have oversight hearings. We have had a \ncouple on Iraq, but in terms of what is needed with the immense fraud \nand abuse and waste that has gone on in Iraq, we could assign our \ncommittee nothing else and still not catch up to what needs to be done \nrelative to the waste and the fraud and the abuse that has taken place \nin Iraq contracting. We have perhaps three or four staff members \nassigned to investigation. They are in the middle of an investigation \nnow. They could not possibly--with the very small number of staffers \nassigned to that responsibility--take on the breadth of work which \nneeds to be done relative to Iraq.\n  Also, this amendment not only has a contracting commission, but it \nalso is going to amend the Special Inspector General Act relative to \nIraq to fill in a number of gaps which exist in the inspector general's \njurisdiction.\n  The areas which I just outlined that the current special inspector \ngeneral does not have jurisdiction over, we must have a modification of \nthat jurisdiction in order that the special inspector general will have \nthat capability which is now omitted from the tasking of the special \ninspector general. As the Senator also knows because he was responsible \nfor the appointment of a number of these commissions, our committee \nsupports, and indeed has led the way, in the creation of independent \ncommissions all the time. It was not an abdication of our jurisdiction \nor our authority when the Packard Commission was created, when the \nsection 800 commission was created, or when the Service Acquisition \nReform Act Commission was recently created. There are many commissions \nthat we appoint, and we are leading the way and have led the way to \nhave created, and in no way does that diminish the jurisdiction of our \ncommittee.\n  In fact, it is quite the opposite. The creation of these commissions \nhas been able to lead to reforms, legislative reforms at times, which \nour committee then is able to take up and adopt, hopefully, in many \ncases, and in fact has adopted in many cases.\n  So there is nothing novel about the creation of commissions. As a \nmatter of fact, I think the Senator from Virginia, perhaps almost on \nhis own, was the creator of a commission which we recently heard from \nto give us the independent assessment of the military capability of the \nIraqi military forces, the commission led by General Jones.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I acknowledge that, yes, I did conceive \nthat idea, and successfully, with the help of Senator Byrd and others, \ngot that legislation through. But that was for a tightly defined \npurpose within a prescribed short period of time.\n  This one, I believe, is of 2 years duration. Mr. President, I say to \nmy distinguished chairman, I have listened to him recount some of the \ncommissions that our committee has sanctioned. But I am now prepared on \nthis floor to tell my chairman, if you believe we need extra help, I \nwill lead the effort with you to get more money from our committee to \ntake over some of the responsibilities that the Senator is about to \nrecommend to the Senate be outsourced to a commission.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Did we outsource to the Packard Commission, the reforms \nthey recommended?\n  Mr. WARNER. I remember that Packard Commission very well, but that \nwas a tightly knit commission for a specific purpose. I used to be at \nthe Pentagon and worked under David Packard as Secretary of the Navy. \nWe were fortunate to get him to do that. This seems to be an omnibus \nsituation to me. I am concerned about having the inspector generals, \nwhich, again, is a creation by our committee, against some of the \nadministration's wishes. They weren't overly keen on putting inspector \ngenerals in there. Our colleague from New Jersey has a bill to have an \nIG now for Iraq. I want to support that. But these inspector generals \nhave to report to this Commission, I understand. I would not want to be \na party to amending the law there. They were created by the Congress, \nand they should report to the Congress, not to a commission.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't think working closely with the Commission \ncollaboratively in any way means they are not going to report to us. \nThey will continue to report to the Congress. There is no shift of the \nreporting function. As a matter of fact, the IG for Iraq does not have \nthe authority which should have been given to him, and would now be \ngiven to him by this bill, for instance, on logistics support \ncontracts. Why in heaven's name should the special IG not have \nlogistics support contracts jurisdiction?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if you want to take those provisions out \nand make it a freestanding amendment, I would be supportive of \nmodifying it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have never seen as much fraud, waste, and abuse. There \nis no analogy in the history of this country, I don't believe, for the \namount of fraud and waste and abuse that is taking place in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. I don't think our committee could do anything else if we \ntook on that responsibility. I think we would be having hearings every \nweek, when we need to have hearings on all of the other matters under \nour jurisdiction. I don't know that we could do an authorization bill \nproperly if we took on this responsibility. It is too massive.\n  I wonder whether the Senator can give me one example in American \nhistory where there has been this degree of waste, fraud, and abuse. We \nnow see a massive investigation taking place because of the alleged \nfraud of a number of members of the armed services. I cannot remember \nanything comparable. This is a massive undertaking. It is most \nappropriate that we have a special commission to do that. There is no \nreason why they should not work in concert with an IG. We don't want \nthem overlapping and conflicting.\n  The issue is whether we are going to take on this responsibility one \nway or the other. This is only one practical way to do it. I wish we \nhad the resources and time in our committee to do the kind of oversight \nthat has to be done relative to Iraq. To me, it has been the most \nshocking abuse of the taxpayers' dollars that we have seen. As a \npractical matter, I think the former chairman of the committee would \nacknowledge it would take a huge amount of staff and committee time.\n  I want to give one example. We have an ongoing investigation right \nnow, and it is very small relative to the size and scope of this one. \nWe wanted to talk to a witness. During this investigation, a number of \nwitnesses talked to us voluntarily, but a few witnesses would not. In \nour committee, we don't even have subpoena power unless the full \ncommittee votes for it. The Senator from Virginia was very helpful to \nme, as he remembers, in getting the full committee to vote for a \nsubpoena. I extended my appreciation to him then, and I do it publicly \nnow for his cooperation and that of Senator McCain. Every one of those \nsubpoenas required a vote. Then there had to be a hearing. We have to \ngo through a hearing of our committee to hear from a witness that is \nsubpoenaed, even though that should be through a discovery process. \nEven our rules are so limiting in our committee that we could not \nundertake an investigation of this scope.\n  This is a massive undertaking. To me, it would be suggesting, for \ninstance, that if there was an Iran-Contra Commission, somehow or other \nthe appointment of that Iran-Contra Commission--there was a special \ncommittee of the Congress. Was that an abdication of the work of the \nexisting committee? I don't think so. It fit a special need at that \ntime. Each of the committees from which that special committee was \ndrawn didn't have the resources to do it on their own. So each of these \nare designed for a purpose.\n  I don't know why there would be objection. The reason for the length \nof time that the amendment takes is twofold: One is that this is a \nmajor investigation that will take a lot of time because its scope is \nhuge. Secondly, we want to take it out of politics. I think the \nsponsors will speak to this, and perhaps already have. This should not \nbe something where there is going to be a report in the middle of a \nPresidential campaign. It ought to end after that campaign is over. I \nthink they provide for interim reporting, as I remember, in January \nafter the Presidential campaign.\n  So I hope there will be bipartisan support. It is not a political \neffort. The report comes after the Presidential\n\n[[Page S12106]]\n\ncampaign. There is no practical way that our committee has the \nresources to undertake the travel and the responsibility and the scope \nof this. This is huge. There has never been this degree of waste that I \nknow of in American history. I know enough about this already from our \none hearing, on one matter, involving one contractor, involving the \nscope of a contract that we touched literally with the tail of an \nelephant or donkey. It is massive.\n  I plead with the former chairman here, who knows exactly the \nresponsibilities of our committee, who knows more than anyone in this \nbody what responsibilities our committee has, that there is no \npractical way, given our bill that comes up every year, given our \nnominations process with which the Senator is fully familiar--we have \nfour nominations that we have to hear tomorrow. We have dozens of \nnominations each year. On top of all of that, we have oversight, which \nwe try to do in a number of areas. We had oversight on the Boeing \ncontract. That was one contract that took a significant amount of time. \nWe did some major good. I don't know the magnitude, but if you look at \nthe Boeing contract, for instance, this contracting abuse scandal has \nto be a multiple of 10 to 100 times that one investigation. I plead \nwith my friend to support this as the only practical way to get our \nhands around this situation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know our chairman has another \nengagement. We will return to this debate. This thing really poses, in \nmy judgment, new ground for the committee, to outsource this much \nresponsibility of oversight. At this point, I will yield the floor. I \nsee our colleague seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, if I may address the question of the \nSenator from Virginia briefly, I think it is important to keep this in \ncontext.\n  First, the Senator from Virginia worries that the Armed Services \nCommittee was giving up jurisdiction in order to form this Commission. \nI think it is important to remember that this mess is not just the \njurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee. This mess is also the \njurisdiction of the Foreign Relations Committee. It is also the \njurisdiction of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. In fact, an argument can be made that this is the modern-day \nTruman Committee, and the chairman of that committee is none other than \nSenator Levin, who chairs the Special Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations.\n  One could make the argument that the State Department should be \nanswering to Foreign Relations for the messes in contracting in terms \nof reconstruction. One could argue that the active military should be \nanswering to Armed Services. Government Affairs should be looking at \nthe whole mess. The bottom line is that this Commission does two \nimportant things: First, it gets above all of the agencies to bring all \nof the problems to one place, so we don't have the turf fights over \nwhich committee has jurisdiction over this particular problem that we \nhave encountered like never before. As the Senator from Michigan, \nchairman of the committee, said, we have never had this kind of problem \nbefore in terms of an armed conflict.\n  The other thing to remember is that, unlike those committees, this is \nbipartisan. This Commission is four Democrats and four Republicans. It \nis not a commission where one party is going to take precedence over \nthe other party. We have a representative of the President and the \nSecretary of Defense on this Commission. So the bipartisan nature \nallows us to get above this knee-jerk reaction we have around here that \nif they are for it, we are against it; and if they are against it, we \nare for it. This is way too important to engage in that.\n  Finally, in terms of time period, this has a set time; it is only 2 \nyears. The first report is due after the Presidential election in \nJanuary 2009--the first interim report. Next year, when the capping \nreport is presented to us, they can give it to this Commission, and \nthey can look it over. Stuart Bowen is onboard with this. We discussed \nit at length, and he thinks this is a great way to move forward and get \nthis above each individual committee and above some of the \npartisanship. Frankly, we have engaged in it. We are not without sin \nhere. My party has engaged in partisanship over this. I understand that \nit may feel that this is an effort to engage in partisanship. That is \nwhy we went out of our way to say it is going to be bipartisan in \nnature, limited in time, getting above the various committees that have \njurisdiction here because of the State Department's involvement, DOD's \ninvolvement, and the involvement of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee--three different committees, including \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The first interim report \nis due January 2009. The final report must be presented by January \n2010. This is a 2-year period of time to work and collaborate.\n  By the way, I tried to count up--and I am sure the Senator from \nVirginia is aware of this--how many people we have working in the \nDepartment of Defense in auditing and auditing-related activities. \nThere are 20,000 people. Now, if you think about that in the context of \nwhat has gone on, you realize we need some help. How do we have 20,000 \npeople in contracting and auditing and related investigative activities \nin the DOD and have the kind of runaway abuse that we have had.\n  By the way, in talking to the generals in Iraq who are involved, they \nwere focused on their mission. I have no ill will toward these \ncommanders who were trying to get a job done in terms of a military \ncontext. That is why we need this Commission, to give the military \nclear guidance, along with the State Department, of how we fix this \nsystemically. What kind of training do we need to do? These detailees \nwithin these various areas given the contract oversight responsibility, \nthe CORs, are not trained right now. They don't have the core \ncompetency in terms of contract monitoring that we must have under \nthese conditions where we are contracting at an unprecedented level. If \nyou look at the modifications we have made, where we have actually said \nwe are not ever going to allow this Commission, in terms of members \nleaving, to get to anything other than a four-four, we are never going \nto have a situation where it is not completely bipartisan and where \nthey are not going to focus with expertise on ways they can guide our \ncommittee and guide the committee I serve on, Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs and guide the Foreign Relations Committee in \nmaking sure we help the State Department and Department of Defense and \nany other Government agencies involved, including inspector general \nagencies and other auditing agencies. Frankly, GAO does a lot of this \nwork for Congress, and we take their reports.\n\n  I think that in light of what has occurred and the scope of this \nbeyond the jurisdiction of any one committee, 2 years is a reasonable \nfinite time to come with concrete, meaningful suggestions that get us \nabove this partisan rancor over the conflict in Iraq and using it as a \npolitical football that we have a tendency to throw around here with \nsome frequency.\n  The Senator's leadership on this particular issue is so key to us \nhaving success with this amendment. I ask the Senator to take some time \nto look at it. I will be happy to visit with him about the conversation \nI had with Stewart Bowen about the valid approach we are making that I \nthink will bring about some of the same positive results that were \nbrought about in the past, whether it was the 9/11 Commission, the \nBaker-Hamilton Commission or the other commissions the Senator from \nMichigan referenced that the Senator has been involved with and party \nto in terms of wanting outside eyes at some point to help us get beyond \nsome of the stuff that goes on that we cannot help.\n  I think it is tremendously important, and I implore the Senator from \nVirginia to take a look at it again and see if we haven't done the \nthings that will reassure him this will be an augmentation of the Armed \nServices Committee's work instead of an abdication of their \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri. I must say, having been on this Armed Services Committee now \n29 years with my good friend, Senator Levin, we ``old bulls,'' as we \nare referred to, are very much impressed with our new member, her \nvigor, her\n\n[[Page S12107]]\n\nforesight, her determination to get things done. She has stirred us up \nin a very constructive way, I might say.\n  As to this measure, this will require a little more study on this \nside. But I am concerned with the fundamental proposition that we are \nabdicating the duties of the committee, but we are not quite there yet \nin this debate to try to reach some final determinations.\n  An interesting observation: 20,000 individuals, and probably that is \ncorrect. They are scattered not just in Washington but all across \nAmerica in military departments. The Department of the Army has its \nprocurement center outside the Nation's Capital.\n  In a sense, as the chairman said and I think the Senator from \nMissouri has said, the enormity of the problem out there--is the \nSenator suggesting that the enormity of that problem is a consequence \nof this 20,000 or so not performing their duties as prescribed?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I believe that what happened was in an unprecedented \nfashion, we engaged in contracting--I know the Senator is a student of \nhistory, and if he looks back at the history of the Seabees and where \nthe Seabees came from in terms of the idea that you are going to put \npeople in the middle of a conflict who are not military personnel, in \nterms of doing ancillary activities apart from the direct military \nmission, it is unprecedented what we have done in this conflict in \nterms of the contracting.\n  I don't think the active military was prepared for this kind of scope \nin terms of the types of contracts that were entered into, many of them \nnot definitized, many of them not with the kind of oversight that one \nwould expect for contracts that run into $15 billion, $20 billion per \ncontract, in some instances. I think this was a matter of we need it \nnow, we don't have the end strength to get everything done we need to \nget done; if we contract it, it is going to be cheaper in terms of \nlegacy costs to get a worker to peel potatoes than to recruit a soldier \nto peel potatoes or to cook.\n  I understand that was done long term because it had the potential for \nefficiencies, it had a potential to preserve our ground strength for \nthe military mission and to allow us to not incur the legacy costs of \nanother member of the active military.\n  In reality, because they were not prepared in terms of their systems \nfor this level of contracting and oversight, bad things happened--very \nbad things happened.\n  If we are going to continue to contract at this level, why not at \nthis fork in the road embark upon a limited 2-year exercise in a \nnonpartisan way to get concrete suggestions with expertise and not \ncreating a new bureaucracy, because they can access those 20,000 \npeople, they can access the Army auditor, they can access the \ncontracting agency within the Army, they can access all the inspectors \ngeneral, they can access all the acquisition and procurement \nspecialists. They can access that information, bring it together for \nthe State Department and for DOD and say: If moving forward we are \ngoing to continue to contract at this level--and let's be honest, I \nthink we are--then these are things we need to be doing.\n\n  If the military could do this on its own, we wouldn't have the \n``lessons learned'' book in Bosnia not even getting to the people in \nIraq until after they entered into most of these contracts. We remember \nthe testimony from David Walker. He talked about the fact that even \nthough they had drawn up the book and said these are all the mistakes \nwe made in Bosnia, guess what. They forgot to look at the book before \nthey began down the very same road in the Iraq conflict. That is what I \nwant to prevent in the future.\n  This is about looking forward and not about looking back. This is \nabout figuring out a way forward that we can responsibly contract in a \nway that protects our military and the strength of our military, and, \nboy, would I like the help of the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her analysis. As I \nread this, they can look backward, forward, sidewise, any way they wish \nand have one of the strongest powers Congress can confer on any \ncommission--subpoena power--compelling persons against their wishes to \ncome before that committee, take an oath, and provide testimony. That \nis something that Congress should consider very carefully before it \nconfers that on--for the moment we know not who will be on this \ncommission.\n  As I say, we will require further deliberation. But I do point out \nthat the Senator talked about the uniform side. Much of the military \nprocurement system is performed by very able career civilians. From \ntime to time, military officers are detailed as a part of their career \nand otherwise to work with those civilians. But I feel the Senator is \nputting on report an awful lot of people with a broad brush. I want to \nthink about that. Having had the privilege of serving with those people \nin the Department of Defense--perhaps not the ones who are there now \nbut many. I think at the time I was Secretary of the Navy, I had \n700,000 to 800,000 civilians in the Department of the Navy. They are \nvery conscientious people. I acknowledge there have been a lot of \nunfortunate things in the rush to do what we felt was necessary with \nrespect to Iraq and, to a lesser degree but nevertheless to a degree, \nAfghanistan.\n  Haste makes waste is the old adage. For the moment, I have thoroughly \nbeen informed by the views of the Senator, and I hope to continue to \nhave a dialog with the Senator as this matter is now before the full \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia. I don't want to overemphasize his support, but there are few \npeople around here who can get us past partisanship. I have noticed in \nmy short time in the Senate he is one of the chosen ones. He can get us \npast that partisanship sometimes.\n  I am very hopeful and remain optimistic that I can convince the \nSenator from Virginia this is a measured and appropriate way to provide \nsome accountability to all those men and women to whom he referred who \nare trying to do the right thing. We have not figured this out yet, and \nI think we have to try something different to see if we can figure it \nout.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Missouri, the \nState in which my mother was born.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about two matters, but I \nwish to, first of all, associate myself with the remarks by my \ndistinguished colleague from the State of Missouri. Our first-year \nclass of Senators has worked hard on a lot of issues. She and our \ncolleague from Virginia, Mr. Webb, have worked hard on this issue. I \nappreciate her comments today, as well as the enlightening exchange and \nas well as Senator Levin's comments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2196\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak first about amendment No. 2196 \npertaining to the National Drug Intelligence Center which is located in \nJohnstown, PA, in southwestern Pennsylvania. This center was created in \n1993 and provides Federal, State, and local law enforcement and \nnational security agencies with crucial information about the \nstructure, membership, finances, communications, and activities of \ndrug-trafficking organizations.\n  While a number of Federal agencies play different roles in combating \nillegal drug use and distribution, the National Drug Intelligence \nCenter, which some know as NDIC, performs a unique role by providing \nindependent information about drug use to other Federal, State, and \nlocal agencies.\n  This center produces an annual national drug assessment report which \nis the principal report by which Federal policymakers evaluate trends \nin drug use and the overall drug threat faced by this Nation. Given the \nrole drug trafficking plays in financing international terrorism, \ninformation compiled by the NDIC about drug distribution plays an \nimportant role in combating terrorism worldwide.\n  Much has been made about the fact that the NDIC is located in \nJohnstown, PA. Let me speak for a few moments about the benefits of \nlocating outside Washington.\n  All the answers to our Nation's problems do not reside here. \nSometimes there are a lot of good answers outside Washington. To some, \nthat may be a news bulletin.\n  First, the Johnstown location translates into reduced overhead and \nlower administrative costs.\n  Second, being outside the beltway allows for greater coordination \nwith\n\n[[Page S12108]]\n\nState and local law enforcement. The work done by NDIC does not have to \nbe conducted in Washington and, I would argue, the Johnstown location \noffers greater cost savings for the Federal Government.\n  This amendment comes at an interesting time where recently--\nyesterday, actually--the Drug Enforcement Agency, DEA, announced that \nthis center, in particular, played key roles in an international case \ntargeting the global underground trade of anabolic steroids, human \ngrowth hormone, and insulin growth factors, in addition to some other \ninformation. The investigation included significant enforcement of \nillicit underground trafficking of ancillary and counterfeit \nmedications.\n  The investigation represents the largest steroid enforcement action \nin U.S. history, and it took place in conjunction with enforcement \noperations in nine countries worldwide.\n  The information provided by this center in Johnstown, PA, played an \nimportant role in this investigation.\n  I also wish to add my own feelings with regard to this particular \ncenter in Johnstown, PA. I am very proud of the people in Johnstown, \nPA. They share a heritage of hard work and sacrifice, they have \novercome a lot, and they have a tremendous work ethic. Any investment \nin a city such as Johnstown, PA, is a prudent investment, not just \nbecause of economic activity but principally, and most importantly, the \nimportant work this center provides for law enforcement.\n  If we want to do comparisons with other places around the country, I \nam sure that will be constructive. I rise to speak against this \namendment and urge my colleagues to vote against it and also to \nhighlight the value of having this center in the State of Pennsylvania \nfor our Nation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3035\n\n  I wish to change subjects. I have a second set of remarks which I \nwish to take the time to deliver.\n  We are contemplating voting on legislation that pertains to hate \ncrimes. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act at long last may be voted on in \nthe Senate. There are a lot of reasons for me to stand up not only as a \nsupporter of this legislation but a cosponsor; one of, at last count, \n43 bipartisan cosponsors. In the other body, there are more than 170, I \nam told.\n  This act is simple but profoundly important. First of all, the Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act will strengthen--strengthen law enforcement's \nability to crack down on these kinds of crimes by providing grants to \nlocal and State agencies to fight the particular evil that resides in \nthe hearts of those who want to commit crimes based upon this kind of \nmotivation--a motivation of hate, pure and simple. Secondly, in terms \nof the mechanics of how this will work, this legislation will help the \nDepartment of Justice work with local and State law enforcement \nagencies to assist in the prosecution of these crimes.\n  But beyond the program and beyond the details of a government program \nlie some very personal stories. One story that all of America knows, \nbut we need to be reminded sometimes about these stories, is one we saw \nplay out in the 1990s.\n  His name was Matthew Shepard. He was born on December 1, 1976, to \nJudy and Dennis Shepard in Casper, WY. He went to the University of \nWyoming and had a great interest in politics and a great interest in \nthe environment. In October of 1998, two men tied him to a split rail \nfence, tortured and beat him, and left him to die in freezing \ntemperatures. He was found 18 hours later, and he died several days \nlater in October of 1998 at the age of 21.\n  I had the opportunity in September 2005 to meet Matthew Shepard's \nmother. We had a private meeting where she expressed her deep concern \nabout this crime we see play out across the country. She, obviously, \nwill probably never fully recover from the loss of her son and the way \nhe died, but when I rise to speak about this, I think we have to \nconsider who speaks for that mother if the Senate doesn't stand up and \nspeak with one voice on an issue such as this.\n  This is about combating hate, hate in the hearts of men and women \nacross this country. We talk all the time about people from other parts \nof the world and how evil they can be, especially the terrorists, but \nthere are examples in our country of real hate. If we do not stamp them \nout and prosecute vigorously these kinds of crimes, we cannot fully \nappreciate nor can we fully expect others to appreciate the feeling in \nour hearts about making sure we treat people with dignity, with \nrespect, and acceptance, but that we do it in the spirit of brotherhood \nand sisterhood.\n  When such a crime as this happens, I would hope the Senate would do \neverything possible to fully and vigorously prosecute and sanction \nanyone who engages in this activity. This legislation, the Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act, is one important step to achieving that goal, and I \nspeak in support of that legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, would the Senator from Pennsylvania mind \nanswering a couple of questions before he leaves?\n  No. 1, I would note, just on the hate crimes legislation, that the \nperpetrators of the heinous crimes against Matthew Shepard had full \njustice carried out against them. That is true, is it not?\n  Mr. CASEY. Well, there are a lot of ways to prosecute someone.\n  Mr. COBURN. Were they prosecuted, I guess, and did they receive \nsignificant punishment?\n  Mr. CASEY. Let me finish my thought. There are a lot of ways to \nprosecute a crime like that. But when you have legislation that is \nsupported broadly across the country, including by law enforcement \nagencies, district attorneys, and police organizations across the \ncountry, I rely upon their judgment when it comes to what are the tools \nwe need for law enforcement.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2196\n\n  Mr. COBURN. The second question--and I want to make sure you \nunderstand as the author of this that it doesn't say anything about \nJohnstown, PA, which has great folks. This amendment isn't about the \npeople of Johnstown, PA, and what they can offer. They offer great \nthings to our country, and it is not meant to degrade or delineate \nanything other than the utmost respect for them.\n  What this amendment is about is, are we getting the value for what we \nare spending? And all you have to do is look at what the Department of \nJustice says, which is running this program, and what the DEA says, and \nwhat every other intelligence-run enforcement center is saying: that, \nin fact, there is not added value for the dollars that are spent there, \nand anything that is a positive contribution could be more effectively \nutilized at some other center.\n  So it is not about the people of Pennsylvania and it is not about who \ndid it or whether we all shouldn't try to get a Federal facility to \nhelp areas that are economically depressed across the country. That is \nnot a bad idea. There is nothing wrong with that. The purpose of this \namendment is to delineate that there is not good value for the half a \nbillion dollars we have already spent and that taxpayers could get more \nvalue out of less money if, in fact, we did what the professionals and \neveryone else has said, including former directors of that center.\n  Mr. CASEY. Let me just respond to my colleague, the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma, who has been on this floor for many years \nholding public agencies accountable, and we appreciate that and I share \nthat concern. I only raised the question about Johnstown, I guess, \nbecause as a Senator from Pennsylvania, I want to make sure we are \nfighting for an important community. I am not saying that is the intent \nof the legislation. I just wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate \nthe work ethic of that community.\n  Every program that is funded with taxpayer dollars has to be \naccountable, and I appreciate that. We have an opportunity on this \nfloor to debate programs where we spend significant sums of public \ndollars. When I was in State government, as Senator Coburn knows, my \njob for the better part of a decade was to do just that, and it is \nclose to my heart, the kind of accountability I know the Senator is \nconcerned about. But I would hope, in pursuing that, we don't \nunjustifiably have an impact on a facility that is providing a great \nbenefit for law enforcement well beyond Pennsylvania and, secondly, \nthat we work to be equitable about it. I know that is the intent, but I \nthink we have\n\n[[Page S12109]]\n\nan honest disagreement about this particular center.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator for answering my question. I guess my \ndebatable point is the offering of the value, in the judgment of the \nprofessionals who are running all of the Department, including the \nDepartment of Justice and the DEA, which says it doesn't measure up. \nThat is my point. That is why I brought the amendment. It doesn't \ndenigrate the work of the people there.\n  The fact is, if we are really going to continue to send $30 million \nto $40 million a year, let's find them something that will give us \nbetter value. If we choose not to support this amendment, let's give \nthem direction so that the $30 million or $40 million we do invest \nactually brings us something that is worth $30 million or $40 million.\n  And it is not the employees there who are at fault. In fact, the \ndirection and the mission has been one that hasn't been accomplished \nbecause it wasn't needed in the first place.\n  Mr. CASEY. Quickly, by way of a response, I have to say that when I \nwas the auditor general of Pennsylvania, our office authored lots of \nreports about waste, fraud, and abuse and about problems in spending. \nWhat we tried to do as well was not just point out where the problems \nwere but also to point out and to list, actually in reports, a series \nof recommendations and corrective actions.\n  I think there is ample reason in a lot of public programs to make \nchanges and to have corrective action. I don't think that always should \nresult in the defunding or the elimination of an entire program. But we \nmight have a disagreement on this issue, and I respectfully submit \nthat.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator for his words and his courtesy in \nanswering my questions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2999\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my Democratic \ncolleagues in the freshmen class who are offering amendment No. 2999 \ntoday. I wish to give my thanks in particular to Senator McCaskill, \nSenator Webb, as well as the other six freshmen Senators in the \nDemocratic caucus in offering this amendment that deals with \naccountability as it applies to contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The nine of us were elected last fall in large measure because the \npeople in this country were tired of the war in Iraq and tired of a \nlack of accountability for how our tax dollars have been spent in the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The fact is, people in Montana and around \nthe country work way too hard to have their tax dollars stolen from \nthem by people who think they can take advantage of an environment \nwhere there is little or no oversight or accountability. This amendment \nwill bring some much needed accountability in the way our tax dollars \nare spent in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we will do it in a way that \ntakes this issue out of the political spotlight.\n  This amendment will establish a bipartisan commission to review the \ncontracts we have entered into in fighting the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The Commission will be outside of Congress and will be \noutside of the Bush administration. The amendment will also direct this \nnew Commission to review the way new contracts are awarded and \noverseen. This will give us a chance to prevent future waste, fraud, \nand abuse.\n  The Commission will work in consultation with the Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq Reconstruction, which currently oversees only \nreconstruction contracts in Iraq, to review and investigate logistics, \nsecurity, and intelligence work that has been contracted out by the \nDefense Department.\n  According to the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, we \nhave squandered $10 billion in Iraq reconstruction funds due to \ncontract overcharges and unsupported expenses. That means 1 out of \nevery 6 reconstruction dollars spent in Iraq is not accounted for, and \nonly now, after 5 years of war in Iraq, the Army is looking back at \nnearly $100 million in contracts to determine how these funds have been \nspent.\n  I think it is important for folks to understand we are not coming at \nthis with the idea that every contract is a bad one. There are many \ncontractors who are doing a good job and who are being responsible with \nour tax dollars. But there are others who are not. At a time when we \nare struggling to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi and Afghani \npeople, those who are deliberately overeating at the taxpayer trough, \nwhile our troops are fighting and dying in Iraq, are nothing short of \ntreasonous.\n  Many Americans have questioned how their tax dollars are being spent \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. They have wondered why it is that there are \nmore contractors than troops in Iraq. They have wondered why some \ncompanies are enjoying record profits even though so many projects \nremain incomplete. For too long, the answer from the Government has \nbeen a deafening silence. This amendment is a long-overdue response to \nthe cries for accountability and transparency in our contracting \nprocess. It should not be and is not a partisan issue. It is about good \ngovernment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me concur with my colleague, \nSenator Tester, in support of the amendment being offered by Senators \nWebb and McCaskill and which Senator Levin also spoke on a little \nearlier, and that is the need for us to have this independent \nCommission look at what has happened in Iraq as far as the U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars. I am proud that our new Members of the Senate have \nmade this a priority. I think it is important that the taxpayers have \nconfidence that the money we appropriate will be spent appropriately, \nand that has not been the case in the reconstruction of Iraq.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3035\n\n  I also take the floor to speak about an amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy that will be voted on later. I spoke last week about hate \ncrimes in America, and I talked about what is happening in our own \ncommunities. I spoke about an episode in College Park, MD, and we are \nall familiar with what happened in Jena, LA. The FBI has indicated that \nthe number of hate crimes reported is unacceptably high in all \ncommunities in America today.\n  Today, we are going to have an opportunity to do something about \nthat. We are going to have an opportunity to support S. 1105, the \nMatthew Shepard Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that bill, and I \nthank the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for bringing \nforward this issue. We will have a chance on this very important bill \nto speak about the moral commitment of our own country and what we \nstand for as a nation. This is an issue which we need to deal with \nbecause it speaks to what type of people we are in this country, that \nwe will not tolerate hate crime activities.\n  This legislation gives the Department of Justice jurisdiction over \nviolent crimes where a perpetrator picks the victim on the basis of \nrace, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender \nidentity, or disability.\n  Now, why do we give the Department of Justice jurisdiction in these \nareas? Well, we all know, first, that it will make it clear this is a \nnational priority. Secondly, the Department of Justice is in a far \nbetter position, in many cases, than local law enforcement working by \nitself to successfully complete an investigation.\n  This legislation gives additional tools to local law enforcement so \nthey can get their job done. It gives them training dollars. It gives \nthem other resources and assistance so that, in many cases, they can \nget the type of information necessary to pursue these cases \nsuccessfully.\n  It is what is needed in partnership with local government. But there \nare some States that are unable or unwilling to move forward with hate \ncrime activities. Only 31 States and the District of Columbia include \nsexual orientation or disability as a basis for hate crimes \nprosecution. So we have voids in the Nation and this gives us an \nopportunity to move forward.\n  This legislation is bipartisan. We have had support from both sides \nof the aisle to make it clear that in America we will not tolerate hate \ncrimes activities. It strengthens the current law. It removes the \nlimitation in the current law, the Federal law, that says you\n\n[[Page S12110]]\n\nonly can move forward if it would involve a protected activity such as \nvoting or attending school. That restriction is removed, so that we \nhave more opportunities for the Federal Government to be of assistance \nin prosecuting hate crime activities. As I have indicated before, it \nincludes sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability as \ncategories of hate crime activities.\n  I am very pleased it has broad support from many organizations and \ngroups around the Nation, including the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association, the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the National District Attorneys Association, and the National \nSheriffs' Association. It also enjoys support from civil rights groups \nincluding the Anti-Defamation League, Human Rights Campaign, Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, and the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People. The U.S. Conference of Mayors also \nsupports this legislation. It is also supported by the Consortium for \nCitizens with Disabilities, including the Maryland Disability Law \nCenter.\n  There is a broad group that supports this legislation because they \nknow it is needed. They know we need to do a better job, and they know \nit is time for this Congress to act. Hate crimes are un-American. When \nthey happen, we are all diminished and we have a responsibility to do \nsomething about it. It is time for the Senate to act.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for bringing this forward. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it. The House has already taken similar action. \nIt is time this legislation be submitted to the President.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 3016, 3010, 3043, 3009, as Modified; 3046, 3008, as \n          Modified; 3006, as Modified; 2251, and 2172 En Bloc\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I send a series of amendments to the desk which have \nbeen cleared by Chairman Levin and the ranking member. Therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate consider those amendments en bloc, \nthe amendments be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table. Finally, I ask that any statements relating to these \nindividual amendments be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment no. 3016\n\n  (Purpose: To require a report on the solid rocket motor industrial \n                                 base)\n\n       At the end of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1070.

That was a group of how many amendments?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Nine.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are making progress on this bill, but I strongly urge \nother colleagues to bring forward their amendments. We have a lot to do \non this bill. We are dealing with a bill that is absolutely essential \nfor the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families. We should \nmove along as best we can to complete this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2196\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to respond to \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, to \neliminate the National Drug Intelligence Center, which is located in \nJohnstown, PA. That center was created in 1992 and performs a very \nimportant function. The National Drug Intelligence Center, commonly \nreferred to as the NDIC, partners with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the Office of Counternarcotics Enforcement, to provide \nintelligence, to identify, track, and sever the nexus between drug \ntrafficking and terrorism. The NDIC created an entity called \nHashKeeper, a company software program which is provided to the Federal \nGovernment for use in Iraq. The cost of this center is about one-third \nof what it would be if it were located in the Washington, DC, area.\n  I think it makes good sense to decentralize Federal functions to the \nextent it is possible and practical. Everything does not have to be \nlocated in Washington, DC. Everything does not have to be located in a \nbig city. Our country is more vulnerable when everything is \nconcentrated in one area. Johnstown has the advantage of being much \nless expensive, being able to provide these vital Federal services for \nabout one-third of the cost, while being reasonably close to \nWashington, DC, which is the location of many of the other entities \nwith which it cooperates.\n  The jobs which are provided are very substantial for my constituents \nin Pennsylvania; an obvious interest that I have as a Senator \nrepresenting the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. These are several \nhundred jobs; they are very important. It is a legitimate interest to \nwant to maintain our industrial base in Pennsylvania and to maintain \ngovernmental activities in Pennsylvania. But there is good value in \nhaving the NDIC function, in general, and there is extra good value in \nhaving it function in Johnstown, PA.\n  The NDIC has been complimented by a broad number of agencies. In a \nNovember 21, 2001, letter, the FBI praised the NDIC for its work on \nfinancial crimes, saying:\n\n       Through the analysis of these documents, over 400 specific \n     intelligence products have been produced for the FBI, the \n     Department of Justice, the Department of Treasury, and U.S. \n     Attorney's Offices. The work NDIC produces continues to \n     initiate actionable leads and identify avenues of \n     investigation. NDIC has integrated seamlessly with the FBI \n     investigation and has enhanced the way the FBI will \n     investigate future financial cases. The participation of NDIC \n     . . . continues to be invaluable.\n\n\n[[Page S12114]]\n\n\n  In a June 23, 2006, letter, the Drug Enforcement Agency had this to \nsay:\n\n       The Fort Worth Resident Office--\n\nthat is of DEA--\n\n     amassed thousands of documents, but was unable to properly \n     exploit the information they contained. The valuable report--\n\nreferring to the NDIC report--\n\n     caused several of the principals to negotiate pleas to \n     pending charges. If not for the willingness of the members of \n     NDIC to confront these challenges in a cooperative effort, \n     this investigation would not have reached its current level \n     of success.\n\n  There have been many plaudits given to the NDIC by the special agents \nin charge of FBI offices, such as the FBI agent in charge of the Tampa \nField Division, the FBI special agent in charge of the Detroit Field \nDivision, the DEA special agent in charge of the Dallas Field Division, \nthe FBI special agent in charge of the Charlotte Division, and the DEA \nspecial agent in charge of the Oklahoma City District Office. This last \nis ironic, in a sense. In a March 25, 2006, DEA cable, the DEA Oklahoma \nCity District Office had this to say.\n\n       In support of phases one and two, NDIC deployed two teams \n     in Oklahoma, each consisting of one special agent, one \n     computer exploitation and five document exploitation \n     personnel. Actionable intelligence was generated and passed \n     to the appropriate DEA offices. The OKCDO thanks all NDIC \n     personnel--\n\nthat is the Oklahoma City District Office thanks all NDIC personnel--\n\n     who planned and participated in this operation. The \n     intelligence and operational knowledge gained was beneficial \n     to OKCDO, and its law enforcement partners. . . .\n\n  President, National High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, HIDTA, \nDirector's Association Executive Board: May 24, 2007, Letter to the \nAttorney General in support of NDIC:\n\n       NDIC produced thirty-two HIDTA drug market analyses for the \n     HIDTA program. Production of the HIDTA drug market analyses \n     required a full-time effort of twenty-six analysts for \n     extended periods of time working side-by-side with the HIDTA \n     Intelligence Center personnel.\n       NDIC is a very valuable asset in addressing the nation's \n     drug problem.\n       This entire effort lead to a valuable working relationship \n     with not only the HIDTAs but federal, state and local drug \n     enforcement entities.\n\n  FBI Special Agent in Charge--Tampa Field Division: January 16, 2007, \nLetter of Appreciation for NDIC assistance.\n\n       The purpose of this letter is to recognize the assistance \n     of the National Drug Intelligence Center's (NDIC) Document \n     and Computer Exploitation Branch for the superb analytical \n     support they provided the Violent Crimes/Gang Squad on an \n     investigation into the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation.\n\n  FBI Special Agent in Charge--Detroit Field Division: December 11, \n2006, Letter of Appreciation for NDIC:\n\n       The teamwork displayed in working with investigators from \n     the DEA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is a true \n     measure of what can be accomplished when agencies work \n     together.

The valuable [NDIC] report listed the seized \n     documents and collated them, which created a valuable tool \n     for Investigators and Prosecutors in this investigation.\n       In conclusion, this effort caused several of the principals \n     to negotiate pleas to pending charges.\n       Subsequently, 19 search warrants and over 100 seizure \n     warrants were executed, which resulted in the seizure of \n     approximately $20 million, in assets.\n       If not for the willingness of the members of NDIC to \n     confront these challenges in a cooperative effort, this \n     investigation would not have reached its current level of \n     success.\n\n  FBI Charlotte Division: May 2, 2006, Letter of Commendation for NDIC:\n\n       In February 2006, your staff presented to the North \n     Carolina Law Enforcement Community, the most comprehensive \n     Intelligence Assessment ever conducted within the state of \n     North Carolina relating to gangs.

He and I have worked very closely in his almost 3 years in \nthe Senate. I observed his work in the House of Representatives, and I \nknow his work as a medical professional. I understand what he is doing \nin subjecting to an analytical eye Federal expenditures. But I do not \nbelieve he should target the NDIC.\n  I concur that we ought to be holding down Federal expenditures, and I \nthink that close scrutiny of all such projects is very much in the \nnational interest. But I believe the facts are very strong in support \nof continued operation of the NDIC in Johnstown, PA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield so I can respond to the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and then we can get this off the floor?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. That is fine.\n  Mr. COBURN. A couple of points. You should be down here defending \nthis. This is something in your State and it is appropriate that you \ndo. The point I raise is the HashKeeper system is ineffective and \ndoesn't work near to the way every other component works. We know it \ndoesn't work, and it costs about 18 times what the NARL system does, \nplus the NARL system is admissible in court and the HashKeeper system \nis not, which is developed by the NDIC.\n  So there is no question that some of the work they do is valuable. \nBut every example you cited was the DOCX program, which requires \nanybody there to travel somewhere else. So the location doesn't matter \nwhere.\n  The other point I would make--and the significance of that is we are \nnot, overall, getting as good a value as we could. The idea is not to \nrelocate this to Washington, what the Justice Department is \nrecommending this DOCX portion of it be where it needs to be--which is \nall across the country--and the rest of the areas that are deemed \nvital, which is about 10 percent of what the NIDC does, be relocated to \nEl Paso where the drugs come in, where our border is, and where they \nneed it.\n  This is not a criticism of the people who work there or everything \nthey do. What it is, the amendment as made is intended to give us a \nperspective about value that we are not getting. I have great respect \nand consider a friend the Senator from Pennsylvania. I understand his \ndefense of this program. I do not believe it meets the scrutiny of any \ncommonsense objective when you look at it, and what the Department of \nJustice, which runs it and manages it, and also the fact that in a time \nof war we can spend a whole lot less money and have that money \navailable to defend this country.\n  I thank the Senator for listening to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2999\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here to speak in support of \namendment No. 2999, as amended. This is an amendment that is very \nimportant to me, and I appreciate the leadership of my colleagues \nSenator McCaskill and Senator Webb, and in fact all of the freshmen \nDemocrats who are supporting this legislation, the goal of which is to \nbring more public accountability to the way our Government does \nbusiness.\n  I think you and I both know, having spent the last 2 years going \naround our State, that people are yearning for more public \naccountability from our Government. They are yearning for more \ntransparency. We heard calls for that--increased transparency. And here \nwe have, in the area of Armed Services and the area of Government \ncontracting, a chance to act on it.\n  This amendment establishes an independent, bipartisan commission to \nstrengthen Government oversight and examine the true costs of a \ncontracting culture that the Federal Government relies upon in Iraq. \nThis idea is not unprecedented.\n  The legislation is inspired by the work of the Truman Commission and \nit is fitting Senator McCaskill is from Missouri, as was Truman. The \nTruman Commission, as you know, conducted hundreds of hearings and \ninvestigations into Government waste during World War II, at an \nestimated savings of more than $178 billion in today's dollars; $178 \nbillion. Think of what that would mean to the American taxpayer today \nat a time when we are spending somewhere between $10 to $12 billion a \nmonth in Iraq.\n  There is, unfortunately, a natural tendency in this country toward \nexcess and corporate excess. So when people are given sort of unlimited \ncontracts, no-bid contracts, I think you can expect excess.\n  I come from a prosecutor background. We know that when people are \ngiven leeway, and maybe even when they have the best intentions, the \npeople in charge, the people on the ground, it leads to fraud and the \nGovernment is the one that is on the short end of the stick.\n  I think it is more than just a cost of doing business when we are \nlooking at what we have been seeing in Iraq with private contractors \nover the last 5 years. The number of contractors in Iraq, the last \nestimate I had, was 180,000. It now exceeds the number of American \ncombat troops in Iraq. We need to look at the effects these logistical \nand security contractors have on our military.\n  Now, I would say this: We are not talking about creating an \nadditional bureaucracy. We are talking about expanding an \ninfrastructure that already exists. The Special Inspector General for \nIraq Reconstruction, with the excellent performance that we have seen \nin uncovering waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq reconstruction projects, \nis proof of its ability to conduct more interagency examination of \nwartime contracts.\n  The special inspector general has proven to be a powerful tool in \ninvestigating reconstruction contracts. In 2005 alone, he reported a \nloss of $9 billion tax due to a contractor's inefficiency and bad \nmanagement.\n  I can tell you this, in my job as county attorney, when we had a case \nin front of us, we would always say: Follow the money and you would \nfind the bad guy.\n  Well, we need to do more of that with Iraqi contractors. This motto \ncould not be more true than it is today as the GAO, the Defense \nContract Audit Agency, and news reports continue to expose gross \nmismanagement in defense contracting.\n  That is why I am so proud to support this amendment. We have heard \nthat of the $57 billion awarded in contracts for reconstruction in Iraq \nthat was investigated, approximately $10 billion has been wasted; $4.9 \nbillion was lost through contractor overpricing and waste; $5.1 billion \nwas lost through unsupported contract charges. Of this $10 billion, \nmore than $2.7 billion was charged by Halliburton. This means almost 1 \nin 6 Federal tax dollars sent to rebuild Iraq has been wasted. And \nwhile we have heard in dollars the staggering amount, this waste \namount, $10 billion, the costs of mismanaged contracts extends beyond \nthat.\n  For instance, if you look at the electricity in Baghdad, you have \nseen the city only enjoying an average of 6.5 hours of electricity a \nday. It has actually gone down from where it was a year ago.\n  Water. Congress has provided nearly $2 billion to provide clean \ndrinking water and repair sewer systems. But according to the World \nHealth Organization, 70 percent of Iraqis lack access to clean drinking \nwater.\n  With jobs, the Defense Department has estimated that the unemployment \nrate is anywhere from 13.6 percent to 60 percent. In a recent survey, \nonly 16 percent of Iraqis said their current incomes met their basic \nneeds. These costs in every way are unacceptable. They are unacceptable \nto the people of Iraq, and they are unacceptable to the taxpayers of \nthis country.\n  My colleagues and I--and you are one of them, Mr. President--came to \nWashington demanding accountability. Today I am proud to be part of a \ngroup that supports an important amendment to bring more transparency, \nto bring accountability to contracting in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12116-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12116-S12122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12116]]\n                                  CHIP\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise at this moment to speak in strong \nsupport for the renewal of the Children's Health Insurance Program. It \nis an issue that is fast upon us. The House of Representatives passed \nthis legislation last evening. We will, I hope, do the same, and will \nsend it to the President.\n  This is an issue that is not just an economic issue; it is also a \nmoral imperative. If we cannot ensure the children of this country have \nthe opportunity to have access to good health care, then we cannot \nensure that we keep pace with the basic notion of this country: \nopportunity for all of our citizens.\n  Health care and education together are the engine that moves this \ncountry forward. They give children a chance to use their talents, \ndevelop their talents, and go on and contribute to this great country. \nBut also it makes tremendous economic sense. As we invest in children's \nhealth care, we hopefully will ensure that throughout their lifetime \nthey will not only have healthy lifestyles, but they will have the \nadvantage of a good start, so that their efforts can be directed toward \ncontributing toward their community, and contributing to this economy.\n  We understand that the costs of health care are skyrocketing, and \nthat for many families they have, unfortunately, had to make the choice \nof forgoing it, to leave their children vulnerable, without access to \ngood primary care, without access to specialized care when they need \nit.\n  We also understand that these children, when they get sick, \nultimately find their way to an emergency room and we end up paying \nmuch more, because a child who can be seen on a regular basis could \nhave access to preventive care. Arriving at the emergency room with a \nvery serious condition requires a great deal more resources than seeing \na child before that condition becomes serious, and becomes an \nemergency.\n  So we should be, I think, smart, as well as morally responsive to the \nissue before us. And that directs me to my strong support for this \nlegislation. The final bill which will be coming before us will invest \n$35 billion in our Nation's children and their future. It preserves \ncoverage for 6.6 million children, but it will also reduce the number \nof uninsured children by 4 million.\n  In fact, the final bill improves upon the Senate bill that I proudly \nsupported weeks ago. It provides quality dental coverage to all \nchildren enrolled. That is critical. I can recall listening to a foster \nmother in Rhode Island. She had six different foster children. What was \nher biggest complaint? She could not get a dentist. They would not see \nher because she did not have dental coverage. Her complaint to me was a \nrepetition of what her child said to her in so many words, which was: \nWhat do I do? How do I take care of a toothache? How do I go to school \nwhen I cannot bear to concentrate because of the pain?\n  For most of us here in this room, that would be a simple call to the \ndentist, a trip there, and immediate relief, and for our children also. \nBut for millions of Americans, that is not the case. Here we have a \nchance to give them what we too often take for granted.\n  I think it is going to be an important step forward. I am \nparticularly proud, because the architect of this program 10 years ago \nwas Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island. He stood on a bipartisan \nbasis with many in this Chamber and pushed for the adoption of the \nchildren's health care bill. It stands as a legacy to him. It is a \nvibrant legacy which we in Rhode Island cherish and we hope we can \nextend through this legislation.\n  The final bill that will result we hope in passage and signature by \nthe President will give Rhode Island an increase in Federal funding \nfrom $18 million to $93 million. It will prevent future shortfalls. \nLast November on the floor of the Senate before we went out, I insisted \nthat we could not leave until we provided help to States that had \nalready run out of their SCHIP funding. We were able to do that.\n  But those stopgap measures at the eleventh hour do not provide for \nthe kind of planning and predictability that are essential to keep the \ncosts down and keep the program going. I do think, again, this is a \nbill that is worth all of our efforts and all of our support.\n  If we can afford to spend $12 billion a month in Iraq, we must be \nable to afford to spend a fraction of that to give children health care \nin this country. I just left the Appropriations Committee hearing. \nSecretary Gates is urging $50 billion more funding for Iraq. That is \nquite a bit more than we are asking over 5 years for the children's \nhealth care program. That is just for several months in Iraq.\n  The American people, I believe, will demand that we pass this \nlegislation. If we can find the resources overseas, we have got to be \nable to find the resources here for this compelling issue.\n  The other aspect of this is this legislation is fully paid for, \nunlike the spending in Iraq which is deficit spending, which we are \nliterally sending forward to the next generation of Americans to deal \nwith. This is fully paid for by an increase in the cigarette tax; sound \nfiscal policy as well as sound public policy.\n  Now, we have heard a lot from the President, particularly about why \nhe is proposing to veto this legislation. I find it hard to discover \nany logic at all. It is full of misrepresentations, frankly. The bill \ndoes not cover children up to 400 percent of poverty. In fact, about 80 \npercent of the newly insured children are from families below 200 \npercent of poverty. Those are the new children to be enrolled.\n  This bill is well targeted, and provides incentives to ensure that \nthe lowest-income children are insured first. This does not federalize \nhealth care or socialize it. In fact, in Rhode Island this children's \nhealth care program is run by private health insurance companies, and \nthat is a very effective and efficient approach.\n  What I have noticed over the last few years is not that private \nhealth insurance has expanded dramatically in this country and this \nlegislation would constrain that. Quite the opposite. With private \nhealth insurance, the number of insured Americans has decreased. They \nare losing their private insurance. It is too expensive. So the idea \nthat this somehow is going to throttle the attempts of the private \ninsurance industry to insure those children is, on its face, \npreposterous.\n  Those children will not be insured because their parents cannot \nafford to pay the coverage, and because private insurance companies \noperate at a profit, they do not extend coverage because they feel like \nit.\n  This is the way to expand coverage. This is the way to protect \nchildren. This is the way to invest in our future. This is the way to \ndo it in a fiscally responsive manner by increasing the cigarette tax. \nIt makes sense on every ground.\n  The President's suggestion that he is vetoing it has to be something \nother than common sense. In fact, it strikes me as slightly spiteful. \nThis is something on a bipartisan basis we have done for 10 years; \nsomething on a bipartisan basis that we will continue to do. And to be \nfrustrated by a Presidential veto, I think, would add insult to the \ninjury of not having children insured in this country.\n  I call on the President to reconsider his veto threat. I call on the \nPresident to join us in providing health insurance to the children of \nAmerica, to provide them a foundation for their education, provide them \nthe foundation to proceed forward as good citizens, good workers in the \neconomy, and contributing members. I hope that will happen in the next \nfew days with passage and signature by the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise today to speak briefly in \nconnection with amendments we made to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. Specifically, I wish to comment \non five amendments which have been accepted which are important to the \nfuture of our military and also important to the future of military \ninstallations we have within the State of Colorado.\n\n[[Page S12117]]\n\n  At the outset, let me say that as we have moved forward with this \nlegislation, I have very much appreciated the leadership of the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Carl Levin, and all of his staff who \nhave worked so hard with all of us on these amendments and the hundreds \nof amendments so many Members have filed. I also express my \nappreciation to Senator McCain and to his staff, Senator Warner and all \nof his staff, who have also worked with us on these amendments that are \nso important for our Nation's defense.\n  The five amendments I wish to briefly review are related, in part, to \nColorado but also in a larger sense related to the question of how we \nmake sure we have the best national defense and homeland security we \npossibly can.\n  The first of those amendments is an amendment relating to an effort \nwe have underway with the Secretary of the Air Force to make sure we \nare protecting our Air Force bases from the kind of encroachment that \nwill impair their military mission, unless we are proactive about \nmaking sure the appropriate buffer zones are, in fact, created.\n  In my State of Colorado, there are three Air Force bases which are \nvery important to our Nation's defense system. They are Peterson and \nSchriever Air Force Bases in El Paso County, in Colorado Springs, and \nBuckley Air Force in Aurora, in the Denver metropolitan area. In the \ncase of each one of those installations, which I have frequented often \nin my time in the Senate, I have seen the development that is occurring \nfrom one end of the base to the other and the encroachment that occurs \nas the urbanization moves out. I have expressed often to local elected \nofficials in that part of the State it is important that what we do is \nprotect those military installations so that 10 years, 25 years, or 50 \nyears from now, we can make sure the military mission we have assigned \nto those bases is one that will not be compromised. Yet, as \nurbanization occurs and you see the subdivisions that sprout up around \nthese bases, you have to wonder when that point in time will come where \nthe encroachment itself will start having an impact on the mission of \nthese military installations.\n  We have noticed in the past--and studies have concluded, including a \nstudy from the RAND Corporation--that some branches of our Armed \nServices do a better job than others in terms of protecting their \nmilitary installations from encroachment. The REPI program, which is a \nprogram that has now been in existence for some time, has been widely \nused by the U.S. Army. Indeed, in our State of Colorado, with Fort \nCarson, one of the things that has happened is we have seen much of the \nbuffer-zone area that is needed to be acquired to assure that Fort \nCarson's military mission is not negatively impacted in the future. It \nis that same kind of proactiveness that we need to take on with our Air \nForce Bases.\n  I recently met with Secretary Wynne to talk about the importance of \nus doing this not only in Colorado but around the Nation. He is in \nagreement that we ought to do that. He is in agreement that we ought to \ntake a look at what more we can do to protect our Air Force \ninstallations.\n  In my own view, in terms of what happens in my own State, we are not \nproactive enough. What happens is that whenever there is a developer \nwho comes in with some kind of a program, the developer will go to the \nlocal land-use officials and seek the necessary land-use approvals to \nmove forward, to try to get their development built. What the local \ngovernment officials will do is they will look at whether the military \nmission is being impaired as only one factor. But it is being reactive \nto a force of development that is probably occurring in that entire \narea.\n  It would be much better, from my point of view, if what we do with \nour Air Force installations is to be proactive and look out at what we \ncan do to make sure we are protecting the mission of those Air Force \nBases for the long term--for 10 years, for 25 years, for 50 years. It \nis my hope with this amendment, which has been agreed to, that we will \nbe able to do that.\n  The second amendment which I want to speak about briefly has to do \nwith the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. The Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site is \nsome 237,000 acres of training facility located in the southeastern \npart of my State of Colorado. It is a very important part of the \ntraining capacities we have at Fort Carson. Over the last several \nyears, the U.S. Army has indicated that what it wants to do is \nsignificantly expand Fort Carson and the training facility that is \nlocated at the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site.\n  Because of rumors and the information flow, which is not always \naccurate, at one point in time the residents of my State in \nsoutheastern Colorado had the view that what, essentially, the Army was \nattempting to do was to condemn what was the entire southeastern part \nof the State of Colorado. If that, in fact, were to have happened or if \nthat were to happen in the future, the ranching heritage of the \nsoutheastern part of my State would be destroyed.\n  So what has happened over time is we have had a conversation with the \nDepartment of Defense and the Secretary of the Army about the future of \nPinon Canyon. There are a number of very legitimate questions that have \nbeen raised.\n  One of those questions is whether the 237,000 acres that already \nencompass the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site are sufficient to be able to \nprovide the training capacity that is needed at Fort Carson. There is a \npossibility that the answer to that question will be, yes; that when \nyou combine those 237,000 acres with the nearly 100,000 acres already \non the Fort Carson main campus itself, there are sufficient land needs \navailable for its future. It may be that the answer comes back that \nsome additional land might be needed. But if so, then it is important \nfor the Army to tell us what additional training capacities would be \nacquired if they acquire this additional land.\n\n  There are many questions with respect to the expansion, from my point \nof view, that have not been answered. I place this in the context of \nwhat the BRAC Commission found in January of 2005, where the findings \nof the Commission were that additional brigades would be moved into \nFort Carson which are now underway in terms of being moved into Fort \nCarson itself; that there was enough training ground at Fort Carson to \nbe able to satisfy the needs of our soldiers at Fort Carson. So if that \nwas, in fact, the conclusion that we reached in January of 2005, it \nraises the very legitimate question as to why it is that we need to \nhave additional land for training today. So these important questions \nare set forth in legislation that my friend and colleague, Senator \nAllard from Colorado, and I offered together in an amendment, and it \nwas an amendment that was accepted by the Senate last night. For that I \nwant to say thank you once again to the floor managers of this \nlegislation.\n  The third amendment I want to speak about briefly this afternoon is \nan amendment that deals with the paralympic program for wounded \nwarriors. Today, in my State, in part because of the fact that the U.S. \nOlympic Committee is hosted and housed in Colorado Springs and the fact \nthat we have a major paralympic program that takes place in the State \nof Colorado, there is a desire to be able to do more. There is a desire \nto be able to do more in large part because many of the wounded \nwarriors we see coming back from Iraq and from Afghanistan, those \n30,000 men and women who have been wounded, sometimes very grievously \nin this war, ought to be given every opportunity that we can possibly \ngive them so they can live the best life they can, given the injuries \nthey have sustained on behalf of a very grateful nation. So it is in \nthat regard that our paralympic amendment would expand the authorities \nof the Department of Defense so that they, our wounded warriors, would \nhave a greater opportunity to be involved in some of the paralympic \nprograms that are hosted throughout the Nation. So, again, I thank my \ncolleagues for accepting that amendment.\n  The fourth amendment I want to briefly address this afternoon is the \namendment relating to a hard deadline for the destruction of chemical \nweapons at the Pueblo Chemical Army depot, as well as at Blue Grass in \nKentucky. This legislation is legislation that has been pushed hard on \na bipartisan basis. It has been pushed hard by Senator McConnell and \nSenator Bunning, Senator Allard and myself. It is our hope that with \nthe passage of\n\n[[Page S12118]]\n\nthis legislation, the Army will, in fact, understand, and that the \nDepartment of Defense will, in fact, understand that 2017 sets a hard \ndeadline for us to move forward and complete the destruction of these \nchemicals which today provide a hazard to the communities and people \nwho live nearby, and provide a national security threat if these \nchemical weapons were ever to fall into the hands of terrorists and \ninto the hands of those who want to do us wrong in this country. So it \nis our hope that with this legislation, we will be able to continue to \npush for a 2017 deadline for the completion of the destruction of these \nchemical weapons.\n  Finally, the fifth amendment I want to refer to briefly is an \namendment relating to the training of helicopter pilots at high \naltitudes. Today, in the mountains of Afghanistan, where many of us in \nour congressional delegation trips into either Iraq or Afghanistan have \nbeen in those helicopters, we know the kinds of conditions they have to \nfly in, at some of those very high altitudes, especially in the country \nof Afghanistan and those borders between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The \nonly place where our pilots can receive the adequate training to be \nable to make sure they have the capacity to fly those helicopters at \nthose high altitudes is at a site in Gypsum, CO. But today, whenever a \nhelicopter pilot has to go into that area, into that training facility \nin order to be trained on how to fly their helicopters, what they have \nto do is they have to bring their own helicopters to the site.\n  So what we are asking for here is for six helicopters to be stationed \nthere at the site to be able to provide our pilots with the best kind \nof high altitude training for helicopter pilots that we can possibly \nprovide as a nation. So I thank my colleagues. I thank Senator Levin, \nSenator McCain, Senator Warner, Senator Reid, and others who have been \ninvolved in pushing the Department of Defense authorization bill \nforward, and I thank them for supporting those amendments.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to \nspeak on the Children's Health Insurance Program as in morning business \nfor a period of up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  CHIP\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, today I rise first to praise the \nbipartisan spirit in which the Children's Health Insurance Program came \nto this floor and was accepted by this Chamber on a positive vote of 68 \nvotes saying yes to providing health insurance to the young children of \nAmerica. It was one of the finer moments, it seems to me, of the last \nyear in this Chamber, where Democrats and Republicans came together and \nsaid: Yes, we can do this for all of the right reasons. It was a \ncircumstance where, with the leadership of Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley of the Finance Committee and Senator Hatch and Senator \nRockefeller, IV, who basically were the key movers and shakers in \ntrying to move this package forward, they said: We are going to put \naside our partisan differences, and we are going to put together a \npackage that we can make sure receives bipartisan support on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  At the end of the day, that package did, in fact pass, and today and \nover the next several days, hopefully, we will get that legislation to \nthe President's desk for his signature. It is my hope the President \ndoes sign this bill. It is my imploration to the President that he sign \nthe bill on behalf of our Nation's children. Covering our kids, \nproviding them with the kind of preventive care, with the kind of \ndoctors and nurses that they need, will ensure that they grow up \nhealthy and that they grow up strong. These have been the goals of our \nbipartisan work in this Chamber over the last many months.\n  The Finance Committee passed that plan by a vote of 17 to 4, and we \nthen confirmed the bipartisan nature and the importance of children's \nhealth insurance with a 68-to-31 vote. Now, with 9 million kids without \nhealth insurance around the country, 180,000 of those kids in Colorado, \nthe President has issued a veto threat of this legislation. In my view, \nand with all due respect to the President, I believe the President is \nwrong to issue a veto threat on such a fundamentally important issue.\n  Earlier this year, as I was traveling through Colorado, I spoke with \nfolks in my State about the need to reauthorize the children's health \ninsurance plan. As I did so, a school nurse told me of a boy who was \ninjured during a football game. His family wanted to have health \ninsurance, but with premiums increasing up to 70 percent since 2000 and \namounting to for that family about $10,000 a year, that family simply \ncould not afford health insurance. They couldn't afford to take their \ninjured son to a doctor. All they could do was to apply ice to their \nson's leg and pray that somehow it would get better. It did not get \nbetter. The boy's leg, which was then fractured, grew progressively \nworse. It swelled to twice its normal size. In the end, with no choice \nleft, the parents took the child to the emergency room, the most \nexpensive place for any of our children to get care.\n  Beyond the pain and the anguish that the child or the parents felt \nthat day, the most frustrating part is that with the coverage provided \nwith the legislation that we are about to adopt in this body, the child \nwould have been able to see his doctor within a couple of hours of the \ninjury. He would have received better care at a lower cost and with a \nlot less pain and a lot less frustration for everybody involved.\n  We have all heard the stories of how the health care system is \nfailing our children. We hear of the colds that turn into pneumonia. We \nhear of the earaches that develop into ear infections. We hear of other \nillnesses that grew worse because parents could not afford to seek \nmedical care for their children. Nine million kids--nine million kids--\nin the United States have no health insurance today. It is \nunconscionable that in the strongest, most prosperous democracy in the \nworld that we cannot give our kids that basic coverage of health that \nthey need to have a fair chance in life. Our failure to extend health \ninsurance coverage to more kids would not only be a moral failure, but \nit would be a massive liability for the education and well-being of our \nchildren and for our future economic security.\n  This is why. Uninsured children miss more school than their peers. \nThey are six times--six times--more likely to have unmet medical needs. \nThey are 2\\1/2\\ times more likely to have unmet dental needs, and one-\nthird of all uninsured children go without any medical care for an \nentire year. I am proud of the work of the Senate. I am proud of the \nbipartisan work that went into writing this legislation to cover the 10 \nmillion uninsured children in America. This legislation provides the \ncoverage to an additional 3.3 million children who are currently \nuninsured, and it also maintains the coverage for all the 6.6 million \nlow-income children currently enrolled in the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. The bill includes significant incentives for States \nto enroll more children into CHIP, particularly children in rural \ncommunities, many rural communities such as the ones in my State of \nColorado, where geographic distances and the lack of health insurance \ncreate barriers to enrollment. Twenty percent of all low-income \nchildren live in rural areas, and a significant number of them are \nuninsured. This bill will help them get health insurance.\n  The CHIP reauthorization also allows a State to cover pregnant women. \nChildren, we know, who are born healthy have a far greater chance of a \nhealthy life. Healthy children save Medicaid and CHIP significant \nresources in reduced health care costs. It is sensible that they \nreceive this coverage under our program.\n  Once again I want to thank the model of effectiveness and leadership \nin this Senate in Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley and \nSenators Rockefeller and Hatch for their strong leadership on this \nissue. They united the Finance Committee and much of this Chamber \naround our common goal. It is a very simple goal. It is a simple goal \nof helping our kids get to the doctor.\n  This bill is a giant step forward in our Nation's steady march toward \nproviding every child in America the chance to chase their dreams. I \nhope President Bush will change his mind and that he will support this \nbill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S12119]]\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, it is without question that we are \non a wrong course in Iraq. The Bush administration's failure to listen \nto the American people, failure to plan for the unexpected, and failure \nto learn from its mistakes has left our Nation less, not more, secure \nfrom terror and from the dangers our troops face in Iraq.\n  The expenditure of hundreds of billions of American tax dollars has \nnot only strained our Treasury, but cost us uncountable opportunities \nto improve the lives of American families and to strengthen our \ncountry's future.\n  Every month, we are borrowing and spending over $10 billion to fund \nthe war in Iraq--billions of dollars that we borrow and spend that \ncould help deliver health coverage to children who need it; that could \nhelp improve the quality of elementary education and make college more \naffordable--things that are an essential investment in our Nation's \neconomic strength into the future.\n  In addition to the billions we are spending to continue our military \ninvolvement in Iraq--a policy that must change, and soon--we are also \nspending billions more on reconstruction efforts. In this area alone, \nbetween 2003 and 2006, we have spent more than $300 billion. The same \nPresident who thinks it is too much to spend $35 billion on American \nchildren's health care over the next 5 years had no problem pouring \n$300 billion into Iraq reconstruction, and I submit that there is very \nlittle to show for it.\n  We have fought long and hard to keep pressure on President Bush to \ntake a new direction in Iraq. At every turn, he and his allies in \nCongress have resisted. We will continue our fight, but as we do, we \nalso have an obligation on behalf of the American people to ensure that \nthese tax dollars are being used as they should be.\n  As fighting the war and rebuilding Iraq have been privatized, too \noften we have seen evidence of fraud. According to a 2005 report by the \nSpecial Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, nearly $9 billion in \nfunding intended for reconstruction efforts went unaccounted for--just \ngone. Investigations by the Special IG for Iraq Reconstruction of $32 \nbillion in funding for Iraq reconstruction have already led to $9.5 \nmillion in recovered and seized assets and more than $3.6 million in \nrestitution.\n  Iraq is a target-rich environment for corruption, and monitoring the \nexpenditure of U.S. resources there requires vigilance. We must ensure \nthat our tax dollars are not squandered to corruption or other \nmalfeasance, and we must ensure that we have the ability to audit U.S. \ntax dollars from the time our officials award contracts through their \nfinal expenditure. We must do all we can to prevent ``leakage'' of this \nreconstruction aid through every step in the contractor supply chain.\n  We must give ourselves the chance to consider what effect all this \ngraft and corruption may be having on the motivations of Iraqi leaders. \nWhen I visited in Iraq, we heard of just one official from Al Anbar \nProvince--a police official--who had embezzled more than $50 million. \nWith graft at that scale, one can only imagine how the motivations of \nIraqi leaders might be warped.\n  The measure before us today will help us find out. It will establish \na new ``Truman Commission'' to restore the American people's faith that \ntheir tax dollars are being accounted for. The Truman Commission was \nformed during World War II, when then-Senator Harry S Truman created a \nspecial committee to investigate the National Defense Program to \ninvestigate defense-related contracts and expose corruption and \nmismanagement in the use of war-related funds.\n  The commission we seek today will have the authority to audit U.S. \nfunds used for U.S. projects or for U.S. efforts to support \nrehabilitation of Iraqi industries. The establishment of this \ncommission will ensure that this cascade of billions of dollars for \nreconstruction in Iraq can be tracked, so that the hard-earned money \nU.S. taxpayers provide will serve the purposes--the legitimate \npurposes--of the American and the Iraqi people.\n  I applaud Senator Webb and our Presiding Officer, Senator McCaskill, \nfor their leadership in sponsoring this amendment. I am very pleased \nthat my colleagues in the Democratic freshman class, every one of us \nhas thrown our support behind it.\n  Last November, the American people told us it was time for a change \nin Iraq, and we are working hard for a new direction. But as we fight \nto bring our troops home, this amendment will help make certain that \nour tax dollars are spent as we mean for them to be. It is wise \nlegislation, it is needed legislation, and I urge its support.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3035\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, over the course of this morning, this \nafternoon, and yesterday, we have had some excellent comments in \nsupport of our hate crimes amendment which we will be voting on in the \nmorning. Also, we will be voting on the SCHIP program as well. Over the \ncourse of the afternoon, a number of people have spoken on these \nissues. I am enormously grateful to many of my colleagues who have \ntaken a great interest in these issues and wanted to be able to speak \non them. Many of them have. Others will continue through the afternoon, \nprobably into the evening, to express their support for this \nlegislation.\n  I wish to take a couple of moments on the issue of hate crimes. We \nhave heard during this discussion that hate crimes are alive and well \nin the United States, tragically. Over the last few days, we have \nspoken about many people who have been impacted by hate crimes and \ndescribed in some detail the horrific circumstances so many of these \nindividuals, fellow citizens, have undergone because of their \nreligious, ethnic, racial, and sexual orientation.\n  I was moved--and I am sure many were--by the Southern Poverty Law \nCenter and their very important study on estimates of hate crimes. The \nSouthern Poverty Law Center was focused on crimes of race in the South \nfor many years and developed enormous amounts of information about \nthose horrific crimes and was very responsible in bringing people to \njustice in a number of circumstances. Their focus on these issues of \nhatred got them to expand their research.\n  As I mentioned in an earlier presentation, they recorded their best \njudgment that hate crimes reach 50,000 people per year every year, \nwhich is an extraordinary amount.\n  I wish to respond to a point or two that have been raised in \nquestioning our approach on this issue.\n  In the hate crimes legislation we have introduced, our bill fully \nrespects the primary role of State and local law enforcement in \nresponding to violent crimes. The vast majority of hate crimes will \ncontinue to be prosecuted at the State and local level.\n  The bill authorizes the Justice Department to assist State and local \nauthorities in hate crimes cases. It authorizes Federal prosecution \nonly when a State does not have jurisdiction or when it asks the \nFederal Government to take jurisdiction or when it fails to act against \nhate-motivated violence.\n  We have responded to these issues and gone into them in very careful \ndetail. There are those who say this legislation is going to make every \ncrime of violence a hate crime. We have heard that statement in \nopposition. We have heard it for a number of years. We have addressed \nit, and we have spelled out in the legislation exactly what is the \njurisdiction.\n  The bill protects State interests with a strict certification \nprocedure that requires the Federal Government to consult with local \nofficials before bringing a Federal case. It offers Federal assistance \nto help State and local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute \nhate crimes in any of the categories. It offers training grants for \nlocal law enforcement. It amends the Federal Hate Crimes Statistics Act \nto add gender to the existing categories of race, religion, ethnic \nbackground, sexual orientation, and disability. So a strong\n\n[[Page S12120]]\n\nFederal role in prosecuting hate crimes is essential for practical and \nsymbolic reasons.\n  In practical terms, the bill will have a real-world impact on actual \ncriminal investigations and prosecutions by State and Federal \nofficials. This legislation can send a strong message to the \nperpetrators of such crimes and to all others who think we are going to \nsit back and watch our fellow citizens being attacked so brutally.\n  What we are basically saying on the issue of hate crimes is we are \ngoing to fight it with both hands. Now the Federal Government has one \narm tied behind its back, unable to deal with the problems of hate \ncrimes. Now we are saying: Yes, we are going to work with the locals; \nyes, we are going to work with the State; but, yes, we are going to \ninsist that all of the resources at the Federal level can be utilized \nwhen called upon in these horrific crimes of hate.\n  These are some of the points that have been raised. I wanted to \nrespond to them this afternoon.\n\n\n                                  CHIP\n\n  Mr. President, I see others of my colleagues here. I had planned to \nspeak briefly for a few moments on another issue we are going to vote \non tomorrow, the SCHIP program. If any of our colleagues wanted to make \na comment on this, I will be glad to welcome it.\n  Moving to this issue about the vote we will have tomorrow on the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program that was developed to provide \nhealth insurance to the children of working families--the very poor are \ncovered by Medicaid, and CHIP is for the working families. It has been \na great success. The greatest failure has been we have not provided the \nkind of assurance we should to all children who are in need of this \nprogram.\n  This is the statement of the President:\n\n       America's children must also have a healthy start in life. \n     In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll \n     millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up \n     for the Government's health insurance programs. We will not \n     allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand between \n     these children and the health care they need.\n\n  I hope the Senate will heed that comment and that commitment because \nthat effectively is what we will be voting on tomorrow.\n  It is difficult for many of us to understand, when the President made \nthat comment and that commitment to the American people, that he would \nurge us to reject the excellent proposal that has been basically \naccepted by the House and the Senate.\n  Quickly, this chart is the Center for Medicare Services, known as \nCMS, report on CHIP, September 19, 2007. Over the past 10 years, CHIP \nhas improved overall access to care, reduced the level of unmet needs, \nand improved access to dental care, expanded access to preventive care, \nand reduced emergency department use. This is the Center for Medical \nServices. This is a part of the current administration.\n\n  This is the current administration's assessment. We have the \nPresident's statement and now their assessment about the success of the \nprogram.\n  We can understand why, when we look at this chart--this is National \nHealth Interview Survey--CHIP has reduced the uninsured rate for \nchildren from when we started the program in 1997 to now, with the \narrows going down, from 22 percent down to 13 percent. This side of the \naisle would like to have it go all the way down. It shows remarkable \nprogress in an area of important national need.\n  This chart demonstrates the relationship between health and \neducation. Enrollment in CHIP has helped children learn. We passed an \nimportant education program earlier this year. We are addressing now \nthe K-through-12 challenge we are facing. Look at the difference in \nchildren's performance ratings before and after 1 year's enrollment in \nCHIP. We have before, and we are talking about paying attention in \nclass, and after we find a dramatic increase in the interest of \nchildren, and before and after ``keeping up with school activities.''\n  It is very understandable because the children are getting the health \ncare they need, they are getting eyeglasses, they are getting the \nhearing assistance they need, they are getting the medical attention \nthey need, and the results has been a dramatic increase in the \nperformance of schools.\n  We have great issues and questions about what works and what doesn't \nwork in education. What we know is, if you have a healthy child, you \nhave a child who is going to do better in education.\n  We are concerned in the Senate about disparities that exist in our \nsociety, the dramatic difference between the haves and the have-nots. \nWe are very much concerned about that disparity, in the fields of \neducation as well as health care, in our committee.\n  If we look at the disparities, the percentage of children with unmet \nhealth needs before CHIP and after CHIP--this is the Kaiser Family \nFoundation--we see the difference between Blacks, represented by 38 \npercent, and Hispanics. If we look at it during CHIP, we see overall \nprogress, and we see the disparities reduced. This means we are looking \nat all children. We are concerned about all children, and the success, \naccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, has been dramatic.\n  One of the areas--and this is a typical one--is asthma. It is one \nthat has affected my family, and it is one in which there has been a \ndramatic increase over the last several years. Unquestionably, it is \nbecause of the administration's changes in environmental standards \nwhich put more poisons into the air, and I believe it is also because \nof an increase of poverty in our country. We have more children who are \npoor, more families who are poor than ever before.\n  Rather than looking at the escalation of asthma, if we look at unmet \nhealth needs of children, we see the dramatic difference in emergency \nvisits of children before CHIP and after CHIP, and this has had a \ndramatic impact on the wellness of children.\n  As has been pointed out by many of my colleagues--and I do not intend \nto take a great deal more time--this is an issue of priorities. We know \nthe program works. We know it is built on a delivery system which has \nbeen basically supported by the President. The Medicare prescription \ndrug program--I didn't agree with that delivery system, but the \nPresident strongly supported it. It is the law. The same delivery \nsystem is used in the CHIP program. It is based on the private use of \nprivate insurance, and it is paid for by, as we all know, an increase \nin the tobacco tax, which is going to mean additional benefits in \nhealth for children. Here is the cost: $35 billion over 5 years, $120 \nbillion for the cost of Iraq. Stated differently, it is $333 million a \nday; CHIP is $19 million.\n\n  Finally, this chart here really says it all. A quote from the mother \nof Alexiana Lewis:\n\n       If I miss a single appointment, I know she could lose her \n     eyesight. If I can't buy her medication, I know she could \n     lose her eyesight. If I didn't have MASSHealth, my daughter \n     would be blind.\n\n  This is one parent, and it is being replicated by parents all over \nthe country, by 6 million children and their parents. I hope we are \ngoing to have a solid vote in support of that program on the morrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there will be no more votes today. We have \ntried all day to have more votes, but it has been difficult to work \nthat out. We hope in the morning, at about 10:30, we can have as many \nas five votes--three to five votes. We are going to finish our work on \nhate crimes and SCHIP. That will require three to five votes. We hope \nwe can get that done with a unanimous consent request; otherwise, we \nwill work our way through it and the procedure will take care of most \nof it. I think there is a general feeling that this should be done. As \nindicated, I thought we were going to be able to have the votes today, \nbut for various reasons we were unable to do that. It has made it \ndifficult for the two managers of the bill, but, in fact, we have been \nable to work out some amendments that have been offered. I just wish we \ncould have done more.\n  I respect so much the work of our manager on this side and Senator \nWarner on the other side. They are certainly experienced at this, and \nwe are confident we will be able to draw to a close, hopefully in the \nnot too distant future, the Defense authorization bill and, shortly \nthereafter, move to the Defense appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S12121]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from Illinois would yield for just a \nmoment, I would only urge our colleagues--and I know Senator Warner \njoins me in this--we have over 300 amendments that have been filed. We \nare clearing some. We have cleared 10 more.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are up to 150 cleared.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have about 300 still that need to be addressed one way \nor the other. Either they are going to be resolved, voted on, or \ndropped. We need the full cooperation of every Senator to address this \nvery large number of amendments. We have made some progress in clearing \namendments. We had two votes today on important amendments. We look \nforward to those three to five votes in the morning. But we still need \nthe full cooperation of every Senator, and I would urge them to work \nwith our staffs to see if we can clear as many additional amendments as \npossible.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, if we spent 3 more days \non this bill, that means we would have to dispose of 100 amendments a \nday. If we spent 4 days on it, we would have to dispose of 75 \namendments a day. So these managers have done excellent work, and we \nknow we can't get through all these amendments, but there are a lot we \nneed to get through. It is important, and we will cooperate on this \nside in every way we can, and I am confident the minority will also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I was not on the floor earlier, but I \nsuspect the leader was discussing this bill as well as how we finish \nthe week.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Basically, I said there would be no more votes today; \nthat somewhere in the morning, around 10:30, we will have three to five \nvotes, three or four on hate crimes--hopefully, only two--and one on \nSCHIP. When we finish that, we will find out where we are in relation \nto this bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I concur completely with what the \nmajority leader has indicated. We have been working together to try to \nfigure out how we can wrap up the week. We have a number of other \nitems, as he suggests, including the CR, and we are hoping to be able \nto get all this processed at some point during the day tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we do have a lot to do. There are a number \nof other issues in addition to the CR that we have to finish before \nMonday. We have no choice. We have a farm bill we have to extend, and \nwe have a number of things we have to do. We are going to work together \nto see what we can do in that regard. It has been slow on this bill, \nbut in spite of that, I think we have had one of the best debates we \nhave had on this bill. On the two amendments we have dealt with, the \nKyl-Lieberman amendment and the Webb amendment, I think that was very \ngood debate. In addition, we had extremely good debate on the Biden-\nBrownback amendment. I always joke about the House saying: We are going \nto do this much this week. And I say: Well, we will do this much this \nweek and feel good about what we have done. We are getting to a point \nhere where we have the ability to see the light at the end of the \ntunnel, and we are pushing toward that goal, and that goal is Monday as \nthe drop-dead day on a number of things we have to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if there are no others speaking on this \nDefense authorization bill, I would like to address my remarks to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, who is still on the floor and who spoke to \nus on the SCHIP proposal for the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nwhich has been in place for 10 years and works for so many children so \neffectively.\n  I might correct the Senator's presentation in one regard. I just left \na meeting of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. The request of \nthis administration for the next year for the war in Iraq is $189 \nbillion--$189 billion. That comes out to about $15 billion a month that \nthey are asking for this war for the next year. It is my understanding \nthat this bill we are going to present to the President to provide \nhealth insurance for somewhere in the range of an additional 5 million \nkids is going to cost us $6 billion or $7 billion a year. So the war in \nIraq is costing us $15 billion a month; this program, which the \nPresident says we can't afford, to provide health insurance for our own \nchildren, will cost us about $7 billion a year--a year.\n  It would seem to me that a strong America begins at home. It begins \nwith our families, our kids, with our neighborhoods and communities, \nand I think the President has overlooked that. If we are going to be \nstrong for the future, we have to help our kids have the kind of health \ninsurance coverage that gives them a fighting chance. So I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The $35 billion will not be paid for by the taxpayers.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Which is really extraordinary. We have done the \neducation program, where we took some $20 billion from the lenders. \nThis $35 billion is going to be paid for with the increase in the \ncigarette tax, which in and of itself will have an extraordinarily \npositive impact in the quality of health for children in this country \nand to the whole problem and challenge of childhood addiction to \nnicotine. So I think it is important.\n  We hear a great deal about: Well, the figures the Senator mentioned \nare dramatic in terms of the choice which is before the Members \ntomorrow in terms of priorities. But you even add to that the fact that \nthe taxpayer is going to be spared that kind of additional burden, and \nit is difficult for many of us to understand the strong opposition of \nthe administration.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from Massachusetts that two \nout of three Americans support an increase in the tobacco tax for this \npurpose. It is a clearly positive thing for us to do. So unlike the \nIraq war, which we are not paying for at all in this instance, we are \npaying for children's health insurance with a tobacco tax, and I think \nthat is a much more responsible approach.\n  Mr. President, I have a statement here on the hate crime issue, but I \nsee two other colleagues on the floor, and I don't know what their \nschedules are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before my friend and colleague from \nIllinois sits down, I have a question. I am going to speak on hate \ncrimes, but that will be after the Senator from Vermont, who is \nwaiting.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Illinois a question. We, the \nDemocrats, have a reputation of, well, tax and spend, tax and spend. \nBut just seeing my colleague from Massachusetts here, I realized that \nin the two major bills we have just done--and my friend from Illinois \nhas mentioned one on higher education and one on children's health--A, \nwe have paid for them. Unlike what has been done on the other side, \nsay, with the prescription drug program, we paid for them. We are being \nfiscally responsible. And we didn't pay for them by hurting average \nfolks in terms of their taxes. The tobacco tax, which the Senator from \nMassachusetts just mentioned, and on the college tuition, we are paying \nfor that by making the banks pay a little more. Not a nickel of \ntaxpayer money is coming for that.\n  So I ask my colleague, how would he compare the record of the new \nmajority on fiscal responsibility compared to the old majority?\n  Mr. DURBIN. My colleague and friend from New York has served in both \nthe House and Senate, and he knows that often promises are made on \nimportant things we do. But we have kept our promise that we would have \na pay-as-you-go plan. As we came up with new ideas for legislation, we \npaid for them--much different from what we saw around here as we were \ndriven deeply into debt under the leadership of the other party.\n\n  The war in Iraq is a classic example. This President continues to \nwage this war and asks for money without any tax or cut in spending. He \njust adds to the deficit of this country--a deficit which, \nunfortunately, is out of control and makes us beholden, mortgaged, to \nsome of the largest countries in the world.\n  So I would say we have kept our promise. It is a pay-as-you-go \npromise.\n\n[[Page S12122]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3035\n\n  I would like to make this point on the hate crime amendment, and then \nI will defer to my colleagues, who may be speaking on the same subject.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is about to consider a bipartisan amendment \nto the Defense Department authorization bill dealing with hate crimes \nwhich broadens the scope of the Federal hate crime law in significant \nways. It is one of the most important pieces of civil rights \nlegislation in our time, and I am proud to cosponsor it.\n  Some people might ask: Haven't we moved beyond the need for this in \nthis modern age of the 21st century? Do we still really need a hate \ncrime law? Unfortunately, the answer is yes.\n  As Senator Kennedy said on the Senate floor:\n\n       At a time when our ideals are under attack by terrorists in \n     other lands, it is more important than ever to demonstrate \n     that we practice what we preach and that we are doing all we \n     can to root out bigotry and prejudice in our own country that \n     leads to violence here at home.\n\n  Sadly, there is no shortage of bigotry and violence here at home. In \nthe past week, there has been a national spotlight on Jena, LA, where \nWhite high school students put up nooses in a tree to intimidate \nAfrican-American students--nooses--the ancient symbol of hatred and \nlynching.\n  The problems with hate crimes and racial tension are not confined to \nthe South. Take a look at today's Washington Post. An article entitled \n``Colleges See Flare in Racial Incidents'' said that a noose was found \na few weeks ago at the University of Maryland outside the campus's \nAfrican-American cultural center. This past weekend, a swastika was \nspray-painted onto a car parked on that same campus.\n  My home State of Illinois is not immune to this same problem. Last \nmonth, a judge in Chicago awarded $1.3 million to two victims of \nvicious hate crimes that were committed a few months after September 11 \nin Chicago's West Loop. The victims--Amer Zaveri and Toby Paulose are \nAmerican-born citizens of Indian descent. The perpetrators yelled, \n``Are you Taliban?'' and ``Go back to your country'' before punching \nthem, assaulting them, kicking them, and smashing a beer bottle on one \nof their heads, causing facial fractures and lacerations.\n  Now, according to statistics compiled by the FBI, nearly 10,000 hate \ncrimes are committed in America each year. Other estimates put the \nnumber closer to 50,000. An increasing number are committed against \ngays and lesbians, representing nearly 15 percent of all hate crimes.\n  The response from some Republicans, not from all--Senator Gordon \nSmith of Oregon is a prominent cosponsor of the Kennedy bill on hate \ncrimes--but from some others, is that we need to study this issue. The \nstudies have been done over and over again. Sad to report, hate crimes \nare a reality in America today.\n  The existing Federal hate crime law was enacted 40 years ago, in \n1968. It was passed at the time of Martin Luther King's assassination. \nIt is an important law, but it is outdated. Its coverage is too narrow. \nUnless the hate crime falls within one of six very narrow areas, \nprosecutors can't use the law. For example, if it takes place in a \npublic school, the Government can prosecute, but not in a private \nschool.\n  This hate crime law we are considering would expand the categories of \npeople who would be covered and the incidents covered as well. The \ncurrent Federal law provides no coverage for hate crimes based on a \nvictim's sexual orientation, gender or disability. Sadly, hate crimes \ndata suggest that hate crimes based on sexual orientation are the third \nmost prevalent, after race and religion. Our laws should not ignore \nreality.\n  Some people have suggested that banning hate crimes is a violation of \nthe first amendment and the right to free speech. The Supreme Court has \nbeen very clear that is not the case. In 2003, in the case of Virginia \nv. Black, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of laws banning cross \nburning, one of the ultimate hate crimes. In her opinion, Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor wrote:\n\n       To this day, regardless of whether the message is a \n     political one or whether the message is also meant to \n     intimidate, the burning of a cross is a symbol of hate.\n\n  This week we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the integration of \nLittle Rock Central High School. Arkansas at that time was the \ncrucible, the laboratory for us to test whether America was an \naccepting, diverse nation. Those nine students and those who stood \nbehind them had the courage to step through those classroom doors and \nface the intimidation on the way. It is important the Senate have the \ncourage to confront the injustice of our time and pass the bipartisan \nKennedy-Smith hate crime amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I say to my distinguished counterpart, the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, we have tried real hard. This is the \nthird time we have taken up this Defense authorization bill. I \nunderstand the feelings Senator Levin, Senator Warner, and Senator \nMcCain have regarding this bill. Is this a good time to file cloture? I \ndon't think there is ever a good time. But I think that we have all had \na pretty good picture of what is happening on this bill. I would have \nto acknowledge that at some time, if the distinguished Republican \nleader had not filed cloture, then we would have filed cloture. Whether \nit would have been today is something we can talk about later. But I \ndon't feel in any way the Republican leader has surprised me. He has \nkept me posted about some of his feelings on this.\n  We have had a number of very complicated issues in this last couple \nof weeks because of the fiscal year drawing to a close. As a result of \nthat, we have procedural things that seem to always come up with the \nSenate. But in spite of having said all that, we have been able to \naccomplish a lot. It would have been much better had we not been \ninterrupted so many different times for various reasons, but that is \nwhat happened.\n  We have spent 15 days on this bill, 15 legislative days on this bill. \nOther than immigration, I don't think there is anything we have spent \nthis amount of time on during this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12122-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12122-S12123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I want to take a few brief moments to \nexplain my votes this afternoon on two amendments to the Defense \nauthorization bill. The first, a resolution offered by my good friend \nfrom Delaware, and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nBiden, expressed the Senate's support for helping the Iraqis to seek a \npolitical solution to the current conflict in that country by \nsupporting three Federal regions in Iraq.\n  It is still my position that the United States should not impose a \npolitical solution on the Iraqis to which Iraqis are opposed. According \nto recent polling in Iraq, it seems as though Iraqis are not yet ready \nto divide their country along these lines. However, sectarian divisions \nare already occurring by huge internal displacements in Iraq which are \ndirect results of the level of carnage and violence in that country. \nAnd if Iraqis should decide that they would like to devolve their \ncountry into three separate sectarian regions, and if they choose this \nmethod as the best means for ending the current conflict in that \ncountry, then I would wholeheartedly support that decision. This \nresolution calls for exploring that option, and if Iraqis decide to do \nso, then I will strongly support such action.\n  I am deeply worried by the language contained in the Kyl-Lieberman \namendment, and for what purposes this language was introduced. Let me \nbe very clear, the Iranian regime is behaving in deeply troubling ways, \nin its quest to secretly acquire nuclear weapons, to destabilize Iraq \nand Lebanon, and by calling for the destruction of the State of Israel. \nWe must deal with the various threats Iran poses in an effective, \nsmart, and multilateral way, and I am prepared to do just that.\n  But we must also learn the lessons of the runup to the Iraq war, when \nthis body passed seemingly innocuous nonbinding language that ended up \nhaving profound consequences. Our President must use robust diplomacy \nto address our concerns with Iran, not turn to the language in the Kyl \namendment to justify his action if he decides to draw this country into \nanother disastrous war of choice.\n  I wholeheartedly agree that we should increase the economic pressure \non the Revolutionary Guard, or any other entity of Iran, and that is \nwhy as chairman of the Banking Committee, I held a hearing to determine \nhow best to use targeted, robust, and effective sanctions against any \nelements in the Iranian regime who are supporting and exporting \nterrorism and extremism.\n  But this amendment would not increase economic pressure on the \nIranian regime--instead it would provide bellicose rhetoric which may \nserve as the basis of future military action against Iran. For that \nreason, I staunchly oppose it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an amendment that \nwould increase the maximum Federal age limit at which a member of the \nmilitary, who has been honorably discharged, may become a Federal law \nenforcement officer.\n  Military servicemembers make extraordinary sacrifices on our Nation's \nbehalf. They are the defenders of our freedoms, our liberties, and our \nsecurity. We owe each of them a great debt, and any appropriate \ncompensation we can offer is a step toward repaying that national \nobligation.\n  Many of our brave soldiers joined the world's finest military when \nthey were 18 years of age. Large numbers of them become career \nsoldiers, serving 20 years or more before retiring.\n  However, current U.S. law states that applicants to Federal law \nenforcement positions must be between 23 and 37 years old. A \nservicemember who joins the military at the age of 18 and serves \nhonorably for 20 years falls outside this federally mandated age range. \nI am sure my Senate colleagues would agree that members of the \nmilitary, with their training and experience, can be highly suited for \npositions in Federal law enforcement, and if otherwise qualified should \nnot be prohibited from further serving their country by an arbitrary, \nmaximum age limit.\n  My amendment would increase the maximum age for Federal law \nenforcement recruitment to 47 years old for military personnel who \nreceive an honorable discharge. This means that many more honorably \ndischarged military members will be able to seek employment with \nFederal law enforcement agencies. This amendment is an important tool \nin both recruiting and retaining fine servicemembers. It is my hope \nthat more would be willing to remain in the military, knowing that \nafter they complete 20 years in uniform, they will still have the \nopportunity to serve our country as Federal law enforcement officers.\n  I have heard from several servicemembers who are considering an early \ndeparture from the military so that they can become Federal law \nenforcement officers. It should be remembered that many of these \nsoldiers already have the necessary security clearances for these \npositions. Furthermore, I believe Federal law enforcement training \ncosts would be largely reduced because of the military training of \nthese individuals. The American people need qualified, competent law \nenforcement officers, and what greater pool from which to draw than \nexperienced and professional military retirees? I am anxious to see \nthis arbitrary retirement limit changed for military personnel and I \nencourage my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n\n[[Page S12124]]\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, in recent years, our country has seen a \nmajor shift in the way that our National Guard has been used. \nTraditionally, our Guard units have supplemented our active duty troops \nduring a major war or conflict. But as America faces ever-increasing \nmilitary challenges, we see these citizen soldiers now replacing active \nduty troops in operations around the world. Since September 11, many \nGuard members have been called to active duty for multiple tours, and \nthis is likely to continue in the foreseeable future.\n  The National Guard has played a critical role in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Currently, almost 15,000 \nguardsmen and women are deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan and 242,271 \nhave been deployed since the beginning of Operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. These tours have stretched our National Guard to the \nlimit, and have severely depleted our Guard's equipment. In reality, \nmuch of the equipment that is sent into theater never returns with the \nGuard units when their tour of duty is complete. This exacerbates the \nissue of equipment reset.\n  While we consider the strain that our current operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan are placing on our National Guard, we must also remember \nthat the Guard has another important responsibility: providing security \nat home. In the past few years, we have seen the valuable role that the \nArmy and Air National Guard play in providing support during domestic \nemergencies. I know that in my State of New Jersey, the National Guard \ncame to the rescue during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and was also \ninstrumental in helping during the aftermath of the flooding that \nwracked New Jersey last year. The guardsmen and women also provided \ncritical support in response to the hurricanes that severely damaged \nthe gulf coast in 2005. Unfortunately, our current military operations \nabroad have left our National Guard without much of the equipment it \nneeds to respond to some of the domestic emergencies I have just \nmentioned.\n  In February of this year, the National Guard Bureau released a report \nentitled ``National Guard Equipment Requirements,'' which detailed the \n``Essential 10'' equipment needs to support domestic missions. The \nshortfalls in equipment total $4 billion, and cover areas including \nlogistics, security, transportation, communications, medical, \nengineering, aviation, maintenance, civil support teams and force \nprotection, and join force headquarters and command and control. \nWithout the proper equipment, the National Guard will not be able to \nrespond as quickly and effectively in missions here at home.\n  We saw an example of this in May when tornadoes ripped through \nKansas. Although the Kansas National Guard was able to respond to the \ndisaster, Governor Sebelius spoke out about the challenges her State \nfaces due to the severe equipment shortages. National Guard units \nthroughout the country are facing such equipment shortfalls, and with \ntornadoes, floods, hurricanes, and forest fires affecting our nation \nannually, it is imperative that the National Guard have the equipment \nit needs to respond accordingly in the face of these emergencies.\n  That is why I introduced the recently passed amendment that expresses \nthe sense of Congress that the Army and Air National Guard should have \nsufficient equipment available to achieve their missions inside the \nUnited States and to protect the homeland.\n  This Congress always talks about supporting our troops--well we need \nto remember that supporting our troops means supporting the National \nGuard and providing them with the equipment they need not only for \nmissions abroad but here at home. In the coming months, I will be \nworking with my colleagues to see that this Congress provides the \nnecessary funding to address these severe equipment shortages. In the \nmeantime, I hope that the entire Senate will support this amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, our Nation's bomber fleet is a vital \nnational asset. Bombers today offer global reach, operational \nresponsiveness, and close air support for troops on the ground in ways \nthat their designers could never have imagined. While our bomber fleet \nis currently aging, there is virtually no chance that new long-range \nbombers will enter service before 2020.\n  If we remove bombers from our active force and do not furnish them \nwith critical upgrade programs, they will be irretrievably lost. This \nwill create a ``bathtub'' in bomber capabilities that will last over a \ndecade.\n  Over the last 2 years, the administration has proposed dramatically \ndownsizing our bomber force, particularly by cutting the B-52 force \nfrom 94 aircraft to 56. Neither the House nor the Senate found the \nadministration's arguments for cutting the bomber fleet persuasive. \nThey both concluded that making deep B-52 retirements would put at risk \nour military's ability to carry out the national security strategy. Let \nme quote from the House Armed Services Committee's report:\n\n       Committee also understands that the current B-52 combat \n     coded force structure is insufficient to meet combatant \n     commander requirements for conventional long range strike, if \n     the need should arise to conduct simultaneous operations in \n     two major regional conflicts.\n\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee had similar concerns:\n\n       The Committee is concerned that any further reduction in \n     the B-52H total aircraft inventory will create unacceptable \n     risk to national security and may prevent our ability to \n     strike the required conventional target set during times of \n     war.\n\n  Because of these concerns, last year Congress enacted defense \nlegislation allowing the retirement of only 18 B-52s, reducing the \nfleet to 76. But the law required that the savings from those \nretirements be devoted to modernizing the remaining bombers, and the \nlaw prohibited any further retirements until a next generation bomber \nwas available--probably around 2018.\n  I will ask that section 131 of the John Warner National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 be printed in the Record, along \nwith the relevant sections of the House and Senate Armed Services \nCommittees' reports on that law.\n  Unfortunately, there have been some efforts to try to find a way \naround that law. For a while, it looked like there might be an effort \nto play games with the assignments of the B-52 fleet, by doubling up \nthe assignments of aircraft that we now use for training and calling \nthem ``dual coded'' training and combat aircraft. Then, instead of \nretiring B-52s, they would simply mothball them. But mothballed \naircraft will do nothing to preserve our ability to fight and win two \nwars.\n  Based on the analysis of the Armed Services Committee and my own \nstaff's analysis, it is clear that slashing the size of our B-52 force \nwould significantly increase the risks we face in fighting and winning \ntwo nearly simultaneous contingencies. If we retired 38 B-52s, it would \nbe impossible for the Air Force to deploy a bomber force comparable to \nthe one we used during the initial days of the war in Iraq. During the \ninitial 30 days of combat in Iraq, the Air Force used more than 80 B-\n52s so it could sustain a deployed force of 42 B-52s at forward \noperating locations overseas. Obviously, the Air Force could not repeat \nthat feat with just 56 B-52s.\n  Moreover, the war in Iraq has tied down a large share of our land \nforces and increased our dependence on the Air Force for dealing with \nany additional crises. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Peter Pace \nhas made the situation very clear. He said, ``If another, [conflict] \npopped up tomorrow, regardless of where, . . . you would have the Navy \nand the Air Force being able to get there very quickly.''\n  Because we were concerned about the risks to our warfighting ability, \nlast year Congress barred the Pentagon from retiring B-52s until the \nsubmission of a comprehensive Bomber Roadmap study by an independent \nresearch institution. That study still has not been completed.\n  Some people have tried to tie the B-52 issue to an altogether \ndifferent question: whether the Air Force will be allowed to retire a \nlong list of old aircraft in its inventory that currently have \nrestrictions on their operation or are even grounded. Let me be clear. \nAs chairman of the Budget Committee, I strongly agree that we need to \nretire unserviceable aircraft. There is no point in paying to maintain \naircraft that we cannot fly.\n  The B-52 is not part of that problem. While it has flown for many \nyears, the B-52 is still a young aircraft in flying\n\n[[Page S12125]]\n\nhour terms. The Air Force has said that today's H-model B-52 is flyable \nfor another 30 to 40 years. Most commercial airliners have several \ntimes as many cycles per aircraft and airframe hours as the B-52, which \nspent most of the Cold War sitting alert on the ground.\n\n  In fact, the B-52 is in many ways the most valuable aircraft in our \ninventory. Today's B-52 has been modernized and can carry the widest \nrange of weapons of any aircraft we own. It has the highest mission \ncapable rate in the bomber force, and it costs the least to operate of \nany bomber. The FY 2006 reimbursement rate for the B-52 is $10,000 per \nflying hour less than the B-1B and $4,000 per flying hour less than the \nB-2.\n  Does it make sense to try to save money by cutting the portion of the \nbomber force that is by far the least expensive to operate and has the \nhighest utilization and mission capable rates? I don't think so.\n  The B-52 is an indispensable tool for our nation's military, being \nused in combat overseas on a daily basis. It is crucial that we \nmaintain a sizeable bomber force and that each plane is outfitted with \nthe most technologically advanced equipment.\n  The Conrad-Dorgan-Landrieu-Vitter amendment reinforces the law we \npassed last year requiring a B-52 force of no less than 76 aircraft. \nThis amendment requires that the 76 aircraft B-52 force include 63 \nactive aircraft, 11 backup aircraft and two reserve aircraft, just as \nit did in 2006. It will prohibit the Pentagon from reducing the \nmaintenance status of some B-52s and creating ``hangar queens'' that \nare not regularly flown.\n  The Conrad amendment also requires technological upgrades to the \nentire B-52 fleet, ensuring the planes are using the latest in defense \ntechnology. It states that the entire fleet must be kept in a ``common \nconfiguration.'' The Senate and House Armed Services Committees have \nalready authorized additional funding for B-52s to ensure that the full \n76 aircraft fleet is upgraded.\n  It makes absolutely no sense to try to save money by cutting the \ncheapest bombers to operate. With ongoing conflicts in Iraq, \nAfghanistan and elsewhere around the world, our Nation should \naccelerate the modernization of our bomber force rather than shrinking \nit.\n  I thank the distinguished managers of the bill for their support of \nthis amendment and look forward to working with them as the Defense \nauthorization bill moves toward enactment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the material to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       H.R. 5122 (National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2007)\n\n     SEC. 131. BOMBER FORCE STRUCTURE.\n\n       Requirement for B-52 Force Structure--\n       (1) Retirement limitation.--During the B-52 retirement \n     limitation period, the Secretary of the Air Force--\n       (A) may not retire more than 18 B-52 aircraft; and\n       (B) shall maintain not less than 44 such aircraft as \n     combat-coded aircraft.\n       (2) B-52 Retirement limitation period.--For purposes of \n     paragraph (1), the B-52 retirement limitation period is the \n     period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act and \n     ending on the date that is the earlier of--\n       (A) January 1, 2018\n       (A); and\n       (B) the date as of which a long-range strike replacement \n     aircraft with equal or greater capability than the B-52H \n     model aircraft has attained initial operational capability \n     status.\n       (b) Limitation on Retirement Pending Report on Bomber Force \n     Structure--\n       (1) Limitation.--No funds authorized to be appropriated for \n     the Department of Defense may be obligated or expended for \n     retiring any of the 93 B-52H bomber aircraft in service in \n     the Air Force as of the date of the enactment of this Act \n     until 45 days after, the date on which the Secretary of the \n     Air Force submits the report specified in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Report.--A report specified in this subsection is a \n     report submitted by the Secretary of the Air Force to the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives on the amount and type of bomber force \n     structure of the Air Force, including the matters specified \n     in paragraph (4).\n       (3) Amount and type of bomber force structure defined.--In \n     this subsection, the term ``amount and type of bomber force \n     structure'' means the number of each of the following types \n     of aircraft that are required to carry out the national \n     security strategy of the United States:\n       (A) B-2 bomber aircraft.\n       (B) B-52H bomber aircraft.\n       (C) B-1 bomber aircraft.\n       (4) Matter to be included.--A report under paragraph (2) \n     shall include the following:\n       (A) The plan of the Secretary of the Air Force for the \n     modernization of the B-52, B-1, and B-2 bomber aircraft \n     fleets.\n       (B) The amount and type of bomber force structure for the \n     conventional mission and strategic nuclear mission in \n     executing two overlapping ``swift defeat'' campaigns.\n       (C) A justification of the cost and projected savings of \n     any reductions to the B-52H bomber aircraft fleet as a result \n     of the retirement of the B-52H bomber aircraft covered by the \n     report.\n       (D) The life expectancy of each bomber aircraft to remain \n     in the bomber force structure.\n       (E) The capabilities of the bomber force structure that \n     would be replaced, augmented, or superseded by any new bomber \n     aircraft.\n       (5) Preparation of Report.--A report under paragraph (2) \n     shall be prepared by the Institute for Defense Analyses and \n     submitted to the Secretary of the Air Force for submittal by \n     the Secretary in accordance with that paragraph.\n                                  ____\n\n\n House Report 109-452 on H.R. 5122 (National Defense Authorization Act \n                              for FY 2007)\n\n\n                          B-52 force structure\n\n       The budget request included a proposal to retire 18 B-52 \n     aircraft in fiscal year 2007, and 20 B-52 aircraft in fiscal \n     year 2008.\n       The committee understands that the 2006 Quadrennial Defense \n     Review directed the Air Force to reduce the B-52 force to 56 \n     aircraft and use the savings to fully modernize the remaining \n     B-52s, B-1s, and B-2s to support global strike operations. \n     However, the committee understands that the estimated $680.0 \n     million savings garnered from the proposed B-52 retirement in \n     the remaining Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) has not \n     been reinvested into modernizing the current bomber force, \n     but has instead been applied towards Air Force \n     transformational activities. The committee also understands \n     that the current B-52 combat coded force structure is \n     insufficient to meet combatant commander requirements for \n     conventional long-range strike, if the need should arise to \n     conduct simultaneous operations in two major regional \n     conflicts.\n       Additionally, the committee is concerned that the decision \n     to retire 38 B-52 aircraft is primarily based on the nuclear \n     warfighting requirements of the Strategic Integrated \n     Operations Plan, and did not consider the role of the B-52 in \n     meeting combatant commander's conventional long-range strike \n     requirements. The committee disagrees with the decision to \n     reduce the B-52 force structure given that the Air Force has \n     not begun the planned analysis of alternatives to determine \n     what conventional long-range strike capabilities and \n     platforms will be needed to meet future requirements.\n       The committee is deeply concerned that retirement of any B-\n     52 aircraft prior to a replacement long-range strike aircraft \n     reaching initial operational capability status is premature. \n     Further, the committee strongly opposes a strategy to reduce \n     capability in present day conventional long-range strike \n     capability in order to provide funding for a replacement \n     capability that is not projected to achieve initial \n     operational capability until well into the future.\n       Therefore, the committee included a provision (section 131) \n     in this Act that would prohibit the Air Force from retiring \n     any B-52 aircraft, except for the one B-52 aircraft no longer \n     in use by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     for testing.\n       Additionally, this section would require the Air Force to \n     maintain a minimum B-52 force structure of 44 combat coded \n     aircraft until the year 2018, or until a long-range strike \n     replacement aircraft with equal or greater capability than \n     the B-52H model has attained initial operational capability \n     status.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Senate Report 109-254 on S. 2766 (National Defense Authorization Act \n                              for FY 2007)\n\n\n      Limitation on retirement of B-52H bomber aircraft (sec. 144)\n\n       The committee recommends a provision that would authorize \n     the Secretary of the Air Force to retire up to and including \n     18 B-52H aircraft of the Air Force. The committee expects the \n     remaining B-52H aircraft inventory to be maintained in a \n     common aircraft configuration that includes the Electronic \n     Countermeasure Improvement, the Avionics Mid-life \n     Improvement, and the Combat Network Communication Technology \n     modification efforts. The committee expects no further \n     reduction in the B-52H total aircraft inventory, including \n     the current inventory levels for combat coded Primary Mission \n     Aircraft Inventory and Primary Training Aircraft Inventory. \n     The committee is concerned that any further reduction in the \n     B-52H total aircraft inventory will create unacceptable risk \n     to our national security and may prevent our ability to \n     strike the required conventional target set during times of \n     war.\n\n\n             Retirement of B-52H bomber aircraft (sec. 145)\n\n       The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit \n     the use of any funds available to the Department of Defense \n     from being obligated or expended for retiring or dismantling \n     any of the 93 B-52H bomber aircraft in service in the Air \n     Force as of June\n\n[[Page S12126]]\n\n     1, 2006, until 30 days after the Secretary of the Air Force \n     submits to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and \n     the House of Representatives a report on the bomber force \n     structure. The committee directs that the report shall be \n     conducted by the Institute for Defense Analyses and provided \n     to the Secretary of the Air Force for transmittal to \n     Congress. The committee is troubled that the Air Force would \n     reduce the B-52 bomber fleet without a comprehensive analysis \n     of the bomber force structure similar to the last \n     comprehensive long range bomber study, which was conducted in \n     1999.\n                                  ____\n\n\nConference Report 109-702 on H.R. 5122 (National Defense Authorization \n                            Act for FY 2007)\n\n\n                   Bomber force structure (sec. 131)\n\n       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 131) that would \n     prohibit the Air Force from retiring any B-52 aircraft, \n     except for the one B-52 aircraft no longer in use by the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration for testing. \n     The provision would require the Air Force to maintain a \n     minimum of 44 B-52H combat coded aircraft until the year 2018 \n     or until a long-range strike replacement aircraft with equal \n     or greater capability than the B-52H model has attained \n     initial operational capability.\n       The Senate amendment contained similar provisions (secs. \n     144-145). Section 144 would allow the Secretary of the Air \n     Force to retire up to 18 B-52H bomber aircraft in fiscal year \n     2007. Section 145 would prevent the obligation or expenditure \n     of funds for the retirement or dismantling of any of the 93 \n     B-52H bomber aircraft in service in the Air Force as of June \n     1, 2006, until the Secretary submits to the Committees on \n     Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     a report on the amount and type of bomber force structure \n     required to carry out the National Security Strategy of the \n     United States.\n       The Senate recedes with an amendment that would authorize \n     the Secretary to retire up to 18 B-52H bomber aircraft, but \n     maintain not less than 44 combat coded B-52H bomber aircraft, \n     beginning 45 days after the Secretary submits to the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives a report prepared by the Institute for \n     Defense Analyses on the amount and type of bomber force \n     structure required to carry out the National Security \n     Strategy of the United States.

I ask unanimous consent we now proceed to a period for \nmorning business with Senators permitted to speak therein for a period \nof up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nMatthew Shepard Act as an amendment to the DOD authorization bill.\n  Federal hate crimes legislation is a much-needed and long missing \npiece of the civil rights and criminal law puzzle.\n  First, I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nKennedy, for his determination and leadership on this bipartisan \namendment.\n  I would also like to thank my friends and colleagues--Majority Leader \nReid and Chairman Levin--for their support of hate crimes legislation \nand this amendment. Many people had amendments they wanted on this \nbill, but Senator Levin and Senator Reid understood the importance of \nthis legislation.\n  Dr. King once said ``In order to answer the question, `where do we go \nfrom here?'. . . we must first honestly recognize where we are now.''\n  We are still in a time where racism and other hatred are ever-\npresent.\n  We are still in a time when our old scars and wounds from times past \nhave not healed.\n  Yes, we have made progress, but all of us know we have a long way to \ngo. And the only way we can get there is if we travel together, as one \nNation.\n  And if our Federal Government can say with one strong, unified voice \nthat crimes based on hatred will not be tolerated, then that is a step \nforward.\n  And we can also say that those hate-mongers who commit these crimes \nwill not get off lightly; but rather will pay the consequences of \ncommitting a crime against a larger community.\n  We can all say this together by voting for the Matthew Shepard Act \nbefore us today. The act is named for a brave and courageous \nindividual, who was killed simply because of who he was. This act \ndeserves a quick and strong passage.\n  We have been here before. In 2004, this body passed hate crimes \nlegislation, only to see it stripped away in conference. And I stand \nbefore my colleagues today to say--it is time to pass this legislation \nonce again.\n  Current Federal hate crime laws are inadequate to deal with the \nrising tide of hate crimes that are tearing at the very fabric of our \ncommunities.\n  This legislation would remove the ``federally protected activity'' \nrequirement that currently exists, and also expand the groups of \nindividuals that are covered by Federal law including sexual \norientation.\n  In addition, this legislation gives much needed resources and \nassistance to State and local law enforcement officials in \ninvestigating and prosecuting these crimes.\n  Let me clear, this legislation allows the Federal Government to act \nonly with the consent of State or local law enforcement officials.\n  This law can be seen as a backstop--in case State hate crime laws do \nnot cover a particular crime, or if State or local officials need the \nresources of Federal law enforcement.\n  This should assuage any federalism concerns that some of my \ncolleagues may have.\n  Additionally, Congress has the clear mandate to act in this arena, \nbased on both our authority under the commerce clause and the 13th \namendment.\n  This type of crime--violence based on a person's skin color, \nreligion, ethnicity, or other traits and characteristics, are as old as \nslavery itself. It is unconscionable. Matthew Shepard was killed \nbecause of his sexual orientation. Who can defend that? Who can say we \nshould not increase the strength of the laws to deal with that hatred, \nbigotry and nastiness?\n  Hate crimes differ from other crimes because the criminals target \ngroups of individuals who have been traditionally marginalized or \nstigmatized in our society.\n  This violence directly affects an individual's ability to feel safe \nand secure in a particular location, and has the effect of forcing \npeople from their homes, or impeding their ability to travel.\n  Additionally, hate crimes are greater crimes. These crimes affect an \nentire community. They are not aimed at one individual. In fact, they \nare often not aimed at the individual upon whom they are committed but, \nrather, a much broader group. In that sense, these crimes are anti-\nAmerican. They fly in the face of American pluralism, ``E Pluribus \nUnum'' that is on every dollar bill we see. Yes, out of many, one. \nThose who commit hate crimes are saying: No, there are certain groups \nof people who should not become part of the American fabric.\n\n  What could be more un-American than that?\n  Hate crimes must stop. The violence directly affects an individual's \nability to feel safe and secure in a particular location and has the \neffect of forcing people from their homes or impeding their ability to \ntravel. But, additionally, they are greater crimes because they affect \nan entire community, not just one individual. In that way, these crimes \nhurt all of us--the American community.\n  Because of that, the perpetrators of these crimes should be punished \nfor their actions; both Federal and local law enforcement working \ntogether to punish the perpetrator is an important and sometimes \nnecessary signal showing that violence motivated by hatred\n\n[[Page S12127]]\n\nis not tolerated at any level. This legislation enjoys a broad range of \nsupport from numerous civil rights organizations to the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association; rightfully so, since this affects all \nof us as Americans. I urge my colleague to vote for this important \npiece of civil rights and criminal law.\n  I hope we will get an overwhelming vote from both sides of the aisle, \na condemnation of hatred, a condemnation of pointing to a particular \ngroup and saying: You don't belong. You can be subject to vicious and \nnasty crimes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12127-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12127-S12128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HATE CRIMES\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, first, I wanted to make some comments \nabout the hate crimes bill. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that bill. \nActually, this came out of my work as a prosecutor in Minnesota. We had \na number of cases that involved crimes that were motivated by hate. \nSometimes they were found to be hate crimes under our law; sometimes \nthey were not. The ones I remember most--the little 14-year-old boy \nshot in the middle of the day by a guy who said he wanted to go out and \nkill a Black kid on Martin Luther King Day.\n  We had a Hispanic young man who could only speak Spanish, working in \na factory, and his boss got mad at him because he didn't speak English \nand he was speaking Spanish and he took a 2 by 4 and hit him over the \nhead.\n  We had a temple that was desecrated. We had a number of cases, but \nwhat I most remember about this was when the hate crimes bill was first \nintroduced in Washington, I had the honor of introducing President \nClinton when he announced his support for the hate crimes bill.\n  Before we went into the event, I got to meet the investigators in the \nMatthew Shepard case, two burly cops from Wyoming. They talked about \nthe fact that until they had investigated that case, they had not dealt \nwith ideas of what this victim's life was like. They did not want to \nthink what his life was like. And then they got to know the family in \nthat case, they got to know the mom, and they got to know the people \nsurrounding Matthew Shepard, and their own lives were changed forever. \nI hope that by passing this bill, by doing the right thing, we can \nchange the lives of other Matthew Shepards, and other victims of hate \ncrimes.\n\n\n                                 SCHIP\n\n  I did come tonight, Mr. President, on the eve of what I hope will be \na victory for the children and families in Minnesota and the Nation--\npassage of the children's health insurance reauthorization bill.\n  I come to remind my colleague of the weight of the situation \npresented to us. We have the opportunity to better the lives for \nmillions of children, children and low-income families. We can do it by \nlifting the burden and lessening the struggle that confronts those who \nare uninsured.\n  Today, 45 million Americans are living without access to affordable \nhealth care. The worst part of it, the saddest part of it, is that 9 \nmillion of them are children and they are uninsured. Kids without \naccess to affordable health care are at an enormous risk, an enormous \ndisadvantage as they grow up and start to make their life in this \nworld. Children without health coverage are less likely to get basic \npreventive care, less likely to see a doctor regularly, and less likely \nto perform well in school. Children without health coverage are often \nmore likely to show up at the hospital sicker and more likely to \ndevelop costly chronic diseases.\n  I used to represent the biggest emergency health care center in our \nState, Hennepin County Medical Center, when I was Hennepin County \nAttorney. I can tell you this, when people do not have health care, \nwhen children do not have health care, they do have a doctor. The \ndoctor is the emergency room, and we all pay for it. That is why making \nsure that people have health insurance, that these children have health \ninsurance, is actually, in the end, better for all of us, better for \ntaxpayers and certainly better for the kids.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program was established to reverse \nthe troubling problem of uninsured youth. It is a successful program \nthat deserves to reach even more children. This is important because, \nfirst, it is the decent thing to do for American kids, who, through no \nfault of their own, are growing up in families who simply cannot afford \nhealth care. But it is also important because it is something that is \ngood for all of us, and something that is important because it is a \nsmart investment. It is a smart investment to make sure these kids get \npreventive care. It is a smart investment to help America's children \ngrow up as healthy as they can be.\n  I was at a senior center the other day, and I told the seniors: The \nreason you should care about this is you need someone who is going to \npay your Social Security in the end. We need kids who grow up who can \nparticipate in our economy and can work. It is a smart investment to \nhave America's children in school, focused on learning, rather than \ndistracted by sickness or injury. It is a smart investment to have \nAmerica's children get medical care through a sensible system of health \ninsurance rather than having them end up in a hospital emergency room \nat the taxpayers' expense.\n  When my daughter was born, she was very sick. She couldn't swallow. \nWe did not know how long she was going to be in the hospital. She \nactually could not swallow for about a year and a half, and she was fed \nthrough a tube. So I saw firsthand the struggle these families go \nthrough. She is doing so well today, and it was because she had good, \nexcellent health care at Minneapolis Children's Hospital.\n  Well, not all families have access to that health care. When I think \nof what happened to her and how she was able to get stronger and \nstronger, even though she was this tiny little baby on an x-ray \nmachine, I think all kids should have that right.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush and his administration continue to \nfight efforts to expand SCHIP, a popular and effective program. The \nadministration recently put in place a restrictive rule that makes it \nnearly impossible for States such as Minnesota to expand their program.\n  I want to remind the President this issue is not about scoring \npolitical points or pushing an ideology. It is about bettering the \nlives of America's future generation. Today we are making a choice, \neither to support a proven, effective program that has helped children \nin all States or supporting the status quo which could lead to more \nkids losing health care coverage as States struggle to make ends meet.\n  If the Children's Health Insurance Program fails to pass the Senate \nor the President chooses to veto its reauthorization and deny children \naccess to this vital program, the consequences could prove dire for \nMinnesota's children and families. It is estimated that an additional \n35,000 Minnesotans who would otherwise be uninsured would be enrolled \nin this program should this bill be signed into law. If the President \nuses his veto power, he will deny health care to 86,000 uninsured \nMinnesotan children who may have been enrolled with the passage of this \nbill. From a fiscal standpoint, our State once again loses out if this \nbill fails to pass. With changes in the allotment program and the \nformula, Minnesota would receive an increase of over $50 million in \nfiscal year 2008 to fund our children's health insurance and Medicaid \nProgram. If the bill fails, Minnesota would be presented with a funding \nshortfall leaving low-income families in a frightening situation.\n  This program is very important to our State. Our Governor, a \nRepublican Governor, supports it, as has the Governors Association. He \nhas written letters asking us to approve this bill.\n  We are proud to have one of the lowest rates of uninsured in our \nState in the Nation, partially because of this program, and partly \nbecause we have been innovative in bolstering coverage for low-income \nkids and their parents. Since Minnesota was ahead of the curve in \ncovering kids before this program was created, Minnesota uses a portion \nof these Federal dollars to provide coverage to their parents. This is \nbecause ample evidence proves that when parents get coverage, kids are \nmore likely to have health coverage. I am glad to see that the \ncompromise\n\n[[Page S12128]]\n\nbill we reached largely retains the parental coverage in these special \ncases.\n  Many of my colleagues have expressed concern about the CHIP program \nreplacing private insurance. I am reminded, though, of the testimony of \nCBO Director Orszag who reported to the Finance Committee this summer \nthat this program is about as efficient as a program can be.\n  That being said, this bipartisan legislation makes an effort to \nmitigate the replacement of private insurance by requiring GAO and the \nInstitute of Medicine to report on best practices for enrolling low-\nincome children who need assistance the most. It requires the Secretary \nto help States implement those methods. I believe this rational \napproach will prove to be effective in reducing crowdout and will \nprotect the State's flexibility, contrary to the Bush administration's \noverly restrictive rule that essentially bars States from expanding \ntheir program. I do not know why you would want to bar States from \nexpanding their program when we are living in a time when more and more \nchildren have less and less health coverage.\n  When I went around my State in the last 2 years, I would go to cafes \nand we would think maybe 10 people would show up, so we would set the \ntable up with 10 chairs. Then 100 people would show up. These were \nmiddle-income people, lower income people. I finally realized when you \nhave got less money in your pocket, when health care premiums go up 100 \npercent, as they have in our State in the last decade, you feel it \nfirst in your pocket. When it costs 100 percent more to go to college, \nas it does at the University of Minnesota in the last 10 years, and you \nare a middle-class person, a low-income person, you feel it first in \nyour pocket.\n  That is what has been going on in this country. There has been an \nenormous shift of resources away from the great majority of people in \nthis country who are just trying to get by, to the very top echelon of \npeople in this country.\n  We are trying to reverse that with this Congress. We are trying to \nchange that with this Congress. We need vital programs such as \nchildren's health insurance more than ever, especially as these rising \nhealth care costs force families to tighten their budget.\n  The President should reconsider his threat to veto, and my colleagues \nwho say they are against this bipartisan compromise legislation should \nreconsider their opposition. I thank the Finance Committee for their \nefforts to bring this bill to the floor, and to expand this important, \nsuccessful initiative. It is not only good for American kids, it is \ngood for our families, it is good for all of us.\n  When I think about the health care my daughter got when she could not \neven swallow and all of the doctors who were there to help her and the \nnurses who were there to help her, all kids should have that kind of \nbeginning. That is what this bill is about.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for what time I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12128-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12128-S12131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SCHIP\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, soon the Senate will be debating the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. I might refer to that from time to \ntime as CHIP, C-H-I-P, Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  This program is sunsetting in a week. The program was started 10 \nyears ago, a product of a Republican-led Congress. It is a targeted \nprogram. It is a program designed to provide affordable health coverage \nfor low-income children of working families. Those are families, \nworking families, who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but \nstruggle to afford private insurance and may not even have it.\n  Last July, because this program has to be reauthorized right now, the \nSenate Finance Committee reported bipartisan legislation to enhance and \nimprove CHIP by a strong vote of 17 to 4.\n  In August, the Senate passed the Finance bill with the same \nbipartisan support by a vote of 68 to 31. On Tuesday, 265 Members of \nthe House of Representatives voted for the bill that now will be before \nthe Senate. That bill is a product of informal conferencing between the \nHouse and Senate. Clearly, we have a bill with strong bipartisan \nsupport. I want to emphasize that because this is the way the Senate \nFinance Committee has operated over a long period of time, both with \nRepublicans in control and Democrats in control. Senator Baucus worked \nvery closely with me when we were in the majority. Senator Baucus has \ncontinued that working relationship now that Democrats control the \nCongress and he is chairman of the committee. I welcome and appreciate \nthat bipartisan leadership. It is obviously represented in this product \nthat will soon be before the Senate.\n  This legislation maintains the fundamental provisions of the Senate. \nI want to emphasize that it maintains the fundamental provisions of the \nSenate bill not to denigrate the work of the House of Representatives \nbut as a reflection of the fact that we had to work out something that \nwould not be filibustered in the Senate. In the House of \nRepresentatives they don't have such provisions for filibuster. The \nHouse had some deference to the Senate. I appreciate that. But I also \nappreciate the fact that a lot of my colleagues--and these are \nRepublican colleagues to whom I refer, not Democratic colleagues--said \nso often during the months of consideration of this bill before we \nfinally passed it the first time that this $35 billion didn't mean much \nthat we passed in the Senate because the House of Representatives \npassed a $50 billion CHIP bill and it would come back much bigger. I \ntried to say to my colleagues at that particular time that there would \nhave to be a realization that if we were going to avoid a filibuster in \nthe Senate, we would have to have something closer to the Senate \nprovisions than the House. So I emphasize that this is pretty much the \nlegislation the Senate originally passed, albeit right now it is a \ncompromise between the House and Senate. There was a cap on new \nspending of $35 billion. There are no Medicare provisions in this bill \nas there were in the Senate bill. Spending is paid for by an increase \nin the cigarette tax. I commend the majority in the House and Senate \nfor cooperating with Senate Republicans and for working with us on our \npriorities during the negotiations that led to this agreement. This \ncompromise agreement is consistent with the principles we put forth in \nthe Senate bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would my friend yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Of course I will.\n  Mr. REID. I was in my office with the TV on listening to my friend \nfrom Iowa. I was compelled to come to the Chamber. I have been in \nWashington for a long time as a Member of Congress. I served in other \noffices before I came. All my adult life I have been involved in \ngovernment one way or the other. They were all part-time jobs until I \ncame back. The reason I came to the floor is that in my experience over \nall these many years I have rarely seen anyone with the leadership that \nthis ranking member, former chairman of the Finance Committee, offered \nwith this very difficult children's health issue. I say that without \nqualification. I have said it in closed meetings, and I have said it in \npublic meetings, and I say it before the American people this \nafternoon. I wish we could have done more with this. I wish we could \nhave done more. But, as I said, and as the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Iowa heard me say in my office, in my years in government, I have \nspent more time on this issue than anything else I have ever worked on. \nWe could not be at the point we are now but for the Senator from Iowa.\n  It has been very difficult. The House had to give up a tremendous \namount of what they wanted. The Senator from Iowa and I both served in \nthe House. They are two different institutions. It is difficult for the \nHouse, from my having served there, to understand and appreciate the \ndifficulties we have here.\n\n[[Page S12129]]\n\n  I don't know how I can say more than what I have said. I am impressed \nwith the way Senator Grassley has handled this bill. We had difficult \nissues that came with the House because they had so much, and we were \nonly going to offer them a lot less than what they wanted. But the \nSenator from Iowa was firm. He was gracious. He was a gentleman through \nit all.\n  As I have told a number of people, with Chuck Grassley, no one ever \nhas to wonder how he stands. It is not ``I will go talk to my staff,'' \nor ``I will get back to you.'' He told us in those meetings what he \ncould do and what he couldn't. I was compelled to come to the floor \nbecause we had a real gesture of statesmanship by the Senator from Iowa \nwith this SCHIP legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senate majority \nleader leaves, I thank him for those very kind remarks. I also want to \nrecognize him. Without his being an honest broker as an intermediary \nbetween the House and the Senate, particularly among Democrats, I don't \nthink we would be here either. I appreciate that very much. As a person \nwho has worked hard on this for 4 months, it wouldn't have happened \nwithout the Senate majority leader as well. I thank him very much.\n  Getting back to the bill, I want to explain that this is \nfundamentally the Senate bill. We had a cap on new spending at $35 \nbillion. That is where the Senate was. The Senate didn't have any \nMedicare provisions in their bill. The House did. We didn't have any in \nour bill, the House had Medicare provisions in theirs. Those are \ndropped out. There is a lot of Medicare provisions that we must act on, \nbut Senator Baucus and I want to do that as separate pieces of \nlegislation. We will do that, and we have committed to the House to do \nthat.\n  Spending is paid for by an increase in the cigarette tax. That is \nsimilar in both the House and Senate. I do want to commend the majority \nin the House and Senate for cooperating with Senate Republicans and for \nworking with our priorities during the negotiations that led to this \nagreement. This compromise agreement is consistent with principles that \nwe put forth in the Senate bill. I made clear during the debate on the \nbipartisan Senate bill before we originally passed it that the Senate \nwent as far as I was willing to go in terms of spending and politics. \nIt makes sense that we stayed true to the Senate bill. The Senate, \nafter all, had a veto-proof majority. So it made sense to stay as close \nas possible to that successful formula, if the President would go \nthrough with his statement of veto and actually veto it.\n  The legislation before this body maintains all of the key policy \nprovisions of the Senate-passed bill. This bipartisan bill refocuses \nthe program on low-income children. It phases adults off the program. \nIt prohibits a new waiver for parent coverage. It reduces the Federal \nmatch rate for States that cover parents. It includes new improvements \nto reduce the substitution of public coverage for private coverage. \nThis compromise bill maintains the focus on low-income uninsured \nchildren and adds coverage for more than 3 million low-income children.\n\n  The compromise bill discourages States from covering higher income \nkids by reducing the Federal matching rate for States that wish to \nexpand eligibility over 300 percent of Federal poverty limits. It \nrewards States that cover more low-income kids by providing targeted \nincentives to States that increase enrollment for coverage of low-\nincome kids. So there is a very clear message to the States, all 50 \nStates: Cover your poorest kids, meaning your kids from low-income \nfamilies, first. Don't spend money on childless adults, as we heard so \noften during the debate. The word CHIP has no A in it. It is for \nchildren, not adults. Don't spend money on parents unless you can prove \nyou are covering low-income kids. Don't spend money on higher income \nkids unless you can prove that your State is covering your lower income \nkids first. It is all there in black and white. Everybody can read it.\n  I get a sense, talking to some of my colleagues, that they haven't \nread what we are going to be voting on. Anyone who suggests this bill \nis an expansion to higher income kids or other populations, as has been \ndone under some waivers given by the Bush administration, is simply not \nreading the bill.\n  Since the Senate passed a bill the first time, the subject of \ncrowdout has become a lot more important in the debate. I want to \ndefine the word ``crowdout.'' That is the substitution of public \ncoverage for people who were previously in private insurance, \nindividual or corporate, health care policies. Crowdout occurs in CHIP \nbecause the CHIP benefit is attractive and there is no penalty for \nrefusing private coverage if you are eligible for public coverage.\n  On August 17, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services put out a \nletter giving States new instructions on how to address the crowdout, \ntrying to stop going from private coverage to the CHIP program. I \nappreciate the administration's willingness to engage this issue. They \nhave some very good ideas. But I also think there are some flaws in \nthat policy stated on August 17 by the Secretary of HHS. States are \nsupposed to cover 95 percent of the lowest income kids under that \npolicy statement. But it has been a month since they have issued the \npolicy statement, and CMS still cannot explain what data States should \nbe using to make that determination about 95 percent. Personally, I \nbelieve CMS should have answers before they issue policies. If they \nstill can't explain how it works a month later, I believe, as the \nsaying goes, they obviously aren't ready for prime time. So the \ncompromise bill that is before the Senate and passed the House last \nnight replaces the CMS letter with a more thoughtful, reasonable \napproach.\n  The Government Accountability Office and the Institute of Medicine \nwould produce analyses on the most accurate and reliable way to measure \nthe rate of public and private insurance coverage and on best practices \nby States that they would take to address crowdout problems because we \ndon't want to create a public program that moves people from one \nprivate coverage to the other. That has happened to some extent over \nthe last few years. We don't want to go further. This deals with that \nproblem. We want to talk about people who don't have any health \ncoverage rather than moving people from private to public.\n  Following the two reports that are referred to by the Institute of \nMedicine, as well as the Government Accountability Office, the \nSecretary, in consultation with the States, under this bill will \ndevelop crowdout best practices recommendations for the States to \nconsider and develop a uniform set of data points for States to track \nand report on coverage of children below 200 percent of Federal poverty \nguidelines and on crowdout.\n  Next, States that extend CHIP coverage to children above 300 percent \nFPL must submit to the Secretary a State plan amendment describing how \nthey will address crowdout for this population, encouraging the best \npractices recommended by the Secretary to limit moving people from \nprivate coverage to public. After October 1, 2010, Federal matching \npayments will not be permitted to States that cover children whose \nfamilies' income exceeds 300 percent of poverty, if the State does not \nmeet a target for the percentage of children at or below 200 percent of \npoverty enrolled in CHIP because we want the emphasis upon low-income \nchildren being covered. And at the lower income level, less have to \nhave insurance in the private sector as opposed to higher income people \nmaybe having to have that. So, simply put, cover lower income kids \nfirst or the State does not get money to cover higher income kids.\n\n  Now, I know some people are obsessed with the State of New York in \ntheir efforts to cover kids up to 400 percent of poverty. It seems to \ncome up in the talking points of every person who is against the \nlegislation now before the Senate. This bill does not change the CHIP \neligibility rules in any way--not one bit. This bill does not expand \nthe CHIP program to cover middle-income families or higher income kids. \nIt does not do it. The bill actually goes in the other direction. The \nreal fact is the bill makes it very difficult for any State to go above \n300 percent of poverty. It will make it very difficult for New Jersey, \nthe only State currently covering kids above 300 percent of poverty, to \ncontinue to do so if they do not do a better job of covering low-income \nkids.\n\n[[Page S12130]]\n\n  If you are concerned about the State of New York, well, do not waste \nyour time looking at this bill. You will not find answers to New York's \nfate here in this legislation. The answer is where it has always been--\nin the office of the Secretary of HHS, Mike Leavitt. Only he has the \nauthority to allow any State to cover children up to 400 percent of \npoverty. The authority to approve what States do with the CHIP program \nrests with him and no one else. This bill does nothing to change that \nauthority. That is a fact. I heartily encourage those of you who have \nnot read the bill and are talking along this line to read the bill. You \nwill find out that what I have just said is a fact. It is all there in \nblack and white.\n  I also want to say a few words about the President's position on this \nbill and speak directly to the President, as I spoke to him on the \nphone at 10 minutes to 9 last Thursday about why he should not veto \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate that you are not--or at least there \nare words out that you are not--going to support this bill, that you \nmight veto it. I would hope, Mr. President, that you would reconsider. \nI would hope that you would sign this bill. President Bush, you \nyourself made a commitment to covering more children. I could quote \nseveral times you have said this. But I will go back to something I \nheard you say personally. It was during the Republican National \nConvention in New York City. Mr. President, you were very firm on this \npoint. Here is what you said. I want to quote what you said:\n\n       America's children must also have a healthy start in life. \n     In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll \n     millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up \n     for the government's health insurance programs. We will not \n     allow a lack of attention or information to stand between \n     these children and the health care they need.\n\n  So, Mr. President, that is what you said back at the Republican \nConvention. You were reelected. You have a lot of mandates you are \ntrying to carry out. This Republican Senator is trying to help you \ncarry out that mandate you were elected on based on that speech you \nmade.\n  I think that you, Mr. President, were pretty clear in your \nconvictions then. I would like to repeat your words because I think \nthey are very important. President Bush, you said that you would ``lead \nan aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children . . . [in] the \ngovernment's health insurance programs.'' That is the end of your \nquote. I am happy to make sure we fulfill that commitment you made, \nPresident Bush, but I believe your current budget, where you suggested \n$5 billion more, does not do the job. I happen to agree with your \npolicy. I think this bill carries out your policy. But I do not think, \nPresident Bush, this bill can do that. You obviously cannot do that for \nthe $5 billion more you have in your bill.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reports that your budget proposal, \nPresident Bush, for SCHIP for fiscal year 2008 would result in a loss \nof coverage--not an increase of coverage that you say you want--a loss \nof coverage of 1.4 million children and pregnant women. Increasing the \nnumbers of uninsured children is clearly not the goal you expressed or \nwhat we want to accomplish in our legislation. So we carry out the \npolicies of covering the kids you want to cover with the amount of \nmoney that will do it. That is what we have done in this legislation \nbefore us.\n  Now, this bill does not warrant the overheated rhetoric we heard in \nthe House last night.\n  I want to say to the President--before I get on to the point about \nwhat was said in the House last night--also, the President has another \npolicy he wanted to work into this SCHIP reauthorization. He wanted to \nuse the private sector and use the tax deductibility of individual \npolicies to cover some--and even a great amount--of uninsured people. \nHe thought the SCHIP bill would be a vehicle to do that. I agree with \nthe President's policy on doing that.\n  There was a period of time--during February, March, and April--that \nwe were negotiating with the White House when I said I thought very \nmuch what Senator Wyden of Oregon was trying to do--and the Senator is \non the floor--was worthy of doing. I asked the White House would they \ntry to find some help for me and Senator Wyden, that maybe we could do \nthis. They did not find any support for that. They still say they want \nto do that, but sometime along April or May, we had to make a decision \nhere. Were we going to do what the President wanted to do on SCHIP? So \nwe could not do what the White House wanted to do through the private \nsector as part of SCHIP, so in order to negotiate a bipartisan \nagreement, we had to forget that aspect. But I promised the White House \nall the time that I was going to be working for those goals of covering \nthe uninsured through tax deductibility of individual policies, as \nSenator Wyden has suggested, and get universal coverage, even, if we \ncan. I am still committed to that.\n  I spoke to the President of the United States about that last \nThursday when I was on the phone with him. I said: Let's get this SCHIP \nbehind us. And I am going to join Senator Wyden in his effort to do it \nso we can get bipartisanship started on that issue, as well as what we \nhave on SCHIP.\n  So I am asking President Bush: Won't you please consider signing this \nbill, and then let Senator Wyden and me work with you on trying to take \ncare of the 47 million people who do not have health insurance--do it \nthrough the private sector, do it through the tax deductibility of \npolicies like that.\n  We even had Senator Clinton, in her statement in Iowa, in her \ncampaign for the Presidency, speak along the same efforts of using tax \ndeductibility of private insurance to take care of medical problems \ngenerally but mostly the problems of the uninsured.\n  So I think we can move in ways of accomplishing what the President \nwants to accomplish, but it just could not be done on the SCHIP. So you \nhave to do what you have to do around here. If it takes two steps to \nget the job done, you do it. So I want everybody to know I am not \nabandoning any efforts to take care of the uninsured. I am going to \nwork with Senator Wyden on that.\n\n  Now, if I could go to the debate, the overheated rhetoric we had last \nnight in the House. This is a bill which improves coverage for kids who \nare poor. This bill does not make it easier for illegal immigrants to \nget benefits. I do not know how that comes up, but that red herring has \nbeen going on over the last 24 hours, and somehow people believe \nanything they are told. Here is a case of reading the bill again. The \nbill clearly states that funds cannot go to illegal immigrants.\n  The desperate efforts I heard on the House side to suggest this bill \nmakes it easier for illegal immigrants to get benefits simply strains \ncredibility. The bill does not extend eligibility for illegal immigrant \nchildren or pregnant women. I heard that.\n  The bill does not make CHIP an entitlement. Now, we all know what the \ndefinition of ``entitlement'' is. That was thrown out in the debate in \nthe Senate 2 months ago when we had this bill up. An entitlement is \nsomething that, if you qualify for it, you get it, and the money comes \nfrom the Federal Treasury, and there is no limit on the amount of \nmoney. That is an entitlement. This is a specific amount of money which \nis going to be spent on this program. Not one dollar more can be spent. \nThis is not an entitlement. Even as recently as a meeting I was in \nwithin the last 4 hours, among a mass of my colleagues, that argument \nwas used. I do not know how intellectually dishonest you can be. You \nare a Member of the U.S. Senate. You know what the language of \nGovernment is. Maybe the people at the grassroots do not think of \nentitlements the way we do. They do not think of programs, appropriated \naccounts the way we do. But everybody who has been around this Senate a \nfew months knows what those things are. And to call this program an \nentitlement is intellectually dishonest.\n  This bill is not a Government takeover of health care, either. And \nyou heard that. This bill is not socialized medicine. Screaming \n``socialized medicine'' during a health care debate is like shouting \n``fire'' in a crowded theater. It is intended to cause hysteria that \ndiverts people from reading the bill, looking at the facts.\n  To those of you, my colleagues, who make such outlandish accusations, \nI say: Go shout ``fire'' somewhere else. Serious people are trying to \nget real work done. Now is the time to get this work done.\n\n[[Page S12131]]\n\n  I appreciate very much the leadership Chairman Baucus has provided. I \nthank him and Senator Rockefeller for what they did to reach a \nbipartisan agreement because they gave as much as Senator Hatch and I \ngave as we were negotiating--the four of us--for this bipartisan \nagreement.\n  I also extend a sincere thanks to Senator Hatch, who is on the floor \nwith me, for being a part of this effort. Senator Hatch was the main \nRepublican sponsor of this bill 10 years ago, creating the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. His commitment to the ideals and \nfundamentals of the program is steadfast, and the program is better for \nit.\n  When we began the debate on CHIP, I wrote down some principles I want \nto refer to--principles I gave my staff that I believed in that I \nthought were accomplishable goals in this reauthorization. I probably \nwrote these down--well, anyway, I will refer to them. But I wrote these \nprinciples down in my own handwriting and handed them to my staff and \nsaid this is how I think we ought to proceed with the negotiations on \nthe CHIP bill. I am not going to go through and read it line by line, \nbut this is what I wrote down sometime back in February, and I am going \nto refer to some of these without holding this paper up again.\n\n  Here are some highlights of these principles I wrote down entitled \n``Principles on SCHIP and How They Compare to The Bill.''\n  It cannot be a middle-class entitlement, I said. This bill is not an \nentitlement. It must be paid for. This bill is paid for.\n  Another principle I wrote down is that it must be focused on families \nbelow 200 percent of Federal poverty level. This bill is focused on \nthose low-income families.\n  Another principle: Kids should be covered before adults. This bill \nclearly makes that a requirement.\n  Another thing I said is the program should be capped--not an open-\nended entitlement to States. The program continues to be capped in this \nbill.\n  I am here to say that my principles remain intact in this compromise \ndocument; therefore, I support the compromise bill and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12131-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12131-S12133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CHIP\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, let me \ncongratulate Senator Grassley for his very fine work on this \nlegislation, and Senator Hatch as well. It has been a true bipartisan \neffort. I want to take this discussion in a little different direction. \nI strongly support the SCHIP program. I happen to believe it is a \ndisgrace that the United States of America remains the only country in \nthe industrialized world which today does not guarantee health care to \nall of its people. I just came back the other day from a trip to Costa \nRica, and this small, poor country manages to cover all of its people. \nYet, in our country, we have 47 million Americans who have no health \ninsurance, and we have some 9 million children who have no health \ninsurance.\n  I always find it ironic that the American people seem to get from the \nWhite House what they don't want, and they don't get what they do want. \nThe American people want to end the war in Iraq as soon as possible, a \nwar which will soon be costing us, if you can believe it, $750 \nbillion--three-quarters of $1 trillion--which even in Washington is a \nlot of money. For the war in Iraq, for Halliburton contracts, we seem \nto have an endless supply of money. The American people don't want it, \nbut that is what they are getting.\n  On the other hand, the American people do want health insurance for \ntheir children. The American people strongly support--and the polls are \nvery clear about this--the SCHIP program. The American people would \nlike all of the children in this country to be covered. That is what \nthey want, but that is what they are not getting.\n  What this bill, in fact, does do, which is very good--and I mentioned \na moment ago my congratulations to Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch \nfor their efforts--is it takes us somewhere. It provides health \ninsurance for 5 million more children, which is clearly a significant \nstep forward, and I will strongly support this legislation.\n  It is interesting to me that from the White House the main argument, \nit appears, for opposition to this particular piece of legislation, and \nthe reason they are threatening to veto it, one of the key reasons is \nthis is an expansion of ``government health care''--government health \ncare. Let me read to my colleagues to whom it might be of interest, and \nto the American people, a poll on the economy done a few weeks ago by \nCBS News, from September 14 to September 16. This is the CBS poll.\n  Question No. 1: Which do you think would be better for the country: \nHaving one health insurance program covering all Americans that would \nbe administered by the government--administered by this terrible \ngovernment--and paid for by taxpayers, or keeping the current system \nwhere many people get their insurance from private employers and some \nhave no insurance? So CBS asked: Do you want a government-administered \nprogram covering all people or do you want the current system? The \nresponse from the American people was 55 percent believe in one health \ninsurance for all Americans administered by the government; 29 percent \nwant to maintain the current system.\n  We hear a lot of discussion from the White House about how terrible \n``government health care'' is, and yet what the polls show by an almost \n2-to-1 majority is that the American people would like a health \ninsurance system guaranteeing health care to all people administered by \nthe Government and paid for out of the tax base.\n  When I go back to Vermont, I find strong support for the Medicare \nProgram, I find strong support for the Medicaid Program. Veterans want \nto see a significant increase in VA health care, which is, in fact, a \n100-percent controlled Government program. In fact, Mr. Nicholson, who \nis head of the Veterans' Administration, former head of the Republican \nParty, says--and I think he is quite right--that the Veterans' \nAdministration provides some of the very best quality health care in \nthe United States of America, and they have been honored by national \norganizations who have looked at health care quality and have awarded \ndistinction to the Veterans' Administration, which is, by the way, a \n100-percent Government-run health care system. We have federally \nqualified health systems, health care programs all over America which \ntime and time again are acknowledged to be tremendously successful. \nThey are supported in a very strong, bipartisan way here in the \nCongress. They provide health care to millions of Americans--Government \nhealth care. So I think we should perhaps end this bogeyman mentality \nof Government health care--how terrible an idea it is. In fact, the \nAmerican people want more Government health care in this country.\n  Our health care system has serious problems. In fact, it is in the \nmidst of disintegrating. We have 47 million Americans today who have no \nhealth insurance, and that number, since President Bush has been in \noffice, has gone up by over 7 million. The cost of health care is \nsoaring. More and more people are not only uninsured, they are \nunderinsured. Despite all of that, our country continues to spend twice \nas much per capita on health care as any other Nation on Earth. \nMeanwhile, despite all of that spending, despite all of the people who \nare uninsured, our health status measures--including infant mortality \nand life expectancy and the kind of work we do in disease prevention--\nranks very low compared to other developed countries. We spend more, we \nget less value, we have more and more people uninsured, our health care \nsystem is disintegrating, and it is high time, in my view, that the \nUnited States ends the national disgrace of being the only country in \nthe industrialized world that does not provide health care to all \npeople.\n\n  Not only are more and more people uninsured; this system is even \nincapable of providing the doctors we need, especially in rural \nAmerica. In cities we have doctors who are specialists earning millions \nof dollars a year, but somehow this system can't get doctors into rural \nAmerica, into primary health care, into internal medicine. We lack \ndentists all over this country. We have a major nursing crisis, such \nthat\n\n[[Page S12132]]\n\nwe are depleting the health care systems of the Philippines and other \ncountries, because we are not educating our own nurses. So we have some \nmajor problems.\n  In terms of the SCHIP program, it is hard for me to understand--it is \nhard for me to begin to understand--how this President can be \nthreatening to veto this legislation. We hear in the Congress a whole \nlot about family values. Well, if taking care of our children is not a \nfamily value, then I don't know what a family value is. It is clear \nalso that providing health insurance to our children is what is cost \neffective. Forget the suffering involved. Forget the children who deal \nwith illness they are not getting treated for because their parents \ndon't have health insurance. Look at the cost-effective aspect of this. \nWhat kind of thinking is involved when we say: No, we can't provide \nhealth insurance for you, but when you get sick because you haven't \ngone to the doctor, oh, yes, we will operate on you and we will spend \ntens and tens of thousands of dollars to take care of you when you are \nin the hospital?\n  Let me conclude by saying that the time is long overdue for this \ncountry to get its priorities right. We should not continue spending \nhundreds of billions of dollars on a war the American people don't \nwant. We should not, as the President and some in this institution \nwant, give $1 trillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest three-tenths of \n1 percent by repealing the inheritance tax. One trillion dollars over \n20 years, we have money to do that, but we don't have, apparently, $35 \nbillion to provide health insurance to 4 million children in this \ncountry. This Congress has to reorder and change the priorities \nestablished in the White House, and I believe that passing this SCHIP \nprogram will be a good step forward, a first step forward to be \nfollowed by much more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I won't take much time about SCHIP, only \nto say I hope our colleagues will vote for the SCHIP bill. It is a real \nbipartisan effort made by Democrats and Republicans over a long period \nof time with a lot of give by House Democrats and House Democratic \nleadership because they wanted a bill. I hope we pass that bill. I will \nidentify my remarks to a large degree with the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa who spoke earlier.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3047\n\n  Madam President, I wish to discuss an amendment addressing the \nsubject of hate crimes that I have filed on this national defense bill. \nI do not think that hate crimes legislation should be attached to this \ndefense bill. The issue of hate crimes has nothing to do with the \nmatter before us, our national defense.\n  Frankly, this Kennedy amendment has no relationship, as far as I am \nconcerned, to this very important bill intended to help our military, \nand it should not be included on this legislation. Yet, as long as my \ncolleagues insisted on filing a politically problematic hate crimes \namendment to this legislation, it was important that we have a balanced \ndebate.\n  My amendment would provide Federal assistance to the States and \nlocalities in the prosecution and investigation of bias motivated \nviolence. That is what we are talking about here: bias motivated \nviolence.\n  I want to be absolutely clear. No one--nobody in this entire body or \ninstitution--believes for one second that such crimes are ever \nacceptable. Nobody in this body believes that. So those who want to \nmake political points by suggesting that are plain wrong, and they \nshould stop.\n  The question is: What is the proper role of the Federal Government in \nthe prosecution of these crimes? This needs to be a matter that we keep \nin careful balance. Our States are the primary guarantors of our rights \nand liberties. As far as I can see, having watched it for years, the \nStates have handled these crimes very well. In every case I can think \nof--there may be some exceptions, but I don't know of any--the State \nhas handled these matters adequately and well and people have been \nprosecuted and convicted. Some have been put to death; others have been \nsentenced for life.\n  The States are the primary guarantors of our rights and liberties. I \nthink we must respect the hard and decent work of the States as they \nsecure equal justice under the law for all of our citizens in the \nrespective States.\n  With due respect to my colleagues and good friends, Senators Kennedy \nand Smith, I do not think this amendment strikes the right balance. In \nfact, I think this amendment is not needed. It has plenty of \ndifficulties. It is constitutionally very questionable.\n  And frankly, it should not be on this bill. If they want to bring it \nup, they can do it separately. It should not be on the bill because the \nPresident indicated that he is not going to put up with this type of \nlegislation on this bill. This is not because of a lack of dedication \non his part in prohibiting hate crimes. He is as dedicated as anybody \nin this body to targeting these crimes, and that includes the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  So I rise to oppose both hate crimes and the Kennedy hate crimes \namendment. A conviction against bias-motivated violence does not \njustify supporting a proposal that is unwise, unnecessary, and \nunconstitutional.\n  This amendment would create a new Federal criminal felony, punishable \nby up to 10 years in prison, for willfully causing bodily injury \nbecause of a person's perceived race, color, national origin, religion, \ngender, sexual orientation, disability, or--get this--gender identity.\n  Senator Kennedy made a specific point earlier today that this new \nfelony is not related to Federal jurisdiction. He said such a \nrequirement would be ``outdated, unwise, and unnecessary,'' but that \nrequirement is grounded in the Constitution itself. With all due \nrespect to my friend from Massachusetts, the Constitution is not \noutdated, unwise or unnecessary.\n  Not only does Congress lack authority to create such a freestanding \nhate crimes felony, the States are already handling this issue.\n  The Kennedy proposal would end up treating the less serious bias \ncrimes too harshly, putting people who committed misdemeanors under \nState law in Federal prison, and treating the most serious bias crimes \ntoo harshly, with no death penalty even for the most heinous murders as \nin the case of James Byrd in Texas.\n  This bill goes further even than the Kennedy proposals of the past.\n  Let me mention a number of problems that I perceive with Senator \nKennedy's hate crimes amendment. First, as noted yesterday, the Kennedy \namendment is different from the hate crimes bill offered in past \nCongresses. This amendment adds ``perceived . . . gender identity'' as \na protected class. What does this concept mean? The Senate has held no \nhearings on the meaning of this phrase or how far this phrase would \nallow the courts to go. How far would some of the courts interpret this \nphrase? The bill's definition is vague; it raises more questions than \nit answers. Would this include wearing an earring? Would it include an \nassault of a man with long hair or a woman with short hair? What about \na woman wearing long hair? Are all protected the same under Federal \nlaw? What about different kinds of clothing?\n  Clearly, there would be cases that fall safely within the drafters' \nintent, but can Senators be confident of what this language means? I do \nnot think so. Do they want to pass a law to put judges or juries in \ncharge of interpreting the meaning of clothing and personal style? \nAgain, there have been no hearings in the Senate to give any guidance \nto Senators for this vote.\n  When the House passed this bill, the White House released a SAP \npromising a veto. To pass the Kennedy amendment is to jeopardize the \nDefense authorization bill altogether.\n  The Justice Department has also indicated it supports the concepts \nfound in my alternative proposal.\n  There is no evidence that hate crimes go unprosecuted in the States. \nFor example, as Dr. Coburn recently pointed out on the floor, the \nkillers of Matthew Shepard--for whom this bill is named--were \nsuccessfully prosecuted under State law. And recall that the killers of \nJames Byrd in Texas several years ago were sentenced to death under \nState law. But there is no death penalty provided for in the Kennedy \namendment. By the way, Senator Kennedy cannot make the case that the \nStates are inadequate in their handling of these crimes. I don't think \nhe can\n\n[[Page S12133]]\n\nmake the case the States are not doing a good job of handling these \ncrimes. These kind of crimes are intra-State crimes. I do not think he \ncan make the case there is a sufficient nexus of interstate commerce to \njustify what I consider to be the unconstitutional Kennedy amendment.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts stated earlier that ``all hate crimes \nwill face a Federal prosecution.''\n  If that is true, then prepare for a massive federalization of basic \ncriminal law, which is handled well by the States. Maybe 100 years ago \nyou could find States not enforcing hate crime laws, but I do not think \nyou will find that today in any State in this Union. There is not a \nperson in the Senate who wants those crimes to go unpunished. But the \nStates are handling them well. Why would we bring the almighty arm of \nthe Federal Government into these matters?\n\n  There are also several reasons this bill is unconstitutional. \nConsider one: The Supreme Court held that certain of the criminal \nprovisions of the Violence Against Women Act were unconstitutional \nbecause most crimes of violence against women were not interstate in \nnature. I have to admit I was a prime cosponsor, along with Senator \nBiden, of VAWA. I was somewhat disappointed in that decision, but that \nis the decision. That is our constitutional law. The Kennedy amendment \nwould criminalize many physical and sexual assaults. The same \nconstitutional issues are at stake.\n  Again, I decry hate crimes. I do not believe there should be evil \ndiscrimination, bias discrimination, in any way, shape or form. I have \nalways stood up for the rights of those who have been discriminated \nagainst. I may have differed on some bills, as I do on this one. But I \ndecry these types of acts. But to federalize hate crimes legislation \nand to make it not only burdensome but very intrusive on the State's \nwork in this area, I think, is the wrong thing to do.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider some of these thoughts. I will \nspeak in more detail tomorrow. But the fact of the matter is I think it \nis a real mistake, when the States are doing as good a job as they have \nbeen doing, when the very crimes they use to justify this bill were \nhandled by the States and people were sentenced to long terms, or even \nto death, I think it is inadvisable for us to proceed on this \namendment.\n  Last but not least, the President said he is going to veto the bill \nif Senator Kennedy's amendment makes it in. I think it is wrong to put \nthis amendment into this Defense Authorization Act. It has been wrong, \nas far as I am concerned, to have a lot of these amendments that have \nbeen brought up on the floor that have nothing to do with Defense \nauthorization, or have everything to do with trying to score political \npoints, at a time when we should have passed this bill 2 weeks ago and \ngotten it on its way to the House of Representatives and then to the \nPresident, so our soldiers will have the benefits this bill provides \nfor.\n  Adding hate crimes to it may lead to a veto of the whole bill. That \nwould be just plain tragic, especially since we know of the President's \nsuggestion that he will veto the hate crimes bill. So I am concerned \nabout it. I understand Senator Kennedy's motivation on this. He wants \nto get it on a bill that has to pass both Houses of Congress. But it \nought to be on a bill related to hate crimes or related to criminal \nlaw, not something that can scuttle this important Defense \nauthorization bill. I personally feel badly that so many of these days \nhave gone by with amendments that have nothing to do with the defense \nof our country or our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere \naround the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Mr. President, I hope tomorrow the Senate will pass \nurgently needed help for millions of America's children. I hope it will \nbe done quickly because it is a moral abomination that millions of \nAmerica's kids don't have health care. If the Senate acts quickly and \nthe White House approves the legislation, it would then be possible to \nmove forward on a bipartisan effort to more broadly address the \nextraordinary health care needs of all of our citizens.\n  The fact is, you don't get anything important done on health care, or \nother issues, unless it is bipartisan. Tomorrow, we will see a textbook \ncase of bipartisanship on display on the floor of the Senate. Four \nmembers of the Senate Finance Committee on which I am proud to serve--\nSenators Baucus, Grassley, Rockefeller, and Hatch--and I see my friend \nfrom Utah on the floor. I salute him personally in my remarks because I \nknow the Senator from Utah, the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator \nfrom Montana, and the Senator from Iowa spent hours and hours, day \nafter day, working on the legislation to help our kids.\n  Bills such as this don't happen by osmosis; they happen because \nlegislators of good faith, such as Senator Hatch, who, along with \nSenator Kennedy and others, was a pioneer of this effort. Senator Hatch \nhas addressed the major concerns. This is protecting private options \nfor health care for children. He has been able to target the neediest \nyoungsters. I am pleased he has addressed this waiver question and the \nremarks that the Senator has made and the distinguished Senator from \nIowa has made, joining Senators Baucus and Rockefeller. This is a \ntextbook case, in my view, of how we address health care in a \nbipartisan way.\n  Frankly, one of the points I am going to make tonight in my remarks \nis that I wish to have this issue addressed by the Senate quickly \nbecause, first, our kids need it so much and, second, because if we can \nget it done quickly, he and I, Senator Grassley, and so many other \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee still want to work in a bipartisan \nway to go further.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator for his kind remarks, which come from \nsomebody who I know takes health care very seriously and has proven \nhimself to be one of the leaders in health care. I personally pay \ntribute to the other Members who have also worked so hard on the SCHIP \nbill; in particular, Senator Kennedy. I remember back in the early \ndays, when it was a lonely thing for Senator Kennedy and I to go around \nthe country talking about helping the poor kids, the only ones left out \nof the health care system. It took a leading liberal such as Senator \nKennedy and this poor, old beaten-up conservative to be able to do \nthat.\n  I am grateful we were able to come up with a bipartisan bill that the \nHouse was kind enough to work with us on. That was one of the rare \nbipartisan efforts this year that I would like to see more of in the \nCongress.\n  I sure hope somehow or another we can get the CHIP bill not only \nauthorized but passed and signed into law so these 10 million kids have \na future from a health care standpoint.\n  In any event, I did not mean to take so much of the Senator's time, \nbut I wanted to thank him for his very kind and thoughtful remarks. His \nfriendship is important to me. I personally congratulate him for his \nsensitive and very professional work on health care, not only in the \nHouse of Representatives but here as well.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my friend. The fact that Senator Hatch and Senator \nKennedy, in particular, have prosecuted this cause of improving health \ncare for our citizens has been so important. It is going to pay off, I \nhope, this week with resounding support for the children's health bill.\n  I want to spend a few minutes tonight talking about the possibility, \nwith a strong victory for the cause of children's health, about the \nprospects of moving on from there. I wish to pick up on the remarks of \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley. He has been very \ngracious in terms of working with me and looking at the variety of \noptions for broader reform. And I appreciate the conversation that \nSenator Grassley had just a few days ago with the White House.\n  What a lot of us are saying to the White House is we think you have \nsome valid points with respect to the broader issue of health care \nreform. I happen to think that Democrats have been spot on, absolutely \ncorrect on the coverage issue. We have to cover everybody because if we \ndo not cover everybody, the people who are uninsured shift their\n\n[[Page S12134]]\n\nbills to people who are insured. But Republicans have had a very valid \npoint as well that there ought to be private options, that there ought \nto be choices, that you need to have a strong delivery system with \nAmerican health care in the private sector. That is why I made mention \nof the emphasis in the children's health bill on the private sector \noptions.\n  My message to the White House has been, and I think the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa has made the same point, that it will not be possible \nto go on to the broader issue of health care reform until first the \nurgent needs of our children, needs that are demonstrated every single \nday in communities across the land--we are not going to see efforts on \nthe broader reform effort pay off until first the needs of our children \nare met.\n  I hope the White House will see that the prospects of getting into \nissues that they correctly identify as important--I have said for a \nlong time, and I say to my colleagues again, every liberal economist \nwith whom we have talked in the Finance Committee and the Budget \nCommittee has made the point that the current Tax Code \ndisproportionately on health care favors the most wealthy and \nencourages inefficiency.\n  If the children's health bill can get passed, and passed quickly, we \ncan then go forward, Democrats and Republicans, to work together on it. \nI have a different approach than the White House has with respect to \nfixing the Tax Code on health care, but certainly there are ways that \nDemocrats and Republicans can work together if there is the same kind \nof good faith, bipartisan effort we have seen with Democratic and \nRepublican leaders on the CHIP legislation.\n  I hope the White House will not veto the CHIP bill. They want broader \nhealth care reform, and so do I. The fact is, Senator Bennett of Utah \nand I, along with Senator Gregg, Senator Alexander, and Senator Bill \nNelson, have brought to the floor of the Senate the first bipartisan \nuniversal coverage health bill in more than 13 years. It has been more \nthan a decade, I say to my colleagues, since there has been a \nbipartisan universal coverage bill.\n  The fact is, out on the Presidential campaign trail, a lot of the \nDemocratic candidates for President and a lot of the Republican \ncandidates for President are talking about some of the very same \napproaches I outlined when I proposed the Healthy Americans Act in \nDecember of 2006.\n  This is an important time for the future of health care in our \ncountry. I hope steps will be taken to meet the needs of our kids that \nare so urgent and the President will sign that legislation, that he \nwill see the value of the important bipartisan work done in this \nChamber. If he does, even though the clock is ticking down on this \nCongress--and there is not a lot of time left for major initiatives--I \nstill believe, as do Senator Bennett and the sponsors of the Healthy \nAmericans Act, Democratic and Republican colleagues with whom we \ncontinue to talk, that it is possible to go forward after a good \nchildren's health bill is passed to have broader health reform. And I \nthink colleagues understand how urgent that is.\n  One of the sponsors of our Healthy Americans Act, Senator Gregg, the \nranking Republican on the Budget Committee, just came into the Chamber. \nI am very honored to have him as a cosponsor of the Healthy Americans \nAct. Senators Gregg and Conrad have correctly identified entitlement \nspending and the need to address it as a special priority.\n  The fact is, we cannot address the growing escalation in entitlement \nspending unless we deal with health care reform. We just cannot do it. \nIt cannot happen because there are no costs rising in America like \nmedical bills. Medical bills are a wrecking ball, flattening \ncommunities across the country and are the principal factor in the \nmushrooming cost of entitlements.\n  Again and again, the question of our country's well-being, the place \nof our companies in a tough global marketplace, the spiraling cost of \nentitlements comes down to the need to better address comprehensive \nhealth reform.\n  I believe, even though there is not a lot of time left in this \nsession of Congress, that can be done, but only if, as Senator Grassley \nnoted early in the evening, the legislation that ensures that at least \nthis session of Congress, at a minimum, takes steps to remove some of \nthat moral taint we now face because our kids don't have health care. \nIf that is done, we can go on from there.\n  I hope tomorrow we will see a resounding vote for the country's \nchildren. It is in their interests, it is in their name that we have \nhad a bipartisan coalition working on the legislation. But I also \nsuggest to the White House and others who want broader reform, reform \nthat picks up on some of the White House's principles, it cannot happen \nunless the children's health bill is passed, and passed with a strong \nmajority this week and the President signs it into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I echo the words of the Senator from Oregon \nand thank him for his leadership on health care issues and especially \nhis urging the President of the United States to sign the children's \nhealth insurance bill. We are hoping for a strong vote in the Senate \ntomorrow in passing that very important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12134-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HATE CRIMES\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise this evening in support of the \nKennedy amendment, the hate crimes amendment. Our Nation's strength \nlies in its diversity, its tolerance, its respect for the individual. \nHate crimes borne of prejudice and ignorance, of fear and cowardice, \ncontravene these core principles which our Nation for more than two \ncenturies has held dear. They are perpetuated by individuals who fear, \nin some sense, individuality. Terrorism is a hate crime.\n  The amendment offered by my colleague, Mr. Kennedy, ensures that hate \ncrimes be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. \nIt enables Federal investigations of what are clearly Federal crimes. \nHate crimes target individuals because they are part of a community. In \nthe national community, all of us have a stake in fighting back against \nthese crimes.\n  My colleague's amendment sends a strong message. The message is this: \nOur Nation will not turn the other way when individuals try to divide \nus. We will not tread softly when individuals use violence to \nperpetuate hatred. We will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law \ncrimes that reflect a vicious disregard for individual rights and our \nNation's core central values.\n  Our Nation is a community of people who care about one another. Hate \ncrimes destroy our cohesiveness and our mutual respect and replace \nthose values with paranoia, with divisiveness, and with destruction. \nHate crimes weaken our Nation. This amendment strengthens it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12134-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12134-S12135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FOREWARN ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in July, I introduced S. 1792, the FOREWARN \nAct of 2007, a direct outgrowth of legislation that one of my \npredecessors, two predecessors ago, Senator Metzenbaum from Ohio, \nintroduced called the WARN Act, legislation he got through the Congress \nin the 1980s, but legislation that now needs an update. It is about \nplant closings and job loss.\n  Job loss, whether it is in Ohio or whether it is in Seattle, does not \njust affect a worker or a worker's family. Job loss devastates entire \ncommunities and local economies.\n  While notice of a layoff is no substitute for a job, the WARN Act of \n20 years ago was supposed to give employees time to find a new job and \nfor help to be provided. Under current law, however, fair notice has \nproven to be the exception, not the rule, because too many have gamed \nthe old WARN Act.\n  Employers have laid off workers in phases to avoid the threshold \nlevel of the WARN Act, used subsidiaries to evade liability, and \npressured workers in too many cases, in too many places around Ohio to \nwaive their rights.\n  Whether one lives in Toledo, Columbus, Cleveland, Akron, Cincinnati, \nor Lebanon, it is absolutely critical that in these situations, workers \nand groups have sufficient notice to begin working to attempt to limit \nthe damage this causes a community.\n\n[[Page S12135]]\n\n  The new legislation which I introduced in July, with Senator Clinton, \nSenator Obama, and Senator Stabenow, S. 1792, will close these \nloopholes and provide the tools necessary for the enforcement of the \nrules.\n  The legislation gives the Labor Department the authority to take \ncivil action for violations, as well as giving authority to State \nattorneys general if the Labor Secretary fails to act within 6 months. \nSo if the Labor Secretary today refuses to act, if this happens in \nZanesville or Lima, Attorney General Marc Dann of Ohio may take action.\n  The legislation reduces the closing plant threshold from the current \nnumber 50, which is gamed all too often, to 25 employees. It \nrecalculates the mass layoff figure. The current mass layoff figure is \ncalculated from at least one-third of the employees, or 50. FOREWARN \nsets the number at 100 in all events, or one-third of employees if \nthere are between 50 and 100 employees.\n  Our legislation, S. 1792, reduces the employer size to 50 employees \nand lengthens the notification period from 60 calendar days to 90 \ncalendar days. It requires employers to provide written notification to \nthe Labor Secretary, as well as local stakeholders, including early \nwarning networks and mayors. It increases penalties for violations of \nthe WARN Act from back pay to double back pay.\n  Mr. President, I know you have had this problem in the State of \nPennsylvania, the problem of lost manufacturing, and you know that the \nworst thing a community can face is a major plant closing or major \nreduction of workforce in a plant. And you know that as bad as that is, \nthere are some things employers can do to make it better, and many do. \nBut you also know that the law passed 20 years ago has not always made \nsure that the transition from losing their job to going back into the \ncommunity and getting work, getting their family through the hardest \ntimes, getting the community through the hardest times--the law has not \nalways addressed the best way to do that, and I think this legislation, \nS. 1792, does that very well.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to consider this legislation. It is time to \nupdate the 20-year law, the WARN Act, which passed and was approved by \nPresident Reagan. I think this legislation will help ease the lost-job \nproblems. We need to do much more. We need to train differently, we \nneed new trade law, different tax laws, and all the different kinds of \nthings the Presiding Officer and I have worked on already in our time \nin the Senate, but the FOREWARN Act will matter for communities such as \nSteubenville, Portsmouth, and Chillicothe, and it will matter for \nfamilies who have suffered the indignities and the tragedies and the \nhardship of lost jobs and plant closings.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

Mr. President, I rise to deliver tonight some brief \nremarks about a matter that a group of freshmen Democrats in this body \nhave worked on together, and that is a bipartisan commission on wartime \ncontracting and to expand the authority of the existing oversight \nmechanisms to help make sure our taxpayer dollars are spent properly \nand wisely in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I, like the Presiding Officer from the State of Ohio, joined Senators \nWebb and McCaskill and 23 other Members in cosponsoring this amendment \nand encourage the full Senate to approve it when it comes to a vote \ntomorrow. As a former auditor general in Pennsylvania, I know firsthand \nthe need to aggressively root out waste in government. But it is \nespecially egregious to discover waste and abuse and the loss of \ntaxpayer dollars when our troops are in harm's way.\n  I also know that the oversight required to monitor potential abuse is \na full-time job. That is why this amendment takes the extraordinary \nstep of creating a new commission, evenly divided between the political \nparties, to investigate contractor abuses in a thorough manner. Some \nhave argued we should leave this task to our existing committees in the \nSenate. I and my cosponsors, respectfully disagree with that \nassessment. As the distinguished Senator from Michigan said earlier \ntoday on the floor, our existing committees in the Senate, if they have \nthis responsibility, would grind to a halt if any of those committees \nhad to undertake a full investigation of contractor abuses in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The commission we propose is deliberately patterned after \nthe Truman Commission--named, of course, after a former President, but \nat the time the Truman Commission was named for his work in the Senate.\n  The Truman Commission consisted of a group of patriotic Americans \nthat was charged with the mission of studying all financial and \nmilitary transactions related to the execution of our war effort during \nWorld War II. This Commission recognized that it was not only American \nmilitary might that would win the war in the struggle against the axis \npowers, but that every dollar saved, every dollar and every resource \nrescued would materially contribute to the war effort and enable the \nAmerican Nation to focus its power and its energy on our common enemy \nat that time.\n  The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are very different from World War \nII, we know that, but the same principles apply when it comes to \nrooting out waste, fraud, and abuse. Every day we read the horror \nstories about the lack of body armor for our troops. We see that the \nmilitary has failed to order enough mine resistant ambush protective--\nso-called MRAP--vehicles to secure all of our troops. We hear our \nmilitary stock is in need of urgent replenishment. The United States is \na wealthy nation, we know that, but we are not a nation of infinite \nriches and resources. We have to prioritize our spending and make hard \nchoices. That is why it is so important to crack down on contractor \nabuses in Iraq and Afghanistan. We cannot afford to let companies doing \nbusiness there profit--profit--from fraud and abuse at the same time we \nneed those very dollars for real priorities--our men and women in \nuniform.\n  In 2005, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \nreported that $9 billion spent on Iraq's reconstruction was missing--\nunaccounted for--due to inefficiencies and bad management. When I say \nmissing, I literally mean the special inspector general's office was \nunable to find out what happened to this money. Only last week, the \nPentagon disclosed that it is auditing $88 billion in contracts and \nprograms for financial irregularities. Let me repeat that number--$88 \nbillion. This is not a case of a few inappropriate cost overruns in \ncontracts or sloppy bookkeeping in other contracts. Here we know that \n40 individuals--40 individuals--and private companies have already been \nsuspended, debarred, or are proposed for debarment. Another 30 \ninvestigations await prosecution at the Department of Justice.\n  Contractor abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan is a national scandal. It is \nan embarrassment. I think it also represents a taking. Every dollar \nwasted there is a dollar taken away from our troops and our ability to \nfight the enemy. Most of us supporting this amendment today were \nelected last year on the promise to change the culture in Washington \nand to no longer take for granted this type of crass corruption. We \nshouldn't accept it. We should root it out and do everything possible \nto make it almost impossible to commit this kind of crime.\n  This legislation establishes an independent commission to \ncomprehensively vet Federal agency contracting for reconstruction, \nlogistical support of coalition forces, and security and intelligence \nfunctions in Iraq and Afghanistan. What we are talking about is an \nindependent and bipartisan commission to provide real credibility and \nreal authority in cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  This amendment also provides significant new powers to the already \nexisting Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction to expand \nhis important work and coordinate with this\n\n[[Page S12136]]\n\nnew commission. I had the chance earlier this month to meet with Stuart \nBowen, who is that inspector general and in that position. We discussed \nthis amendment, and he agreed it was a good proposal, one that deserved \nto be implemented to enhance the ability to uncover and prosecute gross \nabuses of the public trust.\n  No matter where one stands on the war in Iraq, I would hope we could \nagree on the need to eliminate all waste and fraud and prosecute those \nwho facilitate such fraud and such waste. These actions bring dishonor \nto our Nation and, in a word, are unpatriotic. We should do everything \nwe can to root out such abuses, and this amendment is an important \nfirst step to do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Matthew Shepard was a 21-year-old student at \nthe University of Wyoming when he was savagely beaten on October 6, \n1998. Why? Because he was a homosexual; he was gay. Two men who had \noffered him a ride home robbed and pistol whipped him, beat him so \nseverely they smashed his skull. If that wasn't enough for these \ndemons, they tied him to a fence with a rope in the cold of winter, \nlonely--you can appreciate it if you spent a few of them in Wyoming--\nand left him to die. And he did die. He died of severe head injuries \nless than a week after the beating that was given.\n  What happened to Matthew was a tragedy for this young man, of course \nfor his family, for other gay men and women who were and have been \nterrorized by this awful crime. It was certainly a tragedy for our \nNation. The men who murdered Matthew Shepard were not charged with \ncommitting a hate crime because crimes of violence committed on the \nbasis of sexual orientation were not prosecutable as hate crimes under \nWyoming or Federal law. This is still the case today. The Matthew \nShepard Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act would strengthen the \nability of Federal, State, and local governments to investigate and \nprosecute hate crimes.\n  This amendment would remove the current limitation on Federal \njurisdiction that allows Federal involvement only in cases in which the \nassailant intended to prevent the victim from being engaged in a \n``federally protected activity,'' such as voting. This amendment would \nexpand the groups protected under current law to include all hate \ncrimes, including those based on disability, gender, sexual \norientation, gender identity--including race and ethnicity. This \namendment would provide the Department of Justice the authority to \nassist State and local jurisdictions in prosecuting violent hate crimes \nor taking the lead in such prosecutions where local authorities are \nunwilling or unable to act.\n  Unfortunately, some of these crimes of hate-motivated violence have \nbeen directed to our men and women in uniform.\n  Just a few years ago, Alan Schindler, a sailor in the Navy, was \nstomped to death by a fellow serviceman because of his sexual \norientation.\n  A short time after that, PFC Barry Winchell, an infantry soldier in \nthe Army, was beaten to death with a baseball bat because his attackers \nbelieved he was gay. They didn't know--they believed he was gay. To \nthem he acted gay, whatever that means.\n  In December of 1995, two paratroopers who were members of a group of \nneo-Nazi skinheads at Fort Bragg shot an African-American couple in a \nrandom, racially motivated double murder that led to a major \ninvestigation of extremism in our military. These killers and 19 other \nmembers of this division were dishonorably discharged for neo-Nazi gang \nactivities.\n  According to a recent Southern Poverty Law Center report, the problem \nis only going to get worse as members of hate groups have been entering \nour military, which is increasingly desperate for new recruits. In \nfact, it used to be if you had committed a crime, any type of crime, \nthe military wouldn't take you. You had to have a high school education \nand you certainly couldn't be a member of a gang. They are so desperate \nfor military members because of this war we are involved in in Iraq, \nthey are taking just about anybody. There are no background checks with \nthese new recruits.\n  We have to make it clear that crimes of hate in our military will not \nbe tolerated, and this amendment does just that. It strengthens the \nDefense authorization bill by sending a clear message that such crimes \nwill be punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n  Is there a better place to have this amendment than on the Defense \nbill? I think not. We have had it on it before. If we have our military \naround the world fighting terror--and that is what they are doing--\nshouldn't we be able to protect our own troops from the terror? \nShouldn't we be able to protect our own people in this country against \nbeing terrorized because of their sexual orientation? the color of \ntheir skin? their religion? The answer, of course, is we should be able \nto do that. They should be able to be protected.\n  We have to make it clear that crimes of hate in our military will not \nbe tolerated. I repeat that. As we hold ourselves up as a model for the \nideals of equality, tolerance, and mutual understanding abroad, we have \na special responsibility to combat hate-motivated violence right here \nat home. Our troops are on the front lines of Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere fighting against evil and hate. We owe it to them to uphold \nthese same principles at home.\n  The Matthew Shepherd Act was introduced this spring at a ceremony \nattended by his parents, Judy and Dennis. I hope that tomorrow we will \nhonor the memory of this young man by passing this important \nlegislation which is named after him.\n  We all remember the brutal killing of James Byrd a few years ago, in \nTexas. This young man, at nighttime, was walking down a street in his \nown hometown when he was seen by some white men. They beat him \nseverely, tied him to the back of their car, and dragged him through \nthe streets until he was dead.\n  We need only look to the recent events in Jena, LA, to see for all \nthe progress, racial tensions continue across our country. This \nlegislation honors the commitment to justice that is woven deep within \nthe fabric of our Nation.\n\n  I certainly urge all of our colleagues to join me in voting for this \nmatter in the morning. It is important. It is the least we can do for \nMatthew Shepard and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12136-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12136-S12137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was disappointed earlier this year when \nthe\n\n[[Page S12137]]\n\ncomprehensive immigration reform was not passed. On two separate \noccasions, as Republicans filibustered the legislation to its \nlegislative death, we tried to move this to conference on comprehensive \nimmigration reform, and it was filibustered both times. We had \nknowledge there were not enough Republican votes to pass it. The last \ntime we got 12 Republican Senators.\n  Part of that vital legislation was something we called the DREAM Act. \nThis legislation's advocates have moved very hard. The primary advocate \nfor this, and its primary sponsor, has been Senator Richard Durbin of \nIllinois. He has worked tirelessly in his efforts to pass the DREAM \nAct. He has spoken within the Senate on many occasions, both here on \nthe Senate floor, in the committee, and in press conferences we have \nhad regarding immigration. I have never known Senator Durbin to feel \nmore strongly about anything than this, and we have been together for 5 \nyears.\n  The DREAM Act recognizes that children should not be penalized for \nthe actions of their parents. Many of these youth come to America very \nyoung. Many do not even remember their country of origin because they \nwere too young when they left, nor do they speak the language of their \nhome country. They think of themselves as Americans.\n  Many of these children are so desperate to be able to go to school. \nOnly children who come to the United States when they were 15 years old \nor younger and have been in the United States for at least 5 years can \napply under the DREAM Act. They would have to meet certain criteria, \nincluding earning a high school diploma, demonstrated good moral \ncharacter, and passing criminal and security clearances. That is what \nthe DREAM Act requires. To qualify for permanent status you must go to \ncollege or serve in the military for at least 2 years.\n  I have met star students in Nevada, for lack of a better description, \nwho had qualified for the DREAM Act. With it their future is limitless. \nWithout it, their future is very limited. Their future is diminished, \nof course, if they can't go to school.\n  Many of the children this bill would help are extremely talented and \nhave graduated in the top of their classes, yet cannot go to a State \nschool. What a waste it is to make it more difficult for them to go to \ncollege or prohibit them from getting jobs where they could be making \nmeaningful contributions to their communities and to our country. What \ngood does it do anybody to prevent these young people from having a \nfuture? Is gang membership better? Is a minimum wage job for life \nbetter? Is a life of crime better?\n  I hoped we would be able to offer this legislation as an amendment to \nthe pending legislation, the Defense Authorization Act, but we have \nbeen unable to do that. Enacting the DREAM Act will give more of our \nchildren an opportunity to succeed.\n  Senator Durbin and all who care about this matter should know that we \nwill move to proceed to this matter before we leave here.

Jeffers\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today I wish to reflect on the life of \nSGT Edmund Jeffers, who died last Wednesday in a vehicle accident in \nTaqqadum, Iraq. Sergeant Jeffers served in the 1st Battalion, 9th \nInfantry, 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. At the age of 23 he was \non his second tour of duty in Iraq.\n  Eddie Jeffers grew up in Daleville, AL, just south of Fort Rucker. \nThe son of a master sergeant, he learned the value of military service \nearly in life. He enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2002 after his \ngraduation, feeling the call of duty after the events of September 11.\n  Those who knew Sergeant Jeffers describe him as a man of conviction, \nprinciple, and faith. His Christian values, his father recounts, guided \nhis work as a soldier. They strengthened his resolve to defeat those \nwho commit evils against innocents, and they kept alive his hope for a \nfuture of freedom and security for Iraqis. He saw the threat of \nterrorism as the struggle of his generation, a long war that will \nrequire sacrifice and commitment from all Americans.\n  Sergeant Jeffers, like so many soldiers before him, documented his \nexperiences in war with pen and paper. He kept a journal in Iraq, \nposted updates for his friends and family online, and shared some of \nhis writings with the world. He was eloquent and sharp. One of his \nessays, entitled ``Hope Rides Alone,'' has circulated widely on the \ninternet, and newspapers have reprinted portions in recent days.\n  In, the essay, Eddie worried that the political debate at home was \nweakening our resolve to achieve success in Iraq and was driving a \nwedge between the country and the military.\n  He noted that this war is being fought on the backs of our men and \nwomen in uniform, while the ``American people have not been asked to \nsacrifice anything. Unless you are in the military or the family member \nof a servicemember, it's life as usual . . . the war doesn't affect \nyou. But it affects us.''\n  The political debate here in Washington, Sergeant Jeffers argued, has \nbecome a national preoccupation that is distracting our focus from our \ngoals in Iraq. As Sergeant Jeffers notes, there is strong disagreement \nin this country about the course we should take in Iraq. Our soldiers, \ntoo, have many different opinions. Much of this debate is necessary and \nhealthy for a democracy, but, as Sergeant Jeffers cautions, the \ndiscussion should neither distract us from our efforts to protect \nnational security nor lessen our commitment to helping secure a better \nfuture for Iraqis.\n  In the end, Iraqis ``want what everyone else wants in life: safety, \nsecurity, somewhere to call home,'' Sergeant Jeffers wrote. ``They want \na country that is safe to raise their children in.''\n  General MacArthur once said that it is ``the soldier, above all other \npeople, who prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest \nscars of war.'' This was true for Eddie. Amid the chaos and violence in \nIraq, Sergeant Jeffers never lost sight of the simple aspirations and \nthe basic humanity that bind the vast majority of Iraqis.\n  I admire Sergeant Jeffers' life and service, all the more for his \ncourage to share his thoughts with the world. His writings are powerful \nand challenge us to better account for the costs of freedom and for the \nsacrifices that all Americans should be prepared to make on its behalf.\n  One cannot adequately honor Eddie Jeffers' service and sacrifice. His \nactions need no praise to be commendable, and his writings stand alone \nwith the force of his convictions. We are humbled by his life and \nsaddened by his loss.\n  To Eddie's wife Stephanie, and to his parents Tina and David, my \nthoughts and prayers are with you. I know of no words that can lessen \nthe pain that you feel, but I hope that one day you will find comfort \nin knowing that Eddie's sacrifice will never be forgotten. He \nchallenges us to do better by our soldiers, to never let ``hope walk \nalone.'' His voice is heard, and his country is grateful. He will \nendure in our hearts and our prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12137-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12137-S12138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO PEGGY EWING WAXTER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I commemorate the life of \nPeggy Ewing Waxter, a woman who worked tirelessly to promote positive \nsocial change and civil rights. Mrs. Waxter passed away last Tuesday, \nSeptember 18, 2007, at the age of 103. The State of Maryland and our \nNation have lost a remarkable woman.\n  In the 1930s, Mrs. Waxter helped found the Waxter Center for Seniors \nin\n\n[[Page S12138]]\n\nBaltimore City. She also aided in the founding of various other \norganizations, including the University of Maryland Center for Infant \nStudy, the Children's Guild of Baltimore, and the Maryland Committee \nfor Children. She also helped establish the Baltimore Metropolitan \nAssociation for Mental Health.\n  In addition to working to improve the lives of seniors, women, and \nminorities, Peggy Waxter also served as chairwoman of the Volunteers \nAdvisory Committee at Baltimore City Hospital, which is now the Johns \nHopkins Bayview Hospital, and as head of the Northeast Symphony \nSociety. Through these and numerous other service organizations, she \ninfluenced nearly every aspect of Baltimore society and was rightfully \nnamed by Baltimore Magazine one of the city's 11 most powerful women in \n1978.\n  Baltimore is a better city because of Peggy Waxter's guiding hand. \nShe is survived by her family: a daughter, Margaret Waxter Maher; a \nson, retired Baltimore City Circuit Court Judge Thomas J.S. Waxter, \nJr., with whom I was privileged to serve in the Maryland General \nAssembly from 1967 until 1971; 6 grandchildren; and 10 great-\ngrandchildren. I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to the Waxter \nfamily, and I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering her \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12138-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE CONRATH POST OFFICE\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to \nrecognize and congratulate the Conrath Post Office, located in Conrath, \nWI, on its 100th anniversary.\n  In 1904, the Conrath brothers settled in what would later become the \nvillage of Conrath. Located in northwest Wisconsin, the village sat on \nthe Wisconsin Central Railroad line between Owen, WI, and Duluth, MN. \nIn 1905, Frank Conrath sent 10 possible names to the railroad general \npassenger agent for the naming of the village. The general passenger \nagent decided on the name that still stands today: Conrath.\n  Mrs. Frank Conrath wrote to the postmaster general in 1905 to request \nthat a post office be established in the village. The post office moved \ninto the Rusk Farm Company Store where George W. Kendall became the \nfirst postmaster in 1907.\n  The first rural mail carrier in Conrath was Joseph Hahn, who \ndelivered the mail in a single-cylinder, chain-drive, high-wheel-car. \nThroughout the past century, there have been 21 postmasters and \npostmistresses, as well as numerous rural route carriers, who have \ndiligently served the residents of Conrath.\n  Just as Mrs. Conrath did over 100 years ago, residents in Conrath \nhave continued to express the need for the Conrath Post Office as well \nas value the service and benefit to their community. That is why I am \nproud to have worked with the residents of the village in support of \ntheir efforts to maintain this post office. When they told me it might \nclose, I worked with residents to convey these concerns to the U.S. \nPostal Service in order to ensure that this historic post office \nremains open and that rural residents continue to have effective and \nconsistent postal service.\n  On behalf of our State and Nation, I congratulate the Conrath Post \nOffice on its 100th anniversary and send my best wishes to all \nresidents of the village of Conrath.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12138-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING AUDREY KIRKPATRICK\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Audrey \nKirkpatrick, one of South Dakota's 2007 Congressional Coalition on \nAdoption Institute's Angels in Adoption Award recipients. Audrey has \nworked with Catholic Social Services in Rapid City, SD for 30 years, \nexhibiting empathy and dedication to birth families, adoptive parents, \nand adoptees. I am pleased to recognize Audrey for her years of \nservice, and extend my congratulations to her on this special occasion.\n  Audrey was among the first social workers employed by Catholic Social \nServices in Rapid City when she began her work with pregnancy \ncounseling and infant adoption in 1977. She remained with the agency \nuntil November 2002. At that time, Audrey believed the time had come \nfor her to retire. However, when the program director of the agency \nresigned, Audrey was called upon to return to Catholic Social Services \nand fill in the gap during that critical time, despite suffering from \nongoing health problems.\n  Audrey continues to be active in the agency on a part-time basis, and \nis often tapped by other social workers to answer questions, direct \npeople to resources, and provide ideas on how to continue expanding and \nfulfilling the agency's mission to facilitate the adoption process, in \naddition to her role working directly with families.\n  Stories of Audrey's intense commitment abound. She has been available \nto families 24 hours a day, going so far as to venture out in the \nmiddle of the night to help a young birth mother whose car had broken \ndown. On another occasion, she was present for a reunion of a birth \nmother and adult son, who she had helped to place in adoption as a \nchild. The mother offered her thanks to Audrey, who had been such a \ncomforting presence at the beginning and end of the adoption \nexperience. It is not uncommon for people to come back to the agency to \nexpress their gratitude to Audrey, even years after she helped them \nthrough the adoption process.\n  Audrey is truly an Angel in Adoption. Her contributions to the \ncommunities of western South Dakota are inestimable. In the words of \none of her coworkers, ``I can say with confidence that the gift Audrey \noffered to these individuals is stronger than words can express. \nDedication, alone, cannot describe it.'' Audrey is beyond a doubt \ndeserving of recognition for her commitment to ensuring that countless \nchildren in South Dakota have loving families and safe homes. It is \nclear that Audrey's legacy will be one of compassion and \ncaring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12138-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12138-S12139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING BREWER FEDERAL CREDIT UNION\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I congratulate the Brewer \nFederal Credit Union for being named the City of Brewer's 2007 Business \nof the Year. Founded in 1960, the Brewer Federal Credit Union has \ncontinually expanded its operations to serve an increasing number of \ncommunities in the Brewer area. With slightly over 20 employees, two \nbranches, ATMs throughout the region, and Internet banking services, \nthe credit union aims to make banking simpler for its roughly 8,400 \nmembers. Additionally, the Brewer Federal Credit Union's monthly \nnewsletter provides useful information to assist customers, including \nupdated information, news, and financial tips.\n  The city of Brewer recognized the Brewer Federal Credit Union for its \noutstanding service to the communities that it serves. Indeed, \ncountless acts of generosity demonstrate well the commitment of the \ncredit union to community service. During the Thanksgiving and \nChristmas holidays, the credit union assists the Brewer Community \nService Council in collecting nonperishable foods that are put together \nin baskets to be distributed to local families in need. When a student \nfrom the town of Orrington was selected for the People to People \nprogram, the Brewer Federal Credit Union helped the student collect old \ncell phones and used ink cartridges which, in turn, were given to local \nbusinesses for recycling, to help finance his trip to Australia. During \nthe annual Brewer Days, a fun-filled celebration held in September, the \nBrewer Federal Credit Union sponsors specific events, including a block \nparty and street dance. In a similar vein, the credit union has \nsponsored events like the Brewer waterfront winter festival. Finally, \nthe credit union generously supports local youth sports leagues, as \nwell as Brewer High School athletic programs, various student musical \nensembles, and the Boosters Club.\n  Helping others is clearly an integral part of the Brewer Federal \nCredit Union's equation for success. By providing a friendly and \nwelcoming business atmosphere, combined with compassionate assistance \nto individuals and groups within the community, the credit union sets a \ntruly remarkable example by leaving a positive mark on those whose \nlives it touches. The credit union's selection as Brewer's Business of \nthe Year is a recognition of the positive impact that the credit union\n\n[[Page S12139]]\n\nbrings to the city and a cogent reminder of the appreciation of \nBrewer's citizens for a local business that goes above and beyond the \ncall of duty. I congratulate the Brewer Federal Credit Union for its \nrecent award and wish everyone at the credit union continued success in \ntheir kind endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12139-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 976) to amend \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax relief for small \nbusinesses, and for other purposes, with amendments.\n                                  ____\n\n  At 12:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3625.

A bill to increase the wages and benefits of blue collar \nworkers by strengthening labor provisions in the H-2B program, to \nprovide for labor recruiter accountability, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Increasing \nAmerican Wages and Benefits Act of 2007.\n  Since 2000, key economic indicators confirm that the economic \nsecurity of Americans is moving in the wrong direction: nearly 5 \nmillion more Americans are living in poverty; nonelderly household \nincome has declined by nearly $2,500; over 3 million manufacturing jobs \nhave been lost; and 8.6 million more Americans are without health \ninsurance. While the rich have gotten richer, every other income group \nover the past 7 years has lost ground economically, with the middle \nclass and working families losing the most.\n  The Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act would begin to reverse \nthis downward economic trend for workers employed in construction, \nforestry, ski resorts, stone quarries, asphalt paving, hotels, \nrestaurants, landscaping, housekeeping and many other industries by \nreforming the H-2B guest-worker program.\n  Under current law and existing Federal regulations, employers \napplying for H-2B visas must first certify that capable U.S. workers \nare not available, efforts were made to recruit U.S. workers for these \npositions first, and the employment of guest workers will not adversely \naffect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. \nworkers.\n  As documented by the AFL-CIO, Change to Win, the Southern Poverty Law \nCenter and other groups, the H-2B program is frequently used by \nemployers to drive down the wages and benefits of U.S. workers, while \ncheating H-2B workers out of earned benefits. These abuses have clearly \nundermined the legislative and regulatory intent of this temporary \nguest-worker program.\n  The Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act would reform the H-2B \nprogram to ensure that workers receive the wages and benefits they \ndeserve and prevent employers from abusing the system.\n  Specifically, this legislation: requires employers to do a much \nbetter job at recruiting American workers first at higher wages before \nbeing able to hire H-2B guest-workers; provides the Department of Labor \nwith the explicit authority to enforce labor law violations pertaining \nto the H-2B program; allows workers who have been directly and \nadversely affected by the H-2B program\n\n[[Page S12144]]\n\nto have their day in court against unscrupulous employers; prohibits \ncompanies that have announced mass lay-offs within the past year from \nhiring H-2B guest-workers. Allows the Legal Services Corporation to \nprovide the same legal services to H-2B workers as it provides to H-2A \nworkers; requires employers to pay for the transportation expenses for \nH-2B guest workers both to the United States and back to their country \nof origin once the employment period ends; and provides other important \nprotections for H-2B guest-workers.\n\n  This legislation improves and strengthens the H-2B program so that it \ncan be used by employers during emergency labor shortages, while \nincreasing the wages and benefits for both American workers and guest-\nworkers.\n  I am proud that the Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act has \nthe strong support of the AFL-CIO; the Service Employees International \nUnion, SEIU; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; the Southern \nPoverty Law Center; the Building and Construction Trades Department; \nthe Laborers' International Union of North America; the United Food and \nCommercial Workers; the International Brotherhood of Electrical \nWorkers; the Alliance of Forest Workers and Harvesters; the United \nFarmworkers of America; and the Farmworkers Support Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of \nsupport.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2007.\n     Hon. Bernard Sanders,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sanders: The AFL-CIO strongly supports the \n     ``Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act of 2007,'' which \n     would strengthen necessary labor protections within the H-2B \n     seasonal non-agricultural guest worker program.\n       As demonstrated by a recent report issued by the Southern \n     Poverty Law Center, ``Close to Slavery,'' employers and \n     recruiters who seek to import seasonal workers through this \n     program have all too often engaged in questionable tactics \n     and subjected workers to exploitation. This exploitation \n     often goes undetected because the investigative and \n     enforcement mechanisms of the H-2B program are largely non-\n     existent.\n       Adequate enforcement of labor standards within the H-2B \n     seasonal guest worker program would not only help deter the \n     abuse of an imported foreign workforce, but would also \n     protect the wages and benefits offered to American workers, \n     who are unfairly forced to compete for jobs by employers who \n     appreciate the benefits of filling vacancies with a more \n     vulnerable workforce.\n       The suffering of one segment of our workforce has an \n     inevitable and damaging impact on every worker. We must stop \n     unscrupulous employers from padding their profit margins by \n     endangering workers and driving down wages and workplace \n     standards. We applaud your efforts to protect the living \n     standards of all who labor within our borders.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William Samuel,\n     Director, Department of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Immigrant Justice Project,\n\n\n                                  Southern Poverty Law Center,\n\n                               Montgomery, AL, September 17, 2007.\n     Hon. Bernie Sanders,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sanders: I write on behalf of the Southern \n     Poverty Law Center in support of the legislation you recently \n     introduced to reform the H-2B guestworker program. The bill, \n     ``The Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act,'' would \n     substantially improve the legal protections available to H-2B \n     workers and to American workers laboring in industries that \n     rely heavily on guestworkers.\n       Founded in 1971, the Southern Poverty Law Center is a civil \n     rights organization dedicated to advancing and protecting the \n     rights of minorities, the poor and victims of injustice in \n     significant civil rights and social justice matters. Our \n     Immigrant Justice Project represents low-income immigrant \n     workers in litigation across the Southeast.\n       During my legal career, I have represented and spoken with \n     literally thousands of H-2 guestworkers in many states. \n     Currently, the Southern Poverty Law Center is representing \n     workers in seven class action lawsuits on behalf of \n     guestworkers. We have also recently published a report about \n     the H-2 guestworker program in the United States entitled \n     ``Close to Slavery,'' which can be accessed at http://\nwww.splcenter.org/pdf/static/SPLCguestworker.pdf.\n       Our report, which discusses in detail the abuses suffered \n     by guestworkers, is based upon thousands of interviews with \n     workers as well as a review of the research on guestworker \n     programs, scores of legal cases and the experience of legal \n     experts from around the country. As the report reflects, \n     guestworkers are systematically exploited because the very \n     structure of the program places them at the mercy of a single \n     employer and provides no realistic means for workers to \n     exercise the few rights they have.\n       The H-2B guestworker program permits U.S. employers to \n     import human beings on a temporary basis from other nations \n     to perform work when the employer certifies that ``qualified \n     persons in the United States are not available and . . . the \n     terms of employment will not adversely affect the wages and \n     working conditions of workers in the U.S. similarly \n     employed.'' Those workers generally cannot bring with them \n     their immediate family members, and their status provides \n     them no route to permanent residency in the United States.\n       The program is rife with abuses. The abuses typically start \n     long before the worker has arrived in the United States, with \n     the recruitment process, and they continue through and even \n     after his or her employment here. Unlike U.S. citizens, guest \n     workers do not enjoy the most fundamental protection of a \n     competitive labor market--the ability to change jobs if they \n     are mistreated. If guestworkers complain about abuses, they \n     face deportation, blacklisting or other retaliation.\n       Our report documents rampant wage violations, recruitment \n     abuses, seizure of identity documents and squalid living \n     conditions, among other things. H-2B workers simply have very \n     few legal protections under our current law.\n       In addition, H-2B workers cannot reasonably enforce the few \n     rights they have under our current system. Providing workers \n     a way to enforce promises made to them by employers and \n     giving them access to legal services attorneys are important \n     steps in helping workers combat abuse and protect their \n     rights.\n       In conclusion, current guestworker programs for low-skilled \n     workers in the United States lack adequate worker protections \n     and lack any real means to enforce the protections that do \n     exist under federal law. Vulnerable workers desperately need \n     Congress to take the lead in demanding reform of this system. \n     Passage of this bill would go a long way toward remedying the \n     abuses that vulnerable workers experience in U.S. guestworker \n     programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Mary Bauer,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          United Food & Commercial\n\n\n                             Workers International Union, CLC,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2007.\n     Hon. Bernard Sanders,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sanders: On behalf of the 1.3 million members \n     of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union \n     (UFCW), I am writing to thank you for introducing the \n     ``Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act of 2007.'' UFCW \n     supports this legislation that will improve the legal \n     protections to H-2B seasonal non-agricultural workers.\n       It is clear that the current temporary non-immigrant \n     programs have not worked as intended and it is long past the \n     time for reform. UFCW has long advocated for reform of \n     existing guestworker programs. Many employers and recruiters \n     who recruit and hire workers through this program have \n     engaged in questionable tactics, and many of the workers have \n     been subjected to exploitation.\n       In addition, we believe that many of these jobs could and \n     would be filled by American workers, especially if the \n     employers offer appropriate wages and working conditions to \n     attract domestic workers. The ``Increasing American Wages and \n     Benefits Act'' will increase the enforcement for the program, \n     deter abuse of guestworkers, and would improve the wages, \n     benefits, and working conditions offered to these workers and \n     all American workers, who are unfairly forced to compete for \n     these jobs.\n       UFCW has been a long-time proponent of reforming \n     guestworker programs because, in spite of the theory, the \n     real world impact is that they have created an underclass of \n     workers, have held down wages, discouraged reporting of \n     workplace complaints, and reduced workers' ability to \n     organize and collectively bargain. In addition, the result of \n     the existing programs is that they have engendered \n     discriminatory attitudes toward individuals who are afforded \n     neither full rights nor benefits on the job, nor \n     participation in our society. Our experience is that no \n     matter how many worker protections have been written into \n     temporary worker programs, the approach inherently provides \n     employers with the opportunity to exploit workers and turn \n     permanent jobs into low-wage, no-benefit, and no-future jobs.\n       UFCW supports your reform efforts and we look forward to \n     working with you to enact this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael J. Wilson,\n       International Vice President, Director, Legislative and \n     Political Action Department.\n\n[[Page S12145]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                           Farmworker Justice,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2007.\n     Re reform of the H-2B Temporary Foreign Worker Program.\n     Senator Bernard Sanders,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sanders: Thank you for introducing the \n     Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act to reform the H-2B \n     guestworker program for seasonal employment Farmworker \n     Justice, a national advocacy and litigation organization for \n     agricultural workers, has had substantial experience helping \n     U.S. and foreign workers affected by the H-2B program as well \n     as the H-2A agricultural guestworker program. Our research \n     and direct experience cause us to conclude that substantial \n     reforms of the program are needed. We support the legislation \n     and hope that Congress enacts it immediately.\n       Currently, the H-2B law instructs the Department of Labor \n     to prevent employers that hire H-2B guestworkers based on \n     claimed labor shortages from displacing United States workers \n     and from adversely affecting their wages and working \n     conditions. The law's provisions fail to achieve these \n     objectives. The law also fails to prevent exploitation of \n     foreign citizens who, due to their poverty and the temporary, \n     nonimmigrant status of the H-2B visa, are vulnerable to \n     accepting substandard and often illegal employment \n     conditions. Further, the Department of Labor's policies and \n     actions fail to meet the statutory goals. The H-2B law must \n     be improved and your legislation would do so.\n       The need for strong protections in guestworker programs has \n     been demonstrated time and time again, in the hiring of \n     Chinese workers in the 1860's to 1870's, in the employment of \n     Mexican workers in the Bracero guestworker program in the \n     1940's to 1960's, and in the H-2A and H-2B guestworker \n     programs. Many employers find guestworkers advantageous \n     because they usually come from poor countries, where wages \n     are a small fraction of those in the U.S., and often will \n     work at very high productivity rates for significantly lower \n     wages than will U.S. workers. Guestworker programs have \n     displaced U.S. workers and depressed wage rates.\n       Your legislation is also important because it would begin a \n     process of regulating the international recruitment of \n     guestworkers by labor contracting firms that are hired by \n     employers in the United States. The guestworker recruitment \n     system often enables the ultimate employers to escape \n     responsibility for the mistreatment of the foreign citizens.\n       While we support reform of the H-2B program, we remain \n     skeptical that any guestworker program is consistent with \n     America's economic and democratic freedoms. We are a nation \n     of immigrants, not a nation of guestworkers. In America, \n     workers should have the freedom to switch employers, demand \n     better wages and working conditions, join unions and become \n     citizens with the right to vote. Although reform is one \n     critical step to protect U.S. workers from displacement and \n     wage depression and guestworkers from exploitation, \n     ultimately Congress should consider abolishing the program \n     and replacing it with a system based on a true immigration \n     status for workers who are needed in this country.\n       Thank you very much for introducing the Increasing American \n     Wages and Benefits Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Bruce Goldstein,\n     Excecutive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         Comite de Apoyo a los Transbajadores Agricolas--\n           Farmworkers Support Committee,\n                                Glassboro, NJ, September 19, 2007.\n     Re endorsement for the increasing American Wages and Benefits \n         Act.\n     Senator Sanders,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Sanders: CATA--El Comite de Apoyo a los \n     Trabajadores Agricolas, The Farmworker Support Committee, is \n     a grassroots migrant and immigrant worker organization whose \n     mission is to educate and empower workers so they are able to \n     defend their rights.\n       We at CATA acknowledge that the H-2B reform bill you have \n     prepared would provide greater protection to workers. Thank \n     you for your support in combating the abuse of current H-2B \n     workers.\n       We believe that maintaining equivalent wages between \n     American workers and guestworkers is critical for sustaining \n     appropriate working conditions and preventing the creation of \n     an underclass. We at CATA remain adamant that enforcement of \n     any legislation is key to its effectiveness at protecting \n     workers' rights.\n       We at CATA recommend further legislation to address the \n     portability of jobs to eliminate worker vulnerability under \n     the current law. We also insist on developing a mechanism for \n     H-2B workers to achieve permanent residence. Despite not \n     addressing these critical concerns that CATA has, the \n     Increasing American Wages and Benefits Act is a decisive step \n     forward for human rights.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Nelson Carrasquillo,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Ensign, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 2096. A bill to amend the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act to \neliminate the automatic removal of telephone numbers registered on the \nFederal ``do-not-call'' registry; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with \nSenators Stevens, Schumer, Ensign, Kerry, Kohl, Feingold, Clinton, \nFeinstein, and Nelson of Florida, the Do-Not-Call Improvement Act of \n2007. We seek with this bill to ensure that millions of Americans who \nsigned up for the ``Do-Not-Call'' registry do not face a resumption of \nunwanted calls from telemarketers next year when registrations on the \nregistry begin to expire.\n  Most Americans are unaware that their registration on the list is set \nto expire after 5 years. The expiration is unnecessary, most people who \ninitially wanted to be rid of telemarketing calls likely still want to \nblock these calls. The system automatically removes numbers that are \ndisconnected and reassigned.\n  The automatic expiration will only create a hassle for Americans as \nthey start receiving calls again and have to go through the process of \nre-registering. The U.S. Government would have to spend money to let \npeople know they need to sign up again.\n  This bill would prevent the automatic expiration and removal of \nnumbers from the registry.\n  Congress established the ``Do Not Call'' registry in 2003. It quickly \nbecame one of the most popular consumer protection programs in history. \nCongress did not provide for automatic expiration of ``Do Not Call'' \nlist registrations, but the FTC and FCC included an automatic five year \nexpiration for registrations when they wrote the rules for implementing \nthe program.\n  That was not what Congress intended. As things stand today, 52 \nmillion Americans will either have to re-register on October 1, 2008, \nor get ready to hear their telephones ringing during supper time again \nwith unwanted, commercial solicitation calls.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2096\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modify the optional method of computing net \nearnings from self-employment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \naddress an injustice in the Tax Code that is threatening family farmers \nand other self-employed individuals. Some of my constituents, primarily \nWisconsin farmers, have requested Congress's assistance to correct the \nTax Code so they can protect their families. The legislation I \nintroduce today, the Farmer Tax Fairness Act of 2007, is similar to \nlegislation I introduced in the last two Congresses and will solve the \nproblem for today and into the future.\n  Farming is vital to Wisconsin. Wisconsin's agricultural industry \nplays a large and important role in the growth\n\n[[Page S12146]]\n\nand prosperity of the entire State. Wisconsin's status as ``America's \nDairyland'' is central to our State's agriculture industry. Wisconsin's \ndairy farmers produce approximately 23 billion pounds of milk and lead \nthe Nation in cheese production with over 25 percent or 2.5 billion \npounds of cheese a year. But Wisconsin's farmers produce much more than \nmilk; they also are national leaders in the production of butter, \npotatoes, ginseng, cranberries, various processing vegetables, and many \norganic foods. So when the hardworking farmers of Wisconsin need help, \nI will do all I can to assist.\n  One concern that I have heard from Wisconsin farmers is that the Tax \nCode can limit their eligibility for social safety net programs, \nincluding old age, survivors, and disability insurance, OASDI, under \nSocial Security and the hospital insurance HI part of Medicare. These \nprograms are paid for through payroll taxes on workers and through the \nself-employment tax on the income of self-employed individuals. To be \neligible for OSADI and HI benefits an individual must be fully insured \nand must have earned a minimum amount of income in the years \nimmediately preceding the need for coverage. Every year, the Social \nSecurity Administration, SSA, sets the amount of earned income that \nindividuals must pay taxes on to earn quarters of coverage, QCs, and \nmaintain their benefits. An individual's eligibility requirements \ndepend upon the age at which death or disability occurs, but for \nworkers over 31 years of age, they must have earned at least 20 QCs \nwithin the past 10 years.\n  Self-employed individuals can have highly variable income, and, \nparticularly for farmers who are at the whim of Mother Nature, not \nevery year is a good year. During lean years, individuals may not earn \nenough income to maintain adequate coverage under OASDI and HI. \nTherefore, the Tax Code provides options to allow self-employed \nindividuals to maintain eligibility for benefits. These options allow \nindividuals to choose to pay taxes based on $1,600 of earned income, \nthus allowing self-employed entrepreneurs to maintain the same Federal \nprotections even when their income varies.\n  Unfortunately, both the options for farmers and nonfarmers, Social \nSecurity Act Sec. 211(a) and I.R.C. Sec. 1402(a), have not kept pace \nwith inflation, and they no longer provide security to families across \nthe country. Decades ago, self-employment income of $1,600 earned an \nindividual four QCs under SSA's calculations. In 2001, the amount \nneeded to earn a QC rose to $830 of earned income, so individuals \nelecting the optional methods were only able to earn one QC per year; \nmaking it much harder for them to remain eligible for benefits because \nthey must average 2 QCs per year to be eligible. With inflation, there \nis no chance of the amount needed to earn a QC dropping on its own and \nit has steadily risen since 2001, so legislation is needed to fix this \nunanticipated erosion in this option for farmers and the self-employed.\n  Congress's failure to address this problem threatens the ability of \nself-employed individuals to maintain eligibility for OASDI and HI. I \nhave heard from several of my constituent who want these options to be \nfixed so they can make sure their families will be taken care of in the \nevent that something unforeseen occurs.\n  Therefore, I am introducing the Farmer Tax Fairness Act of 2007 in \norder to provide farmers and self-employed individuals with a fair \nchoice. Under this bill, they will continue to be able to elect the \noptional method if they so choose. When individuals do elect the \noption, this legislation provides an update to the Tax Code so farmers \nand self-employed individuals can retain full eligibility for OASDI and \nHI benefits. It indexes the optional income levels to SSA's QC \ncalculations, allowing these farmers and self-employed individuals to \nclaim enough earned income to qualify for four OCs annually. In \naddition, by linking the earned income level to SSA's requirements for \nQCs, the bill will ensure that the amount of income deemed to be earned \nunder the optional methods will not need to be adjusted by Congress \nagain.\n  Along with providing security to self-employed individuals and \nfarmers across the country, this solution is fiscally responsible. It \ncould even provide a short run increase in U.S. Treasury revenues while \nhaving negligible impact upon the Social Security trust fund in the \nlong run.\n  Let me take a moment to acknowledge the efforts of the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Grassley, to address this problem in the 107th Congress. As \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, he included similar \nlegislative language in the chairman's mark for the Small Business and \nFarm Economic Recovery Act of 2002. The Senate Finance Committee held a \nmarkup on the legislation on September 19, 2002, but the changes to the \noptional methods did not become law.\n  When incomes fall, the Tax Code provides optional methods for \ncalculating net earnings to ensure that farmers and self-employed \nindividuals maintain eligibility for social safety net programs. When \nthese provisions were developed, Congress intended self-employed \nindividuals to have the ability to pay enough to earn a full 4 QCs. \nUnfortunately the Tax Code has not kept up with the times and due to \ninflation many farmers are losing eligibility for some of Social \nSecurity's programs. Congress needs to provide security to farm \nfamilies and other self-employed individuals. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Farmer Tax Fairness Act of 2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2097\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Northern Plains Heritage Area in the \nState of North Dakota; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nConrad to introduce legislation called the Northern Plains Heritage \nArea Act. This legislation would designate a core area of historically \nsignificant resources in Burleigh, McLean, Mercer, Morton and Oliver \ncounties in North Dakota.\n  This National Heritage Area extends nearly the entire length of the \nlast of the free-flowing Missouri River in North Dakota, the last place \nthe river can be seen as it was seen by Lewis and Clark and the \nancestors of today's Mandan and Hidatsa tribes.\n  But what makes this area a particularly good fit for a National \nHeritage Area designation is the distinction arising from the patterns \nof human activity shaped by geography. This is the northern extremity \nof Native agriculture on the Great Plains.\n  The scenic breaks of North Dakota's Missouri Valley overlook a rich \nagricultural tradition stretching back a thousand years. Along the \nlength of the State's remaining free-flowing Missouri River, from Huff \nNational Landmark on the south to the Knife River Indian Villages \nNational Historic Site on the north, the Northern Plains Heritage Area \nwould encompass the ancient homeland of the Mandan and Hidatsa nations.\n  While farming methods have changed, the agricultural traditions and \nthe scenic, cultural and historic values remain. The same attributes of \ngeography and climate that attracted the Mandan and Hidatsa later \nappealed to homesteading farmers and ranchers and the energy industry, \nall of whom benefited from the natural resources of the land.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2098\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nassist low-income Medicare beneficiaries by improving eligibility and \nservices under the Medicare Savings Program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kerry, \nSalazar and Stabenow to introduce the Medicare Savings Program \nImprovement Act of 2007. This legislation would make critical \nimprovements to the Medicare Savings Programs, which provide important \ncost-assistance for low-income Medicare beneficiaries through the \nMedicaid program and include the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary, QMB, \nSpecified Low-income Medicare Beneficiary, SLMB, and Qualified \nIndividuals-1, QI-1, programs.\n  One of the most significant improvements within this legislation is \nto make permanent the QI-1 program, which expires at the end of this \nmonth. This program provides vital assistance to low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries in paying for Medicare Part B premiums. It was \nestablished as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and was \nauthorized for 5 years. Unfortunately, every few years we in Congress\n\n[[Page S12149]]\n\nmust act to reauthorize this program, providing unnecessary uncertainty \nfor beneficiaries and State Medicaid programs.\n  Congress should not participate in this annual last minute scramble \nto try and extend the program for a few months or a year. It is a \ndisservice to the States, who must watch the Congress closely to \nconstantly prepare to send out disenrollment notices and lay off staff, \neven though they are relatively certain the program will be extended. \nBut, more importantly, it is a disservice to the 185,000 beneficiaries \nthat need this important assistance, as many of those enrolled worry \nthis benefit will be taken away and many of those never enrolled are \nnot told of the benefit since States and advocates are spending their \ntime trying to get the program extended rather than conducting \noutreach.\n  While I remain very hopeful that the Congress will pass an extension \nof the QI-1 program for an additional period in the coming week, I am \nintroducing the Medicare Savings Program Improvement Act of 2007 today \nin the hope that Congress will end this process of temporary extensions \nand permanently authorize the program, as provided for in this \nlegislation.\n  Furthermore, the bill proposes several improvements to the Medicare \nSavings Programs and application processes that will make these low-\nincome benefits both more efficient to administer and more accessible \nto the individuals who need them. It would also seek to simplify the \nprocess of applying for Medicare Savings Programs and make the Programs \nmore understandable to low-income senior citizens and people with \ndisabilities, as well as State and Federal Government officials.\n  Rates of enrollment in the Medicare Savings Programs are well below \nthose of other means-tested benefit programs. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that only 33 percent of eligible people are \nparticipating in the QMB program, and that the participation rate in \nthe SLMB program is only 13 percent--these figures exclude people who \nare eligible for full Medicaid benefits. In comparison, participation \nrates are estimated to be 75 percent in the earned income tax credit, \n66 percent to 73 percent for Supplemental Security Income, and 66 \npercent to 70 percent for Medicaid.\n  In New Mexico, over 1,500 low-income Medicare beneficiaries receive \nthe QI-1 benefit, which saves them almost $1,000 in Medicare Part B \npremium out-of-pocket costs annually. Unfortunately, according to \nestimates made by the Medicare Rights Center using Census Bureau data, \nover 11,000 are likely to be eligible. Many are completely unaware of \nthe assistance this program offers. This is usually because many \neligible individuals are difficult to reach or communicate with because \nthey are isolated, cannot read or speak English, have difficulty seeing \nor hearing, or lack transportation.\n  To briefly describe the most critical aspects of the legislation, \nSection 2 of the bill provides for one unified name for the Federal \nprograms that offer cost sharing and benefit assistance for low income \nMedicare beneficiaries. Rather than separately referring to the QMB, \nSLMB, and QI-1 programs, the bill provides one common name for all of \nthese programs, the ``Medicare Savings Programs.'' Aligning these \nprograms under one title helps to establish greater uniformity in \nincome and resource limits, simplifies the application process, makes \nmore people eligible for subsidies and increases the enrollment in \nprograms.\n  Low enrollment in these assistance programs is in large part due to \nthe lack of knowledge and understanding of the programs or benefits \noffered. For example, 79 percent of non-enrolled eligible people have \never heard of the Medicare Savings Programs and two thirds of enrollees \nneed assistance in completing the lengthy application form. This simple \nchange has been pilot tested with Medicare beneficiary groups and found \nto elicit a positive response and interest from Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Section 3 of the legislation would make permanent the QI-1 category \nby incorporating these individuals into the SLMB category at 100 \npercent Federal medical percentage, FMAP, matching rate. In addition to \nsimplifying and making permanent the program, such a change would \nensure funding for QI-1 cost-sharing.\n  Section 5 eliminates the limit on assets, which is set at $4,000 for \nan individual and $6,000 for a couple and disqualifies millions of \nMedicare beneficiaries with very low incomes from qualifying for \nassistance. Many potential beneficiaries do not apply for benefits \nbecause they incorrectly assume that they have too many assets to \nqualify or fear losing their estate. Some States have waived or \ndisallowed the counting of some assets for the purposes of eligibility \ndetermination and have seen much higher enrollment rates. The \nrequirements to document one's assets also makes the application \nprocess burdensome and deters potential enrollees who might pass the \nasset test.\n  Finally, section 8 eliminates some of the critical barriers to \nenrollment. As I noted earlier, rates of enrollment in the Medicare \nSavings Programs are well below those of other means-tested. benefit \nprograms. This section provides for several important enrollment \nsimplification procedures, such as allowing self-certification of \nincome and continuous eligibility, and expanded outreach efforts. For \ninstance, instead of requiring people to apply for benefits at the \nstate Medicaid office, the Social Security Administration took \napplications and forwarded them to Medicaid offices for processing and \nincreased enrollment by 10 percent. Perhaps with more outreach efforts \nprovided within this bill, even more low-income Medicare beneficiaries \nwill receive the health care for which they are eligible.\n  I urge the Congress to pass a temporary extension of the QI-1 program \nearly next week, but then to immediately begin work to permanently \nauthorize the QI-1 program and to simplify and streamline all the \nMedicare Savings Programs. Our Nation's low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries and the States deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2101\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to phase \nout the 24-month waiting period for disabled individuals to become \neligible for Medicare benefits, to eliminate the waiting period for \nindividuals with life-threatening conditions, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation entitled ``Ending the Medicare Disability Waiting Period \nAct of 2007 with Senators Obama, Salazar, Brown, Kerry, Stabenow, \nCantwell, and Clinton. This legislation would phase-out the current 2 \nyear waiting period that people with disabilities must endure after \nqualifying for Social Security Disability Insurance SSDI. In the \ninterim or as the waiting period is being phased out, the bill would \nalso create a process by which the secretary can immediately waive the \nwaiting period for people with life threatening illnesses.\n  When Medicare was expanded in 1972 to include people with significant \ndisabilities, lawmakers created the 24-month waiting period. According \nto a April 2007 report from the Commonwealth Fund, it is estimated that \nover 1.5 million SSDI beneficiaries are in the Medicare waiting period \nat any given time, ``all of whom are unable to work because of their \ndisability and most of whom have serious health problems, low incomes, \nand limited access to health insurance.'' Nearly 39 percent of these \nindividuals do not have health insurance coverage for some point during \nthe waiting period and 26 percent have no health insurance during this \nperiod.\n  The stated reason at the time was to limit the fiscal cost of the \nprovision. However, Mr. President, I would assert that there is no \nreason, be it fiscal or moral, to tell people that they must wait \nlonger than two years after becoming severely disabled before we give \nprovide them access to much needed health care.\n  In fact, it is important to note that there really are actually three \nwaiting periods that are imposed upon people seeking to qualify for \nSSDI. First, there is the disability determination process through the \nSocial Security Administration, which often takes many months or even \nlonger than a year in some cases. Second, once a worker has been \ncertified as having a severe or permanent disability, they must wait an \nadditional five months before receiving their first SSDI check. And \nthird, after receiving that first SSDI check, there is the 2-year \nperiod that people must wait before their Medicare coverage begins.\n  What happens to the health and well-being of people waiting more than \n2\\1/2\\ years before they finally receive critically needed Medicare \ncoverage? According to Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, \nwhich has conducted several important studies on the issue, \n``Individuals in the waiting period for Medicare suffer from a broad \nrange of debilitating diseases and are in urgent need of appropriate \nmedical care to manage their conditions. Eliminating the 2-year wait \nwould ensure access to care for those already on the way to Medicare.''\n  Again, we are talking about individuals that have been determined to \nbe unable to engage in any ``substantial, gainful activity'' because of \neither a physical or mental impairment that is expected to result in \ndeath or to continue for at least 12 months. These are people that, by \ndefinition, are in more need of health coverage than anybody else in \nour society. The consequences are unacceptable and are, in fact, dire.\n  The majority of people who become disabled were, before their \ndisability, working full-time jobs and paying into Medicare like all \nother employed Americans. At the moment these men and women need \ncoverage the most, just when they have lost their health, their jobs, \ntheir income, and their health insurance, Federal law requires them to \nwait two full years to become eligible for Medicare. Many of these \nindividuals are needlessly forced to accumulate tens-of-thousands of \ndollars in healthcare debt or compromise their health due to forgone \nmedical treatment. Many individuals are forced to\n\n[[Page S12154]]\n\nsell their homes or go bankrupt. Even more tragically, more than 16,000 \ndisabled beneficiaries annually, about 4 percent of beneficiaries, do \nnot make it through the waiting period. They die before their Medicare \ncoverage ever begins.\n  Removing the waiting period is well worth the expense. According to \nthe Commonwealth Fund, analyses have shown providing men and women with \nMedicare at the time that Social Security certifies them as disabled \nwould cost $8.7 billion annually. This cost would be partially offset \nby $4.3 billion in reduced Medicaid spending by Medicaid, which many \nindividuals require during the waiting period. In addition, untold \nexpenses borne by the individuals involved could be avoided, as well as \nthe costs of charity care on which many depend. Moreover, there may be \nadditional savings to the Medicare program itself, which often has to \nbear the expense of addressing the damage done during the waiting \nperiod. During this time, deferred health care can worsen conditions, \ncreating additional health problems and higher costs.\n  Further exacerbating the situation, some beneficiaries have had the \nunfortunate fate of having received SSI and Medicaid coverage, applied \nfor SSDI, and then lost their Medicaid coverage because they were not \naware the change in income when they received SSDI would push them over \nthe financial limits for Medicaid. In such a case, and let me emphasize \nthis point, the government is effectively taking their health care \ncoverage away because they are so severely disabled.\n  Therefore, for some in the waiting period, their battle is often as \nmuch with the Government as it is with their medical condition, \ndisease, or disability.\n  Nobody could possible think this makes any sense.\n  As the Medicare Rights Center has said, ``By forcing Americans with \ndisabilities to wait 24 months for Medicare coverage, the current law \neffectively sentences these people to inadequate health care, poverty, \nor death. . . . Since disability can strike anyone, at any point in \nlife, the 24-month waiting period. should be of concern to everyone, \nnot just the millions of Americans with disabilities today.''\n  Although elimination of the Medicare waiting period will certainly \nincrease Medicare costs, it is important to note that there will be \nsome corresponding decrease in Medicaid costs. Medicaid, which is \nfinanced by both Federal and State governments, often provides coverage \nfor a subset of disabled Americans in the waiting period, as long as \nthey meet certain income and asset limits. Income limits are typically \nat or below the poverty level, including at just 74 percent of the \npoverty line in New Mexico, with assets generally limited to just \n$2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples.\n  Furthermore, from a continuity of care point of view, it makes little \nsense that somebody with disabilities must leave their job and their \nhealth providers associated with that plan, move on to Medicaid, often \nhave a different set of providers, then switch to Medicare and yet \nanother set of providers. The cost, both financial and personal, of not \nproviding access to care or poorly coordinated care services for these \nseriously ill people during the waiting period may be greater in many \ncases than providing health coverage.\n  Finally, private-sector employers and employees in those risk-pools \nwould also benefit from the passage of the bill. As the Commonwealth \nFund has noted, ``. . . to the extent that disabled adults rely on \ncoverage through their prior employer or their spouse's employer, \neliminating the waiting period would also produce savings to employers \nwho provide this coverage.''\n  To address concerns about costs and immediate impact on the Medicare \nprogram, the legislation phases out the waiting period over a 10-year \nperiod. In the interim, the legislation would create a process by which \nothers with life-threatening illnesses could also get an exception to \nthe waiting period. Congress has previously extended such an exception \nto the waiting period individuals with amyothrophic lateral sclerosis, \nALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and for hospice services. The \nALS exception passed the Congress in December 2000 and went into effect \nJuly 1, 2001. Thus, the legislation would extend the exception to all \npeople with life-threatening illnesses in the waiting period.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2102\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the in the home restriction for Medicare coverage of mobility \ndevices for individuals with expected long-term needs; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Obama, \nSalazar, Collins, and Lieberman to introduce the Medicare Independent \nLiving Act of 2007. This legislation would eliminate Medicare's ``in \nthe home'' restriction for the coverage of mobility devices, including \nwheelchairs and scooters, for those with disabilities and expected \nlong-term needs. This includes people with multiple sclerosis, \nparaplegia, osteoarthritis, and cerebrovascular disease that includes \nacute stroke and conditions like aneurysms.\n  As currently interpreted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, the ``in the home'' restriction only permits \nbeneficiaries to obtain wheelchairs that are necessary for use inside \nthe home. As a result, seriously disabled beneficiaries who would \nprimarily utilize a wheelchair outside the home are prevented from \nreceiving this critical and basic equipment through Medicare. For \nexample, this restriction prevents beneficiaries from receiving \nwheelchairs to access their work, the community-at-large, place of \nworship, school, physician's offices, or pharmacies.\n  On July 13, 2005, 34 senators wrote Secretary Leavitt asking the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to modify the ``in the \nhome'' requirement so as to ``improve community access for Medicare \nbeneficiaries with mobility impairments.'' Unfortunately, CMS continues \nto impose the ``in the home'' restriction on Medicare beneficiaries in \nneed of mobility devices.\n  As the Medicare Rights Center in a report entitled ``Forced \nIsolation: Medicare's `In The home' Coverage Standards for \nWheelchairs'' in March 2004 notes, ``This effectively disqualifies you \nfrom leaving your home without the assistance of others.''\n  Furthermore, in a Kansas City Star article dated July 3, 2005, Mike \nOxford with the National Council on Independent Living noted, ``You \nlook at mobility assistance as a way to liberate yourself.'' He added \nthat the restriction ``is just backward.''\n  In fact, policies such as these are not only backward but directly \ncontradict numerous initiatives aimed at increasing community \nintegration of people with disabilities, including the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the Ticket-to-Work Program, the New Freedom \nInitiative, and the Olmstead Supreme Court decision.\n  According to the Medicare Rights Center update dated March 23, 2006, \n``This results in arbitrary denials. People with apartments too small \nfor a power wheelchair are denied a device that could also get them \ndown the street. Those in more spacious quarters get coverage, allowing \nthem to scoot from room to room and to the grocery store. People who \nsummon all their willpower and strength to hobble around a small \napartment get no help for tasks that are beyond them and their front \ndoor.''\n  In New Mexico, I have heard this complaint about the law repeatedly \nfrom our State's most vulnerable disabled and senior citizens. People \nargue the provision is being misinterpreted by the administration and \nresults in Medicare beneficiaries being trapped in their home.\n  The ITEM Coalition adds in a letter to CMS on this issue in November \n25, 2005, ``There continues to be no clinical basis for the `in the \nhome' restriction and by asking treating practioners to document \nmedical need only within the home setting, CMS is severely restricting \npatients from receiving the most appropriate devices to meet their \nmobility needs.''\n  My legislation would clarify that this restriction does not apply to \nmobility devices, including wheelchairs, for people with disabilities \nin the Medicare Program. The language change is fairly simple and \nsimply clarifies that the ``in the home'' restriction for durable \nmedical equipment does not apply in the case of mobility devices needed \nby Medicare beneficiaries with expected long-term needs for use ``in \ncustomary settings such as normal domestic, vocational, and community \nactivities.''\n  This legislation is certainly not intended to discourage CMS from \ndedicating its resources to reducing waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nMedicare system, as those efforts are critical to ensuring that \nMedicare remains financially viable and strong in the future. However, \nit should be noted that neither Medicaid nor the Department of Veterans \nAffairs impose such ``in the home'' restrictions on mobility devices.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter sent to Secretary Leavitt be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2103\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Independent Living \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Leavitt: The undersigned members write to \n     request that you modify the ``in the home'' requirement in \n     Medicare's wheeled mobility benefit to improve community \n     access for Medicare beneficiaries with mobility impairments.\n       We commend CMS for its dedication to reducing waste, fraud \n     and abuse in the Medicare system, particularly under the \n     mobility device benefit, and fully support your intention to \n     protect precious Medicare funds and resources. Additionally, \n     we commend the agency for recently taking on the task of \n     creating a new and, hopefully, more appropriate Medicare \n     coverage criteria for mobility devices. However, we are \n     concerned that CMS' current interpretation of the ``in the\n\n[[Page S12156]]\n\n     home'' requirement may continue to act as an inappropriate \n     restriction in meeting the real-life mobility needs of \n     Medicare beneficiaries with physical disabilities and \n     mobility impairments.\n       Recently CMS announced a final National Coverage \n     Determination (NCD) for mobility assistance equipment (MAE) \n     that fails to adequately address the concerns of \n     beneficiaries and other parties with the ``in the home'' \n     restriction.\n       In order to ensure that the ``in the home'' requirement \n     does not act as a barrier to community participation for \n     Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities and mobility \n     impairments; we ask that you modify this requirement through \n     the regulatory process. Additionally, if your agency \n     concludes that the ``in the home'' requirement cannot be \n     addressed through the regulatory process, we request that you \n     respond with such information as quickly as possible, so that \n     Congress may begin examining legislative alternatives.\n       We thank you for your consideration of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jeff Bingaman; Rick Santorum; John Kerry; Joseph I. \n           Lieberman; Barbara Mikulski; Maria Cantwell; Edward M. \n           Kennedy; Patty Murray; Evan Bayh; Mark Dayton; Jack \n           Reed; Johnny Isakson; Sam Brownback; Jon S.

Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be \n     construed to include the approval of State proposals that \n     involve waivers or modifications in applicable Federal law.\n       (5) Program or project period.--A State program or project \n     may be approved for a period of 5 years and may be extended \n     for subsequent 5-year periods upon approval by the Commission \n     and the Secretary, based upon achievement of targets, except \n     that a shorter period may be requested by a State and granted \n     by the Secretary.\n       (e) Expedited Congressional Consideration.--\n       (1) Introduction and committee consideration.--\n\n[[Page S12165]]\n\n       (A) Introduction.--The legislative proposal submitted \n     pursuant to subsection (d)(4)(B) shall be in the form of a \n     joint resolution (in this subsection referred to as the \n     ``resolution''). Such resolution shall be introduced in the \n     House of Representatives by the Speaker, and in the Senate, \n     by the majority leader, immediately upon receipt of the \n     language and shall be referred to the appropriate committee \n     of Congress. If the resolution is not introduced in \n     accordance with the preceding sentence, the resolution may be \n     introduced in either House of Congress by any member thereof.\n       (B) Committee consideration.--A resolution introduced in \n     the House of Representatives shall be referred to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives. \n     A resolution introduced in the Senate shall be referred to \n     the Committee on Finance of the Senate. Not later than 15 \n     calendar days after the introduction of the resolution, the \n     committee of Congress to which the resolution was referred \n     shall report the resolution or a committee amendment thereto. \n     If the committee has not reported such resolution (or an \n     identical resolution) at the end of 15 calendar days after \n     its introduction or at the end of the first day after there \n     has been reported to the House involved a resolution, \n     whichever is earlier, such committee shall be deemed to be \n     discharged from further consideration of such reform bill and \n     such reform bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar \n     of the House involved.\n       (2) Expedited procedure.--\n       (A) Consideration.--Not later than 5 days after the date on \n     which a committee has been discharged from consideration of a \n     resolution, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or \n     the Speaker's designee, or the majority leader of the Senate, \n     or the leader's designee, shall move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the committee amendment to the resolution, \n     and if there is no such amendment, to the resolution. It \n     shall also be in order for any member of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, respectively, to move to \n     proceed to the consideration of the resolution at any time \n     after the conclusion of such 5-day period. All points of \n     order against the resolution (and against consideration of \n     the resolution) are waived. A motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of the resolution is highly privileged in the \n     House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and \n     is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, to \n     a motion to postpone consideration of the resolution, or to a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of other business.

Mr. President, I appreciate everyone's cooperation. I will \nsay we have a lot to do. It is all up to us when we get it done. I hope \nit does not spill over into the weekend. If things work out right, we \ncould finish everything tomorrow. We will have to see. But we are going \nto try to. I know that may be wishful thinking on my part. But we are \ngoing to try to get as much done as we can.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It strikes me that there is no good reason why we \nshould not wrap this up tomorrow. I think virtually all of the items \nleft to be dealt with, there is broad agreement on on a bipartisan \nbasis that we ought to pass.\n  I will be working with the majority leader to complete our work for \nthe week at the earliest possible time.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I wish to be able to complete, prior to \na week from Friday, the Defense appropriations bill.\n  I would also like to have a run at Commerce-State-Justice, which \ndeals with the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration. I would \nlike to be able to do those two appropriations bills before we leave. \nWe have a tremendous burden to do the rest of the appropriations bills. \nThe House has passed them. It is easier for them to do than us. I have \nrequested that we start our conferences. I want real conferences like \nwe used to have around here when the distinguished Republican leader \nand I were a little bit younger, when we actually had conferences where \npeople sat down and talked about different issues. We are going to try \nto do that and get a number of these done so we can send them to the \nPresident. I think that is what will get this program moving along.\n  I have spoken to the head of the Office of Management and Budget. \nEven though he may not be able to agree with what I want, I have found \nhim a person who is agreeable. I talk to him anytime I call him.\n  Maybe we can work our way through this. But we can't do it unless we \nhave bills that are completed that we can send to the President. It is \nnot just going to happen by magic. I personally believe it is not good \nfor this country to have long-standing continuing resolutions. We need \nto do our job. That is why I hope we can complete our work so next week \nwe can do the appropriations bills.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the majority leader will yield once again, I concur \nwith the goal of completing those two appropriations bills next week. I \nwill be encouraging everyone on this side to work in a cooperative \nspirit to achieve the result the majority leader has laid out. It is \ngood for the Senate and good for the country to get this work done. We \nwill be cooperating in every way possible toward that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/26/senate-section/article/S12187-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.
