Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration \nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act legislation. Senators \nWhitehouse, Cardin, and Feingold have said they will come and offer \nthree amendments this afternoon. After finishing these, we will have \nabout eight more amendments offered. They will all have time \nagreements, except Senator Feinstein's, but that is not a problem at \nall. They can probably work out the language on that, and it probably \nwon't have to be debated.\n  There is no reason we cannot finish this most important legislation \ntomorrow. We should vote on those three amendments tonight. I hope we \ncan do that. There will be other things that can be debated tonight.\n  Tomorrow, I would like to come in and have three of the most \ncontroversial amendments offered in the morning. One deals with the \nDodd-Feingold amendment to strike retroactive immunity from the \nlegislation--that part of the Intelligence Committee legislation; the \namendment offered by Senator Cardin, who changed the--one amendment is \nto take away retroactive immunity. The other is to deal with\n\n[[Page S562]]\n\nthe substitution, which is a Specter-Whitehouse amendment. Finally, \nthere is one by Senator Feinstein, which deals with exclusivity of \nhaving the FISA Court, the one that handles the intelligence \neavesdropping we do in this country. I would like to do those in the \nmorning. We can do that. There will be 2 hours per amendment. We can \nfinish those and have votes in the afternoon. The rest of the \namendments are limited to several minutes on each side. Some can \nprobably be worked out.\n  We need to finish this legislation very quickly, and we need to \nfinish the conference as soon as we can. That is what I would like to \ndo tonight and tomorrow.\n  I have had a conversation with the Republican leader, and we are \ngoing to give him my proposed amendment--that is, the Finance Committee \npackage. Basically, the only thing that would be added to that is \nlegislation dealing with LIHEAP, which has wide-ranging support on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  We also would take from the House bill some of the language they \nhave, which would add to what we have in the bill. So we hope to get to \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S562-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S562-S563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, each day newspapers around the country tell \nus news stories of America's economic troubles--and there are economic \ntroubles. I was told by Senator Corzine, before he became Governor--and \nhe made millions and millions of dollars on Wall Street--regarding the \nmarket, that you can always understand when the economy is in big \ntrouble when there are large fluctuations in the stock market. If his \nwords are meaningful, and I believe they are, that is what we have had \nto deal with lately--wide fluctuations in the stock market.\n  Today, I looked before I left for the floor, and the market was about \n100 points down. Last week, it was up several times by more than a \nhundred points and then down a few hundred points. That is not an \neconomy that is feeling good about itself.\n  Housing foreclosures are dramatically up in cities and towns \nthroughout the country, including an astonishing rate in Reno, NV, of \nmore than 600 percent. In Las Vegas, it is 200 percent. In Florida, it \nis 275 percent. In California, with 37 million people, it is up more \nthan 300 percent.\n  Gas prices are well above $3 per gallon throughout the country. The \naverage price is $3.02 a gallon. Some States are significantly higher, \nand California and Nevada feel that very much.\n  Heating costs are skyrocketing. This is the time when especially the \nNortheast depends so much on heating oil. Those prices are hard to \nhandle for people.\n  Friday, the Department of Labor's jobs report showed that 17,000 \nnonfarm jobs were cut in January. With the cost of heating homes, this \nis very difficult.\n  I was able to spend some time at home in Searchlight after Christmas. \nI paid the bill last night. In Searchlight, NV, $480 was the cost of my \nbill for heating our house. I wasn't even there all that time. Mr. \nPresident, I can pay that bill, but some people cannot. So they have to \nmake a choice between staying cold or not paying the bill. Most of them \nstay cold because they know they cannot get out of paying their bill.\n  Again, Friday, the Department of Labor jobs report showed that 17,000 \njobs were cut in January. These are 17,000 husbands, wives, sons, and \ndaughters who don't have a job. They wonder what they are going to do.\n  After 8 years of economic growth during the Clinton years, the Bush \nadministration's 7 years have shown anemic job growth. Now job growth \nis nonexistent, negative. During the Reagan years, about 22.5 million \njobs were created. With troubling statistics such as we have had these \npast 7 years--yes, there have been jobs added, but they have been very \nweak--and growing economic challenges in our daily lives, it is no \nwonder that polls show the American people are now more concerned about \nthe economy than the intractable war in Iraq. Congress cannot solve \nthis problem on its own with a single piece of legislation, but we can \nand must help.\n  Last week, the House sent us a plan that was a good first step. It \nwas a first step, but we have a chance now in the Senate to make the \nplan better. On a bipartisan basis, Senators Baucus and Grassley have \nworked together to send us a bipartisan package we can all support, and \nwe should support it.\n  The Finance Committee package sends stimulus checks to 21.5 million \nsenior citizens, who would get nothing from the House bill. Most of \nthem are living on fixed incomes, but they are facing high living \ncosts, as I have mentioned with the heating bill for my little home in \nSearchlight, and medicine and groceries, which are anything but fixed. \nGive them the money, and these seniors will spend that money.\n  This Finance Committee package sends checks to 250,000 disabled \nveterans, who were left out of the House plan. These wounded American \nheroes are struggling to make ends meet, and we should not leave them \nout. Give them the money, and they will spend it.\n  The Finance Committee will extend unemployment benefits for those who \nlost their jobs in this economy. You are entitled to unemployment \nbenefits for 13 weeks. When that runs out and you don't have a job, you \nare in big trouble. We have a lot of people in big trouble. The House \nbill doesn't do anything for the unemployed. Economists tell us that \nthis is the single-most effective way to stimulate the economy. Give \nthe unemployed this tax break, and they will spend it.\n  The Finance Committee bill is business-friendly--much more so than \nthe House bill. It gives small businesses a greater ability to \nimmediately write off purchases of machinery and equipment. When we \ngive these tax rebates and we give these business-friendly tax \nincentives, it will create jobs, and in many instances it will allow \npeople to have money, and these people will spend this money. It helps \nlarger businesses with ``bonus'' depreciation or an extended carryback \nperiod for their past losses to recoup cash for future investments. \nGive them the tax break, and they will spend it. This bill will help \nbig businesses, small businesses, medium-sized businesses, \nmanufacturers, home builders, and a whole panoply of businesses that \nare struggling today.\n  The Finance Committee legislation addresses the housing crisis by \nincluding $10 billion in mortgage revenue bonds to be used by States to \nrefinance subprime mortgages. This legislation was originally put into \nplace to help build new homes, but we don't need that now. We have an \ninventory of tens of millions of homes. We need help in refinancing \nhomes. The President talked about this in his State of the Union \nMessage. This is in the Senate Finance package. Everybody should \nsupport it--Democrats and Republicans.\n  The Finance Committee bill includes an extension of energy efficiency \nand renewable energy incentives, which will create jobs, expand the \nclean energy industry, save consumers money on their energy bills, and \nbegin to help stem the tide of global warming.\n  Mr. President, I am going to offer a substitute, as I explained, to \nmy Republican counterpart to the House-passed legislation. It will \nincorporate the measures reported by the Finance Committee last week on \na bipartisan basis together with the addition of LIHEAP. This will \ninclude the House-passed language on housing, plus the items we put in \nthe bill. It will increase the conforming loan limits for Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, as well as the loan limits for FHA-backed mortgages \nwhich will allow many more homeowners to refinance and will reduce \nmortgage interest rates in many parts of the country.\n\n  This amendment will allow about $1 billion to help low-income \nAmericans heat their homes through the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, which we call LIHEAP. This Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, which speaks for itself, provides some relief to \npeople from having to choose between food and medicine or heat. There \nis more we can do, but this is a step in the right direction.\n  All Americans should know that as a result of our debate, their \nrebate checks will not be delayed a single minute.\n  Under the terms of the House plan, the Internal Revenue Service will \ndetermine the size of payments based on 2007 tax returns, which are not \ndue until April 15. That gives us the opportunity to work together to \ncreate a\n\n[[Page S563]]\n\nbetter plan without any need for concern.\n  The Finance Committee's bipartisan work helps build on the bill sent \nto us by the House of Representatives and makes it much better--fair to \nseniors and disabled veterans--and, as important as that, more \neffective in stimulating the economy with the breaks it gives to \nbusinesses.\n  That is the bottom line. It will do the job. It will work. People \nsay: Why do we need to go to conference? We have to go to conference \nanyway. The House-passed bill allows the benefits to go to undocumented \npeople. I don't think Senators want to vote for that provision. A vote \nthis afternoon is simply a vote to proceed to the House bill. We have \nto go to conference anyway because of that provision; that is, rebates \nfor undocumented persons.\n  We have a chance to stimulate the economy and help more struggling \nAmericans. I hope we can all work together, Democrats and Republicans--\nin fact all Senators--to build on the good work done by the House of \nRepresentatives by supporting this bipartisan Finance Committee \nlegislation. It is good legislation.\n  This is it. People need not look further. If the package does not \npass, that is the end of the line. That will be it. It will be a shame. \nWe will have to look at something else after we dispose of this \nstimulus package to try to do something to stimulate the housing \nindustry, give unemployment benefits, to do something about LIHEAP. It \nwould be a shame that we would miss this opportunity. The Republicans \nshould join with us. The bill has to go to conference anyway. Let the \nconferees determine, working with the President, what we should do to \nstimulate the economy. We believe ours is a Cadillac package. It is \nwhat the American people need. It is what the economy needs. It is \nfair. It is just. It is quick. The House bill is, as I said, a step in \nthe right direction but a very small step.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S563-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today Congress received the fiscal year \n2009 budget request from President Bush. It is a budget that does not \nraise taxes and provides a framework for eliminating the deficit within \n5 years. Both objectives are consistent with and critical to our long-\nterm economic goals.\n  It is now up to Congress to fully and fairly consider this budget \nproposal and each appropriations bill.\n  I do not need to remind our colleagues we are also hard at work to \npass an economic growth package. While considering the budget, we must \nnot undo the economic growth policies contained in that package by \nincreasing the size of Government, when we should be increasing the \nsize of the economy.\n  Turning to one particular item in the budget that is of great \nimportance to me and my home State of Kentucky, I wish to speak briefly \nabout the budget request for the disposal of chemical weapons at the \nBlue Grass Army Depot in Richmond, KY.\n  For years, I have led the fight in Congress to safely and efficiently \ndispose of the deadly chemical weapons at the Blue Grass Army Depot, \nand for years the Department of Defense bureaucracy has dragged its \nfeet on this issue and refused to comply with Congress's direction that \ndisposal of such weapons be given serious attention and the resources \nto get it done.\n  As a result, complete disposal of these deadly weapons has been \npushed further and further into the future, even though the people of \nRichmond and Madison County, KY, have been living for too long already \nwith over 500 tons of chemical weapons in their midst. This includes VX \nnerve agents, one of the deadliest nerve agents ever created.\n  You can understand the people of Madison County and, frankly, I have \nhad enough. So I am pleased to report that after making my wishes clear \nto Defense Secretary Gates, I have convinced the Department to increase \nthe fiscal year 2009 budget request amount to a level that will help \nenable the Blue Grass Army Depot to more safely and quickly dispose of \nthese weapons.\n  I personally thank Secretary Gates for his involvement in this \nsuccess. I have worked with and been frustrated by Defense Secretaries \nunder both Republican and Democratic administrations. But Secretary \nGates gets it and he took action. I thank him for that, and I know the \npeople of Madison County do as well.\n  Before we intervened, DOD had initially set fiscal year 2009 funding \nfor the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives Program, or ACWA, at \n$351 million. ACWA is the program that will dispose of these chemical \nweapons.\n  Now the ACWA budget has been increased to nearly $398 million, thanks \nto Secretary Gates. This is the third consecutive year we have been \nable to persuade DOD to increase the ACWA budget request. By increasing \nthe funding level, we can speed up the disposal.\n  In addition to adequate funding, legislation I authored and that was \nenacted into law now sets a deadline for DOD to complete work on \ndisposal by 2017. That is right, it is now law that disposal must be \ncompleted in less than 10 years, by 2017.\n  This is a two-pronged approach to solving this problem and these two \nprongs complement each other. Together, increased funding for disposal \nand a deadline set into law are moving us closer to the disposal of \nthese heinous weapons.\n  In short, when it comes to the chemical weapons stored at Blue Grass \nArmy Depot, dollars plus a deadline equals disposal. That is the goal: \nthe quick and safe disposal of these chemical weapons. The people of \nKentucky deserve no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S563-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S563-S564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is true we have the President's budget, \nthe eighth one, the eighth and last budget from this President. To \nthink anyone has the audacity to suggest this deficit will be gone in 5 \nyears following the President's plan is almost laughable, a man who has \nrun this country from a $7 trillion surplus over 10 years to now \napproaching $12 trillion or $13 trillion in debt.\n  The Presiding Officer knows as much about the military as anyone \nserving in Congress, having been a distinguished combat veteran in the \nMarine Corps and Secretary of the Navy. No one is more supportive of \nthe military, than the Presiding Officer. I try to be also. The Defense \nbudget I get from morning reports, without having seen the budget, but \nthe press has reported the Defense budget will now be approaching $700 \nbillion this coming year. But there is not a single penny in this \nbudget for the war in Iraq. That is in addition to this request. We are \ntold that in less than 2 years, the cost of the war in Iraq will be $1 \ntrillion, borrowed money from China, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Mexico. And, \nof course, it has been long pronounced this budget of the President's \nwill have cuts in Medicare.\n  The President had us over a barrel last year on the appropriations \nbills because we did not want another continuing resolution. We did not \nwant another continuing resolution. But he does not have us over a \nbarrel this year because either Senator Clinton or Senator Obama will \nbe the President in less than a year. If we have to deal with a CR next \nyear, we will deal with it. We will finish that by the end of January. \nWe will whip through that CR in a short time. We are not going to be \nheld hostage to the unreasonableness of this President--cutting NIH, \ncutting the COPS Program. What is that? Law enforcement to bring down \ncrime rates in our country as it has--the damage to the cities that has \nalready taken place because of the priorities that are so misarranged \nin this budget that he suggests to us.\n  Education--I brought the Teacher of the Year here to watch the State \nof the Union Address. She is devastated by what the No Child Left \nBehind legislation has done, with the President not living up to what \nhe said he would do in funding it.\n  I am glad the budget is here. It is part of the law. I look forward \nto working with our colleagues and hope we\n\n[[Page S564]]\n\ncan do a better job with our appropriations bills than last year. But I \nrepeat, we are not going to be held hostage by the unreasonableness of \nthe White House. I hope we can work together and get some bills passed. \nThe appropriators want to do that. We have now, with the ethics and \nlobbying bill passed, transparency in everything we do.\n  I also express my appreciation to Senator Whitehouse for being here \nto start work on the FISA bill.\n  I have said this before and I say it now to my friend who is the \nmanager for the FISA bill for the Republicans, how much we appreciate \nhis devotion to the intelligence matters of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S564-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 2248, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2248) to amend the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978, to modernize and streamline the \n     provisions of that Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Rockefeller/Bond amendment No. 3911, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for agreeing on a way \nforward on this bill. This is a very important bill, the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, the FISA Act, of 2008. It gives the \nintelligence community the tools it needs right now and over the next 6 \nyears to protect the country.\n  The Protect America Act we passed in Congress and the President \nsigned last August allowed the intelligence community to close critical \nintelligence gaps, but that legislation expires in less than 2 weeks. \nWe cannot let those gaps reopen. We passed a short-term extension, and \nthat extension will expire when we are preparing to go out on the \nPresident's Day recess. We cannot leave our country blind and deaf to \nthreats that terrorists might bring.\n  We were delayed in December by filibuster, which is the right of all \nSenators to have extended discussions. And there are those who say we \nneed more time to look at this measure because it is very important and \nit is very technical and it is controversial. But the Intelligence \nCommittee spent over 9 months looking at FISA modernization. We held \nhearings, we reviewed the Terrorist Surveillance Program, we looked at \nthe implementation of the Protect America Act, and after that, we came \nup with a solid bipartisan bill. That is something in which Chairman \nRockefeller and I take a great deal of pride because we accommodated \nmany changes and improvements and we did improve on the existing FISA \nstructure, as well as adding items the Protect America Act needed to \nhave but did not have.\n  The intelligence community is waiting for us to act. We have a bill \nthat is responsible and effective. It addresses the concerns about the \nProtect America Act, but most of all, it gives the intelligence \noperators the tools they need and ensures that our private partners \nwill continue to assist the Government.\n  As I said, this bill came out of the Intelligence Committee on a 13-\nto-2 vote after months of studying the collection programs. Chairman \nRockefeller, whom I thank again, and I worked together to get an \nagreement that protects America's constitutional rights and the privacy \nrights of American citizens.\n  There was a lot of work with the intelligence community \nrepresentatives and lawyers from the Department of Justice. The \nIntelligence Committee members and their staffs did an outstanding job \ncoming up with a solution.\n  Two provisions added during the initial markup without input from the \nintelligence community needed to be changed. They are great objectives, \nbut they had to be made workable. It was our pleasure to work with \nChairman Rockefeller, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Wyden to come up \nwith a solution to both these problems, and they are now in the \nsubstitute now pending.\n  The Director of National Intelligence, who is responsible for running \nour collection programs, said with these two problems fixed, he will \nsupport the bill. This is very important to the chairman and to me \nbecause we want to pass a bill that works and will become law. It would \ndo no good to pass a bill that has people's good ideas in it or pass a \nbill that is good for politics but doesn't work for those who are \ncharged with protecting us from the threats our country faces. So the \nsupport of this bill by the Director of National Intelligence in \nparticular is critical. With these fixes, we will have a bill the \nPresident will sign.\n\n  The chairman and I have worked shoulder to shoulder on a bipartisan \nbasis to pass this bill. We will have to take a very careful look at \nany amendments that are proposed because we don't want to jeopardize \nthe ability of the intelligence community and their private partners to \ngo forward. It is very technical. Each word matters. And we will do our \nbest to point out whether amendments will work. There are several \namendments pending that we think will improve the bill but will not \nbring a veto.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank all the Members who have worked \nwith us in close collaboration to get time agreements, to get a list of \nacceptable amendments, and I am looking forward to moving ahead with \nthis bill just as soon as we can. I thank my colleague from West \nVirginia and the other colleagues for working together on the \nIntelligence Committee bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, first let me express my appreciation \nto the distinguished vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nfor his very energetic dedication to moving this bill forward. We have \nnot agreed on everything, but nobody can challenge his dedication to \nmoving a bill and to making progress on this issue.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3920 to Amendment No. 3911\n\n  Mr. President, per the pending agreement, I call up amendment No. \n3920, the Whitehouse amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Whitehouse], for \n     himself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3920.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To provide procedures for compliance reviews)\n\n       On page 19, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       ``(7) Compliance reviews.--During the period that \n     minimization procedures approved under paragraph (5)(A) are \n     in effect, the Court may review and assess compliance with \n     such procedures and shall have access to the assessments and \n     reviews required by subsections (k)(1), (k)(2), and (k)(3) \n     with respect to compliance with such procedures. In \n     conducting a review under this paragraph, the Court may, to \n     the extent necessary, require the Government to provide \n     additional information regarding the acquisition, retention, \n     or dissemination of information concerning United States \n     persons during the course of an acquisition authorized under \n     subsection (a). The Court may fashion remedies it determines \n     necessary to enforce compliance.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, in this debate about revising FISA and \ncleaning up the damage done by the President's warrantless wiretapping \nprogram, the administration has talked at length about the importance \nof our foreign intelligence activities. It expends all its rhetorical \nenergy on a topic where we all agree, but it has largely ignored the \nissue that has been central to our debate: On what terms will this \nadministration spy on Americans?\n  I rise today in support of an amendment offered by myself; by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Chairman \nRockefeller; the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy; Senator Schumer of New\n\n[[Page S565]]\n\nYork; and Senator Feingold of Wisconsin, that addresses this issue: the \nprivacy of Americans from Government surveillance.\n  Our amendment reflects the convergence of ideas Senator Schumer has \nbeen working on in the Judiciary Committee and I was working on in the \nIntelligence Committee and, similarly, Senator Feingold has played a \ncritical role in advancing this issue in both committees. Both \nchairmen, Senator Leahy and Senator Rockefeller, have reviewed it and \ngiven it their blessing. It is carefully crafted to incorporate \nstatutory language offered by the Department of Justice as technical \nassistance.\n  On this amendment, we have done our homework. What is this amendment \nabout? As a former U.S. attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, I \noversaw wiretaps and other surveillance procedures, and I learned that \nwith any electronic surveillance, whether it is a domestic law \nenforcement investigation or intelligence gathering on international \nterrorism, information about Americans is intercepted incidentally--in \nother words, when they are not being targeted by our intelligence or \nlaw enforcement agencies but overheard because they are talking to or \ntalking with or even being discussed by someone who is under \nsurveillance. So minimization is the term of art. Minimization is the \nprocess for protecting the privacy of Americans who are caught up in \nsurveillance without being the target of the surveillance.\n  The issue here is privacy rights of Americans, and in domestic law \nenforcement there are clear, established procedures for minimizing the \ncollection or retention of this information to ensure that the privacy \nof innocent Americans is protected. In this pursuit, the prospect of \njudicial review--the prospect of judicial review--is an important part \nof our protection.\n  Under the Senate Intelligence bill before us, the court has the \nauthority to approve minimization procedures. It has the authority to \napprove the procedures, but it is then told that it can't look fully \ninto whether the procedures are being followed. Thus, there is no \nguarantee the procedures are actually being adhered to by the executive \nbranch on the part of the overseeing court.\n  I have introduced this amendment to give the FISA Court the same \ndiscretionary authority to follow up on the implementation of all these \nminimization procedures that it has in every other context and that is \ncommon to all courts throughout the American system of justice. \nChairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond have already agreed and put \ninto the bill we will vote on that this authority already lies with the \ncourt where the target is an American, and I wish to thank Vice \nChairman Bond in particular for working with me in bipartisan fashion \non that point.\n  If the target of surveillance is an American inside the United States \nor if the target of the surveillance is an American overseas, then the \ncourt has the authority to review compliance through the minimization \nprocedures. But as will often be the case, the target will be a person \noutside the United States, a person who is not in America, and then an \nAmerican could just as easily be incidentally intercepted in these \nconversations, and they should still have rights, and they should still \nhave protections.\n  Because minimization serves to protect the incidentally intercepted \nperson, this protection should apply when the incidentally intercepted \nperson is an American, and the court's authority to make sure the rules \nare being followed should apply there as well. It makes no sense to \nstrip a court of its natural authority based on the identity of the \ntarget when the protection runs to the American who is not the target \nbut who has been incidentally intercepted.\n  It, frankly, makes no sense as a general proposition to limit the \ncourt's authority to see whether rules it has approved are being \nfollowed. I found no place else in the law, no place at all where the \nauthority of a court to approve an order, a rule, or a procedure is not \naccompanied by the concomitant authority to see if there is compliance. \nIt is basic. Indeed, it may very well be, if there is litigation on \nthis matter, a court will find that it is so basic to judicial \nauthority that they will imply it. But we should put it in the bill and \nget it right; otherwise, we are creating in this bill a bizarre and \nunique quirk in American law, and there is no sensible justification \noffered for it.\n  To be clear, this amendment creates no mandates, no cumbersome \nprocedures. Indeed, it may never be used at all. In my experience, as I \nsaid, the mere prospect--the mere prospect--of a judicial inquiry into \ncompliance has a salutary effect--a healthy attention-getting, \nawakening, compliance-enhancing effect--on those who are charged with \ncomplying with the law. The opposite, I am afraid, is true as well. \nWhen executive officials are assured, as this law would do without this \namendment, that the court that approves the minimization procedures is \nforbidden to police the compliance of those procedures, one can \nreasonably expect looser compliance in this enforcement holiday.\n  I know the Bush administration fears and despises judicial oversight, \nprobably with very good reason, but that is no reason that we as a \nSenate should follow them down this wayward path. Both here, where the \nFISA bill creates an unheard of limitation on judicial power to examine \ncompliance with its own approved rules, and in the immunity debate, \nwhere we are being led as a legislature into ongoing legislation to \nchoose winners and losers, we embark into dangerous territory, outside \nthe well-established traditions of the separated powers of our American \nsystem of government.\n  Particularly to my colleagues who are members of the Federalist \nSociety, an organization with a declared interest in separation of \npowers, I hope you will take this occasion to defend those principles.\n  To quote the distinguished Justice Scalia from a Supreme Court \nopinion regarding a sense of sharp necessity about this separation of \nthe legislative from the judicial power at the founding of our \nGovernment:\n\n       This sense of a sharp necessity . . . triumphed among the \n     Framers of the new Federal Constitution.\n\n  And it did so, again quoting the decision:\n\n     . . . prompted by the crescendo of legislative interference \n     with private judgments of the courts.\n\n  Going back to a previous decision, United States versus Klein, the \nU.S. Supreme Court, in a holding that Congress may not establish the \nrule of decision in a particular case, said of the legislative and \njudicial powers:\n\n       It is of vital importance that the legislative and judicial \n     powers be kept distinct. It is the intention of the \n     Constitution that each of the great co-ordinate departments \n     of the government--the legislative, executive and the \n     judicial--shall be, in its sphere, independent of the others.\n\n  I submit that a court cannot be independent if it is stripped of the \nduty to determine whether rules and procedures it has the authority to \napprove are even being complied with.\n  I urge other Members to support this amendment. I am very gratified \nto see Senator Schumer from New York on the floor. I know he has worked \nhard on this issue in the Judiciary Committee. I am very grateful that \nsomebody of his experience and distinction would cosponsor this \namendment.\n  I yield to Senator Schumer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield to Senator Schumer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask for 10 minutes from my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island, who has the time.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. No objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. May I modify that request to make it 12 minutes?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Does that leave 3 or 4 minutes, 5 minutes for the \nchairman?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will move it back to 10. I didn't realize we were that \nshort on time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island has \n20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The 12 minutes will work, leaving time for the \nchairman and some to spare.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. On amendment 2937, I wish to thank Senator Whitehouse\n\n[[Page S566]]\n\nfor his leadership on this issue; Senator Feingold and our two great \nchairs, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Leahy. I will briefly describe \nthis amendment.\n  When we debate these issues, our friends on the intelligence side say \nyou cannot stop us with cumbersome procedures that will not allow us to \nlisten in on a phone conversation a terrorist might be engaging in, you \nhave to act quickly. That is a legitimate wish. You certainly do not \nwant to let a phone conversation slip away while you are going through \ndays and days and days in court.\n  But this amendment has nothing to do with that. We do not interfere \nwith any phone conversation that might legitimately be listened in to, \nthat might be tapped ahead of time.\n  What we are saying is this: There ought to be oversight to make sure \nour intelligence agencies obey the rules; that when there is a \nconversation or a person, an American citizen on the line who should \nnot be listened in to because the conversation is not about the \nintended subject, that they quickly stop listening.\n  Now, under present law, there is no oversight, none. So if someone \nwould want to take liberties, in one of the intelligence agencies or \nother agencies, and listen in to Americans having conversations, \ncitizens, who have no right to be listened in to because they did not \ninvolve legitimate security concerns, they could continue to do it and \nno one would ever know.\n  That is wrong. The minimization requirements we have placed in this \namendment, which was originally in the Judiciary Committee amendments, \nbut, unfortunately, or in large part in the Judiciary Committee \namendments--unfortunately that amendment which I supported was \ndefeated--will ensure there is oversight and that we get all the \nintelligence information we need, without abuse or overstepping of \nbounds.\n  That is the perfect balance. It is hard to see how anyone could \nobject to oversight after the fact to make sure people are not abusing \nthe privilege of listening in to phone conversations or other \nconversations, electronic conversations, American citizens are having.\n  That is why this amendment I hope will be supported unanimously in \nthis Chamber. Whether you are a conservative or a liberal, Democrat or \nRepublican, someone who leans to the side of making sure we get every \nbit of information or someone who leans on the side of making sure \nAmerican liberties are protected, both worthy goals, you can support \nthis amendment.\n  I wish to once again thank my colleagues for their hard work on an \nimportant issue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to offer my strong \nsupport for the amendment offered by Senator Whitehouse to ensure there \nis explicit written legal authority in this bill for the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court to review and to assess compliance with \nthe minimization procedures established for the bill's new acquisition \nauthority.\n  One of the most serious deficiencies in the Protect America Act was \nthe fact that the FISA Court was not given a role at all in approving \nthe minimization procedures put in place by the Attorney General and \nthe Director of National Intelligence for collection activity. That was \nfine. But it was insufficient.\n  Minimization procedures are the procedures that govern the treatment \nof nonpublic information concerning Americans in the acquisition and \nretention and dissemination of foreign intelligence.\n  The Intelligence Committee's bill addressed this deficiency in the \nProtect America Act by requiring the court to review and approve \nminimization procedures. The committee, however, learned, and then was \nhappy to take from in our discussions, the Judiciary Committee's better \napproach to this. We did not, in the Intelligence Committee bill, \nexplicitly authorize the court to assess compliance with these \nminimization procedures.\n  As the Senators from Rhode Island and New York have pointed out, \nthere is no point in having something on the books if you cannot be \nsure it is going to be complied with.\n  So compliance is a sacred principle. Senator Whitehouse's amendment \nwill ensure that the court can assess the executive branch's compliance \nwith these minimization procedures, be provided with information it \nneeds to make the assessment, and have the authority to enforce this \nassessment.\n  The administration objected to the provision reported from the \nJudiciary Committee allowing the FISA Court to review compliance with \nminimization procedures as being what it called ``a massive expansion'' \nof the court's role.\n\n  The administration also argued there are enough other oversight \nmechanisms already in the bill, through requirements on the Attorney \nGeneral, the Director of National Intelligence, the Inspectors General \nof the intelligence agencies.\n  I respectfully disagree with that assessment. Assessing compliance is \ninherent in the court's role. It is inherent in the FISA Court's role \nin reviewing and approving minimization procedures in the first place. \nIn fact, without it, without the compliance part of it, the first parts \nare nice but not sufficient.\n  Having the court assess compliance with minimization procedures is an \nimportant safeguard to ensure there is due care in the handling of, as \nI say, nonpublic information concerning U.S. persons.\n  I therefore urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. I ask that the \nbalance of the time on this side be reserved for Senators Hatch and \nSessions and others who want to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the vice chairman yield for a question?\n  Inquiring through the Chair, I am wondering when the vice chairman \nbelieves Senators Hatch and Sessions might be here?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, all I know is we were all expected to be \nback at 5:30. I do not have their flight schedules. We are contacting \ntheir offices, but I do not know when they will be back.\n  Let me move on now to address some of the things that have been said. \nNo. 1, there was a comment about the damage done by the Protect America \nAct. Nobody has shown any damage done by the Protect America Act. What \nit has done is given our intelligence community the ability to \nintercept foreign terrorist electronic communications. It has kept the \nworld and our allies and our own people safer.\n  If anybody wants to look at that, there are, in our enclosed \nintelligence rooms, the full description of what has been gained.\n  The amendment before us, allowing the FISA Court to assess \ncompliance, may sound like a good idea. But when we talk about foreign \ntargeting, we are outside the FISA Court's experience and their \nexpertise.\n  The FISA Court was created in 1978 to issue orders for domestic \nsurveillance on particular targets. But Congress specifically left \nforeign surveillance activities to the executive branch and to the \nintelligence community. This is the first time we have heard that a \ncourt, set up to oversee domestic applications for electronic \nsurveillance, should be involved in the foreign targeting efforts \ndealing with foreign information.\n  FISA minimization procedures are about protecting the identities of \nU.S. persons. This comes up all the time in domestic surveillance. But \nalmost all the collection under these foreign targeting acquisitions \nwill be on non-U.S. persons who require no protection under FISA \nminimization procedures.\n  I will explain later if I have time, after others have spoken, what \nthe FISA Court itself has said about it. Therefore, it does not make \nsense to try to get the FISA Court involved in assessing compliance in \nthe foreign targeting arena.\n  Now, it has been said that a judge, one of the district court judges \nwho is brought in to rule on applications, probable cause applications \nfor domestic surveillance, should go out and review what goes on at the \nfacilities where collections are being made. Now in France, they have a \nwonderful procedure that goes far beyond anything\n\n[[Page S567]]\n\nwe have and would drive many of our civil libertarians nuts.\n  The investigating magistrate investigates, he prosecutes and he rules \non cases. That is a wonderful way of overseeing the whole line of \naction. As an investigator and prosecutor, he makes a judgment.\n\n  We do not have that situation. We do not have that same system. We \nhave courts that rule on controversies. We have given them the power to \nreview the minimization procedures, the written procedures but not to \ngo out and spend the day trying to figure out what is going on where \nthe collections are being held.\n  What we do have is a very robust system of oversight, contrary to \nwhat my colleague from New York said. I will have to agree with him: I \nagree with all the things he said about the New York Giants. I rooted \nfor them. I thought they were great. I will have to confer with my \ncolleagues from New Hampshire and Maine to see whether they would \naccept on our side the terrible things he said about the New England \nPatriots. But I was a born-again Giants fan yesterday.\n  But when he said there is no oversight, he overlooks the supervisors, \nthe inspector general who is overseeing minimization, the Department of \nJustice lawyers who are on top of them, and, more importantly, the \nIntelligence Committee itself. That is our job. Our job is to oversee \nit, and we intend to continue to oversee it to make sure that system \nworks. Our staff can go out there. Our members can go out there.\n  I suggest, given the background the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland has in seeking warrants, and overseas warrants, probably nobody \nin this body will be better able to oversee compliance than the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island, who served as a prosecutor and \nas attorney general. I assure you not one of the FISA Court judges \nwould have nearly as good a background or as fruitful a time as my \ncolleague from Rhode Island would have.\n  I believe, therefore, leaving the existing oversight policies in \nplace, with a robust oversight by the Intelligence Committee itself--\nthose of us who have been entrusted to assure the intelligence \ncollection goes forward in an appropriate manner--should be allowed to \ndo so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime under the proposal I made previously.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \nremaining time on this amendment be reserved until a later time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise as the proud cosponsor of \namendment No. 3920, offered by my friend Senator Whitehouse. I \nsupported the Judiciary substitute amendment, and I am disappointed \nthat it was tabled. It contained a number of important safeguards and \nprotections.\n  However, the Senate still has the opportunity to ensure independent \noversight of our intelligence activities. The amendment before us is a \nkey step in that effort. This amendment makes sure that the FISA Court \ncan review the privacy of American communications, and take action to \nprotect that privacy, any time American communications are gathered \nduring the course of foreign intelligence surveillance.\n  Senator Feingold and I had an early concern that any FISA update \nneeds court oversight with real teeth, and we pushed for these \nprotections to be included in the Judiciary substitute amendment. \nSenator Whitehouse had the same concern, and so the amendment before us \ntoday is the excellent product of many heads working together.\n  I have always said that when it comes to intelligence policy, we must \nhave three things. First, we need a free and open debate about any \nmeasure that affects our security. We are having that debate now. \nSecond, we need clear rules so that our intelligence community knows \nwhat is expected and can act within the clear boundaries set out by \nCongress. I will only support a final bill that contains such rules. \nThird and finally, we must have an independent arbiter to ensure that \nthose rules are being followed. A rule without oversight is likely to \nbe a hollow rule.\n  The amendment before us is necessary to put teeth into the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court's independent oversight function. This \namendment is a simple, commonsense measure, and yet it is also one of \nthe most substantial protections we can provide for Americans. Let me \nexplain why this is so.\n  As we all know, the bill before us would grant the President broad \nauthority to wiretap communications between two foreign people or \nbetween a foreign person and a U.S. person as long as the target of the \nsurveillance is located outside the United States. With these new \npowers, the intelligence community can collect the communications of \nlaw-abiding Americans, without a warrant, if that American happens to \nbe in contact with someone who is up to no good.\n  But law-abiding Americans expect their private communications to stay \nprivate, and rightly so. How can we gather and use the intelligence we \nneed but also protect the privacy of innocent Americans? The \nadministration says that Americans are protected because the \nintelligence community follows a set of rules called minimization \nprocedures. These rules limit the collection, use, and dissemination of \ncommunications to make sure that Americans' privacy is protected. The \nadministration itself sets out these procedures, so they should present \nno hindrance to our intelligence collection. What the administration \ndoes not say is that currently, there is absolutely no independent \noversight of whether the administration is following its own rules. The \nbill before us would allow the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nto review the minimization rules on paper, to see whether they pass \nmuster, but no power to review them in practice.\n  The amendment now before the Senate offers a vast improvement. With \nthis amendment, the court will have the authority to examine the \nadministration's performance and to assess whether the intelligence \ncommunity is practicing what it preaches. If the court finds problems, \nit can issue orders to ensure that the administration follows the \nrules.\n  I am not suggesting that the court should be setting limits before \nthe fact. I think our intelligence community needs the flexibility to \nprotect our country. But I think it is essential for the court to be \nable to look back and tell us, with an independent voice, whether the \nadministration was following its own rules to protect the privacy of \nlaw-abiding Americans.\n  This amendment does not restrict our intelligence gathering. It \nassures meaningful protection for individual Americans, and it helps to \npromote faith in our Government and our intelligence community. I \ncannot imagine why any of my colleagues would oppose this amendment. We \nall know that the fox alone should not be guarding the henhouse. It is \njust common sense to provide independent, retrospective oversight. I \nhope and expect that all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, \nwill join me to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the bill we are now considering gives the \nexecutive branch unprecedented authority to conduct warrantless \nsurveillance. It would permit the government, while targeting overseas, \nto review more Americans' communications with less court supervision \nthan ever before. I support surveillance of those who might do us harm, \nbut we also have to protect Americans' civil liberties. One of the most \nimportant ways to provide that balance is to ensure a meaningful role \nfor the courts in supervising this new authority.\n  Unfortunately, the Protect America Act severely diminished the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court's role as a check and balance \non the executive branch. Under the Protect America Act, the FISA Court \ncannot conduct oversight over whether the executive branch is complying \nwith the ``minimization'' rules that are a crucial protection for \nAmericans whose communications are incidentally picked up by government \nsurveillance of overseas targets. Judicial oversight of how these \nsafeguards are working is\n\n[[Page S568]]\n\na critical protection of the privacy of U.S. persons in this area.\n  I want to praise Senator Whitehouse, who as member of both the \nJudiciary Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence did so \nmuch work to reverse the courts diminished role and to craft this \nfundamental provision. His amendment, which was part of our Judiciary \nbill, would ensure that the FISA Court has the authority it needs to \nassess the Government's compliance with minimization procedures, to \nrequest the additional information it needs to make that determination, \nand to enforce compliance with its orders. It would make certain that \nthe FISA Court has a meaningful role in overseeing this new \nsurveillance authority.\n  Minimization procedures are a key protection--indeed virtually the \nonly protection--for the privacy of the conversations of people in the \nUnited States that are ``incidentally'' collected as part of this broad \nnew surveillance authority. These could well be completely innocent \nAmericans who happen to be talking to someone overseas. FISA Court \noversight of minimization procedures is critical. Without this \namendment, the FISA legislation would allow the court to review \nminimization procedures, but it would not give authority to assess \nwhether the government is complying with those procedures, nor would it \npermit the court to take any action to correct failure to comply with \nthose procedures. This is a crucial amendment and I urge Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle to support it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, is it necessary for me to ask that the \npending amendment be set aside?\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3979 to Amendment No. 3911\n\n (Purpose: To provide safeguards for communications involving persons \n                       inside the United States)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3979.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Webb, Mr. Tester, Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Menendez, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Obama, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3979 to amendment No. 3911.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Protect America Act we passed last \nyear was sold repeatedly as a way to allow the Government to collect \nforeign-to-foreign communications without needing the approval of the \nFISA Court. Last week, the Vice President defended the Protect America \nAct by talking about the need to wiretap without a court order ``one \nforeign citizen abroad making a telephone call to another foreign \ncitizen abroad about terrorism.''\n  Now, this is something all of us support, every one of us. But what \nthe Vice President did not mention--and what rarely gets discussed--is \nthe Protect America Act actually went much further. It authorized new \nsweeping intrusions into the privacy of countless Americans. The bill \nthe Senate is considering to replace the PAA does not do nearly enough \nto safeguard against Government abuse. So this amendment--the Feingold-\nWebb-Tester amendment--would provide those safeguards, while also \nensuring that the Government obtains the information it needs to fight \nthe terrorists who threaten us.\n  I am, of course, extremely pleased to have the support and \ncosponsorship of Senators Webb and Tester, as well as Senators Biden, \nSanders, Kennedy, Menendez, Akaka, Dodd, and Obama. We have worked \nclosely together to develop a workable solution to a difficult \nproblem--a solution I hope the Senate can support.\n  Now, this is not about whether we will be effective in combating \nterrorism. This amendment in no way hampers our fight against al-Qaida \nand its affiliates. This is about whether Americans at home deserve \nmore privacy protections than foreigners overseas. This is about \nwhether anyone outside the executive branch will have a role in \noverseeing what the Government is doing with all the communications of \nAmericans it collects inside the United States.\n  We all know the stakes are very high. I want my colleagues to \nunderstand the impact the Intelligence Committee bill being considered \non the Senate floor could have on the privacy of Americans, because \nthat is exactly what our amendment addresses. This bill does not just \nauthorize the unfettered surveillance of people outside the United \nStates communicating with each other; it also permits the Government to \nacquire those foreigners' communications with Americans inside the \nUnited States, regardless of whether anyone involved in the \ncommunication is under suspicion of any kind of wrongdoing at all.\n  There is no requirement the foreign targets of this surveillance be \nterrorists, spies, other types of criminals or even agents of a foreign \npower. The only requirements are that the foreigners are outside the \ncountry and that the purpose of the surveillance is to obtain ``foreign \nintelligence information,'' a term that has an extremely broad \ndefinition covering anything involving the foreign affairs of the \nUnited States.\n  The key, of course, is that no court reviews these targets \nindividually. Only the executive branch decides who fits these \ncriteria. So the result is many law-abiding Americans who communicate \nwith completely innocent people overseas will be swept up in this new \nform of surveillance, with virtually no judicial involvement and \nvirtually no judicial oversight. That is astounding, isn't it? Yet \nthere has been very little discussion of it.\n  The administration has told us over and over this law is needed to \ncapture foreign-to-foreign, terrorism-related communications. In the \nState of the Union last week, President Bush defended this law by \nsaying:\n\n       To protect America, we need to know who the terrorists are \n     talking to, what they are saying, and what they are planning.\n\n  Even the administration's illegal warrantless wiretapping program, as \ndescribed when it was publicly confirmed in 2005, at least focused on \nparticular al-Qaida terrorists. But what we are talking about now is \ndifferent. This is the authority to conduct a huge dragnet that will \nsweep up innocent Americans at home, combined with an utter lack of \noversight mechanisms to prevent abuse.\n  These incredibly broad authorities are particularly troubling because \nwe live in a world in which international communications are \nincreasingly commonplace. Thirty years ago, it was very expensive and \nnot very common for most Americans to make an overseas call. Now, \nthough, particularly with e-mail, such communications are commonplace. \nMillions of ordinary and innocent Americans communicate with people \noverseas for entirely legitimate personal and business reasons. \nTechnological advancements, combined with the ever more connected world \neconomy, have led to an explosion of international contacts. Americans \ncall family members overseas; students e-mail friends they met while \nthey were studying abroad; businesspeople communicate with colleagues \nor clients overseas.\n  In fact, recently released declassified responses to congressional \noversight questions highlight how broad these authorities are. The \nexecutive branch was asked whether it could acquire all the calls and \ne-mails between employees of a U.S. company and a foreign company the \nU.S. Government is targeting, with no requirement to get a warrant and \nno requirement that there be some link to terrorism or a specific \nthreat against the United States. The administration did not deny this \nwould be entirely legal under the PAA.\n  So any American who works at a company that does business overseas \nshould think about that.\n  Americans should also think about the testimony of the DNI himself, \nin which he said the PAA would authorize the collection of all \ncommunications between the United States and overseas. In other words, \nthe Government\n\n[[Page S569]]\n\nhas the authority to collect all international calls and e-mails into \nand out of the United States--every last one.\n  We often hear from those who want to give the Government new powers \nthat we just have to bring FISA up to date with new technology. But \nchanges in technology should also cause us to look closely at the need \nfor greater protection of the privacy of our citizens.\n\n  If we are going to give the Government broad new powers that will \nlead to the collection of much more information on innocent Americans, \nwe in the Senate have a duty to provide the necessary safeguards \nagainst abuse. That, of course, is what the Feingold-Webb-Tester \namendment would do. It allows the Government to acquire all the \ncommunications of foreign targets communicating with other foreigners \noverseas. It also allows the Government to acquire all the \ncommunications of overseas terrorists, but it sets up additional \nsafeguards--additional checks and balances--for communications of \nforeign targets the Government ultimately determines involves someone \nin the United States.\n  The amendment has several components. But let me reiterate that the \namendment would permit the Government to freely acquire and share all \nforeign-to-foreign communications without any court oversight. This is, \nin fact, an enormous change from the pre-PAA law, and this amendment \nleaves those new authorities intact.\n  Let me quickly describe how the amendment would work. First, when the \nGovernment knows in advance that a foreign target is communicating with \nsomeone in the United States, it permits the Government to acquire, \nwithout a court order, those communications involving terrorism or \nsuspected terrorists or if someone's safety is at stake. It permits the \nGovernment to acquire any other communications into the United States \nwith a court order. The FISA Court would review and approve procedures \nfor making these determinations. As I said, the Government could \ncontinue to acquire and use any communications its foreign targets have \nwith other foreigners overseas. That surveillance would continue, \nagain, without any court oversight. Our amendment permits that.\n  The second part of this proposal recognizes it is frequently not \npossible for the Government, in advance, to determine whether a \nparticular communication is a purely foreign communication or involves \none end in the United States. Thus, the amendment specifies that when \nthe Government does not know in advance with whom a foreign target is \ncommunicating, it can acquire all the target's communications without \nan individualized court order--all of them.\n  But at some point--and this is one of the keys to our amendment--the \nGovernment may realize it has acquired a communication with one end in \nthe United States based on procedures that are developed by the \nexecutive branch and reviewed and approved by the FISA Court. Under our \namendment, it must then tag or segregate the U.S.-end communication in \na separate database.\n  Now, we know this tagging process is feasible because the Government \nrecently declassified the fact that it does something similar with \ninformation obtained under the PAA. The Government can then access, \nanalyze, and disseminate any of these tagged U.S. communications if \nthey involve terrorism or a suspected terrorist or if someone's safety \nis at stake. All they have to do is this: They have to simply notify \nthe FISA Court after the fact and provide a brief certification that \none of these circumstances apply. There is no requirement that these \ncommunications be destroyed, in case they include information that may \nlater prove to be useful. The other tagged communications can also be \naccessed, analyzed, and disseminated if the Government obtains a court \norder.\n  The amendment also ensures there is independent oversight of this \nprocess. If the FISA Court has any concerns that the terrorism or \nemergency certifications are being abused, it has authority to ask for \nadditional information, and to limit future access to certain \ncommunications if it ultimately determines the Government's \ncertifications to the court are clearly erroneous.\n  Now, I do understand this amendment imposes a new framework that may \ntake some time to implement. That is why the amendment would not \nrequire the Government to implement this new system for up to a year \nafter enactment. I think that is plenty of time to work out any \nproblems and get these procedures up and running.\n\n  The amendment also contains a critical oversight provision. It \ndirects the inspectors general of the Department of Justice and the \nDepartment of Defense to audit the implementation of compliance with \nthis amendment. These IGs as well as the FISA Court will have access to \nthe American communications that the Government has acquired to make \nsure the authorities are not being abused.\n  Taken together, these provisions ensure that we know when Americans' \ncommunications are being collected so there is some baseline \ninformation available to the FISA Court, Congress, inspectors general, \nand other independent monitors for tracking impact of the legislation \non Americans' privacy.\n  Tracking this type of information is also good for national security. \nWe have heard the President tell us repeatedly in defense of his so-\ncalled terrorist surveillance program that if there are people inside \nour country who are talking with al-Qaida, we want to know about that. \nThis amendment takes him at his word, and it requires him to set up \nprocedures for identifying those communications in the United States \nwhere it is reasonably practical.\n  We have been hearing for years now that the U.S. Government needs \nauthority to wiretap foreign terrorists outside the United States \nwithout individual court orders. This amendment permits that. To take \none example, if the U.S. Government has targeted a member of al-Qaida \noverseas, under this amendment it can acquire all of that target's \ncommunications--all of them. If it determines the particular \ncommunication is with someone in the United States, the Government \nwould tag it and it could access and disseminate it as long as the FISA \nCourt is simply notified after the fact with a brief certification. \nThat kind of focused, terrorism-related surveillance--the type of \nsurveillance we most want our Government to be engaging in--would \ncontinue absolutely unabated. On the other hand, the amendment provides \nsafeguards in case the Government is, in fact, conducting massive \ndragnet surveillance of communications with people in the United \nStates. In that situation, yes, this amendment would then impose the \noversight that is desperately needed. It will make sure that in \nsituations not involving terrorism or personal safety, the FISA Court \nwill play its important role in overseeing the Government's use of \ncommunications involving Americans. In other words, it will make sure \nthese authorities are not abused.\n  We have heard a lot today about minimization procedures, which are \nsupposed to protect against unnecessary disclosure of information about \nAmericans' communications the Government collects, and the importance \nof giving the FISA Court power to enforce compliance with them. I \nstrongly support that effort. I tried to initiate this issue in the \nIntelligence Committee. It has been very effectively taken up in the \nJudiciary Committee by the Senator from Rhode Island as well as the \nSenator from New York, and it is extremely important that we prevail in \nthat amendment to get those protections. But the supporters of the \nIntelligence Committee bill claim that minimization procedures are \nenough to protect Americans' privacy. In fact, the minimization \nrequirements in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are quite \nweak. They permit the widespread disseminations throughout the U.S. \nGovernment of information about U.S. persons if it is deemed foreign \nintelligence information which, again, is very broadly defined, and \nthey permit dissemination of the identities of these U.S. persons if \n``necessary to understand foreign intelligence information or assess \nits importance''--also a very loose standard.\n  Now, we know from our experience in the nomination hearing of John \nBolton to be United Nations Ambassador how easy it is for Government \nofficials to obtain access to those identities. And when the FBI \nreceives reports referring to a U.S. person, according to recently \ndeclassified Government documents, it\n\n[[Page S570]]\n\nwill ``likely request that person's identity'' and will ``likely be'' \nthe requirements for obtaining it. There are other minimization \nrequirements and Government regulations, the details of which are \nclassified. We know in any event that those can be changed at any time. \nMinimization is simply inadequate in the context of these broad new \nauthorities. More is needed.\n  The amendment I have developed with Senator Webb, Senator Tester, and \nothers is an extremely balanced and reasonable approach to addressing \none of the most serious problems with this legislation. It gives the \nGovernment full access to foreign-to-foreign communications without any \ncourt oversight. And it provides access to communications between a \nforeigner and an American, if there is a terrorism link or if someone's \nsafety is at stake, without the requirement of a court order. In other \nwords, this amendment gives the administration what it asked for when \nit demanded these massive new powers. So when the Vice President says \nwe need to pass legislation that permits warrantless wiretapping of \n``one foreign citizen abroad making a telephone call to another foreign \ncitizen abroad about terrorism,'' this amendment totally permits that. \nWhen the minority leader says the Government needs to be able to \n``freely monitor new terrorist targets overseas,'' this amendment \ntotally permits that as well.\n  But this amendment also provides safeguards to make sure that \nAmericans' basic rights are being protected. Too many communications of \ninnocent Americans are going to end up in Government databases under \nthe PAA and under the Intelligence bill for us to ignore this very \nserious problem.\n  Any Senator who believes that Americans here at home deserve more \nprivacy protections than foreigners overseas should support this \namendment, and any Senator who believes the executive branch should not \nbe granted far-reaching surveillance authorities involving Americans \nwithout independent oversight should support this amendment as well.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Montana, \nSenator Tester, be recognized to speak on this amendment, and after he \nhas concluded his remarks, that the Senator from Virginia be \nrecognized. Both of these presentations would be allocated from the \ntime I control on this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me say how grateful I am to the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Webb, and the next speaker, Senator Tester, \nnew Members of the Senate who have delved into this very difficult \nsubject and who have tried to achieve the right balance. I don't know \nof any Senators who are more concerned about protecting the lives of \nAmericans from terrorists, but they also want to make sure that we get \nthis right while protecting the privacy of Americans. So I thank both \nof them.\n  I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his \nfine work on this amendment. My comments today will indicate my full \nsupport for it. I hope this body uses its wise judgment to put this on \nthe Intelligence bill as it comes forth. I think it is critically \nimportant that we move this amendment forward to protect American \ncitizens from unwarranted wiretapping.\n  Let me say I am very glad we finally reached an agreement on the \namendments to the Intelligence Committee bill that would replace \ncurrent law, that current law being the Protect America Act. I voted \nagainst the Protect America Act this last August because it included \nmeasures that would permit the Federal Government to conduct \nwarrantless wiretapping and intercept innocent Americans' \ncommunications. We all recognize the need for our Government to have \nthe necessary tools to keep us safe. That is at the forefront in all of \nour minds. At the same time, we must do this in a way that protects our \ncivil liberties and constitutional rights to privacy. A number of \namendments have been offered with that goal in mind, including the one \nI rise to talk about today: the Feingold-Webb-Tester amendment.\n  This amendment would require that all inadvertent surveillance of a \nU.S. person--someone who is a U.S. citizen, a legal permanent resident, \nor a U.S. corporation--be tagged and sequestered. Right now, under the \nProtect America Act and under the Intelligence Committee bill that we \nare currently debating, the Government would be authorized to have \nunfettered surveillance of all communications of all people outside of \nthe United States without a warrant. This access would also be extended \nto Americans here in the United States at the other end of that phone \ncall or e-mail message. Americans abroad or those who receive \ncommunications from abroad could be wiretapped without a warrant. That \ndeficiency is what this amendment addresses.\n  Let me be clear. This amendment does not stop surveillance from \nhappening; it merely sets a higher threshold for access to \ncommunications that involve Americans. Let me repeat that. It sets a \nhigher threshold for access to communications for those that involve \nAmericans.\n  The Feingold-Webb-Tester amendment will not impede the collection of \nforeign intelligence information or compromise our national security. \nIt would merely require that intelligence intercepted overseas of an \nAmerican citizen's communications would have to be tagged and \nsequestered before it could be accessed. To be accessed, the \nintelligence community would have to have a specific warrant to review \nAmericans' overseas communications.\n  Why is this necessary? Because in the past, the administration \nimplemented a warrantless surveillance program which severely \nencroached upon our rights against unauthorized search and seizure.\n  Under the Protect America Act, when we monitor foreign \ncommunications, there is no requirement that anyone involved in the \ncommunication be under any suspicion of wrongdoing. As a result, simply \ncommunicating with someone in a foreign country opens any American to \nsurveillance. This is most often the case when a conversation starts \nabroad and ends up with someone in the United States. Why? Because the \nGovernment must meet only two criteria: that at least one party to the \ncommunication be outside of the United States, and that the purpose of \nthe surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence.\n  This overreaching protocol is even more expansive than the \nadministration's illegal warrantless wiretapping program which is \nfocused on people targeted because of their involvement with suspected \nterrorists. I am opposed to the widespread wiretapping and surveillance \nof innocent Americans.\n  The Director of National Intelligence has openly stated that the \ncurrent law, the Protect America Act, allows full collection of all \ninternational communications into and out of the United States, well \nbeyond what the Government says it needs to protect the American \npeople. Further amendments will be offered during the course of this \ndebate that explicitly state such widespread full collection of all \ninternational communication is not authorized. However, as it stands, \nany time you communicate with someone overseas by e-mail or by phone, \nyour conversation could very well end up in a Government database \nsomewhere.\n  These days, international communications are commonplace. Many \nAmericans have friends and family living overseas studying or for \nbusiness or vacationing. When they return, they often keep in touch \nwith the friends they have made while living abroad. For example, if \nyou are on a vacation in Europe and call home to check on your elderly \nparents, the entire conversation could get caught in the crosshairs of \nthis foreign surveillance program. That is not right and it does not \nmake any sense. It opens innocent Americans to the unrestricted \nsurveillance of wholly innocent conversations by the Federal \nGovernment. This is not what Americans expect or deserve.\n  We must act to ensure that such communications caught in the widely \ncast net of surveillance are segregated or specifically designated so \nthat privacy concerns can be minimized. This amendment, the Feingold-\nWebb-Tester amendment, would require that this information be kept \napart as a way to protect the privacy rights of those people who \ninnocently find themselves under surveillance. The content would not be \ndestroyed, but investigators\n\n[[Page S571]]\n\nwould have to go through additional steps in order to access it in the \nfuture.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is meant for foreign \nsurveillance. Our amendment reiterates that focus and it protects \nAmericans from the accidental but very real intrusion of our right to \nprivacy. I don't want my granddaughter, my wife, your kids, or any \nother Americans to have their communications monitored, stored away, \nand then easily accessible at a later date. This amendment ensures that \ndoesn't happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it is \ncritically important for the success of this bill and to protect \ninnocent Americans' civil liberties.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Feingold). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I also rise in support of this amendment, \nwhich I am very proud to be cosponsoring along with the Presiding \nOfficer and Senator Tester. I appreciate also the support of a number \nof other Members of this body on this bill.\n  I wish to start by saying I consider myself to be very much a realist \nwhen it comes to the intelligence services in the United States and \nwhen it comes to the use of classified information. I got my first \nsecurity clearance when I was 17 years old. I have been involved in the \nintelligence world all of my life. When I was Secretary of the Navy, I \nwas privileged to have ``black'' security clearances in a number of \nareas with some highly sensitive information. I understand the \ncomplexities of this environment.\n  I also am very sensitive to the massive instantaneous flow of data \nthat now exists in today's world that makes it essential we have more \nrapid procedures in place in order to intercept key transmissions. But \nthat also gives us the responsibility to ensure that with this higher \nvolume of communication, we don't allow mistakes and abuse, because \nthat potential also rises.\n  Simply stated, this amendment is designed to allow our Government on \nthe one hand to aggressively fight terrorism but, on the other, to \nprotect our vital constitutional rights and our system of checks and \nbalances.\n  This amendment will neither stop nor slow down any of our vital \nintelligence activities. I wish to reemphasize that. There is nothing \nin this amendment that will slow down the ability of our intelligence \nservices to do the job they are supposed to do.\n  The American people have been following this debate. The law is a \ncomplex law; we recognize that. But the arguments advanced by many in \nthis Chamber have not focused fully on the broad constitutional issues \nabout which Americans have concerns. We care about keeping our Nation \nsafe from further terrorist attack. But we also must care just as \ndeeply in this body about making sure our Government's surveillance is \ndone in a way that is consistent with our Constitution.\n  I agree with my colleagues--many of whom sit on the Intelligence or \nJudiciary Committees--this law needs to be updated for all the reasons \nI mentioned. I am very proud of our Government's trained professionals \nwho have worked so tirelessly for the last 6\\1/2\\ years, since 9/11, in \ntheir effort to help keep our country safe.\n  But while the means of electronic communication surveillance have \nrapidly modernized, the speed and overwhelming volume of those \ncommunications still requires us to maintain a balanced Federal system, \nwith proper checks and balances against the improper use of \ngovernmental authority. The broader the governmental authority, the \ngreater is our responsibility to ensure this authority is narrowly and \nproperly applied.\n  The watchwords of this debate, from our perspective, are: Safety. \nSecurity. Fighting terrorism. But also oversight--oversight of the \nexecutive branch, proper checks and balances. Those watchwords should \nguide us.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin has completed an exhaustive explanation of \nthe nuts and bolts of this amendment. The Senator from Montana has \nadded to that. I will not belabor their explanations of those finer \npoints. But I emphasize our amendment will do what the American people \nhave been demanding: restore a proper system of checks and balances in \nour Government's surveillance program. Every Member of this body--and \nevery American, no matter which political party or persuasion--supports \nthe fundamental bedrock concept of checks and balances, concepts we \nhave captured in this amendment's provisions.\n  As I mentioned, this amendment allows our Government to fully and \neffectively monitor communications in order to keep us safe from \nterrorist attack, in every conceivable way. It permits our Government \nto acquire any foreign-to-foreign communications. It permits our \nGovernment to acquire any communications of suspected terrorists into \nor out of the United States. It permits our Government to acquire any \ncommunication where there is reason to believe the acquisition is \nnecessary to prevent death or serious bodily harm. And it permits our \nGovernment to acquire any communications for law enforcement purposes \nif the communication is evidence that a crime has been, is being or is \nabout to be committed.\n  Simply stated, the underlying bill in this amendment bestows on our \nGovernment the essential tools to keep America safe.\n  On top of that, for the first time, this amendment would erect a \nsystem of oversight and accountability for communications that do not \nfall into the broad categories I have described.\n  What types of communications? They are communications that have one \nend in the United States and generally involve innocent Americans who \nare not targeted as suspected terrorists, as the Senator from Wisconsin \nso aptly described. In other words, it could be anyone; it could be \nyou, it could be me. For those of us who have no ties to terrorism, an \nupdated FISA law should and must provide proper protections.\n  As the Senator from Wisconsin described in his remarks, under this \namendment, when the Government realizes it has acquired a communication \nwith one end of the United States, the Government must segregate that \nspecific communication in a separate database. For example, this could \ntake the form of a telephone call or an e-mail.\n  To emphasize, so there is no misunderstanding: Even after segregating \nthese communications, the Government can have full access to them; but \nthe Government cannot, and should not, have unfettered access to \ncommunications of innocent Americans.\n  This amendment is quite simple. The inspectors general for the \nDepartment of Defense and Department of Justice would be given access \nto sequestered communications. These sequestered communications will \nallow the inspectors general to see specifically which Americans the \nGovernment surveilled or which specific communications were diverted \ninto Government hands for possible surveillance.\n  Using this information, the inspectors general would be required to \nconduct audits of the implementation of the sequestration system and \ndetermine the extent of the surveillance. I note the inspectors general \nwould employ staffs with appropriate security clearances. And at least \nonce per year, they must report their findings to the Senate and House \nCommittees on the Judiciary and Intelligence.\n  I believe we need this amendment for many reasons. For almost 7 \nyears, the executive branch's surveillance program has operated in \nalmost total secrecy, often above the law and the Constitution, and \noften above any review by Congress or the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court. For almost 7 years, only the executive branch, and \nperhaps a few isolated employees of telecommunications companies, have \nknown which Americans were being surveilled. This is unacceptable in a \nconstitutional system, whose Founding Fathers rejected the notion of an \nexecutive branch with absolute, unchecked authority. In fact, Congress \nrejected the notion of unchecked executive authority when it originally \npassed FISA, after the Watergate scandal.\n  There are many arguments that may be leveled against this amendment. \nI believe they hold no water. Some of them simply employ fear tactics \nto cloud the issues of constitutional propriety.\n  First, some may contend the underlying bill already greatly expands \nthe authority of the FISA Court. But the problem is the pending bill \nrequires\n\n[[Page S572]]\n\nonly a review of general surveillance processes. Administrations can, \nand have, abused processes. A truly robust system of checks and \nbalances demands accountability and oversight over the specific \ncommunications obtained by the Government.\n  This oversight is all the more critical because, for almost 7 years \nnow, the administration may have enjoyed completely unrestrained access \nto the communications of virtually every American.\n  Do we know this to be the case? I cannot be sure. One reason I cannot \nbe sure is I have been denied access to review the documents that may \nanswer these questions, even about the process. A month ago, our \nmajority leader wrote to the Director of National Intelligence, asking \nthat all Senators be given access to the documents surrounding the \ntelecommunications companies' involvement in the administration's \nsurveillance program. To this date, that request has been denied.\n  The denial of this request is one more reason the Senate must bring \ntrue accountability to our Nation's intelligence-gathering process. If \nwe do not ask the tough questions and demand true oversight, how will \nwe ever know the extent of Government surveillance or how many innocent \nAmericans have been listened to?\n  Second, some will argue a process of sequestering communications will \nbe far too cumbersome and, as the Senator from Wisconsin pointed out, \nthis is simply untrue.\n  Under current law, the Government already labels the surveillance \ncommunications it collects.\n  Additionally, members of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees \ntell me that the segregation of these communications can be easily \naccomplished. Finally, if our intelligence community needs additional \npersonnel or resources to accomplish this requirement, then the \nCongress should promptly provide the necessary funds. Compliance with \nthe U.S. Constitution is not a matter of option; it is mandatory.\n  Third, some may contend that this amendment is a partisan ploy \ndesigned to embarrass the intelligence community and the \nadministration.\n  Again, this is simply untrue. I would make the same arguments if the \ncurrent President belonged to my party. This amendment is not rooted in \npartisanship. Rather, it attempts to protect the constitutional rights \nof all innocent Americans.\n  Moreover, I recognize the tremendous work and sacrifices made by the \nprofessionals in our intelligence community, as they aim to keep our \nhomeland safe from attack. But only through a robust system of checks \nand balances can we ensure the good name of our intelligence \nprofessionals and the work that they do.\n  In sum, I ask my colleagues to join in supporting this amendment. It \nis time to lay aside our differences and do what is right, time for the \nCongress to aggressively and responsibly assert its oversight \nresponsibilities.\n  I am reminded today of a famous quote from U.S. Supreme Court Justice \nCardozo. Analyzing our constitutional system of checks and balances, in \n1935 Justice Cardozo wrote that executive branch ``discretion is not \nunconfined and vagrant. It is canalized within banks that keep it from \noverflowing.''\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the importance of this amendment in \nkeeping our Nation safe while also restoring an appropriate system of \nchecks and balances to the FISA surveillance process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer, in his capacity as a \nSenator from Wisconsin, reserves the remainder of his time on this \namendment.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. I appreciate the \nconcern of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But there are \nquite a few misconceptions and misinterpretations about the bill and \nabout the impact this proposed amendment would have.\n  Again, after the chairman speaks, there are a number of members of \nthe committee who wish to come and speak more about it.\n  The purpose of this bill is, and always has been, to enable the \nintelligence community to act to target foreign terrorists and spies \noverseas. To answer many of the contentions made, you cannot get a \ncertification to begin the process, unless there are reasonable \nprocedures to assure that the targeted persons reasonably are believed \nto be located outside the State. Two, the procedures are consistent \nwith the requirements of the Fourth Amendment and do not permit \nintentional targeting of any person known to be located in the United \nStates. In 2(a)(3), it says that a significant purpose of the \nacquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information.\n  Now, the statements that somebody who has gone abroad and is calling \nback home to their children would be surveilled is beyond the pale. No. \n1, there is a clear prohibition in the bill against targeting any U.S. \npersons abroad without getting a FISA Court order saying there is \nreasonable cause to believe, one, they are acting as an agent or \nofficer or employee of a foreign power; and, two, they have significant \ninformation. What this amendment does, however, is strike the ability \nto collect information on some foreign power that may be talking about \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, it would \nprevent collection on hostile states acting in a dangerous manner to \nthe United States.\n  Now, the amendment, as it is drafted, will have a totally unexpected \nimpact. It is difficult to explain, in an unclassified session, why \nthis amendment is unworkable. But it would say that if there is a \nperson reasonably believed to be located in the United States, such \ncommunication shall be segregated, or specifically designated, and no \nperson shall have access to such communication except in accordance \nwith title I, which presumes that you have access to that information, \nto determine whether it qualifies under the exceptions to the \nprohibition.\n  In effect, you would have a requirement that any kind of incidental \ncommunication from a person, from a foreign terrorist target, somebody \nhaving information of foreign intelligence value or a possible \nterrorist attack, who calls the United States or sends an e-mail, you \nwould have to track down and find out where every e-mail recipient may \nbe. You would have to identify people who might be collecting that \ninformation and investigate whether they are in the United States; and \nyou would compile a significant amount of information on U.S. persons.\n  The whole reason it operates with minimization is to say there are \nonly certain communications which the intelligence community is \nlawfully permitted to acquire, and which it has any desire to acquire, \nbecause to acquire all the communications from all foreigners is an \nabsolutely impossible task.\n  I cannot describe in a public setting how they go about ascertaining \nwhich collections are important. But to say that if Osama bin Laden or \nhis No. 3 man--whoever that is today, after the last No. 3 man in al-\nQaida was wiped out--calls somebody in the United States, we cannot \nlisten in to that communication, unless we have an independent means of \nverifying it has some impact or threats to our security or a terrorist \nthreat.\n  That is the most important communication we need to intercept. The \nProtect America Act has kept our country safe because if somebody calls \nin with information on a terrorist threat, then the FBI and local law \nenforcement officials can go to work on that threat immediately and get \nadditional criminal authorities as needed. But that is the most vital \nkind of information to get. We certainly should not be required to be \nput in a lockbox, as this amendment would provide.\n\n  Finally, talking about expansion of surveillance powers, when FISA \nwas first adopted, most of the collection against foreign targets came \nby radio, whether coming into the United States or going foreign to \nforeign, and there was no limitation on it. There was no limitation on \nintercepting radio communications.\n  What we have done in FISA is to impose significant new restrictions \non the collection of information that might be of foreign intelligence \nvalue. We should change the definition of ``electronic surveillance,'' \nbut we were not able to do so in this law so it would apply to \ncollection against other forms of communications.\n\n[[Page S573]]\n\n  Suffice it to say, this bill before us, the bipartisan bill, is \ncarefully targeted, limited, covered with layers of protection and \noversight to assure minimization, as I previously suggested. Whether \nyou believe the inspector general of NSA, the inspector general of the \nDNI, the Department of Justice will perform adequate oversight or not, \nyou can be sure the Intelligence Committee will do so.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me? I was going \nto ask that I be allowed to proceed, I don't think it will be more than \n5 or 6 minutes, as though in morning business to give a eulogy, with \nthe time not to be taken from either side.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the Senator if I can quickly respond to the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course. I understand.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, responding to the comments just made, \nthe Senator from Missouri, in responding to the Feingold-Webb-Tester \namendment, tried to indicate that this will prevent us from going after \nspies and others from foreign states. First, under our amendment, of \ncourse the FISA Court can grant permission to wiretap spies. And, if it \nis a foreign state that is involved in terrorism, there would be no \npermission required under our amendment to wiretap the officials \ninvolved. It would not affect that.\n  It was also suggested this would somehow be very cumbersome. That \nsuggests we are requiring permission for all foreign communications, \nbut that is not true. Our amendment only affects, and only in a minimal \nway, communications from a foreign place to someone in the United \nStates. That is not cumbersome.\n  Third, the Senator from Missouri suggests we will have to make the \nGovernment sift through all kinds of e-mails to figure out whether they \ncan get at individual communications. That is the opposite of the way \nthis works. This amendment creates an assumption in favor of \ncollection. In other words, if the Government does not know for sure if \na communication is foreign or domestic, the assumption is it is foreign \nuntil there is some indication that it is domestic. It is only then \nthat the limited oversight provided by this amendment kicks in.\n  The final example the Senator from Missouri used shows how \nquestionable these arguments are. If you can believe it, the Senator \nargued that if Osama bin Laden called someone in the United States, \nsomehow our amendment would affect that. That is obviously false. Our \namendment specifically allows an exception for any conversation by \nanyone in the United States with a terrorist overseas, without any \nspecial FISA Court permission. That argument shows the weakness of the \nopposition. The idea that the Senators from Virginia and Montana and I \nwould suggest an amendment to not allow us to listen in on Osama bin \nLaden gives you a little clue that the arguments against this amendment \nare not based on the amendment we offered.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont very much for understanding. I \nwanted to quickly respond to those arguments. I yield the floor and \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from Vermont to \nyield for a moment? I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized after \nthe Senator from Vermont.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I might say, in this debate the \nSenator from Wisconsin is absolutely correct. I was there during some \nof the debate on this issue and I know what he means.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, with the forbearance of the Senator \nfrom Maryland, I wish to place our situation in context because we have \na number of things going on, and I would like the Parliamentarian to \nexplain it to me so it is very clear to all of us.\n  Before I do that, I am reading at the direction of the leader his \nunanimous consent request, and that is to have the time from 5:20 p.m. \nto 5:30 p.m. be reserved for debate on the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 5140, the economic stimulus bill; \nfurther, that the time be equally divided and reserved for the two \nleaders or their designees, with the Republicans controlling the first \n5 minutes and the majority controlling the final 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Now I would like to ask the Parliamentarian to help \nme be sure and our Members on the floor and others what our situation \nis. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee has just given an \nextraordinarily moving tribute to a very dear friend of his--\nextraordinarily moving--but that came in between. Now, the Senator from \nPennsylvania has come upon the floor and he wants to say certain \nthings, and there are people in the gallery to whom this would have a \ndirect effect, so there is a temptation to go along with that. On the \nother hand, we are still on the Feingold amendment. I believe that to \nbe the pending amendment, if the Parliamentarian declares that to be \nthe case.\n\n  On the other hand, the person who is listed second on the order of \nthe day is the Senator from Maryland. In the matter of how many years \nwe should wait before going back to this, if we do, he was in fact the \nsecond person on the order of the day for the second amendment. He is \nhere. He has been waiting and he wants to present that amendment. So it \nis 4 o'clock and we have a variety of things before us, and I wish the \nParliamentarian to set us straight as to where we are.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Feingold amendment is the \npending amendment. There is time remaining for debate on that \namendment. However, an order has been entered for the Senator from \nMaryland to offer his amendment, on which there is 60 minutes of \ndebate, and that is to come next.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I don't know how much time is remaining on both \nsides with respect to the Feingold amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. On the Feingold amendment, the \nmajority has 7 minutes 39 seconds, and those opposing have 37 minutes \n27 seconds.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If this Senator does his mathematics, that takes us \nalready past the time of the unanimous consent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Of course, we don't have to use all our time. \nTherefore, I would encourage our colleagues not to do so, and yet to \nget out the full body of the amendment.\n  I appreciate the response of the Parliamentarian, the Presiding \nOfficer, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support providing the Government with the \nflexibility it needs to conduct important surveillance of overseas \ntargets. Both the Intelligence Committee's and the Judiciary \nCommittee's versions of this bill would allow the Government to \nintercept all communications of overseas targets, including those \ncommunications with people inside of the United States. However, this \nalso means that the Government will necessarily be acquiring the \ncommunications of innocent Americans.\n  I commend Senators Feingold, Webb, and Tester for crafting an \namendment that will help to safeguard the privacy rights of innocent \nAmericans whose communications are acquired during the surveillance of \noverseas targets. This new FISA legislation will grant the Government \nauthority to conduct surveillance on overseas targets concerning \n``foreign intelligence.'' This term covers a broad range of subjects \nand the new authority would permit the Government great latitude to \nintercept communications without a court order. Once Americans' \ncommunications are collected, they can be shared widely with other \nagencies. This Feingold-Webb-Tester provision permits unfettered \nacquisition of foreign-to-foreign communications and of communications \nof suspected terrorists into or out of the United States while creating \nsafeguards for communications not related to terrorism that\n\n[[Page S574]]\n\nthe Government knows have one end in the United States. If the \nGovernment is not able to determine beforehand whether a communication \nwill be into or out of the United States, it can acquire all of those \ncommunications without prior court approval. What this amendment does \nis add the very reasonable protection that if it is later determined \nthat a communication involves a person in the United States, measures \nwill be taken to segregate that information to assure that privacy is \nprotected appropriately. There are exceptions even then to make sure \nthat national security is never placed at risk. If the communication \ninvolves terrorism or a suspected terrorist, if someone's safety is at \nstake, the Government can then access, analyze and disseminate that \ncommunication.\n  This amendment is an important check to ensure that the new authority \nwe will grant with this bill is used as intended. Without it, many law-\nabiding Americans who communicate with completely innocent people \noverseas will be swept up in this new form of surveillance, with \nvirtually no judicial involvement or oversight.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me thank my friend from West Virginia \nfor clarifying the floor circumstances as best we can.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3930 to Amendment No. 3911\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending \namendment, and I call up amendment No. 3930.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin], for himself, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Salazar, \n     proposes amendment numbered 3930.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To modify the sunset provision)\n\n       On page 54, line 16, strike ``2013.'' and insert the \n     following: ``2011. Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, the transitional procedures under paragraphs (2)(B) \n     and (3)(B) of section 302(c) shall apply to any order, \n     authorization, or directive, as the case may be, issued under \n     title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978, as amended by this Act, in effect on December 31, \n     2011.''.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleagues for their \npatience. We are trying to get through a series of amendments on the \nFISA legislation.\n  The amendment I am offering is one that was approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee, one that I think is very important to this legislation \nmoving forward, and one which would establish a 4-year sunset for \ncongressional review. I am proud that my cosponsors of this amendment \ninclude Senator Leahy, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Mikulski, and \nSenator Salazar, and I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, Mr. Rockefeller, for his leadership and for his \nhelp in regard to the amendment I am bringing forward.\n  I wish to go back a little in time to when the original FISA statute \nwas passed. During that period of time, we had recently come out of \nWatergate. There were certainly indications of warrantless surveillance \ndone on Americans because of their disagreement with the administration \nin power, there were indications of warrantless surveillance of \nindividuals because they happened to disagree with U.S. policy in \nVietnam, and there was genuine concern that we had not balanced \nproperly the Government's need to obtain information in order to keep \nus safe and the protections of the civil liberties of the people who \nlive in our own country. So we tried to enact a statute that would \nprovide balance in 1978. There was the Church committee report, and in \n1978 Congress passed the FISA statute.\n  I want to start by quoting from one of our colleagues, Senator \nKennedy, and what he said in 1978 about the original passage of the \nFISA statute--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. He \nsaid:\n\n       The complexity of the problem must not be underestimated. \n     Electronic surveillance can be a useful tool for the \n     government's gathering of certain kinds of information; yet, \n     if abused, it can also constitute a particularly \n     indiscriminate and penetrating invasion of the privacy of our \n     citizens. My objective over the past 6 years has been to \n     reach some kind of fair balance that will protect the \n     security of the United States without infringing on our \n     citizens' human liberties and rights.\n\n  The Attorney General at that time for the Carter administration was \nGriffin Bell. Attorney General Bell said:\n\n       I believe this bill is remarkable not only in the way it \n     has been developed, but also in the fact that for the first \n     time in our society the clandestine intelligence activities \n     of our government shall be subject to the regulation and \n     receive the positive authority of a public law for all to \n     inspect. President Carter stated it very well in announcing \n     this bill when he said that ``one of the most difficult tasks \n     in a free society like our own is the correlation between \n     adequate intelligence to guarantee our Nation's security on \n     the one hand, and the preservation of basic human rights on \n     the other.'' It is a very delicate balance to strike, but one \n     which is necessary in our society, and a balance which cannot \n     be achieved by sacrificing either our Nation's security or \n     our civil liberties.\n\n  A lot has happened since 1978 when that law was passed. We know that \ntechnology has changed and the law has been amended over its life, but \nwe still have the same problem: how to balance our need to get \ninformation, which is important for the protection of our Nation, and \nthe civil liberties of our citizens.\n  I am proud to represent the people of Maryland. I am proud of the \nwork done by NSA--the National Security Agency--which is located in \nMaryland. I have visited the National Security Agency on many \noccasions. These men and women, dedicated to a mission of protecting \nour country by getting lawful information which is important to \npreserve the security of America, do their job with great distinction \nand great dedication to our country.\n  But we have seen in recent years the difficulty in complying with the \nFISA statute. Information obtained from foreign sources, because some \ncommunications come through America with the new technologies and the \nway in which communications are now handled today, is different than it \nwas back in the 1970s. So we need to pass this statute. I think \neveryone here is prepared and understands the need for us to modernize \nthe FISA statute, but we have to get it right.\n  Let me mention one debate that has been taking place on this floor \nthat the chairman and the Republican leader on the Intelligence \nCommittee have talked frequently about, as has the leadership on the \nJudiciary Committee, and that is the minimization rules. We think we \nhave it right now, but we are still concerned about the minimization \nrules. It is interesting to go back in history and look at what the \nSenate Judiciary Committee said in 1978 about the concerns of Americans \nbeing caught in the web but not being the main focus of our target for \nsurveillance. The Senate Judiciary Committee observed:\n\n       Also formidable, although incalculable, is the chilling \n     effect which warrantless electronic surveillance may have on \n     the constitutional rights of those who were not targets of \n     surveillance, but who perceived themselves, whether \n     reasonably or unreasonably, as potential targets. Our Bill of \n     Rights is concerned not only with direct infringements on \n     constitutional rights, but also with Government activities \n     which effectively inhibit exercise of these rights. The \n     exercise of political freedom depends in large measure on \n     citizens' understanding that they will be able to be publicly \n     active and dissent from official policy within lawful limits, \n     without having to sacrifice the expectation of privacy that \n     they rightfully hold. Warrantless electronic surveillance can \n     violate that understanding and impair that public confidence \n     so necessary to an uninhibited political life.\n\n  That is what we are concerned about here. We want to make sure we get \nthis right, and we know that over time we have seen abuses of the \nstatute. We are now concerned about what happens when an American is \ntargeted. They didn't think about that before, about someone traveling \nabroad. I congratulate the committee for bringing forward a bill that \ndoes protect Americans who are traveling abroad and are a target of \nsurveillance by requiring cause be shown. That is how it should be.\n  I am very concerned about the debate we are having in this body \nconcerning the exclusivity in the statute we are going to pass. There \nhas been a long history of debate as to how much article II power the \nPresident has in regard to warrantless surveillance. This is not a new \nsubject. But I must tell you, I think this administration took that \nissue to a new level. I believe the courts agree that the President \nwent\n\n[[Page S575]]\n\ntoo far. So it is our responsibility to try to get this right so that \nwe have the rule of law behind what the administration does, rather \nthan trying to use article II power, which in fact can very easily be \nabused.\n\n  There is another issue I want to comment on briefly--and I will come \nback to the sunset provisions as to why I think the 4 years is so \nparticularly important in this legislation--and that is the immunity \nissue and the retroactive immunity. Retroactive immunity concerns me. I \nwould hope it would concern every Member of the Senate. It concerns me \nnot just as it affects the telephone companies in their cooperation \nwith this administration--because there has been clear evidence that \nthey operated under the authority that the administration had this \npower and that they were helping their country--but what concerns me \nabout granting them retroactive immunity is the impact it will have on \nthe courts' oversight of the abuse of privacy by the administration or \nprivate companies.\n  We need the courts actively involved here. We don't get this right \nall the time, and certainly the administration doesn't get it right all \nthe time. We need the courts involved in these issues. If we grant \nretroactive immunity, we are saying we reserve the right to take away \nthe third branch of Government--the judicial branch of Government--for \nmaking determinations as to whether an individual's right of privacy is \nviolated. I don't think that is something we want as a legacy of this \nCongress. That is why many of us are concerned about using retroactive \nimmunity.\n  There are other options that are out there. I see my distinguished \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, is here. He has a \nproposal that I think would take care of the concerns of the telephone \ncompanies yet protect the integrity of the courts. I congratulate him \nfor that recommendation, and I think he has now refined it to the point \nthat I hope it will garner the type of support necessary for approval \nby this body.\n  Senator Feinstein has a proposal that, rather than just giving \nimmunity, would at least have the courts make the determination as to \nwhether the telephone companies are entitled to this relief; whether \nthey acted in good faith. So at least we have the courts involved in \nthis decision rather than taking away their authority. I think either \nof those recommendations would be a major improvement over giving \nretroactive immunity to telecommunication companies.\n  But let me get to the specifics of the amendment I have offered, \nwhich is the 4-year sunset on the provisions. Again I am pleased to be \njoined by several of our colleagues. It is interesting to point out \nthat sunsets have been part of the FISA statute for a long time. When \nthe USA PATRIOT Act was passed, it contained a 4-year sunset. Now why \ndid we put a 4-year sunset in? We were worried about whether we got it \nall right. This is something that required the continued attention of \nthe Congress and the administration. In fact, we reauthorized it with \nsignificant changes and then put in another 3-year sunset, in this case \nfor one of the most controversial provisions. So this is something we \nhave done in the past.\n  The Protect America Act is a major departure from the PATRIOT Act. It \nwas passed hurriedly, and no one denies that. It was passed hurriedly \nlast August, and we weren't comfortable with what we did. The proof is \nthe bill now before us is a much better bill. Thank goodness we had the \nsunset. The committee recognized the need for a sunset because they put \na 6-year sunset in.\n  Why do I think it is so important to change that 6 years to 4 years?\n  Let me tell you why: I think it is in our national interest that the \nnext administration taking office in January of 2009 be focused on this \nissue, this vital issue of getting the intelligence information that is \ncritical to protect the safety of the people of this Nation but also to \nprotect the civil liberties of Americans.\n  I think it is vital that the next administration look at those \nopinions that came out of the Attorney General's Office and the White \nHouse and give a fresh look to it and try to figure out if there is not \neven a better way to accomplish both the collection of information and \nthe protection of civil liberties.\n  If we continue the 6-year sunset, there will be no requirement for \nthe next administration to take a look at this statute. With a 4-year \nsunset, it will come under the watch of the next administration.\n  It is very interesting that one of my colleagues talked about the \nopportunity to review documents, and I believe the distinguished \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee would agree with me--from the \nfact that we had a sunset on the bill we passed in August, we got a lot \nmore attention from the administration on getting material. They \nbrought a lot of material into our office so we could review it. They \ncooperated with us because they knew we had to act. If we include a 6-\nyear sunset, there will be no requirement for the next administration \nto engage Congress on this issue. I want the next administration to \nengage Congress on this issue.\n  We have seen the change in technology since we passed this bill in \n1976, and technology is changing more rapidly than ever before. We do \nnot know the next way in which terrorists are going to be using it in \norder to try to circumvent our detection as well as our laws. We do not \nknow that. So it is important for us to stay engaged so that we can \nhave the most effective tools in place, not using the article II power \nof the President but having Congress engaged and making sure we have \nthe statutes correct.\n  It is another reason I think it is very important to have a 4-year \nsunset. I know I am not telling you something you do not already know, \nbut the FISA statute gives the administration extraordinary powers and \nvery sensitive powers as it relates to the privacy of people here in \nAmerica and an issue on which we have to make sure we protect the \nrights of our citizens.\n  So for all of those reasons, we want to stay engaged on this subject. \nAgain, I want to emphasize this is not a question of no sunset versus a \n6-year sunset. I understand the administration wants no sunset. I can \nunderstand that. The President probably would want no Congress. But the \nFramers of our Constitution understood the importance of the \nlegislative branch of Government. It is rated as No. 1, article I.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is an amendment \nthat is offered in good faith. I would encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  I reserve the reminder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This Senator would add an additional complication \nbut one which is necessary and highly important.\n  Senator Leahy, as I indicated, gave a very moving statement. We now \nhave two more Senators on the floor who wish to discuss equally tragic \ncircumstances with members of either the family or close friends in the \ngallery, which means we cannot postpone, for a variety of reasons which \nthe senior Senator gave me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we set the pending amendment aside \ntemporarily and first call upon the junior Senator from Pennsylvania \nand then the senior Senator from Pennsylvania to make a few short \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \njunior Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Casey and Mr. Specter pertaining to the \nsubmission of S. Res. 442 are printed in today's Record under \n``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 2591 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill for the \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in the absence of the Senator from \nMaryland, I yield myself 5 minutes from the time controlled by Senator \nCardin on his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S576]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3930\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this Senator supports the amendment \nof the Senator from Maryland to revise the sunset provision of the bill \nso that the new authority established under this act will expire after \n4 years.\n  This Senator had originally started out supporting a 4-year sunset \nbecause it seemed to make sense because it comes during the next \nPresident's term in office.\n  This is supremely important legislation. There is no one--with the \nexception of the administration--who has objected, no committee which \nhas objected to the idea of considering a sunset review. The reason is \nvery clear: One wants to make sure, when you are balancing foreign \nintelligence collection, intelligence collection in general, and civil \nliberties, that one has the right balance. The question before us today \nis what date in the future makes the most sense for a sunset.\n  There are a number of new initiatives which are either proposed to be \nstarted in this legislation or which will be started in this \nlegislation, and none of them are entirely predictable.\n  I think a 4-year sunset makes a lot of sense because it is so \nimportant that we know what we are doing, that we know we are doing it \nright, and that we know the intelligence community knows it is doing \nits work correctly--I do not mean badly or superbly but simply that \nthey are getting it the way they want to do it and it is compatible \nwith the spirit of the law, that the Congress and the administration \nare in sync on it. We do this before we settle this into permanent law.\n  This is all new. Everything changed on 9/11. Many considerations \nunder the law, particularly with respect to the gathering of \nintelligence and the protection of privacy, changed. This is especially \nimportant in light of the rapid pace of change in telecommunications \ntechnology--one of the main reasons were are here today revising FISA.\n  I think we need to have a 4-year sunset amendment. I do think it is \nimportant that the intelligence community, the Congress, and the \nadministration come back together in 4 years. Congress, obviously, can \nbring it up anytime we want. On the other hand, if we do it this way, \nwith a 4-year sunset amendment, it obliges all participants to come to \nparticipate. That is the way we get resolved what works and what does \nnot work, and we learn from the intelligence people, and they learn \nfrom us, as to what we think is the best way to proceed.\n  So I do strongly support that amendment. It would take us to December \n31, 2011. This four year period would give the intelligence community \nample time to move ahead but it also ensures that the decision on \npermanency is made when Congress and the executive branch are prepared \nto evaluate the legislation again. As I have indicated, I support the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican floor manager, I think by our \ntradition, is to be recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share a few views on the amendment. \nAgain, on this measure, as on the others, I have a number of my \ncolleagues who have indicated a desire to speak on it, so I am only \ngoing to take a very few minutes.\n  But let's be clear: When this issue came before the Intelligence \nCommittee, we worked on a bipartisan basis to compromise. I think we \nhad, as I have said before, a very good compromise. Everybody gave. I \ndid not want any sunset. I felt providing our intelligence community \nthe ability to establish a good, strong, adequately protected but yet \neffective means of intercepting foreign intelligence communications was \nvitally important so the intelligence community would know they had \nthis ability.\n  Moreover, I have had the opportunity, in the last couple years, to \nmeet with many of our allies abroad. Our allies depend upon our ability \nto intercept communications that lead to the disruption of terrorist \nattacks in other countries.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues who want to know what the Protect America \nAct has done to review the classified communication that the Director \nof National Intelligence sent us saying how many times and where in \nforeign countries we were able to provide vital information through our \ncollection of electronic signals to the governments that wanted to be \nable to prevent terrorist attacks and were significantly enabled to do \nso by means of our collection efforts. Probably the reason for keeping \nit a permanent law was best expressed by the Attorney General, Mike \nMukasey. When he was asked about why we shouldn't have a sunset, he \nsaid: The enemies, the Islamist terrorists who want to do us harm, do \nnot put a sunset on their fatwas, their orders to go out and kill \nAmericans and kill our allies and kill our troops abroad.\n\n  There is no immediate prospect of cessation of foreign terrorist \nactivities or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or even \nthreats from countries that are absolutely hostile and dangerous to the \nUnited States. To put an artificial time limit on it makes no sense.\n  I have a different view of what the Intelligence Committee should be \ndoing. One of the things we see, as we have discussed some of these \namendments, is that those of us on the Intelligence Committee have \nspecial access to all this information, but we have a heavy \nresponsibility. We try to carry it out well. Every time we explain on \nthe floor what our intelligence activities are concerning, even in an \nunclassified setting, the more we talk about it, the more our enemies--\nthose who would seek to do us harm--learn about our intelligence \ncollection capabilities. Bringing this back to the floor will enable \nthem, once again, to learn more about what we are doing and when we are \ndoing it.\n  Frankly, having a sunset that expires just before a new \nadministration is sworn in after the 2012 elections seems to me not to \nmake much sense. If there are changes needed in the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act amendments of 2008, it is our job on the \nIntelligence Committee to conduct continuing oversight. If there is a \nproblem with that activity, if it is inadequate or if it is not \nproperly regulated, then it is our job in our oversight hearings to \nbring that to the floor and bring that particular fix or that \nparticular change that is needed to the floor immediately. We shouldn't \nwait 6 years or even 4 years. If we need to fix it, we need to find out \nwhat fixing is needed, and we need to take those steps at that time, \nnot wait for 4 years or 6 years. All we do by setting an artificial \ntime limit on it is to say to those who seek to do us harm: Well, if \nyou go past the deadline, who knows? Maybe the Congress will not be \nable to adopt an extension. Maybe we will be able to communicate with \nour operatives in the United States and elsewhere without surveillance. \nIt causes uncertainty in the intelligence community, and I believe it \nis not wise to cut back on the compromise we reached on a bipartisan \nbasis in passing out the FISA amendments of 2008 by a 13-to-2 vote.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of the time on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee for his support for this \namendment. He has helped in bringing it forward. Let me respond, if I \nmight, to Senator Bond's points.\n  First, let me point out that the cooperation we receive from the \nexecutive branch is very much enhanced when they know we have to pass a \nstatute. All we need to look at is the cooperation we have received \nover the last several years from this administration to know that when \nwe get to a point where Congress needs to act, we get the help of the \nadministration in bringing us on board.\n  As to the comments by the Republican leader on the committee that the \nterrorists don't have sunsets, they also don't have a legislature. They \ndon't have democracy. They don't have any process that is open. They \nhave no respect for civil liberties. We fight for this Nation because \nof what this Nation stands for. We know there are abuses of power, and \nwe have a responsibility to take action on them. Sunsets have worked on \nthe FISA statute.\n\n[[Page S577]]\n\nMy colleague from Missouri has supported sunsets at different times \nduring the process. We had it in the PATRIOT Act, and in the renewal of \nthe PATRIOT Act we still have sunsets. We had sunsets on the original \nProtect America Act, and the bill that came out of the Intelligence \nCommittee has a sunset in it.\n  I understand the administration is against sunsets. I understand \nthat. I don't agree with the administration's view and the way they use \nthe power that was given to them--that they thought was given to them. \nI think they have abused it at times. Thank goodness we had oversight \nto try to rein that in, and thank goodness we had the courts looking at \nwhat they were doing.\n  So the point is whether it should be 6 years or 4 years. I think it \nis critically important that the next administration work with this \nCongress to take a look at how this administration used the power and \ntake a look at the legal opinions that were written so we have a \ncomfort level between Congress and the next administration on \nprotecting the security of America and protecting the civil liberties \nof the people who live in this Nation. That is why I believe the 4-year \nsunset is so important.\n  I respect the view of my colleague from Missouri as to the \npredictability of statutes. We are not going to let the authorities \nexpire. We are going to carry out our responsibility. We know that. \nThere is not a person who is a Member of this body who disagrees with \ngiving the appropriate tools to the intelligence community.\n  As I said earlier, I am very proud of the work that is done at NSA in \nthe State of Maryland by dedicated men and women. They can't send out \npress releases when they do things that are very important to our \ncountry in protecting our security. They do a great job. We owe them \nthe type of support that includes a statute that is definitive and \nmakes sense and that we pass; also, that we continue to be their \npartners and continue the oversight with the change in technology and \ncontinue to work with the executive branch to make sure we get it \nright.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think we all recognize that this \nlegislation would provide broad and untested new powers to the \nexecutive branch. We are willing to do that in order to protect our \nnational security. But this surveillance does not just affect foreign \ntargets; it also affects the privacy rights of potentially millions of \nAmerican citizens. That is why it is so important that we get this \nright. And that is why I support Senator Cardin's amendment, which \nwould reduce the sunset provision of this bill from 6 years to 4 years.\n  We are dealing with untested procedures; we have no assurance that \nwhat we are doing now will properly protect national security or the \nprivacy rights of Americans. Many questions remain about how the new \nauthorities that Congress is prepared to grant will be implemented, \nwhether they will be effective, and--equally important--the extent to \nwhich they will intrude on innocent conversation of Americans. As we \nunderstand more about these authorities--and perhaps as technology \nallows us to improve our approach to this important surveillance--the \nexecutive branch and the Congress should reevaluate these sensitive \nauthorities.\n  There is too much here that is new and untested to allow the \nauthorities to go longer than even expiration of the next President's \nterm before requiring a thorough review. A 4-year sunset makes sense. \nIt will allow the next President 3 years of experience under these \nauthorities to monitor how these new powers are being carried out. And \nit is an appropriate time for the Congress to evaluate whether the \nlegislation strikes the right balance between national security needs \nand Americans' civil liberties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Maryland for his leadership on \nthe sunset issue. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3915 to Amendment No. 3911\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3915.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself and \n     Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 3915.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To place flexible limits on the use of information obtained \n                       using unlawful procedures)\n\n       On page 17, strike line 20 and all that follows through \n     page 18, line 11, and insert the following:\n       ``(B) Correction of deficiencies.--\n       ``(i) In general.--If the Court finds that a certification \n     required by subsection (f) does not contain all of the \n     required elements, or that the procedures required by \n     subsections (d) and (e) are not consistent with the \n     requirements of those subsections or the fourth amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States, the Court shall issue \n     an order directing the Government to, at the Government's \n     election and to the extent required by the Court's order--\n\n       ``(I) correct any deficiency identified by the Court's \n     order not later than 30 days after the date the Court issues \n     the order; or\n       ``(II) cease the acquisition authorized under subsection \n     (a).\n\n       ``(ii) Limitation on use of information.--\n\n       ``(I) In general.--Except as provided in subclause (II), no \n     information obtained or evidence derived from an acquisition \n     under clause (i)(I) concerning any United States person shall \n     be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, \n     hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand \n     jury, department, office, agency, regulatory body, \n     legislative committee, or other authority of the United \n     States, a State, or political subdivision thereof, and no \n     information concerning any United States person acquired from \n     such acquisition shall subsequently be used or disclosed in \n     any other manner by Federal officers or employees without the \n     consent of such person, except with the approval of the \n     Attorney General if the information indicates a threat of \n     death or serious bodily harm to any person.\n       ``(II) Exception.--If the Government corrects any \n     deficiency identified by the Court's order under clause (i), \n     the Court may permit the use or disclosure of information \n     acquired before the date of the correction pursuant to such \n     minimization procedures as the Court shall establish for \n     purposes of this clause.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is a provision that was \npart of the Judiciary Committee bill. It was included in a larger \nsubstitute amendment adopted in that committee that was sponsored by \nSenator Leahy and cosponsored by Senator Feinstein, Senator Schumer, \nand others.\n  This amendment puts no additional limits on the Government's ability \nto target people overseas under this legislation or to collect \ninformation about those people. All it does is help ensure that the \nGovernment's procedures follow the requirements that are laid out in \nthe bill. It fixes an enormous problem in the Intelligence Committee \nbill: the complete lack of any incentive for the Government to do what \nthe bill tells it to do, namely, target people overseas rather than \npeople in America.\n  There are many aspects of this bill that have generated strong \ndisagreement, but one thing on which everyone in this Chamber should \nagree is that the Government should not be using these authorities to \ntarget the conversations of innocent Americans in their homes and \noffices in the United States. For that, the Government should have to \nget an individualized court order, as it always has.\n  The bill requires the Attorney General, in consultation with the \nDirector of National Intelligence, to adopt targeting procedures that \nare reasonably designed to ensure that only people outside the United \nStates are targeted. The bill also requires the Attorney General, in \nconsultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to adopt \nminimization procedures to govern the retention and dissemination of \ninformation about Americans that is captured in the course of the \nsurveillance.\n  All of this sounds good. The targeting procedures, in particular, are \none of the few safeguards built into this legislation. Yet, remarkably, \nthe Intelligence Committee bill does nothing to ensure the Government \nwill follow them. They are basically non-binding. The FISA Court does \nnot have to approve the procedures before they are\n\n[[Page S578]]\n\nimplemented. If the Government develops procedures that target \nAmericans in this country, in violation of the law, the FISA Court can \nreject those procedures and require them to develop new ones but only \nafter those procedures have already been in effect.\n  The bill does nothing to stop the Government from continuing to use \nand share the information it collected under those illegal procedures. \nThink about that. The Government develops and implements procedures the \nFISA Court later finds out are not reasonably designed to target people \nwho are outside the United States, meaning the procedures likely permit \nthe targeting of Americans here at home--something we all agree should \nnot be permitted under this bill. Yet if the Government has been using \nthose unlawful procedures while the FISA Court reviews them, it can \nkeep and freely share any communications it gathered. In theory, the \nGovernment could play this game indefinitely, periodically revising its \nprocedures and all the while using and disseminating information that \nhas been illegally collected under prior procedures rejected by the \ncourt.\n  My amendment would solve this problem, at least in part, by allowing \nthe FISA Court to put limits on the use of information about Americans \nthe Government has gathered using procedures the court later finds do \nnot comply with the requirements of this legislation.\n  These types of use limitations are not a new concept. Indeed, they \nare borrowed from another part of FISA. Under current law, if the \nGovernment in an emergency starts surveillance of an American without a \ncourt order and the court later determines the surveillance was not \nlawful, FISA places limits on how the Government can use that \nunlawfully gathered information. It is simple common sense: If the \nGovernment wasn't supposed to obtain this information under the law, \nthen the Government shouldn't be permitted to use this information \nexcept in a true emergency. Otherwise, the limit on obtaining the \ninformation in the first place isn't worth the paper it is printed on--\nit's just there for show.\n  This amendment adopts the same basic idea, but with significantly \nmore leeway for the Government. Under the amendment, if the Government \ncollects information using unlawful procedures, the default is that the \nGovernment may only use the information regarding U.S. persons--namely, \nthe information the Government was never supposed to collect in the \nfirst place--in an emergency involving a threat of death or serious \nbodily harm to any person. But the Government can continue to freely \nuse information collected on foreign persons.\n  The amendment also provides significant additional flexibility. It \ngives the FISA Court discretion to allow the Government to use even \ninformation about U.S. persons--information collected illegally--as \nlong as the Government ultimately fixes the defective procedures. That \nis a very broad exception to the use limitation, but importantly, it is \nan exception that is overseen and applied by the FISA Court.\n  This is the bare minimum we could possibly do to encourage the \nGovernment to adopt and adhere to lawful targeting and minimization \nprocedures in the first place. The practical effect of this amendment \nis simply to give the FISA Court the option of prohibiting the use of \ninformation about U.S. persons obtained illegally--in violation of the \nvery act we are debating. Given the FISA Court's history of \noverwhelming deference to the executive branch, it is quite clear the \ncourt will exercise this option, if ever, only in the most egregious \ncases of Government excess or abuse. And as I said before, the \nGovernment will always have the ability to use information about \nforeign persons and any information that indicates a threat of death or \nserious bodily harm.\n  Just to be clear, no one is talking about holding the Government to a \nstandard of perfection. The bill we are debating does not require the \nGovernment to develop procedures that ensure that in every instance, \nonly people overseas are targeted. Instead, it requires the Government \nto develop procedures that are reasonably designed to target people who \nare reasonably believed to be outside the United States. So the use \nlimitation I am proposing would come into play only if several things \nhappen: First, the Government failed to get court clearance for its \nprocedures before implementing them; second, the procedures were not \neven reasonably designed to meet the modest goal of targeting people \nreasonably believed to be overseas; third, the Government failed to \ncorrect the problem when given a chance to do so, or the FISA Court \ndecides not to allow the use of the illegally collected information \ndespite the procedures being fixed; fourth, the information involves a \nU.S. person; and fifth, the information does not indicate a threat of \ndeath or serious bodily harm. All these things have to be true in order \nfor there to be any limitation here at all.\n  This is an extremely modest safeguard against unlawful procedures and \none that gives the Government ample leeway to develop sound targeting \nprocedures while simultaneously getting and using the information it \nneeds.\n  It comes down to a very simple question: Do we mean what we say when \nwe declare that Americans in this country should not be targeted under \nthe powers we are giving the Government in this legislation? If we do \nmean what we say, we should have no problem saying that the use of \ninformation obtained through procedures that target Americans can be \nblocked by the FISA Court, since that information should never have \nbeen obtained in the first place. If we don't say that, then the \ntargeting and minimization requirements are really just suggestions, \nand the supporters of the bill are not serious when they say they only \nwant to go after foreigners overseas.\n  This amendment is based on a commonsense provision that already \nexists in FISA, with significant additional flexibility for the \nGovernment. It gives the Government a modest incentive to comply with \nthe law, without taking away any of the legitimate tools it needs to \nrespond to foreign threats. And it was already adopted by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise in opposition to another amendment \nthat has been argued very strongly on the other side but which would \nimpose additional operational burdens and limit the ability of our \ncollective agencies in the intelligence community to get the \ninformation they need and to be able to use it to keep our country \nsafe.\n  We have gone through all of these, and we have worked to develop much \ngreater protections for American citizens. One of the protections the \nAmerican citizens seek from us is the protection from foreign attack \nand terrorist attack. If we hamstring our intelligence community--as \nthey were hamstrung under the new techniques under the old FISA law--\nyou will find out we cannot collect the information we need. This \nburden--this superexclusionary rule--goes far beyond what is necessary \nto protect American citizens.\n  While supporters of the amendment may argue that a similar rule \nappears elsewhere in FISA, it is important to remember that rule is \nlimited to individual domestic surveillance and searches, where the \ncourt has found there is no probable cause to target that person. That \nis very different and is a very important protection for Americans from \nsearches and seizures and surveillance without a court order--not a \nproperly developed court order.\n  This amendment tries to apply that same rule to foreign targeting, \nwhen there may be a deficiency identified in the targeting or \nminimization procedures. Applying an exclusionary rule in the context \nof a domestic surveillance involving a small number of targets is \nmanageable and it must be done to protect Americans. It makes no sense \nif there is no finding of probable cause. That is the threshold under \nwhich that rule applies. But it makes no sense to exclude the use of \ninformation simply because there is a deficiency--any deficiency--in \nthe certification or procedures used to target foreign terrorists \noverseas. That is whom we are talking about; that is the overwhelming \namount of the collection--against foreign targets, foreign terrorists, \nand others with weapons of mass destruction plans or proliferation or \nforeign powers. It makes no sense to say a deficiency, which can be \ncorrected, should\n\n[[Page S579]]\n\nrequire all the information collected to be suppressed.\n  For example, this automatic suppression rule would make the \nGovernment temporarily sequester significant amounts of data, \npotentially, that might contain vital foreign intelligence \ninformation--obviously, there is a qualification--but not amount to \ninformation that indicates a threat of death or serious bodily injury \nduring a period of time when the Government is attempting to correct a \nrelatively minor or inadvertent deficiency.\n  That is unreasonable, and it is one more administrative burden to \nplace on the intelligence community. Moreover, the Intelligence \nCommittee's bill already provides an adequate remedy if the FISA Court \nultimately determines that the collection is improper; it may order the \nGovernment to cease collection.\n  The court then has the inherent authority to fashion an appropriate \nremedy to address the collection and the contents that have been \ncollected in a manner inconsistent with the law and the authorities of \nthe collecting agency.\n  This amendment does not fix a problem with the statute. Instead, it \npotentially creates a problem that could have unintended operational \nconsequences for our intelligence community. They don't need any more \nburdens. They have all the challenges they need in trying to intercept, \ntranslate, incorporate, and divine the intents of terrorists. There is \nmore than enough work to do for our intelligence analysts just to stay \nwithin the existing boundaries we have applied in the protection for \nAmerican citizens, without them having to fear we will lose vital \nforeign intelligence collection information because there was some \nminor deficiency that may later be identified by the court. That would \nmake our country less safe and it is not warranted.\n  Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting against \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague, the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Senator Feingold's amendment concerns the effects of \na court determination that there are deficiencies in the Government's \nprocedures under the new authority. This is a complicated issue and I \nthink it is important to explain why I cannot support this amendment.\n  I wish to add that what the vice chairman and I both believe all of \nthis is going to be litigated in the courts for decades to come, and \nall that is said here by us and everybody else becomes an important \npart of the record.\n  Under the Intelligence Committee bill, the FISA Court is required to \nreview the Government's certification, targeting procedures, and \nminimization procedures to ensure their adequacy. If the court finds a \ndeficiency in either the minimization or targeting procedures, the \nIntelligence Committee bill requires the Government correct the \ndeficiency or cease the acquisition.\n  The Feingold amendment goes beyond requiring that collection be \nterminated or deficiencies corrected. It restricts the use or \ndisclosure of any information collected that concerns U.S. persons.\n  Unless the Attorney General determines the information indicates a \nthreat of death or serious bodily harm or the person consents, the \namendment would prevent the Government from sharing or disseminating \nwith anyone in the Federal Government any information already acquired \nunder the new procedure that concerns U.S. persons.\n  I can understand that there may be, at first glance, some appeal to \nthat idea. Senator Feingold, for example, has said it is important to \nensure there are consequences when the Government has not adequately \ndeveloped its procedures. Hard to argue.\n  But looking at the consequences of this amendment in more detail \nmakes it clear the provision is impractical. And it creates serious \nrisks that we will lose valuable intelligence.\n  The language of the Senator's amendment is taken from the emergency \nprovisions currently in FISA. Under those provisions, the Attorney \nGeneral can authorize electronic surveillance without a court order in \nan emergency, as long as an application for an order is submitted to \nthe court within 72 hours. If a court does not approve the FISA \ncollection on an individual target after this emergency intelligence \ncollection has begun, FISA prevents the intelligence collected from \nbeing ``used or disclosed in any . . . manner by Federal officers or \nemployees without the consent of such persons,'' unless the Attorney \nGeneral determines the information indicates a threat of death or \nserious bodily harm.\n  The impact of this existing emergency provision in FISA, however, is \nfar different than the impact of Senator Feingold's amendment.\n  In contrast to limiting the use of a small amount of information \ncollected on one target during 72 hours of emergency procedures, \nSenator Feingold's amendment potentially limits use of all information \ngathered through a new system of intelligence collection. To understand \nwhy these are different situations, it is useful to consider the \ndifference between traditional FISA applications and orders and the new \ntitle VII provisions.\n  Unlike traditional FISA applications and orders, which involve \ncollection on one individual target, the new FISA provisions create a \nsystem of collection. The court's role in this system of collection is \nnot to consider probable cause on individual targets but to ensure that \nthe procedures used to collect intelligence are adequate. The court's \ndetermination of the adequacy of procedures, therefore, impacts all \nelectronic communications gathered under the new mechanism, even if it \ninvolves thousands of targets. I will repeat that.\n  Senator Feingold's amendment applies to all of this intelligence \ncollection. If the court finds a deficiency that the Government does \nnot correct within 30 days, the Federal Government could not disclose \nany information on U.S. persons that was gathered as part of the new \nintelligence collection system without the consent of the person.\n  Thus, unlike existing emergency procedures, which limit the use of a \nsmall amount of intelligence gathered over a 72-hour period on one \ntarget, Senator Feingold's amendment would potentially restrict the use \nof large amounts of intelligence, without regard to the importance of \nthe intelligence.\n  In addition, under the Feingold amendment, intelligence analysts \nwould have to determine whether the collected intelligence contained \ninformation concerning U.S. persons. The Feingold amendment would \nrequire the intelligence analysts to sift through all of the \nintelligence collected under the new process in order to identify \ninformation potentially subject to restriction.\n  As part of that process, analysts might be required to look at \ninformation that had not previously been analyzed in detail because it \ndid not appear to contain significant foreign intelligence information, \nin order to determine whether the information concerned U.S. persons.\n  Senator Feingold's amendment, therefore, has the potential to be more \nintrusive of U.S. privacy interests than the initial collection.\n  Finally, this limitation on use applies regardless of what deficiency \nis found by the court, as long as the deficiency is not corrected \nwithin 30 days. Even if the court finds a minor deficiency in the \nprocedures and the Government is acting in good faith to correct it, \nthis provision would require the intelligence community to prevent any \ndisclosure of the information.\n  Please consider that, Madam President--to share with nobody in the \nGovernment.\n  In sum, this provision could restrict the use of significant amounts \nof intelligence based solely on minor deficiencies in procedures. It \nmay also require the intelligence community to focus its analytical \nresources on satisfying this provision rather than on collecting and \nanalyzing the intelligence needed to protect this country.\n  In my view, this allocation of resources makes no sense. I therefore \ncannot support this amendment.\n  I reserve the remaining time, which is about 4 minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, let me agree with the Chair that it is \nimportant to clarify what these amendments do and do not do, not only \nfor purposes of voting on the amendment, but for any court \nconsideration of this issue.\n\n[[Page S580]]\n\n  The arguments of the chairman and ranking member do not relate, in \nmany cases, to the amendment that has been put forward. The Senator \nfrom Missouri just made the argument that my amendment differs from the \nuse limit provisions for emergency surveillance because my amendment \nwould limit the use of information about foreign targets. But that is \nnot true. That is not the amendment I offered. My amendment only puts \nlimits on information about U.S. persons. The Government can always use \ninformation about foreign persons.\n  With regard to the comments of the Chair of the committee, the \nsupposed burden of identifying which communications involved U.S. \npersons only comes up if the Government starts its targeting procedures \nbefore it gets court approval, and then fails to keep track of what it \nis collecting during that time. And it only comes up if the Government \nprocedures are targeting Americans in the United States, in which case \nI think there are overwhelming policy and constitutional reasons why \nthis information needs to be retrieved and its use limited.\n  Moreover, if the intelligence community is concerned about this \npotential burden, it can do what it says it already does with \ninformation gathered using the PAA, and that is to label it. Then it \nshouldn't have any problem finding it later on; it shouldn't be \ncumbersome.\n  The arguments of the chairman and ranking member would yield the \nfollowing result: We set up rules for the Government, the Government \ndoesn't follow the rules, and there is simply no consequence at all. \nThe law has no teeth. There is no incentive for the Government to \nfollow the rules.\n  Again, under my amendment, the Government can use information even \nabout U.S. persons if it indicates a threat of death and serious bodily \nharm, and the FISA Court can allow the Government to use any \ninformation if the Government fixes the defective procedures. On that \npoint, I am very troubled by the arguments of the Senator from \nMissouri. He says that my amendment will not even allow the Government \nto fix the problem with its procedures. That is absolutely false. I \nspecifically stated that the Government is given an opportunity to fix \nthe problem. If it fixes the problem, the FISA Court can allow it to \nuse the information.\n  If the Government gets a complete free pass and faces no consequence \nwhatsoever for adopting and implementing unlawful procedures, then the \nlaw's requirements for targeting and minimization procedures and the \nFISA Court's oversight of these procedures have no meaning. The \nGovernment would be allowed to intrude on the private conversations of \nAmericans with no consequences.\n  This amendment contains a very modest series of provisions. It gives \nthe court and the Government tremendous flexibility. If the Government \nmakes even a reasonable effort to address the concerns of the FISA \nCourt, there will be no disruption of the information the Government \nneeds--and, of course, none is intended.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, in two sentences, thousands of \ntargets in the Senator's amendment, thousands of targets, all foreign \nmeans hundreds or thousands of pieces of intelligence. Intelligence \ndoes not come as one lump. It is an enormous array of collection of all \nkinds of things which are stitched together over time. All that \nintelligence could be lost under the Feingold amendment if there were \nonly U.S. person information that was involved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, in response to the Senator from West \nVirginia, it is true that the use limits in my amendment would apply to \nany information about U.S. persons gathered under unlawful procedures, \nother than information indicating a threat of bodily harm. That is why \nthe amendment provides significantly more flexibility to the Government \nthan the use limits for emergency surveillance. The FISA Court can \nallow the Government to use even information about U.S. persons as long \nas the Government corrects the defective procedures. That is a huge \nexception that is not present in the emergency use limits provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, the Senate is \noperating under a previous order for 5:20 p.m.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S580-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S580-S596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF \n                        2008--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. is to be divided between the two leaders or their designees, with \nthe Republican leader controlling the first 5 minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Book of Proverbs teaches:\n\n       Listen to your father, who gave you life, and do not \n     despise your mother when she is old.\n\n  This afternoon, the Senate will begin to address whether we honor our \nmothers and fathers, our grandmothers and grandfathers. The Senate will \nbegin to address whether we extend needed stimulus checks to 20 million \nseniors whom the House of Representatives left behind.\n  The author Pearl S. Buck said:\n\n       Our society must make it . . . possible for old people not \n     to fear the young or be deserted by them, for the test of a \n     civilization is the way that it cares for its helpless \n     members.\n\n  This afternoon, the Senate will begin to be tested. The Senate will \nbe tested whether it cares for 20 million seniors or deserts them, as \ndid the House of Representatives.\n  America's seniors deserve to get stimulus checks every bit as much as \nother Americans. They worked hard, very hard all their lives. They paid \na lifetime of taxes. They contribute to the economy. And with the \neconomy turning down, seniors can use the stimulus checks every bit as \nmuch as other Americans. Everyone knows the Social Security check does \nnot pay the bills. The average retiree's Social Security check is about \n$1,000 a month, and with the current hard times and gas, food, and \nhealth care costs all increasing, it makes it even more difficult for \nthem.\n  Two out of three Social Security beneficiaries get most of their \nincome from Social Security. Two out of three get most of their income \nfrom Social Security. Social Security is the only income for nearly one \nin five seniors, and without Social Security, most older Americans \nwould live in poverty. Without Social Security, more than 50 percent of \nsenior citizens would be living in poverty today.\n  Because they can use the money, seniors are excellent targets for \neconomic stimulus checks. Because they can use the money, they will \nspend it quickly.\n  The chart I have next to me is a reminder that the Senate bill \nprovides rebate checks for 20 million Americans. The House of \nRepresentatives excludes rebate checks for these 20 million Americans.\n  Americans over age 65 spend 92 percent of their incomes. Households \nheaded by a person over age 75 spend 98 percent of their income. That \nis higher than any other demographic group over the age of 25. Seniors \nspend their money. That means checks sent to seniors will have a \ngreater bang for the buck in terms of helping the economy. The Finance \nCommittee amendment will help 20 million seniors left out of the House \nbill. The Finance Committee amendment will provide seniors with rebate \nchecks of $500, and the House bill will not help those 20 million \nseniors.\n  The Finance Committee amendment will also provide rebate checks for a \nquarter of a million disabled veterans who receive at least $3,000 in \nnontaxable disability income. The Finance Committee amendment would \nmake them eligible to receive the same rebate checks as wage earners \nand Social Security recipients. It is not right to\n\n[[Page S581]]\n\nexclude 250,000 disabled veterans from getting a rebate check, which is \nwhat happened under the House bill. Those folks will get rebate checks \nunder the Senate bill and the Veterans' Administration will distribute \nthe rebates. The House bill, again, does not provide disabled veterans \nwho don't pay taxes with rebate checks.\n  The Finance Committee amendment would provide an additional 13 weeks \nof unemployment insurance, and high unemployment States will qualify \nfor an extra 13 weeks. The House bill does not provide an extension of \nunemployment insurance, whether it is 13 or the extra.\n  Almost a million more Americans are unemployed today than there were \na year ago. One million more are unemployed today than a year ago, and \n69,000 additional unemployed workers filed claims last week.\n  The Finance Committee amendment has been endorsed by AARP, the \nSeniors Coalition, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Military Officers \nAssociation of American, Vietnam Veterans of America, the American \nLegion, the United Spinal Association, and the Disabled American \nVeterans.\n  Again, seniors groups and disabled groups strongly endorse the \nFinance Committee amendment, clearly because they get benefits.\n  Let us listen to our fathers who gave us life and not despise our \nmothers. Let us not desert our seniors or disabled veterans or \nunemployment workers. Let us move to proceed to the stimulus bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 566, H.R. 5140, \n     the economic stimulus bill.\n         Max Baucus, John D.

On this vote, the yeas are 80, the nays are 4. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have been told by the Republican leader \nwhat to me is incredible. We have two issues this week, among others, \nthat we need to complete. One is the stimulus package, and the other is \nFISA. They are not in order of importance, but they are both issues we \nneed to complete. I have been told we are not going to do anything. \nThat is why I had to have the vote called before 6 o'clock. The 30 \nhours will run out a few minutes after midnight tomorrow night.\n  Now, they are going to waste 30 hours of the people's time on \nnothing. They will not allow us to work on FISA to complete it. The \nPresident said he is not going to extend it any more than one time for \n15 days. We wanted to finish this piece of legislation. They are not \nallowing us to work on it.\n  On the stimulus package, the President told us last Saturday in his \nradio address: We need to have Congress complete this.\n  We are trying. We are trying, but we are told now that, no, we cannot \ndo this. We need the 30 hours postcloture.\n\n  I hope everyone can understand what we are trying to accomplish. We \nare trying to accomplish the work on the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act that the President said he so badly needs. We are \ntrying to complete the stimulus package the President so badly needs. \nWe have the House bill. We just voted to proceed on that. Now we are \ngoing to use the 30 hours postcloture, which, to me, is something that \nis difficult to comprehend.\n  But, of course, why should we be surprised? Last year, the \nRepublicans filibustered 64 times--64 times--wasting the people's time, \nbreaking all records. They broke the 2-year record in 1 year in the \nnumber of filibusters. But here we are starting again--the same thing. \nRather than legislate, maybe they are afraid these votes that have been \nworked out on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--maybe they are \nafraid some of them will pass, or maybe on the stimulus package, the \nFinance Committee package that we have, which is tremendous.\n  What does it do? It includes 21.5 million seniors who are not in the \npackage we got from the House, 250,000 disabled American veterans who \nare covered. Unemployment benefits are extended. People who have been \nout of work for 13 weeks or more will get additional unemployment \nbenefits. That is in the package that was brought to us on a bipartisan \nbasis by Senators Baucus and Grassley.\n  In addition to that, we have provisions in this bill that are so \nimportant to our staggering economy. The homebuilders are in town. They \nare running ads on television. They are visiting Republican offices \ntomorrow to say: Vote for this. They need it because it has a tax \nprovision in there, a loss carryover that will allow them to continue \nbuilding homes, getting people in homes. It is so very important we do \nthis.\n  As I told the Republican leader, we are also going to add something \nthat was not in the Finance package that will allow people who have no \nmoney, the so-called LIHEAP people, who do not have the money to pay \ntheir heating bills--they have to make a choice\n\n[[Page S582]]\n\non whether they are going to have warm houses, whether they are going \nto be able to get their drug prescription filled, or whether they are \ngoing to be able to buy some groceries this year. We have money that \nwill help, and it will go right into the economy. Everything I have \ntalked about will stimulate the economy. Are the Republicans afraid \nthat we will bring this matter to the floor, and it will pass? Because \nit certainly should pass. Economists up and down the line--\nconservatives, liberals, moderates--say this is what is needed.\n  We are not complaining about the House package. It was a good first \nstep, and we appreciate what they sent us. But it is a first step. And \nshouldn't we be legislating here rather than stalling for time for fear \nsomebody is going to have to take a tough vote either on the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act or on the stimulus package?\n  We are ready to work, as we were all last year. We were at a \ndisadvantage early in the year. Of course we were, because Tim Johnson \nwas sick. He is not sick now. He walks into this Chamber like any other \nof the 99, and he is ready to work as many hours as we have to work. \nBut now we have a majority, 51 to 49, not 50-49 anymore.\n  On the package we are going to vote on, whether they make us wait \nuntil Thursday or Wednesday, whenever it is, we are asking nine \nRepublicans of good will to vote with the American people and pass this \nstimulus package.\n  I have said before--this morning--this matter has to go to conference \nanyway. We are not slowing up or stalling anything. It has to go to a \nconference because this House package allows benefits to go to people \nwho are undocumented, and that should be changed.\n  I am dismayed we are going to have to stay in session tonight and do \nnothing and all day tomorrow and do nothing. But that is what I have \nbeen told. And I think it is incredulous, amazing, and not very good \nfor the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if we ended up doing nothing tomorrow, \nthat would be like last Tuesday, last Wednesday, and last Thursday, in \nwhich we could never get a vote. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday we \ncould not get a vote because we could not get an agreement on the FISA \nbill.\n  Finally, last Thursday night, we get an agreement on the FISA bill, \nand the majority leader tells me he will give us the paper--in other \nwords, what he wishes to bring up on this stimulus package--last \nThursday night. In addition, last Thursday, he says if that is \ndefeated, of course, we will amend the House bill. Neither of those \nthings apparently is going to happen.\n  No. 1, we got a few moments ago the version of the Senate Finance \nCommittee package that the majority leader wants to call up. We wish to \nread it. It is a fairly extensive package. Secondly, apparently it is \nno longer the case that if this package is not approved that we will \namend the House bill. We all know the House bill needs to go back \nbecause it needs to be fixed because of the illegal immigration \nproblem.\n  The majority leader has been arguing all along that the House bill \nwas inadequate. So it would make no sense at all, if whatever the final \nversion of the Finance Committee provision is not approved, why we \nwould not want to add seniors and veterans and fix the immigration \nproblem to the House bill.\n  There is a certain amount of spin in politics, but this is beyond \nspin. These are the facts. Three days last week--Tuesday, Wednesday, \nand Thursday--there were no votes on FISA because we could not get an \nagreement. Finally, on Thursday, we get an agreement on the FISA \namendments, and the majority leader tells me he is going to give us the \npaper on what he is going to bring up on the stimulus. We got it a few \nmoments ago. It is not unreasonable for the minority to read the \nproposal. To suggest from that it is a certainty we will not have \nanything voted on tomorrow, I would suggest to my good friend, the \nmajority leader, is nonsense. We will insist on reading it. It is in \nthe process of being read now. When we read it, we will be happy to \ncommunicate further with the distinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to show the absolutely dilatory tactics of \nthis Republican minority, think about last week. My friend, the \nRepublican leader, said we did not have votes last week. Why didn't we \nhave votes last week? They would not let us have votes.\n\n  During the time that Rockefeller, Leahy, Bond, and Specter were \ntrying to work something out on FISA, we wanted to finish Indian \nhealth. No, you can't do it. You can't do Indian health. Indians can \nwait another 6 years. They have waited 6 or 7 years during this \nadministration. What is another few weeks for the Indians? They, \naccording to the Republicans, don't matter that much anyway, as they \nhave been treated like--the worst health care we have in America today \nis on our Indian reservations, and the Republicans don't seem to be at \nall concerned about that. So Senator Dorgan brought a bill to the \nfloor, and we have been rocked and socked and pushed and pulled. We \ncan't do that either.\n  The other thing we could have done last week--of course, we have an \nagreement to do a package that has been held up by the Republicans for \na year dealing with bills that are some 45 in number--energy bills--\nthat usually are handled just like that, in wrapup. Oh, no, not now, \nnot with this Republican minority, we do not do them.\n  I suggested we go to those last week. No. Work out FISA, the \nPresident's favorite, his ability to spy. That is what he wants. The \nproblem is that he wants to do it not in keeping with the Constitution, \nwhich raises some concern with us and the American people.\n  So, no, we could not do anything on Indian health, we could not do it \non the energy package, until we got an agreement on FISA. It is obvious \nwhat is being done here. The Republicans are trying on FISA to do what \nthey did last August. Even though the President has been forced to \nextend this for 15 days, they now want to do what they did in August: \nStall it until the last day so we are forced to do something here and \nsend it to the House so the House has no time to do anything about it.\n  The House has passed something. What we want to do--what we think is \ngood government--is pass the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and \ndo it quickly so the House and the Senate--Democrats and Republicans--\nhave an opportunity to work together to come up with something to give \nto the President that is not 1 minute before midnight on the last day \nof that legislation.\n  It is not as if this picture has not been seen before. This is the \nsame picture we had to deal with all last year--all last year. Every \ninch we have been able to grind out has been tough because there has \nbeen a stall that has been ongoing with this White House and this \nRepublican minority.\n  For 6 years, Congress was ignored by this President--ignored. There \nwas not--in his mind, there was not a legislative branch of Government. \nHe did not have to deal with it because the Republicans in the House \nand the Senate gave him anything he wanted. Why wasn't there a veto? \nBecause there was nothing to veto. He got everything he wanted.\n  Last year, suddenly some people in the White House, at least, came to \nthe realization that there was another branch of Government that the \nFounding Fathers put in the Constitution. So last year they were forced \nto realize that there was a legislative branch of Government. We had to \nprove to the President that we were part of the process. We were able \nto get some things done, but it was difficult, and we had 64 \nfilibusters to overcome. I would have thought this year would be a \nlittle different. We have a Presidential election. We have many Senate \nseats that are up. I would think the Republicans would like to get \nsomething done this year. I would have thought this continual stalling \nthat is going on might reflect on these elections we are going to have \nnext November, that maybe there would be a new day in Washington, that \nthe Republicans are used to being in the minority and would try to work \nwith us on a bipartisan basis to get some things done. But it does not \nappear that is the way it is going to be. If that is the way it is \ngoing to be, that is the way it is going to be, and we will continue to \nwork around their dilatory tactics.\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have before us--last week and this \nweek--two measures that are overwhelmingly bipartisan. We have a FISA \nproposal--Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act proposal--we tried \nrepeatedly last week to get some votes on, and to no avail. That came \nout of the Intelligence Committee 13 to 2--the Rockefeller-Bond bill--\noverwhelmingly bipartisan, which would be signed by the President. That \nwould be a significant accomplishment on a very important issue to the \nAmerican people.\n  With regard to the stimulus, the American people witnessed something \nthey rarely see. They saw the Speaker of the House--a Democrat--the \nleader of the House Republicans, and the Secretary of the Treasury have \na joint press conference among the three of them, indicating they had \nan agreement on a stimulus package that we could pass rapidly.\n  Senate Republicans have been prepared to do that. It came over to us \nJanuary 29. The majority leader felt that the Senate Finance Committee \nneeded to reconvene and do it a different way.\n  This was a situation where you had the Democratic leader of the \nHouse, the Republican leader of the House, the Republican leader of the \nSenate, and the President of the United States all on the same side. \nThat is pretty close to bipartisan. But, no, my good friend, the \nmajority leader, said the Senate needed to do it differently, in spite \nof the fact that everyone was saying the two most important things to \ndo with regard to a stimulus package were to keep it targeted and do it \nquickly. We had an opportunity to do that. We may have an opportunity \nto do it again. But make no mistake about it, no amount of finger-\npointing or no suggesting that just because you file cloture motions, \nthat amounts to a filibuster. Nobody believes that. You can't just run \naround routinely filing cloture motions on everything and then claim \nthere are filibusters going on.\n\n  In fact, the message from the last session was: When you meet in the \nmiddle, you get things done. It finally happened in December: an \nomnibus spending package that met the President's top line, $70 billion \nfor Iraq and Afghanistan without strings attached, an AMT without \nraising taxes on anybody else, and an energy bill that neither raised \ntaxes nor raised rates in the Southeast. All of that was accomplished \nat the end by meeting in the middle.\n  Now, in spite of all of this back-and-forth between my good friend, \nthe majority leader, and myself, we are pretty close on these two \nissues as well. The American people are expecting us to cooperate. But \nI repeat: We are going to read the proposal which we got some 15 \nminutes ago. I don't think anybody in America would think that is an \nunreasonable request. When we get through reading the new stimulus \nproposal, which I was told we would get last Thursday night, we will \nrespond to my good friend, the majority leader, and we will see how we \ncan go forward to accomplish two important things for the country. In \nthe end, they will be done and must be done on an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to show you, with all due respect, how \nshallow this statement just made by my friend is, let me just say this: \nIt is a public record, what came out of the Senate Finance Committee. \nIt is a public record. You can read it on the Internet, what is in the \nstimulus bill. It came out days ago--days ago--not Monday, not today, \nbut days ago. Last week, it was reported out. I believe it was on a \nWednesday that it came out. I told my friend that we added LIHEAP to \nit. One reason I added it is because the Republicans want LIHEAP. \nRepublicans want it. Why not have a chance to vote on it? So to talk \nabout: We want a chance to read this bill--this is really something.\n  I cannot take any more lectures on the bipartisan nature of the \nIntelligence bill because it was referred at the same time to the \nIntelligence Committee and to the Judiciary Committee. That is the way \nit is sometimes around here. There are joint referrals.\n  Now, I admire people who have had us take a close look at what is \ngoing on with spying in this country, OK? Senator Feingold and Senator \nDodd are the leading advocates of taking a look at this bill. Are they \nsaying we are not going to have a bill? No, they are not saying that, \nbut they are saying it needs to be improved. So, yes, it came out of \nthe Intelligence Committee on a bipartisan basis, and that is good, but \nthe Judiciary Committee wanted to put their stamp on it, and they did, \nand big time. A number of the amendments that were offered today and \nwill be offered whenever we have the ability to go back to the bill are \nmeasures that came from the Judiciary Committee.\n  We want to work to get things done, but we don't need excuses such \nas: We need to read the proposal--30 hours to read the proposal, and in \nthe meantime we are doing nothing.\n  Last week, I repeat, we had a lot of we could have done. We were \nprevented from doing that while this very difficult agreement was \nreached on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  Mr. President, let me just say this: People around here in the \nSenate, in the country, know me by now. I pretty much call things the \nway I see them. Sometimes I need to step back a little bit and look at \nhow I see them.\n  I want to say to my friend, my friend from Kentucky, the word \n``shallow'' was improperly descriptive. So I will have that stricken \nfrom the record and insert therein--let's see, what word? Something \nthat I didn't agree with, OK?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend, the majority leader. It is, it \nseems to me, possible to have a civil and spirited debate without \nviolating rule XIX, and I appreciate his withdrawing that comment.\n  I see the Republican whip is here on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader has the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It looks as if I may lose the floor, so I wonder if \nthe Senator from Arizona has a question.\n  Mr. KYL. I do have a question. This is why I was trying to get the \nattention of the minority leader just a moment ago.\n  I am on the Finance Committee, and I am very familiar with the \nFinance Committee bill. Now, I am certain the majority leader did not \nmean to suggest that the proposal we were just handed is, in fact, a \nbill that passed the Finance Committee. It is more than that, is it \nnot?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. It is my understanding--again, we just got it 15 \nminutes ago. In response to the question of the Republican whip, we are \nnot sure what is in it, but our impression is that it may not be what \ncame out of the Finance Committee last Thursday.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could ask just one more question, I just asked my \nstaff. I haven't had a chance to read it yet. My staff has begun to \nlook at it. I would simply represent what my staff said, which is the \nfirst thing they noticed is that there is an additional $1 billion--$1 \nbillion in spending on a program called LIHEAP. Is the minority leader \naware of that yet?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No, I didn't know because I haven't had a chance to \nlook at it yet, but that would make it somewhat different from the \nFinance Committee bill, I gather.\n  Mr. KYL. It would, indeed.\n  The majority leader would like to comment.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I said starting at 2 o'clock this afternoon and every \nchance I get that we added that, they didn't add it. I added it to the \nFinance Committee. I told the Republican staff, I told my friend this \nafternoon when we first--the first time we visited that LIHEAP had been \nadded.\n  Mr. KYL. And there are some additional changes from the Finance \nCommittee version as well; is that not true?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, there are some minor changes, but I say to my friend, \nwho is a member of the Finance Committee, that we have made some \nchanges, but they are very minor, other than the LIHEAP matter.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am not sure who has the floor, Mr. President. Do I \nstill have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield the floor as I see there are \nothers who wish to speak.\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have been trying to get to the floor \nsince this morning--well, actually, since we came into session at 2 \no'clock. We have had a very spirited debate about FISA, and now we have \ninvoked cloture on the stimulus package just to begin this debate. I \nalso want to add my voice of distress that we may be facing a slowdown \nhere on the stimulus package.\n\n  We are in a recession in California. This isn't a recession \n``maybe''; this is a recession in California. There are several States \nthat already have begun a recession, a real recession, including a \ncontraction in jobs, and a housing crisis that has hit our State.\n  We can't wait. When the minority leader, the Republican leader, says: \nOh, my goodness, LIHEAP was added to the package--of all people who \nunderstand this, it is the Presiding Officer. LIHEAP is a program that \nhas been around for a very long time, and it is low-income energy \nassistance. To express shock that this would be added to a stimulus \npackage or to say we need hours and hours of delay to study the impact \nof adding LIHEAP, it just strains credulity.\n  Would my leader like me to pause for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much my friend yielding to \nme.\n  Lost in all this debate about spending is I would hope everyone would \nunderstand that we always knew the stimulus debate would not be \ncompleted until Wednesday. That is when the vote will take place, at \nthe earliest, on the package that came from the Finance Committee. What \nis stunning to me is we will not be able to finish FISA prior to \nWednesday. We could start on that tonight. We have a number of \namendments. I wanted to vote on those tonight. Of course, all day \ntomorrow, we could finish FISA. We could finish it tomorrow.\n  I want to make sure the record is very clear that they can spend all \nthe time they want reading this amendment, which, by the way, doesn't \nadd anything to the bill other than what we have--what I said: It adds \nto it housing language from the House bill which everybody approves of, \nand it adds some money to pay for some IRS things but a little, tiny \nbit of money. Anybody who reads this could do it very quickly and \nsimply.\n  Why can't we work on FISA tomorrow? What would be wrong with that?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, would the leader yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am sorry. Would my friend from California yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, so you can ask a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  So if the minority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, came down and \nhe would give consent, we could go ahead and debate on FISA and \nactually finish it by tomorrow evening; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. The reason it was so amazing to me, what I heard, is \nthat postcloture people have 30 hours to basically stall for more time. \nI thought, why in the world wouldn't they let us finish FISA?\n  Now, everyone knows--and my Presidential candidates, when we had four \nand when we had two, have never missed an important vote. Obama and \nClinton will not miss this important vote we are going to have on the \nstimulus package, but I have to give them a day's notice to get here. \nWith what is happening here--and that is why I had to hurry and call \nthe vote before 6 o'clock, because the 30 hours runs out a couple of \nminutes before midnight tomorrow night. I have to file cloture \ntomorrow, which would be Tuesday, when we could have a cloture vote on \nthe Senate stimulus package. What a waste of time.\n  So I say to my friend from New York, the answer is yes. The \nRepublican leader only has to say: Well, let's go ahead and finish \nFISA, and we will decide what we are going to do after I read the \namendment. If they decide that they are going to continue with the 30 \nhours running and they are not going to let us file cloture until \ntomorrow rather than tonight, they have that right.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would my friend from California yield so I might pose \nanother question to the Democratic leader?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So in other words--I just want to understand this, Mr. \nPresident--the FISA bill--which the President and many on that side \nsaid we should hurry up on, we should move quickly, it is important--is \nreally what is at issue here. The whole debate about reading the \nstimulus bill, which we have heard from the minority leader and the \nminority whip, has no relevance for tomorrow, as the leader--our \nleader, the Democratic leader--has agreed we are not voting on it until \nWednesday. But really the focus is on whether we could vote on FISA--\nthis important bill which we need to get done quickly--and the minority \nis blocking that for no known reason.\n  Should the minority leader come to the floor within an hour and work \nit out and say that we could go forward on FISA, we could start voting \non FISA tonight and tomorrow and perhaps finish it?\n  Mr. REID. We would finish it tomorrow. The only thing that might hold \nit up is there are a couple of Senators who might want to speak for \nawhile, but that is OK. We have a unanimous consent agreement that \nlimits the number of amendments we are going to have on it, so we could \nfinish it tomorrow for sure.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague yield for one final question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am a little confused. Does the majority leader have \nany idea why the minority would want to be holding up FISA?\n  Mr. REID. I sure do, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. What would that be?\n  Mr. REID. There have been books written on this--books written on \nthis--how the President has circumvented the laws we pass to have his \nwiretapping, OK? Now, there is not a single Democratic Senator who \ndoesn't want to get the bad guys. We want to be able to do wiretapping \nso we can listen in on some of their evil conversations. But the \nPresident, you see, based on his past and how we have been treated \nhere, doesn't want this FISA bill to change in any manner except to \ngive them retroactive immunity; that is, to say to the phone companies: \nAll the things you have done, good, bad, or indifferent, the courts \ncan't look at it civilly. They can't look at it civilly. So the \nPresident wants to have that out of the way so that he can wait until \nthe last minute to not have all these amendments that Senator Feingold, \nSenator Dodd, Senator Leahy, Senator Feinstein, and others have offered \nto improve this legislation, to make it more in keeping with the \nConstitution. So, as I have indicated earlier, I say to my friend from \nNew York, they want to wait until the last minute. So that whatever we \ndo here, the House will have to accept.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from California and the majority \nleader for that. Now it all becomes clear what the minority is doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say, while my leadership team is \nhere, I have just gotten the 2 pages--actually, it is 1\\1/2\\ pages--of \nthe additional language on LIHEAP. The rest was taken verbatim from the \nHouse bill, which the President supports.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator had time to read that yet?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I read it while the Senator talked with Senator Schumer.\n  This is LIHEAP, a program that has been around for decades. This is \n$1 billion to help people pay for the expensive cost of heating their \nhomes. As I look at my friend, Senator Sanders, who is in the chair, \nwhat a champion of this program he is--to those in the Northeast in \nparticular.\n  I have to take the minority leader at his word. He says the reason he \nis holding everything up, he doesn't want to do any work--or do \nanything--because he must study this bill. If he were here now--of \ncourse, he is now gone, but Senator Kyl is here--I would say let's read \nthis together. This is easy, almost as easy as ``Jane and John took the \ndog for a walk.'' Yet, still, they come out here and are holding up the \nbusiness of the Senate and the country.\n  Mr. President, I say to my leaders, look, we can argue about how many \nangels dance on the head of a pin, but 20 million seniors are waiting \nfor this. They were left out of the President's and the House package.\n\n[[Page S585]]\n\n  I wish to say to my friend, Senator McConnell--and he is not here \nright now--that this matters. When he says the deal has been cut, that \nthe President agreed with the House, well, wait a minute, look at the \nConstitution. There is a Senate, there is a House, and there is a \nPresident. We work together. We work our will, they work theirs, and we \nget together and compromise.\n  Twenty million seniors were left out, and we are fixing that. What \nelse? We are also fixing the fact that they left out 250,000 disabled \nveterans. So why are we holding up work on something as simple as that? \nThe answer comes back in a very convoluted way. I just have to say to \nsomeone who represents a State that is in a recession--and I know the \nState of the Senator from Nevada is in a recession. Many States are in \na recession.\n  The President said we should act and we are not acting; we are not \nacting on FISA. Again, to respond, Senator Bond and Senator Rockefeller \nagree on how to fix the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Well, \ngood for them. But guess what. The Senate has to debate that and work \nits will.\n  Some people think the phone companies should have immunity. Some of \nus other folks think that if you give them immunity, you will never \nfind out who was spied on and how, why, and how long they were spied \non. We feel strongly. Is the minority suggesting that because two \nSenators agree, the rest of us are ``chopped liver,'' as my mother \nwould say?\n  This place is like ``Alice in Wonderland.'' Tonight, more than any \nother night, it is like ``Alice in Wonderland.'' You have a President \nwho is scared about the economy. He is begging us to act on the \nstimulus package, and we have intelligent Senators stand up--and they \nare very smart--on the floor saying: Oh my goodness, you added LIHEAP, \nand now, we are sorry, we are holding everything up. And then they said \nmaybe they won't. I hope they will not.\n  While I support, with every fiber of my body, the Senate package, it \nis just the start of what we need to do. Until we start paying \nattention to the needs of the American people and end the war in Iraq, \nwhich is stealing our treasure, both in our young men and women in \nuniform and our money, we will never get where we need to get.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Did the Senator know that before the night is out, I am \ngoing to come to the floor and ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nproceed, during the 30 hours they are going to try to use postcloture \non the motion to proceed to the House-passed stimulus package--that \nduring the 30 hours, we be able to proceed to work on the FISA \namendments? Is the Senator aware that I am going to do that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very glad the majority leader is going to do that \nbecause the President--not only is he pushing us to pass his version of \nthe stimulus package--and he is worried about it; he is scaring the \nAmerican people, saying if we don't have FISA done, terrible things \nwill happen. It is time to stop scaring the people and start protecting \nthe people. That is what we want to do. So I am going to support the \nleader's call to move to FISA.\n  I believe if we have a debate on the stimulus and we don't talk about \nthe biggest drain on our people--the Iraq war--we are missing the \nelephant in the room, because until we end this war once and for all \nand end this failed policy in Iraq, we are simply going to be dragged \ndown further and further into an abyss, where we don't have the funds \nwe need for the rest of the things we do, where our military is being \nstretched, and where we have no way out.\n  We actually have Republican candidates who are running for President \nsaying we might be in Iraq for a hundred years. I have been around \npolitics a long time--not quite a hundred years but for my adult \nlifetime. I have served with four Presidents from both parties. What an \nhonor to have served with all of them. But I have never, ever worked \nwith a President who didn't have a clue as to how to end a war he got \nus into--not a clue. I have never seen a President who hasn't given us \nsome idea of how a war will end. So we need to remove this weight from \naround our necks. If we don't, my future, your future, the future of \nour kids and grandkids is not going to be what it ought to be.\n\n  We are spending $10 billion a month in Iraq. That is $2.5 billion a \nweek and $357 million a day in Iraq. And the President and my \nRepublican colleagues say we cannot afford to extend the stimulus \npackage to include seniors and disabled veterans? Well, for the price \nof 1 month in Iraq, we can provide rebates to 20 million seniors who \nneed it the most. Let me say that again. For the price of 1 month in \nIraq, we can provide rebates to 20 million seniors who need it the \nmost.\n  I hope the senior citizens within the sound of my voice have already \ncontacted us to tell us to cover them in this recovery package. They \nare the ones who really need it the most because they are living on a \nfixed income and they are struggling. Some of them have to cut their \npills in half every day they have to take them to stay alive so they \ncan stretch their medicine.\n  Well, the President and my Republican colleagues say we cannot afford \nto extend the stimulus package to include disabled veterans. That is \nwhy we have these charts made up here: 250,000 disabled veterans. I \nhope they are also calling. These are the folks who should be honored, \nloved, appreciated, but not just with words but by deeds.\n  Mr. President, I will tell you, for less than the cost of 1 day in \nIraq, we can provide rebates to 250,000 disabled veterans--1 day in \nIraq. We can take care of our veterans.\n  That is why we don't know why this stalling is going on. What about \nour kids? For less than the cost of 3 months in Iraq, we can enroll \nevery eligible child in the Head Start Program and give them the start \nthey deserve. For the cost of 2 weeks in Iraq, we can provide health \ninsurance for 6 million uninsured children in the United States for a \nyear. The list goes on and on.\n  Last year, in the name of budget austerity, the President vetoed \nchildren's health care. But he has an open checkbook for Iraq. He puts \nit straight on the debt. He vetoed critical investments in our \ninfrastructure.\n  Mr. President, the occupant of the chair helped me when we worked \ntogether on the Environment Committee with Senator Inhofe. We overrode \na veto because the President said: Sorry, we are rebuilding in Iraq. \nBut we cannot afford to fix our infrastructure here in America. The \nPresident vetoed education spending and health research.\n  I don't know about my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but \nwhen I talk to families, they are very scared now about a lot of \nthings. One of those things is, is someone getting cancer or getting \nAlzheimer's, or is a child getting autism, and there are a lot of other \nfears. They are real fears because they hit millions of our families. \nBut the President vetoed the bill that had that health research money \nin it. We were forced to cut back.\n  So where are we now? We are spending money we don't have in Iraq. \nRemember when Budget Director Mitch Daniels said the war would cost no \nmore than $60 billion? Paul Wolfowitz assured us that with Iraqi oil \nrevenue, the war would pay for itself. Some people said the war might \ncost $200 billion, and they were ridiculed as vastly overstating the \ncosts. Well, the President's most recent stimulus package is almost \nthat.\n  The President has spent more than half a trillion dollars on his \nfailed policy. There is no end in sight. It is shorting the funds we \nneed to rebuild our own country--and it is borrowed money. It needs to \nstop. We are hemorrhaging taxpayer money in Iraq, and the wake is \nbeyond disgraceful. For a base in Iraq that was never built, we paid a \ncontractor $72 million. We paid them to build a barracks for the police \nacademy in Baghdad, and instead we got a building with ``giant cracks \nsnaking through newly built walls and human waste dripping from the \nceiling.''\n  The administration loaded $9 billion in cash onto pallets and shipped \nit to Iraq, where it simply disappeared. And we cannot take care of \n250,000 disabled veterans or 20 million seniors, and we cut spending to \nfind a cure for diseases that ail our people. We cut funding from \nafterschool programs when our kids desperately need to have a place to \ngo after school.\n\n[[Page S586]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Republicans are stalling because these facts, when \nwe have these debates, are coming to light. So they are stalling. Can \nyou imagine what would happen if $9 billion disappeared from a Federal \ngrant in Vermont or California or Minnesota or New Jersey or Ohio? The \npeople responsible would go to prison. But in Iraq, the President \nshrugged it off.\n  The President said we lack fiscal discipline. Yet, look what he has \ndone to this budget. He took a surplus and turned it into a massive \ndeficit, and he took a debt we were paying down and it exploded on his \nwatch.\n  For him to say we are not fiscally responsible because we want to \ninvest in our people, we want to invest in our infrastructure, we want \nto find cures for disease, and, yes, we want to invest in alternative \nenergy so we don't have to be dependent on foreign oil and we can clean \nour air of the carbon dioxide that is warming the planet--fiscal \nirresponsibility? That is the name of the game with this \nadministration, whether it is the missing billions or the bases that \nwere never built or this enormous embassy that is being built in \nBaghdad. It is nothing short of breathtaking. The President and his \nsupporters shrug their shoulders, and yet we cannot get to the stimulus \npackage because somebody said they don't understand we have added $1 \nbillion, 1\\1/2\\ pages to the bill to help poor people pay for energy. \nThey have to be kidding. That is a stall.\n  The checkbook is open for Iraq; it is closed for America. This \nPresident wouldn't even be doing what he is doing now unless he is \nscared this recession is hitting.\n  Let me tell you what else we added to this stimulus bill that is \nbeing held up. We took the House language as it pertained to the \nhousing crisis, and we increased the amounts that Freddie and Fannie \nand FHA can lend our homeowners to give them the chance to refinance \nthese mortgages to keep responsible homeowners in their homes. We \ncannot wait on this provision. We can't wait on it. Thousands and \nthousands of cities are witnessing these foreclosures.\n  What happens when a home forecloses? The pool might go. The new owner \nof the home ignores keeping up the property, and it is a danger to have \na pool that has not been attended to. Mosquitoes breed in the pool and \nthe whole lawn gets all brown and the values go down and suddenly you \nhave a downward spiral. We have to turn it around. But somebody has to \nhold up a bill because they have to read 1\\1/2\\ pages about LIHEAP, a \nprogram that has been around for decades and, by the way, supported on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  The toll this Iraq war is having on our Armed Forces is stretching \nour military to the breaking point. Recently, we learned with sadness \nin our hearts that suicide attempts among U.S. troops have reached a \nrecord high, a sixfold increase since 2002. Last year, the Washington \nPost reported there was a readiness death spiral, that is their term, \nthat senior officers warn puts our Nation at risk because we lack the \nstrategic reserve of ground forces to respond to potential crises \nthroughout the world.\n  We are borrowing billions, putting that cost on the backs of our kids \nand grandkids, shorting our ability to take care of the people who need \nus now that the economy is in a downturn, and that hurts our security.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. As soon as I finish my statement, I will be happy to \nyield.\n  We have to ask this President: Why are we in Iraq? The answer depends \non when he was asked. Once upon a time, we were told it was about \nweapons of mass destruction. Remember? We had to go find them. Our \nmilitary found there were none. Then we were told it was Saddam's ties \nto al-Qaida. Well, there was no connection to al-Qaida. Then we were \ntold we had to get Saddam's family and show their pictures to the world \nso the world knew America meant business. And we did that, and the \nfighting went on. Then we were told they need to have an election, and \nhow proud we were when the Iraqi people went and as a free people \nelected their leaders.\n  All that happened. The President said: Mission accomplished. But it \ngoes on and on because it is a changing mission every day, no vision of \nhow to get out of this situation, and we have colleagues on the other \nside talking about us being there 50 years, 100 years, who knows, maybe \n1,000 years. This is not at no cost or little cost. It is costing us an \nabsolute fortune, and it is tied to this deficit because it is tying \nour hands.\n  The President says our commitment to Iraq is not open ended, and yet \nhe will not tell the leaders over there: Get your act together because \nwe have trained 500,000 of you and now it is your turn to stand up and \nfight for your freedom and fight for your democracy, frankly, the way \nwe did and other countries do.\n  There is a point in time when you have given so much blood and \ntreasure that you have to say: We want to help you, we will be there, \nbut we will not be in the forefront of this fight.\n  We have never been leveled with. How many more brave men and women \nwill die? Oh, we don't know. How many more will be wounded? We don't \nknow. But what we do know is some of the wounded are coming home to my \nState and they are suffering, suffering, suffering. Yet in the \nPresident's stimulus package, there is no help for disabled veterans. \nNo, oh, no, we couldn't do that. For a day of the cost of Iraq we can \nhelp them. That is why we want the debate and we want the debate to \nstart.\n  The President says the surge will lead us to victory. We hope so, but \nthe President says he knows it. How long will the surge last? It was \nsupposed to provide a quiet time for the leaders to resolve their \nproblems. It hasn't happened.\n  Our brave men and women in uniform have performed remarkably. They \nhave done every single thing we have asked of them and more. But you \nknow what, there has to be an end to this. As our military leaders tell \nus every day, there is no military solution to the situation in Iraq.\n  I said before we trained 500,000 Iraqis. I want to correct that \nfigure. It is 440,000. That is how many Iraqis we have trained. Our \ntaxpayers have laid the money out to train.\n  I think we ought to look at what the British did. The British were \nvery clear. They said their presence in Iraq was fueling the violence, \nfueling al-Qaida, and it would be far better if they played a \nsupportive role. And most of them will be gone. As a matter of fact, \nthe coalition of the willing has been massively depleted.\n  There is a beginning, a middle, and an end to a mission. But you \ncannot change the mission every few months. It is not fair to our \ntroops. It is sending a mixed message to the Iraqis.\n  Why do I bring this all up in the context of the stimulus? Because \nthe outflow of money is hurting us. We cannot take care of America. I \nthink we need to make a choice, and this stimulus package is the time \nfor us to connect all the dots. This economic recession needs our \nattention. We need to put the resources to it so it doesn't become a \ndeep and darker recession. We have to ask ourselves in the context of \nthis debate: Is it time for America, for our families, for our soldiers \ncoming home, for our children, or is it the time to continue an open-\nended commitment to a war without an end, a price tag without an end, a \nwar that is tying our hands as this recession becomes more real day \nafter day?\n  Clearly, it is no surprise that I say it is time for America and it \nis time for change. I do believe the people out there, whether they are \nDemocrats, Republicans or Independents, are crying out for that change.\n  I will also say, they may not all agree on one particular path, but \none thing they want us to do is our job. They don't want stall tactics, \nthey don't want delays, they don't want brilliant Senators coming to \nthe floor and saying: Gee, there has been a change in this bill, and we \nneed 30 hours to figure it out. Stay up until 10 or 11; you can read \nthat part of the bill. It isn't complicated, and it isn't time to \ncontinue an open-ended commitment to a war without end.\n  As we try to soften the blow of this recession on the American \npeople, let us understand that if we don't change when it comes to this \nwar and start bringing our troops home and start giving the Iraqi \nleaders a signal that they need to take charge of their own country, I \nwill tell you, I can't be part of\n\n[[Page S587]]\n\nthat kind of a value system because our people are suffering.\n\n  Again, my State is in a recession. I have sitting councilmen coming \nto me--by the way, not always in my party, believe me--saying to me: \nSenator, you have to help us. We are in a spiral. Help us. When I \ncalled and said help is on the way, we are going to raise those loan \nlimits for Fannie, Freddie, and FHA, we are going to give the \nhomebuilders some kind of a tax break, we are going to give a tax break \nto the alternative energy industry so they can start hiring people, \nthey smiled, there is hope. But if they heard tonight the back and \nforth between the Democratic leader and the Republican leader and they \nheard the Republican leader say: We are really sorry we are going to \nhold things up because I have to read this bill when, in fact, the \nchanges that were made are so minuscule we could read it in 10 minutes, \nthey don't know what is going on, and they throw up their hands.\n  I am here tonight to tell them: Don't give up hope because we are \nmotivated. We are motivated to get this package through. We are telling \nour seniors to let their Senators know, Democratic and Republican \nSenators, they need to be included, the disabled veterans, the \nhomebuilders, the people who are struggling with their mortgages. We \nare on your side. If your voice is heard, even in this Senate, it will \nhave an impact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think the Senator from California makes a \ncompelling case to take up the stimulus package right away. The bill, \nby the way, is a 71-page bill. I do think we need a little opportunity \nto read through it. If, as the Senator says, there are only two or \nthree changes to it, I am tempted to ask unanimous consent that we vote \non that package tomorrow. The reason I will not is because I owe it to \nthe majority leader to advise him in advance of making such a request, \nand I know what his response will be. His response, I believe, will be \nhe has made a commitment to Senators who are campaigning for the \nPresidency that they will not have to come back tomorrow to vote. That \nis why we are not voting tomorrow. It is not that Republicans are \ntrying to hold up things.\n  Yes, the minority leader made the point that since we just received \nthe bill, we would like an opportunity to read it. I will get back to \nthat in a moment. But the reality is, as the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia said, why are we holding up work on this stimulus bill? We \nare not. As I said, I will be happy to move to vote on it tomorrow.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I will yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Now I am confused, truly, honestly. I thought Senator \nMcConnell said, after you informed him there were changes to the bill, \nthat he was very concerned about that and he needed time to read the \nbill. That is what I heard both of you talk about. You came down and \ntold him that. I heard that.\n  Then I heard Senator Reid say: While you are reading this bill, let's \nget done with FISA. We can't seem to get that done. But it was my \nfriend, Senator Kyl, and my friend, Senator McConnell, who said very \nclearly they needed time to read this bill. I pointed out that the \nbill--\n  Mr. KYL. So what is your question? What is the question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My question is, if you want to go to it right now, why \ndid you tell the majority leader that there were changes to it and you \nneeded to read and take all 30 hours to read the bill? I don't \nunderstand.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the answer to the question, which is, Why \ndon't we go to the stimulus bill; Why do we need 30 hours to read it, \nis, as I said, I would be happy to propound a unanimous consent request \nright now that we go to the stimulus bill and vote on it tomorrow. I \nwill not do that because I know what the majority leader would say, \nwhich is, no, I will object to going to a vote on the stimulus bill \ntomorrow because I have told our Senate colleagues who are running for \nPresident and some others who are campaigning for them that we are not \ngoing to vote on it tomorrow. We are not going to have a vote on that, \nwhich they would miss, because it is too important. That is what he \nsaid a moment ago.\n  I said I would come back to the point of reading the bill, and I do \nwant to get back to that because I do think we should read bills before \nwe vote on them. But the key point here is that Republicans are not \nholding up action on this stimulus package. And for anybody on the \nSenate floor to suggest that we are, it is simply not the case. We \nvoted overwhelmingly to grant cloture so we could take up the bill. I \nthink all of the Democratic Senators voted to take up the bill. So we \nare on the bill. We are on the stimulus bill. But we can't vote on it \nbecause there has been a commitment to Senators who are running for the \nPresidency and some others that we won't vote on it tomorrow. Now, we \ndidn't make that commitment. That commitment, I understand, was made by \nthe distinguished majority leader. That is why I am not going to ask \nunanimous consent to try to embarrass people on the other side.\n  Let me get to the matter of reading the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question? It is so confusing \nto me.\n  Mr. KYL. Well, Mr. President, I am sorry the Senator is confused, but \nlet me continue on to make the point the Senator wanted to talk about, \nwhich is why we need to read the bill.\n  The bill was just handed to me by staff. I have not yet read it. It \nis 71 pages. Here it is. It starts out ``Strike all after the first \nword and insert the following.'' Well, if we are striking all after the \nfirst word, then I want to know what we are inserting. Now, the \nrepresentation from Senators on the other side is that we have added $1 \nbillion in spending on LIHEAP. There is a representation that in the \nbill there is an increase in the amount of mortgages that can be \nrefinanced, and it was represented that is the same as in the House \npackage. If that is the case, that takes the amount--I believe it is \nover $700,000.\n  I don't know a lot of low-income Americans who have mortgages of over \n$700,000 or mortgages up to $700,000. But as I understand it, if that \nis what the House bill provides for, and if that has been added to this \nbill, then that is what that provision would be. And the majority \nleader said there were some other small changes. I am not exactly sure \nwhat they are. It may be as simple as Dick and Jane, as the Senator \nfrom California said, in which case, as I said, perhaps we can go to it \ntomorrow. But, again, I don't think that is what the majority leader \nwants to do because of the commitments he has made to Senators who \nwould have to come back here for a vote on it.\n  What is at work here is not that we are holding up action on the \nstimulus bill. What is at work here is a desire to move forward with \nvotes on the FISA bill, which we are not on. We all voted to go to the \nstimulus bill, including all the members of the Democratic majority. If \nMembers of the Democratic majority want to go on the stimulus bill, \nthen let us consider the stimulus bill. If now the request is we just \ngot on this, but now we want to go back to the FISA package, I wonder \nwhat it is about collecting intelligence on terrorists that is somehow \nless important than the stimulus bill so we can have the Senators vote \non that but we can't have them vote on the stimulus package. These are \nboth big important issues.\n  I don't want to come down here and engage in this tit for tat. I \nfrankly think the American people are tired of it. They see all this \nbickering and they wonder why we can't get business done, why we can't \nget to solving these critical problems.\n  The Senator from California has made an eloquent plea for why we need \nto get out of Iraq, but we hear language like ``breathtaking \nirresponsibility'' and ``never worked with a President that didn't have \na clue''--meaning this President doesn't have a clue--''about how to \nend the Iraq war. An earlier speaker said: The President wants to spy \nin violation of the Constitution.\n  Now, look, you can disagree with the President, but he doesn't want \nto spy in violation of the Constitution. He wants to collect \nintelligence on our enemies consistent with the Constitution. We can \nhave legitimate debate and disagreement about whether what\n\n[[Page S588]]\n\nwe have done is constitutional. Some people might say no; others would \nsay it is constitutional. But I do know this: Six months ago this body \noverwhelmingly--there may have been only one negative vote, I am not \npositive of that, but overwhelmingly--in a bipartisan vote we agreed to \nallow the collection of foreign intelligence under a particular regime \nfor doing that, and it is that method of collection we want to \nreauthorize and we want to continue.\n  It is not just two Senators who decided to get together to develop a \nbill. By a bipartisan vote of 13 to 2 the Intelligence Committee agreed \non the reauthorization and the method by which we have been collecting \nintelligence on our enemies for the last 6 months. Now, if we have been \ndoing it for the last 6 months, and the Intelligence Committee by this \nbipartisan majority said let's keep on doing that, virtually no other \nchanges except in one area dealing with liability protection for the \ncommunications companies, then I don't think it is fair to say this has \nall been done unconstitutionally. That would mean the majority, almost \nall Democrats, agreed to allow intelligence collection that was \nunconstitutional. That certainly isn't what my colleagues intended, \nwhat I intended, or what anybody else in this body intended.\n  So let us not say the President wants to collect intelligence that is \nunconstitutional and that is what we have been doing under a Senate and \nHouse-passed bill for the last 6 months. That is the kind of \nirresponsible debate the American people, quite frankly, are tired of.\n  The basic question that is before us tonight is, Shall we pass a bill \nthat the majority leader has laid down dealing with stimulating the \neconomy? We all just voted--virtually all of us voted--to take up the \nstimulus bill. We had hoped we would actually have this 3 or 4 days \nago, but now we have it, and the majority leader has the absolute right \nto substitute what he wants us to consider, and he has done that. This \nis his proposal. And we have received some assurances as to what is and \nwhat isn't in it. I think we trust, but we also want to verify. As I \nsaid, it is 71 pages, but it shouldn't take that long for us to figure \nout whether there are other things in here other than what has been \nrepresented to us. If in fact it turns out that is the case, that all \nwe have done is add another $1 billion in spending on the LIHEAP \nprogram, we have increased the amount of mortgages that can be \nrefinanced up to 700 some thousand dollars--I think that is the number; \nI will read it here to make sure--and then some other minor changes, \nwhatever those are, then, again, I would be perfectly happy to take up \nthis bill tomorrow.\n\n  If I wanted to score cheap political points, I would do the same \nthing some on the other side have talked about, which is to say: All \nright, I ask unanimous consent that we take this up and vote on it. But \nI know there are people out campaigning. I know the majority leader has \ngiven them assurances they wouldn't have to come back for a vote on it. \nI respect that. It is a perfectly reasonable request. We can be taking \nthe time now not just to ensure what is in the bill but to debate the \nbill, so that when we do vote on it, presumably the next day, we would \nhave had our complete debate. It is not a waste of the American \npeople's time for the Senate to take 1 day to debate a bill this \nimportant.\n  We don't have to be disagreeable about this. We can assure ourselves \nof what is in it and we can take tomorrow to debate it. A lot of the \ncandidates are gone--presumably we don't want to ask them to come back \nto vote on it--so then we can vote on it the following day, and then \ntake up the FISA bill, which is equally important, if not more \nimportant in terms of foreign intelligence collection. We have, what, \nanother week or 10 days to complete work on that, with plenty of time \nto do it.\n  I think we should take a step back, not play political games here \nwith the dueling unanimous consent requests to do something that does \nnothing but embarrass the other side. Let us get to the business of the \nAmerican people, let us get a stimulus package voted on, let us then \nturn to the FISA bill and get the amendments voted on and pass that to \nthe President before we take the work period off that we will be taking \noff in, what, 12 days or so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the constructive comments by my \nfriend from my sister State of Arizona. As I understood what he said, \nhe suggests we debate the stimulus package tomorrow and have a time \ncertain to vote on the proposal that came from the Senate Finance \nCommittee and do that all on Wednesday. Is that what my friend is \nsaying?\n  Mr. KYL. I am very sorry. I apologize.\n  Mr. REID. No problem, I will repeat it. My understanding of what my \nfriend from Arizona said is that you think we should debate the \nstimulus package tomorrow and have a time certain to vote on the Senate \nFinance Committee package on Wednesday.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I said it was my own personal view that we \nwould not be wasting the American people's time to have a debate on the \nstimulus package and to have a vote on it on Wednesday. Obviously, I am \nnot speaking for any of my other colleagues, and we would obviously \nhave to do that, but if the leader is concerned about not having people \ncome back for votes tomorrow, which is a perfectly reasonable concern, \ngiven the importance of tomorrow on both sides--there are Senators who \nare out campaigning, and I understand that is a very important \nproposition--then I think it is appropriate to wait until Wednesday to \nhave a vote on the stimulus package.\n  Mr. REID. We only have three Senators out campaigning, McCain, \nClinton, and Obama, and it was my suggestion that tomorrow, if the \nRepublicans don't want votes, then shouldn't we at least have the \nability to see if we can complete the offering of amendments on the \nFISA legislation? We can intersperse that with people who want to talk \nabout the stimulus. They can do that.\n  I am happy to set a time certain on Wednesday so McCain, Obama, and \nClinton know when to come back on Wednesday. I am happy to do that.\n  I understand my friend is saying that he is speaking for himself, and \nI appreciate that, but he is the second ranking Republican leader in \nthe Senate. What I would suggest, Mr. President, is that he talk to \nwhomever he needs to speak with--I am sure the Republican leader--to \nsee if what he suggests is doable, and we will get that worked out \ntonight. And that is tomorrow we can come in, people can talk about the \nstimulus package all they want, and set a time certain on Wednesday to \nvote. That would save me having to file cloture on it either tonight or \ntomorrow night, which will happen. If I file it tomorrow night, the \nvote will have to be on Thursday. In the meantime, we have to wipe out \na lot of time.\n  I think it is very important we get FISA done. The end is near on \nFISA. We have worked out an agreement to finish that bill.\n  So I say to my friend, if I came and offered a consent agreement in \nkeeping with what your suggestion is, do you think you could get it \napproved tonight?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, obviously, our colleagues are not here. I \nwould not object to that kind of agreement. I don't know what others \nwould do.\n  To be fair, did I represent the distinguished majority leader \ncorrectly, that you had assured Senators they would not be voting on \nthe stimulus package tomorrow?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I have said, starting at 2 p.m. today--I might even \nhave said it last week--that I have two Senators, Obama and Clinton, \nwhom I would try to give at least 1 day's notice when a vote was to \noccur. That is why it is important to me, and I would think it would be \nimportant to Senator McCain also, that we have a time certain on \nWednesday to tell them when they have to be here. If we can't do it by \nagreement, then the only thing I can do, if the Republicans are going \nto waste all the time on 30 hours postcloture, I will have to, before \nmidnight tomorrow, file cloture so we can have a Thursday cloture vote.\n\n  Mr. KYL. If I can respond, obviously, the majority leader knows I \ncan't make that agreement here on the floor, but I will pass that on to \nthe minority leader and consult with our colleagues and see what can be \nagreed to in terms of an agreement.\n  I think the majority leader is exactly correct. As a matter of \ncourtesy to Members on both sides, it is probably\n\n[[Page S589]]\n\nnot the best idea to have votes tomorrow. It is an historic day in \nAmerican history.\n  Mr. REID. If I can interrupt my friend, on FISA, I think we can \neasily have votes tomorrow. There would be no problem with that, \nbecause those votes, most of them, aren't going to be that close \nanyway. I think we need to work through that. I have told all my \nSenators we would do our best to try to have votes on FISA tomorrow.\n  Now, maybe this has been in the works for a long time, because one of \nmy Senators told me she was coming over and one of the reporters said: \nNo votes tomorrow, right? She said: What are you talking about? They \nsaid: Senator McConnell has told his Senators there will be no votes on \nTuesday.\n  So maybe this has been in the works for some time, that there would \nbe no votes on Tuesday. But we may have a couple anyway, to make sure \nwe have some. I do have that ability, to have votes. It may not be much \non substance, but it will be votes, and it will be counted on Senators' \nvoting records.\n  Mr. KYL. If I can interrupt, I don't think Senator McConnell said \nthat. And you can have votes tomorrow. I think our Members would be \nperfectly fine on any votes you want to call.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the constructive tone of my \nfriend's statement, and either I or Senator Durbin will tonight \nsometime offer a consent agreement so we can have a pathway to whatever \nwe are going to do in the next couple of days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2248\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmorning business Tuesday, February 5, the Senate resume the FISA \nlegislation, then proceed to a vote in relation to the four amendments \nthat were debated today, with 2 minutes between each vote equally \ndivided, and that on the disposition of those amendments, the Senate \ncontinue to consider amendments in order to the FISA legislation and \nthat all time consumed during that debate count postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for the reasons I expressed with the majority \nleader a moment ago in our colloquy, I must object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand that. I was not making an \noffer to put my colleague on the spot but merely putting on the Record, \nbecause I think the American people sense what is happening in Congress \nand Capitol Hill and the Senate.\n  I have been out watching the Presidential debates, both the formal \nones and the presentations made by candidates. Change is the biggest \nword of this election cycle on both sides. I think it is evident the \nAmerican people feel America is headed in the wrong direction by \noverwhelming numbers. When they look at Congress and Washington, they \ndo not sense that we are sensitive to the real challenges families face \nevery day. They listen, some of them do, particularly those suffering \nfrom insomnia, watch and listen to C-SPAN and wonder why, why all the \nquorum calls in the Senate? Why all the time wasted? Why not more votes \non bills? If you are here in Washington, why not earn your keep?\n  Sometimes I wonder if this would be a better institution if Senators \nwere paid by the production of this Chamber because certainly this week \nwe are not likely to earn much pay. Last year, the Republican minority, \nand it was their right under Senate rules, were responsible for 62 or \n64 filibusters.\n  A filibuster is an attempt to continue debate indefinitely rather \nthan reach a conclusion and a vote. Sixty-four filibusters made an all-\ntime record in the Senate for 1 year. Sixty-four times the Republicans \nsaid: Whatever you are doing, let it go on forever, let's not bring it \nto an end.\n  And that, unfortunately, meant many important issues were not voted \non, were not decided. That is their right, the minority's right. It is \nthe nature of the Senate to slow things down. But I think the \nRepublican minority in this circumstance has taken it to an extreme.\n  I think it is this extreme that has led to the frustration across \nAmerica as they try to witness what is going on in the Senate and \nwonder why more is not accomplished.\n  Well, what we have tried to do today, unsuccessfully, is to ask \npermission from the Republicans to make tomorrow a productive day, to \nmake tomorrow a day when we can either debate the stimulus package, \npreparing for a vote on Wednesday, or consider amendments to the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act so we can move that bill toward \npassage; in other words, let's not waste a day. Let's not turn the \nlights on and bring all the staff out, turn on the television cameras \nand stand here before the microphones and say nothing and do nothing.\n  But the Republican position is to insist we do nothing tomorrow. \nNothing. I made a request that we go to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act. Now, this is the law the President is asking for, in \nfact demanding, on a timely basis. The President is saying: I need this \nauthority to keep America safe. It took us a long time to work out an \nagreement on amendments. I am sure fingers can be pointed to both \nsides. But we reached the agreement on how many amendments, how many \nvotes will be necessary.\n  Now I have made a request that we go to that bill tomorrow, let's not \nwaste tomorrow, let's move on this important domestic security issue. \nLet's have our debate, let's have our amendments, let's move forward, \nlet's get it done, let's put in a good day's work. And the Senator from \nArizona, on behalf of his leadership, has objected.\n  It means tomorrow we will gather, we will bring in the Chaplain, he \nwill say an inspiring prayer, we will say the Pledge of Allegiance, \nthen we will figure out how to kill a day. That is what will happen.\n  We will fill the Congressional Record, there will be some interesting \nspeeches, no amendments will be considered and voted on, no debate on \nthe economic stimulus package, it will be a wasted day.\n  Can America, can the Senate afford a wasted day? We are in the midst \nof, or at least close to a recession, if not there. A lot of people are \nworried about it. People back in Illinois whom I represent are \nconcerned about what is happening to our economy. We have a lot of \nfolks with 401(k)s and IRAs and pension plans who look at the stock \nmarket on a daily basis and worry about their life savings and their \nretirement, as they should.\n  People are concerned if we slide into a recession there will be even \nmore unemployment than was reported last week, on Friday, when we had \nsobering figures about the thousands of Americans who were out of work.\n  The President has expressed alarm about the state of the economy. All \nthese things argue for us to move forward and do something. We can \nstart doing something tomorrow. We can have a legitimate, substantive \ndebate on the economic stimulus package and a vote on Wednesday. Now, \nwould that not be historic, that the Senate would actually get an \nimportant measure out of the way in a matter of a few days? What is the \ndifference between the Republicans and the Democrats at this moment on \nthe economic stimulus package? I am not sure anymore. You see, the \nPresident's original position with the House, Democrats and \nRepublicans, suggested we would be sending checks for $600 or $1,200 \nfor a family, to individuals, to try to stimulate the economy and extra \nmoney for children if there are children in the family.\n  That is a good start. It is a start that we built on in the Senate \nFinance Committee on a bipartisan basis. In the Senate Finance \nCommittee we said: Beyond those individuals covered by the House, we \nthink 20 million seniors should receive this kind of rebate check as \nwell. They will spend that money, many of them on fixed incomes, and \nstimulate the economy. Let us, in fairness, give them a helping hand.\n  I am not sure, as I stand here, whether the Republicans in the Senate \nare supporting this. Only three Republicans in the Senate Finance \nCommittee voted for it. But what is at stake in our vote on the \neconomic stimulus package is whether 20 million seniors in America will \nbe included in the rebate checks. That is a pretty straightforward \nvote. You either think they should be or they should not be included. \nThe Democrats think they should be included.\n  In addition, some 250,000 disabled veterans who receive compensation \nfrom\n\n[[Page S590]]\n\nour Government for their disabilities for their wounds, we too believe \nthey should receive a rebate. Some say they already get a check. That \nis true. But if any group deserves an extra helping hand, it is those \nwho stood up and fought for this country and risked their lives for \nAmerica.\n  I certainly believe 250,000 disabled veterans should be included in \nthe economic stimulus package. I do not know if the Republicans now \nsupport that. As I said, three, only three in the Senate Finance \nCommittee would vote for that.\n  We also have a provision which says that if you are unemployed, \nreceiving unemployment compensation, we will extend your unemployment \ncompensation benefits for a matter of 13 weeks. And if your State is \nhard hit by unemployment, 26 weeks. Most economists will tell you that \nis the easiest and quickest way to stimulate the economy, people who \nare unemployed are scraping by.\n\n  Every dollar received is spent to keep things together while they \nlook for a job. Well, we think that group, which has historically been \npart of any economic recovery package, should be part of this package \nas well. Now, some of the Republicans object to it. They have said so \npublicly. They have a curious notion that if you give people 13 weeks \nof unemployment benefits, they will then decide to pull out the motor \nhome and go on vacation and stop looking for work. I wonder if these \nsame Republicans have taken a look at how much these people are paid. \nYou know, it is not a princely sum. In many cases it is $500 a week, \n$500 a week for someone who has had a good job is not going to be \nenough to get by. Trying to survive for 3 months or 6 months on that \ncould be extremely challenging. I think it is only right and just and \nfair and moral for us to say to unemployed families: Here is a little \nextra help so you can get by as we push toward and try to avoid a \nrecession.\n  Some Republicans disagree. So perhaps that is the reason why they \noppose the Senate Finance Committee package. There are other provisions \nthere. You can argue them up or down. Should we have a provision, as \nthe Presiding Officer from Vermont has asked for, to extend LIHEAP. \nThis is the Low-Income Heating Energy Assistance Program. It is a way \nto help people pay utility bills who otherwise cannot afford to do it.\n  The Senator from Vermont who is presiding has been one of our leading \nspokesmen for that. Interestingly enough, as Senator Boxer from \nCalifornia mentioned earlier, the Republican leader said that was one \nof the reasons we could not take up the economic stimulus package, he \nhad to read the provisions on LIHEAP because they are the only major \nchange in this bill.\n  Those provisions take all of a page and three lines. I think any \nSenator could get through that without a lot of strain. You do not have \nto be a speed reader to understand exactly what it says.\n  So here we are again, as we were last year 64 times, the Republican \nminority doing everything they can to slow down the Senate, to stop us \nfrom considering important legislation, so at some later date they can \ncomplain that we have not accomplished enough. Well, you cannot have it \nboth ways. You cannot object when we try to move to the FISA \nlegislation and consider amendments and then say later we are not \nmoving quickly or on a high priority.\n  You cannot object to an economic stimulus vote on Wednesday, as we \ntry to schedule it and then object that the Senate Democratic \nleadership is not responsive to America's economy. We are going to do \nthe best we can under the Senate rules. We are going to, unfortunately, \nkill a lot of time because of this Republican approach. It is their \nright under the rules. I do not question it. But I do question the \nwisdom of allowing this Senate to continue to move so slowly, to be so \nunresponsive, to spend so many wasted hours and wasted days for no \nearthly purpose.\n  It would be far better for those of us who were drawing a paycheck \naround here to roll up our sleeves and go to work, be accommodating to \nschedules as we must be, but for goodness sakes, would it hurt us \ntomorrow to take up these amendments to the FISA bill, to debate them \nand vote on them?\n  I think it would be a good, healthy thing. It almost would bring the \nSenate perilously close to being a deliberative body again, which we do \nnot do enough of. I hope the Senate leadership on the Republican side \nwill reconsider their position, will stop objecting to considering \nsubstantive amendments to important legislation that we ought to move \nas quickly as possible.\n  I will make a comment that I think most Members are aware of, but \nthere will be no further votes today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I know the Senator from New Jersey wants to speak, but since \nsome of this was directed to my comments on the unanimous consent \nrequest, I think I should take a couple of minutes to respond.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I may have the courtesy of a question to the \nSenator from Arizona. My subject is away from the present discussion. \nShort subject. It talks about the pride we in New Jersey have about our \nGiants. But if I might have a few minutes?\n  Mr. KYL. Since we have had this discussion, let me take no more than \n4 minutes. I will join the Senator in the pride he has for the Giants \nand their wonderful victory in my home State of Arizona yesterday. I \nhope a good time was had by all, including those who had their string \nbroken.\n  I do wish to respond because there have been a couple suggestions \nmade I think that are inaccurate. We are not going to come in tomorrow \nand have the prayer by the Chaplain and do nothing.\n  I hope that debate on the stimulus package is not perceived by people \nas doing nothing. All of us, almost all of us I think, everybody on the \nDemocratic side voted to take up the stimulus bill. That is what we \nvoted on an hour ago. We voted to take up the stimulus bill. Now we are \non the stimulus bill.\n  I have not had a chance to speak on it yet. I would like to do that. \nTomorrow is my opportunity. The majority leader is the one who said \nthere would be no votes on the stimulus package tomorrow, not the \nSenator from Kentucky, the minority leader.\n  So the fact that we are not voting on the stimulus bill tomorrow has \nnothing to do with Republican delay. It is a commitment made by the \nmajority leader. I have no problem with the commitment. There are \npeople out campaigning. But that was the majority leader's decision not \nto vote on the stimulus bill tomorrow.\n  As I said, we voted for cloture for the House bill. I am happy to \nvote on the House bill. I do not know whether my other colleagues are \ngoing to be done debating this in 1 day tomorrow. But I do know this, \nwe have gone to the stimulus package. We are going to be on it \ntomorrow. That is what we all agreed to do.\n  Now the assistant leader comes down and asks unanimous consent to go \noff the bill we voted to go on and to start voting tomorrow on some \nFISA amendments, some amendments to the FISA bill. He said: What a \nwaste it would be.\n  Now, as everyone in this body knows, we did not vote last Wednesday, \nlast Thursday, last Friday, not because Republican's were not ready to \nvote, there was no agreement on how to proceed to a FISA bill.\n  We have now reached that agreement. That agreement is in place. The \nminute we finish this stimulus package, we will move to the FISA bill. \nWe can get that done within the next 10 days. There is no question \nabout that. So I do not know why this constant attempt to try to put \npeople on record, as the distinguished assistant leader said, and then \nto talk about 64 filibusters by Republicans.\n  The majority leader set a record last year in the number of cloture \nvotes that were required in order for us to do business. When the \nmajority leader brings up a bill and then precludes any other \namendments and files cloture, we have no choice but to vote on that \ncloture motion. If we vote against it, it is called a filibuster. That \nis not a filibuster. But by the reckoning of the other side, I gather \nthat is how they count up the number of filibusters.\n  Every time we vote against a cloture vote, the majority leader has \nrequired--and there is no opportunity for Republican amendments--many \nof those times Republicans are going to say: No, we want a chance to \noffer\n\n[[Page S591]]\n\nsome amendments. That is not a filibuster. Yet that is the kind of \naccusation that has been made here.\n  I want to get back to the point that surely we can have a \nconstructive debate without constantly trying to cut each other off at \nthe knees; that the Republican minority has taken this to an extreme, \nthat they are not sensitive to the challenges the people face, that the \nRepublican position is to do nothing tomorrow.\n  Well, we are all going to debate the stimulus package tomorrow \nbecause we all voted to debate the stimulus package tomorrow. That is \nnot doing nothing.\n  I ask my colleagues again: Let's quit this business of trying to put \nthe other side into an embarrassing position to object to something or \ncomplain that we want to do nothing or we do not care about people or \nthat the President wants to violate the Constitution. This is the kind \nof thing the American people are sick of.\n  We voted to take up the stimulus package. Let's take it up. We will \nhave time to read it. If it is as simple as the other side says, that \nis great. It is 71 pages long. But if it is pretty simple, then \npresumably the debate will not take all that long. Then we can turn to \nthe FISA bill, on which we have reached an agreement.\n  I hope my colleagues, in moving forward, will consider the interests \nof the American people first and stop this bickering to try to put each \nother into embarrassing positions so we gain a little bit of a \npolitical advantage.\n  Mr. President, I am very happy now to join my colleague from New \nJersey in a bipartisan exercise; that is, to congratulate the New York \nGiants on their victory.\n  I am happy to yield the floor to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lautenberg are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Warrior Citizens Ceremony\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, yesterday I met American heroes--dozens and \ndozens of American heroes--citizen soldiers who had returned from \nservice in Iraq. Out of Brooklyn, OH, High School near Cleveland, 81 \nsoldiers in the 256th Combat Support Hospital were honored at the \nWarriors Citizen ceremony.\n  Many years ago--200 years or so ago--George Washington talked about \nfarmers putting down their plows and serving their country. Yesterday I \nmet nurses, teachers, doctors, farmers, and small business owners, all \nof whom had returned from Iraq last October, and all of whom we were \nhonoring yesterday in Brooklyn, OH. MAJ Michael Evarts trained Iraqi \nsoldiers. MAJ Michael Evarts, a citizen soldier, returned to Ohio; he \nworks every day supporting his family as a pharmaceutical \nrepresentative.\n\n  Bryan Block from Zanesville left his restaurant for a year to serve \nhis country. He left Charlie's Subs to his son-in-law in Zanesville and \nlast October returned to a growing, prosperous restaurant. Bryan Block \nis a citizen soldier.\n  LTC Shirley Koachway spoke with an infectious enthusiasm and with an \nobvious dedication to the veterans she serves. Not only is she in the \nArmy Reserve, but she told me about her work in Sandusky--a city just \nwest of Lorraine where I live--in a community-based outreach clinic \nserving veterans--a citizen soldier.\n  CPT Dionne Moore is an optometrist who works for the Department of \nVeterans' Affairs in a community-based outreach clinic in Lorraine, OH. \nCaptain Moore told me with some pain in her eyes how she is seeing more \nand more diabetic veterans who have not gotten their medicine or not \noften enough kept up with taking their medicine, which is causing a \ndecreased use of their vision and an increase in blindness in all too \nmany veterans.\n  CWO Ron Kuntz, who directed the choir for the ceremony, spoke \npassionately not just about his service for our country but spoke \npassionately about his students whom he has as a music teacher in the \nCleveland city schools--another citizen soldier.\n  I also spoke with COL Ron Dziedzicki, who was a nurse and is now a \nhospital administrator who has been working with these men and women, \nwith these soldiers in Europe and in Asia and all over the world in his \nmany years--more than two decades--of service to our Nation--all \ncitizen soldiers.\n  Now, when I think of whom I met yesterday, when I think of these \nsoldiers--men and women of all races, of all ages--when I think of \nthese soldiers who give up their lives or time away--more than a year \naway from their families--one of these soldiers told me his child was \nborn when he was overseas--when I think about them, I think about the \nduty we have to them.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has spoken about this many times. The \nPresident and this Congress, for too many years in the past, have \nsimply not taken care of veterans the way we should take care of them. \nFor the kind of service we have asked of them and sacrifice we have \nasked them to make for our country, we haven't--even in a small way in \ntoo many cases--paid them back.\n  That is why I come to the floor today just for a few more minutes to \ntalk about the GI bill: the post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance \nAct of 2007. A whole generation of Americans in the 1940s and 1950s, a \nwhole generation of soldiers and sailors and marines were educated \nbecause of the GI bill. They were people who came back without much \nmoney, enrolled in school, and the Government--paying them back for \ntheir service for winning World War II, for Korea, for all of their \nservice to our country--the Government decided the most important thing \nto do was to give them the kind of educational opportunity that they \nearned and that they deserved.\n  Do we know what happened? It wasn't just that the GI bill helped \nthousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, a few million \nreturning veterans, it is also what it did for the prosperity of our \nNation because without the GI bill in the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s, we \nwould not have had the educated workforce, we wouldn't have the kind of \neducated citizens this country, the ``greatest generation,'' gave to \nus.\n  That is why a government program such as this, a program that is all \nabout opportunity to give these veterans the GI bill, give these \nveterans an opportunity, an education, will not only help them \npersonally and help their families, it will help their neighborhoods, \nit will help their communities, and it will help us to make our country \neven more prosperous. That is the whole point of programs such as the \nGI bill. It should help those veterans whom I met yesterday, those \nreturning soldiers, some of them still in the Reserve, some of them \nhaving served their time and left. But that GI bill will spark the kind \nof economic growth and expansion for a whole generation of Americans.\n  With programs such as this one, when we provide opportunities to \ncollege students, when we provide opportunities through Head Start, \nwhen we provide opportunities with helping families through the earned-\nincome tax credit, not only does it help those individuals and help \nthose families, it helps our communities, it helps our States, it helps \nour country.\n  That is the story of the GI bill. That is why we need a new GI bill \nthat really does pay those veterans back, pay those soldiers, sailors, \nand marines back for the service they gave our country. It is the smart \nthing to do. It is the morally right thing to do. It is the best thing \nto do for our country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S592]]\n\n                      NEW SOLUTIONS AND PRIORITIES\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, last month I traveled to dozens of \ncommunities throughout my State. I actually visited 47 counties in \nMinnesota in January, from towns on our southern border with Iowa to \ntowns way up on our northern border with Canada. I saw a lot of great \nentrepreneurial activity out there. I got to see ethanol plants. I was \nwith Senator Conrad in North Dakota for his entrepreneurial forum. I \ngot to jump on solar panels to show that hail doesn't hurt solar panels \nin Starbuck, MN.\n  What I heard from people throughout our State--and I think what we \nare hearing from people throughout America--is that Washington must \nprovide a new direction to address the Nation's priorities and solve \nour economic challenges. They know what is happening. There has been a \ndoubling of foreclosure rates in rural Minnesota. We have seen rising \nenergy prices, as my colleagues can imagine when it is so cold. I was \nin International Falls, where it gets to be 10 below zero. In \nInternational Falls, it is pretty cold. In Embarrass, MN, it can get \npretty cold.\n  There are also skyrocketing health costs. I heard about that not just \nfrom individual families and workers but from small businesses that are \nhaving trouble keeping their employees on health care plans or big \nbusinesses that are having trouble competing internationally because of \nthe costs of health care.\n  What people told me out there is they need new solutions and new \npriorities from Washington.\n  What I want to talk about today is, first of all, the President's \nbudget and how it doesn't give us new solutions, it doesn't give us new \npriorities, and then our own stimulus package that is so important to \npush through this Congress and not to be obstructed.\n\n  The President's budget continues a familiar pattern of misplaced \npriorities. It continues a 7-year pattern of fiscal irresponsibility, \nborrowing money and then leaving an ever-larger debt to our children. \nIn just 7 years, this administration took a budget surplus of $158 \nbillion and turned it into what will soon be a budget deficit of \nsomething like $300 billion, $400 billion. It is quite an \naccomplishment. Meanwhile, this new budget continues to neglect \ncritical investments that are needed to strengthen our economy and our \nNation in a very difficult time. It does not make the investments we \nneed in our Nation's transportation infrastructure. It does not make \nthe investments we need in developing renewable energy sources to move \nus toward greater independence and security. It does not make the \ninvestments we need to get new technology to solve our climate change \nproblem--what I call building a bridge to the 21st century. It doesn't \ndo that. It doesn't make the investment we need in the basic medical \nand scientific research that has always been a key driver of our \ncountry's innovation and growth. It doesn't include a shift in these \npriorities, and it also doesn't include how we are going to pay for it.\n  When I went around our State in January, people were willing to talk \nabout reform. They are willing to talk about rolling back some of these \nBush tax cuts on the wealthiest people--people making over $200,000, \n$250,000 a year--so we can actually pay for some of the investments we \nneed in our State. People out in rural Minnesota said: Fine by me. Roll \nback those tax cuts on people making over $200,000 a year. That is not \nme. Meanwhile, I have a road that I can't even go on because it has so \nmany potholes and that has a shoulder that is going downhill where four \npeople were killed in the last few months. I am happy if you can put \nsome money into infrastructure.\n  Here are a few examples in Minnesota of how the President got the \nbudget wrong. I think people are well aware of our tragic bridge \ncollapse. That was only six blocks from my house, when a bridge just \nfell down in the middle of a summer day in the middle of America. It \nwas a tragic wake-up call that the Nation's bridges are deteriorating \nfaster than we can repair or replace them. So what does the \nadministration do in its budget? It reduces funding for the Federal \nhighway construction fund.\n  Minnesota is home to premier medical institutions such as the Mayo \nClinic and the University of Minnesota that conduct breakthrough \nresearch on lifesaving cures. Many of the researchers at these \ninstitutions depend on Federal funding. So what does this \nadministration do in its budget? What was I going to tell the people in \nour State, when I met with them at the Mall of America, who are trying \nto find a cure for children's diabetes, for the parents who met with me \nas we see autism on the rise and we are trying to find a cure or the \npeople on the Alzheimer's ward? What does the President say to them? \nWell, for the sixth year in a row, it freezes funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health, the Nation's leading medical research agency that \nprovides essential funding to doctors and scientists.\n  The budget also cuts health care services. For example, the \nadministration is calling for an 86-percent cut in funding for rural \nhealth programs, including rural health outreach grants and the Rural \nHospital Flexibility Grant Program.\n  I can tell my colleagues what I heard when I was up in Brickstown, \nMN. I was up there. They have a hospital. They have one surgeon--one \nsurgeon. You have to go miles and miles and miles to find another \nhospital. You can see towns miles and miles away, it is so flat up \nthere. But they have this one hospital that is so important to their \narea. The surgeon is reaching retirement age. He might even want to \nretire now, but he can't because they can't find another surgeon to go \nup there. If they don't find another surgeon, they are not going to be \nable to have babies born in that hospital because they don't have a \ndoctor who can do a C-section.\n  Much of my State is rural despite the thriving metropolitan area we \nhave in the Twin Cities and thriving places such as Moorhead and \nRochester and Duluth, and we have these rural hospitals and health care \nproviders that depend on this Federal funding to provide services for \nthe rural residents of my State. It is not just a nicety; it is a \nnecessity.\n  In Minnesota, we are on the leading edge of the renewable energy \nrevolution that promises to transform our economy and lead us toward \ngreater energy security and independence. So what does the \nadministration do in this budget? It cuts funding for solar energy \nresearch, hydropower, and industrial energy efficiency. It also cuts \nDepartment of Agriculture programs that are important for developing \nnew farm-based energy sources such as biomass and cellulosic ethanol.\n  Now, we heard the President at the State of the Union talking about \nmoving to this new energy era. Well, put the money where the mouth is. \nIt is not there. How are we going to stop spending $200,000 a minute on \nforeign oil if we are cutting the possibility of research into things \nsuch as cellulosic ethanol which, if done right with prairie grass, \nwhich puts carbon back into our soil, will allow the prairie grass to \nbe grown on marginal farmland? This is the direction we need to go but \nnot if we are going to cut funding. We have seen these wind turbines in \nour State where people are so excited they have wind turbines \neverywhere, wind turbine manufacturing, but every time the wind tax \ncredit goes away, the investment stops about 8 months earlier because \nit is like a game of red light-green light: They don't know what is \nhappening. So this is what the administration does.\n  This budget would shut down the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \nNorth Central Soil Conservation Research Lab in Morris, MN. That was \none of the places I visited in January. This lab, on the University of \nMinnesota campus, is at the forefront of research and development to \npromote homegrown renewable energy. This is our energy future, but you \nwould hardly know it from looking at the President's budget.\n  Finally, as I mentioned, it has been a little cold in Minnesota. It \ndid get up to 10 degrees below zero one day, but it was down to 20 \ndegrees below zero in Embarrass about a week ago. Nationwide, the \naverage household is expected to pay 11 percent more for heating this \nwinter compared to last year. Families who rely on home heating oil are \nfacing record prices 30 to 50 percent above last winter.\n  What does the administration do in its budget? It cuts in half the \nemergency funding for the low-income heating assistance program. This \nis a program which enjoys bipartisan support.\n\n[[Page S593]]\n\nIt provides much needed help to seniors and families who are struggling \nwith ever-rising heating costs. Maybe the President thinks we are going \nto have so much global warming that we don't need this heating, I don't \nknow. While these prices are going up and you are in the middle of \nwinter, you shouldn't cut the heating program. I hope the next \nPresident see things differently.\n  I believe deeply in the importance of fiscal responsibility. I \nsupport the pay-as-you-go rule for budgeting. My husband and I keep our \nfinancial house in order, and we think the Government should too. If \nyou want to talk about fiscal responsibility, you don't have it in this \nbudget. There is no willingness to talk about doing things differently. \nDo we want a budget that offers tax giveaways to the wealthy or one \nthat provides relief to middle-class families who are squeezed by the \nrising costs of housing, energy, health care, and tuition? You know \nwhat happened on the AMT debate. We voted to pay for it by taking money \naway from the hedge fund operators, but the other side would not do it. \nDo we want to give lucrative favors to the rich and the corporations, \nor do we want to invest in our future prosperity, in things such as \nresearch and development and renewable energy?\n  Instead of investing in the oil cartels in the Mideast, we need to \ninvest in the farmers and workers of the Midwest--maybe a few in \nVermont, as well, Mr. President. Do we want a budget that continues to \nsend tens of billions of dollars to Iraq--I think it is $12 billion a \nmonth--or do we want a budget that provides our local and State law \nenforcement with the resources they need to protect public safety here \nat home?\n  I want to see an administration that aims for fiscal responsibility \nby rolling back the tax cuts for the wealthiest people making over \n$200,000 or $250,000 a year.\n  I would like to see an administration that aims for fiscal \nresponsibility by eliminating offshore tax havens for \nmultimillionaires.\n  I would like to see an administration that aims for fiscal \nresponsibility by ending the tax breaks and royalties that have been \nhanded out year after year to the big oil companies.\n  I would like to see an administration that aims for fiscal \nresponsibility by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription \ndrug prices for seniors. Exactly what we predicted would happen has; \nyou are seeing the prices go up, not down. They just had a re-up period \nfor Medicare Part D. Seniors in my State are trying to figure out all \nthese call-in lines and are trying to save a little money, and they are \ncaught in the doughnut hole. This could have been done better. It \nwasn't done in a fiscally responsible way.\n  The President's budget doesn't provide the new priorities and new \nsolutions America needs. Instead, it continues to take us down the \nwrong path for the future.\n  Even as we must plan and invest for the long term, I am also \nconcerned that we have our priorities right in the short term. At this \ntime, the urgent priority for America is to get our economy moving \nforward again and not let it weaken further. That is why we have put \ntogether an economic stimulus package that would respond promptly and \nresponsibly. It would get this economy moving with tax rebates that are \nfair to the middle class, carefully targeted, and fiscally responsible. \nBut tonight we find out that we are not going to be able to vote on \nthat tomorrow.\n  I do commend Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for their swift work \nin getting this comprehensive, simple, and effective measure to the \nfloor.\n  A short-term stimulus package needs to be targeted for the people who \nneed it most. Although economists are wary to declare that we are \nofficially in a recession, many middle-class American families have \nbeen feeling the effects of an economic slowdown for months. From the \nimpact of the mortgage crisis on the value of homes in their \nneighborhoods, to the skyrocketing costs of the oil that fuels their \ncars and heats their homes, to the rising prices in the grocery store, \nthe middle class is feeling economic pressure from each and every side.\n  When I went across my State on our Main Street tour in January, no \nmatter where I went--all 47 counties--the economy was the first on the \nlist of what the people in my State wanted to talk about. From city \nhall, to the cafe stops, to the turkey-processing places, to the little \nsolar panel company, that is all they wanted to talk about--the \neconomy. The message was loud and clear. I heard a lot from the middle-\nclass families. Even before we began to experience this economic \nslowdown, the families were finding it harder to get by.\n  To give you a sense of what we have in our State, in Minnesota, the \nunemployment rate recently jumped to 4.9 percent, up from 4.4 percent \nthe month before. Our State lost 23,000 jobs in the last 6 months \nalone. Over 50,000 Minnesota families lost their homes to foreclosure \nin the past 3 months. Home heating prices for Minnesota families have \nrisen by 14.1 percent per household in the past year alone.\n\n  In order to get communities along Main Streets in Minnesota and \nacross our country booming again, we need both short- and long-term \nsolutions. While everybody agrees the rebate checks will be a part of \nwhatever targeted and effective stimulus package Congress ends up \nsending to the President, I am here today to voice my strong support \nfor several additional provisions that are in our Senate proposal. \nThese proposals would do much to help improve the middle-class lives \nbehind those statistics I just talked about. These are real people all \nover our State. These proposals are a proven stimulus for our economy. \nThey deserve a full debate and proper consideration in our Chamber.\n  First, we need to expand our rebate effort in order to ensure that \ncertain deserving groups are not left out. As I said, part of creating \na targeted stimulus for the economy is through helping those who need \nit most. I was sorry to see that the House proposal fell short.\n  It is crucial to this package that the 20 million American seniors \nwho worked all their lives, paid taxes, and contributed to our society \nin countless ways will get rebate checks. That is the first point. We \nneed to include the seniors.\n  In the past week, I have heard from hundreds of Minnesota seniors who \ntold me that the Senate proposal to include Social Security recipients \nis the only fair way to stimulate the economy. I agree, and I support \nthe Senate effort to include seniors.\n  It is also crucial that we include disabled veterans in this package. \nThese men and women have served our country both here and abroad. They \nsigned up to serve; there wasn't a waiting line. When they come up and \npeople are getting rebates, there should not be a waiting line. Go to \nthe end of the line--you disabled veterans, who served our country, are \nat the end of the line; you don't get a rebate check. That is not \nright.\n  Second, I firmly believe we should include an extension of the clean \nenergy tax incentives in any stimulus package. We can do that in \nanother package, but we have to do it. These benefits certainly meet \nthe definition of what we need for a short-term stimulus package.\n  If you look at the data, we have seen a revolution going on across \nthe country in wind and solar and other forms of renewable energy. This \nhas been like a game of red light-green light. You can go through the \nlights, and then it lapses for 6 months. It goes on again, and then it \nlapses. The proven statistic is that every time it lapses, the \ninvestors stop investing. That is not what we want. Our country came up \nwith all of the technology for wind and solar, and now we are falling \nbehind the rest of the world in developing it because we don't have the \ninvestment tax credits in place.\n  Third, I believe the stimulus package should also include additional \nfunding for LIHEAP. Working families in Minnesota and across the Nation \nshould not have to choose between paying home heating bills and putting \nfood on the table. Increasing LIHEAP funding to keep pace with the \nskyrocketing price of oil is essential to this stimulus package.\n  I see the stimulus package as a first step, and it is crucial to \nsupport it. But long after those rebate checks are spent, we are going \nto need a long-term economic strategy in response to the problem or we \nare going to be back where we started in the first place. We need an \neconomy that creates good, stable middle-class jobs. We need \ninfrastructure investment so we don't have\n\n[[Page S594]]\n\nbridges falling down in the middle of America. We need energy \ninvestment. That will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and create \ngood jobs in the green-collar energy sector.\n  In the Senate, we have our stimulus package, and it is a good one. \nThe people we serve are asking for a new direction and priority. That \nmeans being fiscally responsible, being willing to roll back some of \nthe tax cuts for the wealthiest, closing down loopholes, negotiating \nfor lower prescription drug prices, and taking the oil giveaways and \nputting them into renewables. Those are new priorities for this \ncountry.\n  Last year, we made a downpayment on change in this country. We moved \ntoward a more responsible budget process. We gave working Americans an \nincrease in the minimum wage. Today, we can continue that progress and \ncontinue that change with a system that is fair for all Americans. That \nmeans getting the stimulus package done, including these necessary \nchanges with seniors and disabled veterans and the LIHEAP funding, and \nthen looking at the long term and making sure in this package--or in \nanother one--we get the tax cuts in place for clean energy and do \nsomething about fiscal responsibility. And we are willing to talk about \nchange and really do it.\n  This is our moment. The American people have spoken. At least they \nspoke to me in Crookston and Worthington and Starbuck. I think if the \npeople who live in those towns were standing here, they would tell the \nSenate what we need to do. So let's get it done.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, during the last several weeks and \nmonths, in fact, there has been increased discussion and comments about \nthe state of our economy. As you know, last month our Nation actually \nshed some 17,000 jobs and many economists tell us we are now in a \nrecession and that is certainly true for some parts of this country.\n  The House, the Senate, and the White House are wrestling with an \neconomic stimulus package, and President Bush has presented his new \nbudget. This week, the Director of the OMB and the Secretary of the \nTreasury will come before the Senate Budget Committee to discuss their \nviews on the economy.\n  Let me begin by stating how dismayed I was by the budget President \nBush has provided us today. Frankly, this budget is unconscionable and \nreflects priorities that are almost impossible to comprehend. While \nproviding hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the \nwealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent of our population over the next \ndecade, this President has proposed major cuts in health care, LIHEAP, \nweatherization, nutrition, housing programs, and other basic needs for \nmoderate- and low-income people. This is a Robin Hood in reverse \nbudget. This is a budget that takes from the poor and working families, \nthose most in need, and gives to millionaires and billionaires, those \nleast in need.\n  This proposed budget tells us how out of touch this President and his \nadministration are with the needs of the American people.\n  Let me be very clear; as a Member of the Senate Budget Committee, I \nwill do everything I can to make sure Bush's budget is rejected and \nthat we bring forth a new budget that reflects the priorities of all \nour people and not just the wealthiest and most powerful.\n  Most Americans understand, for example, our health care system is \ndisintegrating. Since George W. Bush has been President, 8.6 million \nAmericans have lost their health insurance, and we now live in a \ncountry in which 47 million of our neighbors have no health insurance. \nWe live at a time when health costs are soaring, when people are paying \nlarger and larger deductibles and copayments. That is the reality of \nAmerican health care today.\n  How does President Bush respond to this crisis in health care? His \nresponse is to slash funding for Medicare, slash funding for Medicaid, \nslash funding for rural health care programs, making a terrible \nsituation even worse.\n  I understand it will be asking too much for this President to stand \nup to the insurance companies, to stand up to the drug companies and \nmove us toward a national health care program which guarantees health \ncare for all our people, something, by the way, which every other major \ncountry on Earth now has.\n  I understand that is something George W. Bush is not going to do. I \nunderstand that. But at the very least, at a time when some 17,000 \nAmericans a year die because they lack health insurance, he should not \nbe making a terrible situation even worse. He need not deny health care \nto even more Americans.\n  In the State of Vermont and through many parts of our country, \nMinnesota included, we have experienced extremely cold weather this \nwinter. At the same time, as every American knows, the price of home \nheating oil has more than doubled, skyrocketed since President Bush has \nbeen in office. The result is the LIHEAP program, the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, which keeps millions of seniors and low-\nincome households warm in the winter, is stretched to the breaking \npoint. That is the reality. Cold winter, price of home heating oil \nsoaring, the program is stretched.\n  In State after State, because of soaring fuel prices, either fewer \npeople are able to access LIHEAP or the amount of help they are getting \nhas been significantly reduced. That is simply the arithmetic of the \nsituation: lower payments, fewer people. Those are the choices States \nhave with reduced LIHEAP budgets.\n  I know President Bush has no problem, no problem whatsoever, with the \nfact that his good pals at ExxonMobil have announced the largest \nprofits in the history of the world for the third consecutive year, \nover $40 billion in profits in the year 2007. I am quite sure the \nPresident has no problem with that, and I understand that. He has no \nproblem, apparently, with the fact that home heating oil prices are now \nat $3.30 a gallon. I am sure he has no problems with the fact that a \nfew years ago, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, a gentleman named Lee \nRaymond, received a $400 million retirement package from that company. \nIt is not a problem for the President of the United States. He is close \nto those people. As he once famously said: That is his base.\n  But despite the President's lack of concern about rising fuel costs, \nit is beyond comprehension that he would slash the LIHEAP program by \n$570 million, a 22-percent reduction from last year. The price of home \nheating oil is soaring, more and more people are losing their LIHEAP \nbenefits, and the President's response in the midst of this crisis is \nto slash the program. That is pretty cruel. What is a low-income senior \nliving on Social Security supposed to do when the weather gets below \nzero and she cannot heat her home? That is the story today, and you \npropose to make it even worse next year.\n  At a time when millions of low-income seniors are struggling to \nsurvive on inadequate Social Security benefits, this President in his \nbudget wants to cut back on nutrition programs for low-income seniors, \nin addition to cutting back on low-income housing and senior citizen \nhousing.\n  Hunger in the United States of America is increasing. Emergency food \nshelves are simply running out of groceries. There is no moral \njustification for the President of the United States to be cutting back \non nutrition programs for low-income elderly Americans by proposing to \ncompletely eliminate the Commodity Supplemental Food Program which is \nproviding assistance to well over 4,000 low-income senior citizens in \nthe State of Vermont and hundreds of thousands nationally. With hunger \ngoing up, the President cuts back on an important nutritional program \nfor low-income seniors.\n  I am a member of the Veterans' Committee, and I am proud that last \nyear, against opposition from the White House, we substantially \nincreased funding for the VA and are providing billions more so \nveterans can gain access\n\n[[Page S595]]\n\nto quality VA hospitals and clinics. That is what we accomplished. That \nwas the right thing to do. And yet despite all of his rhetoric about \nhow much he loves the troops and how much he respects the troops--last \nweek, I might add, in his State of the Union Address, President Bush \nsaid:\n\n       We must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb \n     so that we might live in freedom and peace.\n\n  That was the President's statement 1 week ago at the State of the \nUnion Address. But today, after all that flowery rhetoric, the \nPresident has proposed in his budget a very sharp increase in health \ncare fees from $250 to $750 for veterans who access VA health care \nfacilities. And there is no question, no doubt about it but that these \nincreased fees, if put into effect, would result in driving many \nveterans out of VA health care which, in fact, is precisely the goal of \nthat proposal. He wants to take veterans out of VA health care, which \nis consistent with what the President did several years ago when he \nthrew large numbers of so-called category 8 veterans, those without \nservice-connected disabilities, out of VA health care.\n  The words tell us how much he loves our soldiers, but actions tell us \nhe is prepared to raise fees for veterans health care, with the result \nof removing many veterans from the VA system.\n  I say to President Bush that at a time when tens of thousands of our \nsoldiers have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, please don't \nbalance your budget on the backs of men and women who have put their \nlives on the line defending this country.\n  Since George W. Bush has been in office, we have seen recordbreaking \ndeficits, and our national debt is now $9.2 trillion, $3 trillion more \nthan when President Bush assumed office.\n  All of us in Congress want to move this country toward a balanced \nbudget to make sure our kids and our grandchildren are not left with an \nenormous debt. But there are right ways to move toward a balanced \nbudget and there are wrong ways to try to do that and, unfortunately, \nPresident Bush's budget moves us exactly in the wrong direction.\n  As many Americans know, since President Bush has been in the White \nHouse, the middle class has been decimated, poverty has increased, and \nthe gap between the very wealthiest people in our society and everyone \nelse has grown wider. In fact, the United States now has by far the \nmost unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on \nEarth.\n  Sadly, the gap between the upper-income people, the wealthiest people \nin our country, and the middle class is increasingly making our country \nlook like a poor developing country. We have the same economic \nstructure, in terms of distribution of wealth and income, that \ncountries such as Brazil and Mexico have, rather than looking like \nother major industrialized countries in Europe, Scandinavia or in \nCanada.\n  I am aware a lot of facts and figures are thrown about on the floor \nof the Senate, but let me mention one fact I hope all Americans pay \nattention to, and that is that according to the latest statistics \navailable, the wealthiest 300,000 Americans--that is men, women, and \nchildren--take in more income than the bottom 150 million Americans. In \nother words, the upper one-tenth of 1 percent, 300,000 people, take in \nmore money than do the bottom 50 percent. One-tenth of 1 percent. Fifty \npercent. And that is what is going on in the American economy today.\n\n  Tragically, that gap between the superrich and everybody else is \ngrowing wider and wider every single year. For those people who live in \nthe bottom 90 percent of the population, the vast majority of our \ncitizens, their average income was $33,000 way back in 1973. Today, \ndespite all of the free trade agreements and globalization, despite all \nof the huge increases in technology, despite the significant growth in \nworker productivity, in inflation-accounted-for dollars, that $33,000 \nper year has declined to $29,000 a year, which is about a $75-a-week \npay cut.\n  That is what is going on in the economy today, and has been going on \nover the last three decades: people on top, doing phenomenally well; \npeople at the bottom, the situation is getting worse; people in the \nmiddle are getting squeezed, working longer hours for lower wages. And \nperhaps those trends tell us why in today's Washington Post a front-\npage story was headlined ``U.S. Concern Over Economy Is Highest In \nYear.'' That was the headline on the front page of the Washington Post \ntoday. The first line of that story tells us that ``The public views \nthe national economy now more negatively than at any point in nearly 15 \nyears.''\n  What is going on is that the American people are getting sick and \ntired--they are getting sick and tired--of paying $3.15 for a gallon of \ngas when ExxonMobil enjoys the highest profits in the history of the \nworld. They are tired of paying outrageously high home heating costs. \nThey are tired of losing their health insurance. They are tired of \nlosing their pensions. They are tired of not being able to find \naffordable childcare for their kids. They are tired of seeing their \nkids come out of college $20,000 or $30,000 in debt and not able to \nfind decent-paying jobs.\n  And not only are they tired, they are worried. They are worried that \nfor the first time in the modern history of this great country--despite \nthe fact that so many people are working so hard, they are worried that \ntheir kids will have a lower standard of living than they do. They are \nworried that the American dream, which is what this country has always \nbeen about--the dream which says that if parents work hard, their kids \nwill do better than they do--they are worried that dream is being lost.\n  That is why there is so much deep concern about the economy. It is \nnot just health care, it is not just the loss of pensions, it is not \nonly outrageously high prices when you fill up your car, and it is not \nonly home heating oil; it is the fact that when you go shopping, what \nyou are doing is buying products made in China and Mexico that used to \nbe made in the United States. Many American people understand that we \nare never going to have a great economy if we are not producing the \nproducts we need and the people throughout the world need.\n  The American people understand that there is something profoundly \nwrong when 20, 25 years ago the largest employer in the United States \nwas General Motors--manufacturer of cars--that paid workers good wages, \ngood benefits, and there was a strong union, and today the largest \nemployer in the United States is Wal-Mart, with low wages, minimal \nbenefits, and vehemently antiunion.\n  The American people are getting the point that people such as \nPresident Bush work tirelessly on behalf of the wealthy and the \npowerful. But who is standing up for the people who make our country go \nevery day--for the cops and the firemen and the farmers and the people \nwho work in factories and the nurses and the doctors? Who is standing \nup for those people? Maybe the time is now for us to begin standing up \nfor those people.\n  In the midst of all of this, the President has brought forth a budget \nthat punishes working people, punishes poor people, but says to the \nwealthiest people in this country, the people who have now had it so \ngood since the late 1920s, and says to them: Hey, I--the President--am \ngoing to help you. In his budget the President wants to repeal the \nestate tax, which would provide $1 trillion in tax relief to the \nwealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent. Let me say that again. Over a 20-\nyear period, $1 trillion in tax relief to the wealthiest three-tenths \nof 1 percent of our population.\n  That is what this budget, this Robin-Hood-in-reverse budget, is all \nabout. If you are old and trying to survive on Social Security, and if \nyou are going to go cold this winter and next winter, the President \nwants to cut back on the heating assistance you receive. If you are a \nlow-income American, or perhaps an American without any health \ninsurance right now, the President wants to cut back on Medicaid and \nMedicare. If you are an American who lives in a home that lacks \ninsulation, and if you are putting money into your heating bill and \nthat heat is going out your poorly insulated home, it is going out the \nwindow, going out the roof, you have a President who wants to \ncompletely eliminate the low-income weather assistance program. If you \nare a veteran who has put your life on the line defending this country, \nthe President wants to make it harder for you to access VA health care \nby substantially increasing your fees. But if you\n\n[[Page S596]]\n\nare a billionaire, the President is all there for you. If you are one \nof the wealthiest families in America, in this budget the President has \nbrought forth today, you are going to get huge tax breaks. Let me cite \none example of how preposterous this scenario is.\n\n  One of the wealthiest families in America is the Walton family. The \nWalton family, as I think most people know, owns Wal-Mart. This one \nfamily is worth, it is estimated, a combined $82 billion. There are a \nnumber of sons and daughters, but combined they are worth about $82 \nbillion--one family. Incredible as it may sound, under the President's \nproposal of completely eliminating the estate tax, that one family \nwould receive over $30 billion in tax breaks.\n  So here we are. If you are old and can't afford to heat your home, we \nare going to cut the program that keeps you warm. If you are sick and \nyou have no health insurance, we are going to cut the program that \ngives you access to a doctor. If you are living in a home where you are \nlosing all kinds of heat through poor insulation, we are not going to \nhelp you. If you are a veteran who has served your country, we are \ngoing to raise fees for you to get into a VA hospital or a clinic. But \nif you are one of the wealthiest families in America, we are going to \ngive you $30 billion in tax breaks.\n  I say this without glee, but President Bush will probably go down in \nhistory as one of the least popular Presidents this country has ever \nhad. And you don't need to know anything more to understand why that is \nso. A President who would give hundreds of billions in tax breaks to \nmillionaires and billionaires and then cut back on the needs of working \nfamilies, senior citizens, and veterans is not a President who is \nrepresenting the vast majority of our people. I will do everything that \nI can as a member of the Budget Committee to not only make sure \nPresident Bush's budget is not implemented, but I will work with my \ncolleagues to fashion a budget that begins to address the real needs of \nthe American people.\n  There is great disenchantment in this country about what is going on \nhere in Washington, but I also note there is great hope out there. \nThere is a belief that if we come together as a people, if we remember \nwhere we came from, if we are prepared to uphold the values that have \nmade us a great country, if we are willing to stand up to the powerful \nspecial interests who have so much influence over what goes on in this \ninstitution--if we can do those things--not only can we once again \ncreate a great middle class, not only can we once again protect the \nmost vulnerable people in our society, but perhaps, more importantly, \nwe can once again give the American people a faith in their Government \nthat they presently lack. That is something we must do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I am pleased to support the Senate's \nbipartisan legislation designed to stimulate the economy and benefit \nworking families, assist seniors and veterans, provide some relief for \nthe unemployed, and encourage business and energy investments. I know \nthat there are numerous families throughout the Nation who have found \nthemselves working harder and having less discretionary income due to \nincreases in living expenses such as gasoline and food costs. In my \nhome state of Hawaii where the cost of living is already high, \nespecially due to housing, families are struggling. they, like the rest \nof the Nation, have been hit hard by the decline in the economy. While \nHawaii's unemployment is not as high as in other parts of the Nation. \nit is not uncommon for individuals in Hawaii to work two or three jobs \njust to provide their families with food and shelter and to have \nmultiple generations living under the same roof in order to save money.\n  One of the key provisions of the Senate's economic stimulus package \nis to put money in the hands of low-income and middle-class individuals \nand families by offering a rebate of $500 per individual and $1000 per \ncouple, plus $300 for every child under the age of 17. For the many \nfamilies in this Nation struggling to make ends meet, these rebates \nwill help ease the financial pressures they are currently facing. Far \ntoo often, due to the downturn in our Nation's economy, families are \nfinding that they simply cannot afford important, basic needs. \nConsequently, they are forced to make very difficult decisions and even \nmore difficult sacrifices. More and more Americans are relying on high-\ninterest credit cards, not to buy luxuries but just to provide daily \nnecessities. The rebates included in the Senate package will help \nfamilies pay down those bills and provide much needed financial relief.\n  The Senate Finance Committee's package also improves upon the House-\npassed bill by extending these rebates to senior citizens and disabled \nveterans. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I am \nstrongly supportive of provisions in this bill that improve the House \nversion of the bill by including hundreds of thousands of disabled vets \nin the stimulus package. It is vitally important that we ensure that \nour Nation's wounded warriors and their families who have sacrificed so \nmuch are given the assistance they need. I am pleased to support the \nextension of benefits in the Senate Finance bill to 20 million senior \ncitizens living on Social Security. For many low-income senior \ncitizens, whose sole income is their monthly Social Security check, a \nrebate check could provide much needed relief in addition to providing \nfurther stimulus to the country's economy.\n  In addition to the rebates included in the Finance Committee package, \nanother important provision is the extension of unemployment benefits. \nI know that for many workers who have found themselves out of jobs due \nto layoffs or business failures, unemployment benefits provide a much-\nneeded bridge to get them over the immediate economic financial crises \nuntil they can find employment. Providing an additional 13 weeks of \nunemployment benefits for individuals who have been caught in the \neconomic downturn and another 13 weeks of benefits for workers in \nstates with high rates of unemployment will go a long way toward \nproviding the support they need as they look for new jobs in this \ndifficult economic environment.\n  I am also supportive of provisions in the Senate economic stimulus \npackage that will encourage businesses to invest. Increasing the \ncarryback period for net operating losses from 2 to 5 years, for \nexample, will benefit the housing industry by allowing builders to \navoid selling land and houses at greatly reduced prices and enable less \ncostly financing. In addition, provisions to extend renewable energy \nand energy efficiency tax cuts for a year will help boost the economy \nby generating new employment opportunities. Given the growing demand \nfor energy coupled with rising prices, it is critical to America's \neconomy that we provide incentives to invest in clean energy \nproduction.\n  As the Senate considers this bill, I will continue to work to ensure \nthat the economic stimulus package passed by Congress is structured to \nhelp hard-working men and women who find it increasingly difficult to \nmake ends meet. We must see that a broad segment of the population, \nincluding the unemployed, senior citizens, and disabled veterans, \nreceives assistance and that business and environmental investment is \nencouraged. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting the \nSenate version of the economic stimulus package.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S596-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

SPAIN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I remember being on the Senate floor on \nSeptember 12, 2001. That was the day after the horrendous attack on our \nNation. It was the only time in my 33 years here that I can remember \nthe public galleries being closed. There was an unprecedented amount of \nsecurity around the Capitol. But every Senator came onto the floor of \nthe Senate that day. We wanted to indicate to the world that this \nsymbol of democracy would not close. I especially remember\n\n[[Page S597]]\n\nthat the closed visitors galleries, however, contained two people: \nformer Ambassador James Spain and my wife Marcelle.\n  This memory, and so many more, came back to me in January of this \nyear when Ambassador Spain's son Stephen informed me that my dear \nfriend Jim had died on January 2 in Wilmington, NC.\n  It is hard to think of anyone in public life I have met during my \nyears as a Senator who is as memorable as Jim Spain. He has touched me \nwith his dignity, his sense of humanity, and his honesty as no one else \ncould. He was the truest of public servants--one who cared for his \ncountry and those his position influenced actually more than he cared \nfor himself.\n  I first met Jim decades ago when he was the Ambassador to Turkey and \nI visited him in Ankara. Even though Turkey was under military rule at \nthat time, he invited people from across the political spectrum to meet \nwith the two of us at his residence. It was there I saw the abilities \nof one of the finest Ambassadors to ever represent our great country as \nhe brought these sometimes adversaries together to talk in what he \ncalled his ``game room'' or play room.\n  Turkey was under a dusk-to-dawn curfew at that time, but I had to \nleave in the middle of the night to get back to the United States. Jim \narranged for a military escort to take me and to open the airport so \nthat my military plane I was using could leave. I still remember ``His \nExcellency,'' as so many of the Turks called him, waving goodbye from \nhis front door in his pajamas, his bathrobe, and his slippers about 2 \na.m.\n  We kept in close touch when he returned to Washington, through his \nambassadorship in Sri Lanka and later retirement. He and Marcelle and I \nonce sat up talking half the night when he was a guest in our house. \nAfter every one of these meetings, I would tell others that I felt I \nhad been with a close member of my own family and my conscience had \nbeen touched in a very special and very helpful way.\n  I wish every member of the Foreign Service could read Ambassador \nSpain's book entitled ``In Those Days.'' I was privileged to write, \nalong with John Kenneth Galbraith and Father Andrew Greeley, a cover \nblurb for that book. In my blurb I said:\n\n       From boyhood glimpses of a strutting Al Capone, to post-war \n     Japan, a stint with the CIA, and a fascinating foreign \n     service career--this is a life worth living. History is \n     shaped by extraordinary people like Ambassador Spain. His \n     Irish eloquence makes the difficult look easy while his \n     humanity touches your soul.\n\n  Another wrote:\n\n       Jim Spain's contribution in assisting CIA Director Allen \n     Dulles to make President Eisenhower get the pronunciation of \n     Prime Minister Nehru's first name right during the latter's \n     official visit to Washington is a typical foreign service \n     moment. ``Heady stuff for a 28-year-old,'' noted Jim Spain.\n\n  Even today I cannot pronounce former Prime Minister Nehru's first \nname correctly. I cannot think of the number of times when traveling \nwith Ambassador Spain he whispered in my ear to make sure I got the \nnames correct.\n  In the end, it was his humanity that touched us all. It was as though \nhis great intelligence and ability was only the pedestal to allow the \nhumanity to shine through.\n  Tissa Jayatilaka--and I do wish Ambassador Spain was here to make \nsure I come anywhere close to pronouncing this name correctly--wrote:\n\n       News reached us over the weekend past that Jim Spain's time \n     on earth had run out. Heaven knows this world of ours cannot \n     afford to do without human beings of his caliber and yet \n     there is only so much that an individual can do for humanity \n     before he, too, moves unto the dusty descend.\n       Ambassador Spain was one of the most decent, gentle, \n     caring, and perceptive human beings I have known to-date.\n       He was unfailingly generous and kind to his fellow-\n     companions on this bittersweet journey on earth that we \n     travel on for a while. It was indeed a privilege to have \n     worked with him briefly and shared a long and fruitful \n     friendship with him thereafter.\n       I first came to know him during my days in The Colombo Plan \n     Bureau in the 1980s. He had arrived in Colombo some time in \n     1985 to head the U.S. Mission here. Until then, Sri Lanka was \n     the only South Asian country he had not lived in before.\n       He was to make up for this in the years ahead, when in \n     1989, consequent to his retirement from the U.S. foreign \n     service, he made Sri Lanka his home.\n       This decision of Ambassador Spain was all the more \n     remarkable because the last several years of the 80s was a \n     period when most Sri Lankans were seeking to run away from \n     their land of birth.\n       Jim Spain not only stayed behind, but also did a great deal \n     discreetly to assist this beleaguered country of ours to save \n     itself from self-destruction.\n\n  This person goes on to write:\n\n        . . . It was several years later that I came to know that \n     only a couple of years prior to his coming to Colombo that \n     Ambassador Spain himself had suffered a monumental personal \n     loss.\n       Consequent to a memorable family reunion after some years \n     during Thanksgiving 1983 at a resort in West Virginia, Jim \n     Spain, his wife Edith and daughter Sikandra bade farewell to \n     their sons and brothers Patrick, William and Stephen and \n     began to wend their way through country roads back to \n     Washington.\n       Near Leesburg, Virginia, their light fiber-glass car was \n     hit by a huge old station wagon going 85 miles per hour, \n     driven by a local football player who was not wearing the \n     glasses his license prescribed. He was not even scratched, \n     but the Spains had to be evacuated to the Washington Hospital \n     Trauma Center by helicopter.\n       By next morning, Sikandra was dead, Edith was clinging to \n     life in an intensive-care unit and Jim was immobilized with a \n     variety of fractures and bruises.\n       A few weeks later, Edith died.\n       With the help of his sons and his strong spirituality, Jim \n     Spain bore his irreparable loss with fortitude.\n\n  I read all that into the Record so my colleagues would know what a \nman he was.\n  I have lost a good friend. Marcelle and I send our condolences to his \nsons Patrick, Stephen, and William; their wives, Barbara, Beth, and \nAnu; to his grandchildren Jeanne, James, Aidan, Katherine, and Rachel; \nand to all within his family.\n  For my part, I know I have gained more from knowing him than I could \never say.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Ambassador \nSpain's biography.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Ambassador Spain was born in 1926 in Chicago, Illinois, \n     where he attended St. Brendan's Parochial School and Quigley \n     Seminary where his classmates included priest/author Andrew \n     Greeley and ``Vatican Banker'' Paul Marcinkus. He received a \n     masters degree from the University of Chicago and a PhD from \n     Columbia University.\n       Ambassador Spain served in World War II, for a time serving \n     on General Douglas MacArthur's staff as a photographer in \n     occupied Japan. He entered the Foreign Service in 1951, and \n     spent the entirety of his career in government service. His \n     assignments took him to Pakistan, Turkey, Tanzania, the UN, \n     and Sri Lanka.\n       His first post was as Vice Consul in Karachi in 1951. \n     Following that he returned to the U.S. where he lived, mostly \n     in Washington, DC, until 1969. He was appointed as Charge \n     d'Affaires to Pakistan in 1969, Consul General in Istanbul \n     from 1970-1972, Deputy Chief of Mission in Ankara (1972-\n     1974), Ambassador to Tanzania (1975-1979) and Deputy \n     Ambassador to the United Nations under Andrew Young briefly \n     in 1979, Ambassador to Turkey from 1980-1981, and finally as \n     Ambassador to Sri Lanka from 1985-1988. He retired as a \n     Career Minister in the Foreign Service and remained in Sri \n     Lanka until 2006, when he returned to the United States. He \n     has been living in Wilmington, NC since then.\n       He was the author of numerous books, including In Those \n     Days, American Diplomacy in Turkey, The Way of the Pathans, \n     Pathans of the Latter Day, and a series of novels featuring \n     Dodo Dillon. He contributed articles on foreign affairs to a \n     variety of publications.\n       Ambassador Spain lived a distinguished life of service to \n     his country and dedication to his friends and family. He was \n     a remarkably able diplomat who drew on his own odyssey from \n     an impoverished youth on the South Side of Chicago--the son \n     of a streetcar conductor and a seamstress who were Irish \n     immigrants--to attending receptions with Presidents and Prime \n     Ministers to inspire those around him to seek the best for \n     themselves and their country. He met adversity with strength, \n     rudeness with grace, and challenges with enthusiasm. He \n     played pivotal roles in maintaining and strengthening the \n     United States alliance with Turkey, in bringing about a \n     peaceful transition to majority rule in Zimbabwe, and \n     strengthening the United States' relations with all the \n     countries of the subcontinent. He was most proud not of the \n     headlines that he had a part in, but of the headlines that \n     never had to be written, thanks to his work defusing tensions \n     between nations.\n       One of his earliest memories of Chicago was being taken by \n     his father to watch Al Capone walk through City Hall. His \n     glimpse of the legendary gangster impressed many, among them \n     Jawarlahal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, who once \n     held up a reception line just to hear about it.\n       James W. Spain, 81, died on January 2, 2008 of natural \n     causes in Wilmington, NC.\n       He was very pleased to have outlived Sen. Jesse Helms of \n     North Carolina, but sorely\n\n[[Page S598]]\n\n     disappointed not to have lived to see the next Democrat in \n     the White House.\n       He was preceded in death by his beloved wife Edith and \n     daughter Sikandra. He is survived by his sons, Patrick, \n     Stephen and William and his grandchildren, Jeanne, James, \n     Aidan, Katherine, and Rachel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S598-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the flags are at half-mast today in the \nvillage of Tinley Park, IL.\n  They will be lowered for 5 days, 1 day for each victim of the tragic \nand senseless shootings that took place last Saturday.\n  Five lives were cut short that morning: Carrie Chiuso, of Frankfort, \nIL, a social worker and counselor of high school students at Homewood-\nFlossmoor High School, dedicated to her community and to her family; \nRhoda McFarland, of Joliet, who had served as a nurse practitioner in \nthe U.S. Air Force and who was engaged to be married; Jennifer Bishop \nof South Bend, IN, a nurse who had worked for 13 years saving lives at \nSouth Bend Memorial Hospital; Connie Woolfolk, of Flossmor, IL, a \nworking mother, with a 16-year-old and a 10-year-old; And Sarah \nSzafranski, of Oak Forest, only 22 years old, a young woman who had \njust recently graduated from Northern Illinois University and started \non a promising career.\n  We offer our support and our prayers to the friends and families of \nthese victims. We mourn with them in their time of loss.\n  There are also reports that a sixth victim was shot in this robbery \nattempt and that she has survived. Our thoughts and prayers are with \nher and her family as well.\n  An investigation by law enforcement authorities is underway, and we \nhope that the person or persons responsible for these killings will be \nswiftly brought to justice.\n  Edward Zabrocki, the mayor of Tinley Park, said, ``This is a tragedy \nthat should not happen to any town.'' He is right.\n  After a gun-related tragedy, we often hear that now is not the time \nto talk about gun violence in America. But when is it time?\n  In America, we lose 81 people to gun violence every day--81 people a \nday, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.\n  In 2004, the latest year for which the Centers for Disease Control \nhas complete information, 29,569 people died from gun violence in \nAmerica. That is more than twice as many people who died that year from \nHIV/AIDS.\n  And that doesn't count those who are wounded by gunfire. In 2004, \n64,389 people were injured by gun violence. That is an average of 176 \npeople every single day.\n  Firearm violence is at epidemic levels in this country. No matter who \nwe are or how safe we think we are, any of us could be among the dozens \nof victims each day who end up on the wrong side of a gun.\n  We need to change the way we talk about gun violence in this country. \nIt is time to move past the stereotypes of ``gun nuts'' and ``gun \ngrabbers'' pitted against each other. The majority of those who own \nguns in this country obtained their guns legally and use them lawfully.\n  But we also need to recognize that every year tens of thousands of \nshots in this country are fired at human beings. And while some are \nfired lawfully in self-defense or in the line of duty, thousands of \ngunshots end with suicide, homicide, assault, or accidental death.\n  We need to reduce these violent shootings, without placing undue \nburdens on the legal uses of guns.\n  Here are some principles that should guide us:\n  No. 1, those who own guns have an obligation to store those guns \nsafely.\n  No. 2, those who sell guns have a duty to sell them only to those who \nare authorized by law to purchase them. Whether you are selling at a \nstore or a gun show, you should not turn your head the other way and \nignore a buyer's background.\n  No. 3, those of us who make laws have a duty to balance the rights of \npeople to own and use guns safely and legally with the need to prevent \ngun violence.\n  We have had too many funerals for Americans like Carrie Chiuso, Rhoda \nMcFarland, Jennifer Bishop, Connie Woolfolk, and Sarah Szafranski. Too \nmany American lives suddenly and brutally cut short. Gun violence is an \nepidemic in this country, and each of us needs to take seriously our \nresponsibility to end this violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S598-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Miller\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I give tribute to an American hero \nwho was killed in the line of duty while conducting combat operations \nfor Operation Enduring Freedom in Barikowt, Afghanistan. SSG Robert J. \nMiller was wounded by small arms fire and died from these injuries \nsustained on January 25, 2008. His bravery and selflessness will be \nremembered and honored. I extend my thoughts and prayers to his \nparents, Philip and Maureen Miller, and all his family and friends.\n  Robert Miller was born in Harrisburg, PA, and eventually found his \nway to the University of Iowa, where he attended his freshman year. \nMiller was an avid gymnast who aspired to be on the university's \ngymnastics team and was an enthusiastic fan of the Hawkeyes. After a \nyear of attending the University of Iowa, he decided to enlist in the \nU.S. Army in 2003. He earned a green beret from the special forces \nqualification course in 2005. During his years of service, he has been \nawarded numerous medals including the Army Commendation Medal with \nValor, Army Good Conduct Medal, and Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal, among others.\n  Staff Sergeant Miller was assigned to Company A of the 3rd Battalion, \n3rd Special Forces Group out of Fort Bragg, NC. He will be remembered \nfor his courageous sacrifice and excellent work ethic. His mother \nMaureen said it best: ``We're proud of what he did, and we loved what \nwe did. He died a hero.'' I ask my colleagues here in the Senate and \nall Americans to remember with gratitude and appreciation a brave \nsoldier, SSG Robert J. Miller.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S598-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S598-S599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SOCIAL SECURITY COLA PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, shortly before our adjournment last \nDecember, I was joined by several of my Senate colleagues in \nintroducing the Social Security COLA Protection Act of 2007. This \nlegislation will provide seniors with much-needed relief from steadily \nincreasing Medicare premiums and will ensure that their Social Security \ncost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, is available for other essential \nneeds such as food, housing, and energy.\n  I want to first thank Senators Boxer, Inouye, Leahy, Mikulski, \nMurray, Reed, Rockefeller,  and Salazar for joining me in this effort. \nRepresentative Herseth Sandlin introduced the companion bill today in \nthe House of Representatives, and I want to thank her for her \nleadership on this issue and other important topics to seniors in South \nDakota.\n  Sixteen percent of South Dakotans are Medicare beneficiaries. When \ncompared to a national average of 14 percent, it is clear that Medicare \npolicies significantly affect my home State. Many of these retirees \nlive on modest, fixed incomes and must pay close attention to their \nmonthly expenses. South Dakota's senior citizens worked very hard all \nof their lives as farmers, small business owners, teachers, and \nparents. In their retirement, all they are hoping for is an opportunity \nto enjoy a basic level of comfort and certainty.\n  Unfortunately, as the cost of health care continues to rise at an \nalarming rate, it becomes more and more difficult for seniors to \nachieve this sense of security during retirement. According to the \nKaiser Family Foundation, the United States spent about $2 trillion on \nhealth care in 2005, almost three times the $696 billion spent in 1990. \nThat $2 trillion represents 16 percent of the gross domestic product. \nThe rate at which our Nation's health care\n\n[[Page S599]]\n\nspending increases is also troubling; health care spending has exceeded \neconomic growth in every decade since the 1970s.\n  These increasing health care costs hit the pocketbook of every \nAmerican, but our senior citizens, many of whom live on fixed incomes, \nhave a particularly hard time making ends meet while health care costs \nclimb. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, recently \nannounced that the Medicare Part B premium, which covers seniors' \ndoctor visits and other nonhospital services, would increase 3.1 \npercent in 2008. CMS correctly noted in its press release that this is \nsmallest percentage increase in the Part B premium since 2001. However, \nCMS failed to point out that the amount seniors will pay for Part B \npremiums in 2008, $96.40, is more than double what they paid in 2000. \nOur Nation's seniors simply cannot continue to absorb these \nskyrocketing health care costs.\n  This doubling of Part B premiums occurred while many Medicare \nbeneficiaries incurred additional premium costs for the Part D \nprescription drug program. CMS estimates that premium costs for Part D \nwill average $25 per month. However, a recent analysis by the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation concludes that seniors enrolled in stand-alone \nprescription programs will experience a 17-percent increase in their \npremiums next year. Both Part D and Part B premiums generally are \ndeducted from a senior's Social Security check.\n  While seniors can expect a modest cost-of-living increase in their \nSocial Security benefits every year, this increase has not kept up with \nthe pace of increased health care costs and specifically Medicare \npremium costs. The Social Security Administration, SSA, announced that \nall Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, SSI, \nbeneficiaries would receive a 2.3-percent cost-of-living adjustment, \nCOLA, beginning in January 2008. Each year, Social Security benefits \nare updated based on the overall rate of inflation as calculated by the \nBureau of Labor Statistics. COLAs are not intended to provide anybody \nwith a ``raise'' but are instead intended to ensure that a \nbeneficiary's monthly payment has the same buying power that it had the \nyear before. A 2.3-percent increase isn't much but should help retirees \nand individuals with disabilities living on a fixed income survive as \nthe prices of food, housing, clothing, and other goods continue to \nincrease.\n  I know that Social Security beneficiaries need every penny of their \nCOLA, and it is important that rising Medicare costs not completely \nconsume the Social Security COLA. In 1986, a hold-harmless provision \ntook effect to ensure that no beneficiary's Medicare Part B premium \nincrease could exceed his or her Social Security COLA in any given \nyear. This ensured that no senior would receive a reduced Social \nSecurity check due to a Part B premium increase. However, this hold-\nharmless provision does not apply to Part D premiums, and the \nincreasing cost of both programs is quickly consuming any small \nincrease beneficiaries see in their Social Security checks. This policy \nis subjecting the incomes of retirees and individuals with disabilities \nto a tight squeeze. Without a legislative change, millions of retirees \nwill likely see much or all of their COLA wiped out by increases in \nMedicare premiums over the next several years. We owe it to America's \nseniors to protect the COLA from being completely consumed by Medicare \npremium increases.\n  This is why I have introduced the Social Security COLA Protection Act \nof 2007, which will protect retirees by ensuring that no more than 25 \npercent of a senior's COLA is absorbed by the increase in Medicare \npremiums. This important legislation will protect the financial \nsecurity of many retirees in my home State and across the country. I \nthank all of the Members who have introduced this bill with me and urge \nthe rest of my colleagues to join us in our effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S599-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S599-S600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SPENDING IDENTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing letter and attachment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: S. 2483, the National Forests, Parks, \n     Public Land, and Reclamation Projects Authorization Act of \n     2007, is a collection of 56 separate legislative measures \n     under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources. Forty-five consist of the text of separate bills \n     passed by the House of Representatives, nine are drawn from \n     separate subtitles of another House-passed bill, and one is a \n     House-passed concurrent resolution. Only one provision, \n     section 482, contains new matter that has not passed the \n     House of Representatives. A complete list of the House bills \n     (and their Senate companion measures, where they exist) was \n     printed in the Congressional Record on December 13, 2007, at \n     pages S15474-S15475.\n       I assembled the 56 measures into a single bill in order to \n     facilitate their consideration by the Senate. Although S. \n     2483 was placed on the Calendar without referral to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, most of the House \n     bills that make up S. 2483 have been reported, or ordered \n     reported, by the Committee.\n       Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate provides \n     that, before proceeding to the consideration of a bill, the \n     chairman of the committee of jurisdiction must certify that \n     each congressionally designated spending item in the bill and \n     the name of the Senator requesting it has been identified and \n     posted on a publicly accessible website. The term \n     ``congressionally designated spending item'' is broadly \n     defined, in pertinent part, to include ``a provision . . . \n     included primarily at the request of a Senator . . . \n     authorizing . . . a specific amount of discretionary budget \n     authority . . . for . . . expenditure with or to an entity, \n     or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional \n     district, other than through a statutory or administrative \n     formula-driven or competitive award process.''\n       Ten of the House-passed bills incorporated into S. 2483 \n     contain provisions authorizing the appropriation of specific \n     amounts targeted to specific entities or localities. These \n     authorizations are included in S. 2483 because they are part \n     of the House-passed text. No Senator submitted a request to \n     me to include them.\n       In the interest of furthering the transparency and \n     accountability of the legislative process, however, I have \n     posted a list of the specific authorizations in S. 2483 on \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources' website. The \n     list includes the name of the principal sponsor of the Senate \n     companion measure that corresponds to the House-passed bill. \n     A copy of the list is attached for your convenience.\n       In addition, I have asked the principal sponsor of the \n     Senate companion measure of each House bill contained in S. \n     2483 to certify that neither the Senator nor the Senator's \n     immediate family has a pecuniary interest in the item, and \n     have posted the certifications on the Committee's website. \n     All certifications received by the Committee pursuant to \n     paragraph 6 of Rule XLIV are posted on the Committee's \n     website as soon as practicable after they are received in \n     accordance with paragraph 6(b).\n       Thus, in accordance with Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of \n     the Senate, I hereby certify that each congressionally \n     directed spending item in S. 2483 has been identified through \n     a list and that the list was posted on the Committee's \n     publicly accessible website at approximately 2:30 p.m. on \n     February 4, 2008.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED \nSPENDING ITEM CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO RULE XLIV OF THE STANDING RULES \n                             OF THE SENATE\n\nS. 2483--The National Forests, Parks, Public Land, and Reclamation Act \n                                of 2007\n\n       Provisions in S. 2483 authorizing appropriations in a \n     specific amount for expenditure with or to an entity or \n     targeted to a specific State, locality, or congressional \n     district, other than through a statutory or administrative \n     formula-driven or competitive award process:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Senate bill\n              Section                        Program or entity                  State              sponsor\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 333(e)..........................

Madam President, the continued deadlock over \nLebanon's Presidency brings further instability to an important country \nin the Middle East. We cannot idly stand by as an emerging democracy \nwhose people have long ties to the United States teeters on the verge \nof collapse. The United States must turn the page on the Bush \nadministration's failed Lebanon policy and replace hollow rhetoric with \nsustained diplomatic engagement. We must work with our European and \nArab allies to foster a new Lebanese consensus around a stable and \ndemocratic Lebanon.\n  With the approach of the third anniversary of the assassination of \nformer Prime Minister Hariri, our thoughts are with the Lebanese people \nas they struggle against extremist forces and continued intervention in \ntheir national affairs by Syria and Iran. Across the broader Middle \nEast, the failures of the Bush administration are everywhere manifest. \nInstead of defeating extremists and elevating the cause of freedom, the \nadministration's Middle East record includes an unfinished war in \nAfghanistan; a war in Iraq that should have never been authorized that \nhas cost us precious lives, trillions of dollars, the readiness of our \nmilitary, and our standing in the world; a too-long neglected Israeli-\nPalestinian peace process; and an emboldened Iran taking advantage of \nwaning American influence throughout the region, and our refusal to use \ndirect diplomacy to advance our interests.\n  Add to this string of failures the state of affairs in deeply divided \nLebanon, once heralded by the President as a stepping stone in his \n``forward march of freedom.'' During its first term, the Bush \nadministration largely ignored the country. It took the brutal \nassassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in February of 2005 to \nwake it from its stupor. At that time, the administration acted \nappropriately and pressed the Syrians to end their oppressive presence \nin Lebanon and called for an international effort to identify and \npunish those responsible for the assassination.\n  But, as with many parts of the world, the administration trumpeted \nthe Cedar Revolution as its own success when the real credit should \nhave gone to the people of Lebanon. And, as is often the case, there \nwas no follow-through by the administration to consolidate democratic \ngains, and momentum was lost.\n  As a result, the hope and opportunity for change that characterized \nLebanon 2 years ago has been replaced by cynicism and renewed civil \nstrife. In that time, Lebanon has witnessed a string of political \nassassinations aimed at critics of Syrian influence that threaten to \nundermine the very foundations of its democracy; a devastating war \nbetween Israel and Hizbullah; a deepening political standoff between \nthe government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and the opposition; and \na long and bloody confrontation between Lebanon's army and an al-Qaida-\ninspired group of extremists.\n  It is time to engage in diplomatic efforts to help build a new \nLebanese consensus. These efforts should focus on the need for \nelectoral reform, an end to the current corrupt patronage system, and \nthe development of the economy so as to provide for a fair distribution \nof services, opportunities, and employment.\n  The United States can play a positive role in helping achieve this \nconsensus. We should support the efforts of our Arab allies and work \nwith them to promote compromise among Lebanon's disparate groups. We \nshould support the implementation of all U.N. reforms including the \ntribunal established to try those accused of assassinating former Prime \nMinister Hariri. We should work with our European allies and the \nSarkozy government in France in calling for an all-party intra-Lebanese \ndialogue. Finally, we must make clear that part of any national compact \nmust be the disarmament of all militias.\n  Moreover, we must support the implementation of U.N. Security Council \nresolutions that reinforce Lebanon's sovereignty, especially resolution \n1701 banning the provision of arms to Hizbullah, which is violated by \nIran and Syria. As we push for national consensus, we should continue \nto support the democratically elected government of Prime Minister \nSiniora, strengthen the Lebanese army, and insist on the disarming of \nHizbullah, before it drags Lebanon into another unnecessary war. And it \nis vital that we work with the international community and private \nsector to rebuild Lebanon and get its economy back on its feet.\n  As the tragic events of the past few years make clear, what happens \nin Lebanon affects other American priorities in the region, including \nthe fight against al-Qaida and other extremists, as well as \nopportunities for regional stability and peace. To neglect Lebanon \nwould not only serve our interests badly, it would fail a nation whose \npeople have suffered too much for too long a nation that could now be \non the edge of a new precipice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S600-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S600-S601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n                                  ____\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF EARL GREENBERG\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to honor the life of an \namazing Californian, Earl Greenberg. Earl recently died from cancer in \nhis adopted home of Palm Springs. He will be missed by so many there \nand by all those whose lives he touched around the Nation.\n  Earl Greenberg's life was marked by an enduring sense of optimism \nthat all things were possible. In the entertainment industry, he \ncreated hit television shows and won an Emmy Award. But his \ncontributions went far beyond the entertainment and business worlds. \nEarl worked every day to make people's lives better, and he had the \nunique gift of convincing countless others to join him in that noble \ntask.\n  In the desert region, Earl led in the creation of the Palm Springs \nInternational Film Festival, which has become a truly international \nevent, drawing hundreds of thousands to see the very best in film.\n  In 1994, when his partner, Rick Weiss, died of AIDS, Earl turned his \nprofound grief into action to change lives. He created the Weiss \nApartments in Santa Monica where people with HIV/AIDS can live. He also \ncreated the Rick Weiss Humanitarian Awards to raise funds to help \norganizations that seek a cure and help people living with HIV/AIDS.\n  His good works did not stop there. Earl was also active with the \nDesert Cancer Society, Desert AIDS Project, Barbara Sinatra Children's \nCenter, Angel View Crippled Children Foundation, Shelter from the \nStorm, AIDS Assistance Program, the Stroke Activity Center, and \nEisenhower Medical Center, giving both his time and money to improve \nlives and restore health.\n  My heart goes out to all of Earl's loved ones. Earl's business and \nlife partner is David Peet. Together they shared a love for one another \nand a true zest for life. I know David will do whatever he can to \ncontinue Earl's work. Earl was a loving father. He is survived by his \nson, Ari Greenberg, daughter, Kathryn Claire, grandchildren, and \nbrothers. I share my deepest condolences for their loss.\n  Meeting Earl was such an honor for me, and watching him work was \nalways a learning and inspiring experience. While so many in the desert \nand across California grieve today because of his loss, we know that \ncountless people are\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\nliving better lives because of his generosity and philanthropy. And \nthere is no greater legacy than that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S601-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO IRVING HERRMAN\n\n Mr. BROWN. Madam President, Mr. Irving Herrman, member to the \n``greatest generation,'' will be 90 years old on February 5, 2008. He \nwas born in Akron, OH, the second of three sons of Armand and Therese \nHerrman and a first-generation American. His parents were Eastern \nEuropean Jews who came to this country at the end of the 19th century.\n  Mr. Herrman graduated from South High School in Akron and attended \nthe University of Akron. He began working for Mr. Milton Radney until \nhe joined the Army Air Corps and served during World War II; he was \nstationed in England. It was in England where he met his wife, Vera \nGrace Cressey. They married on March 19, 1945, and returned to Akron \nand then Cuyahoga Falls after the war, where they raised a beautiful \nfamily together.\n  Upon returning to the Akron area, Mr. Herrman resumed his position \nwith the Radney Cigarette Company where he managed the office. He \nremained with the company until he retired in 1982. He then worked \nparttime for H.R. Block until 1998. Mrs. Herrman died in 2000. Mr. \nHerrman loves his family dearly. He has two daughters and sons-in law, \nBrenda H. and Steven Lipp and Judith H. and Fred Jenkins; he has six \ngrandchildren: Emily Lipp Sirota, Zach Lipp, Nate Lipp, Jake Plattner, \nRachel Plattner and Maggie Plattner.\n  Mr. Herrman is an active and beloved member of the community. He has \nbeen a member of Temple Israel for over 50 years. He has been a \nlongtime member of the Hakoah Club at the Jewish Community Center, \nholding every office in that organization, including president. He is \nalso a member of the Jewish War Veterans, holding offices in that \norganization, as well. In his retirement, he volunteered at local \nhospitals. One of Mr. Herrman's favorite pastimes is bowling. He won \nmany competitions and rolled a 300 game in league play. He is also an \navid ping-pong player and continues to enjoy golf and travel. But his \nfavorite activity of all is spending time with friends and family.\n  Mr. Herrman's life is one that represents the ``greatest \ngeneration:'' a life of family and service to country and community. It \nis people like Mr. Herrman who have built this country and made it \ngreat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S601-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CELEBRATING LULAC'S 78TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I appreciate this opportunity to \njoin my many friends from the Hispanic community in Indiana and across \nthe country as we celebrate the 78th anniversary of the founding of the \nLeague of United Latin American Citizens, better known as LULAC. This \nis a significant milestone and one in which LULAC's members should take \ngreat pride.\n  Since its inception on February 17, 1929, in Corpus Christi, TX, \nLULAC has championed the cause of Hispanic-Americans in education, \nemployment, economic development, and civil rights. To carry out this \nmission, LULAC has developed a comprehensive set of nationwide programs \nfostering educational attainment, job training, housing, scholarships, \ncitizenship, and voter registration. Through the years, LULAC's \ndedication to fostering greater opportunities for young people through \nits scholarship opportunities has been remarkable. It has enabled \nthousands to pursue and reach their higher education goals.\n  Today, LULAC is recognized as the largest and oldest Hispanic civil \nrights and service organization in the United States. LULAC's \ncommitment to the advancement of Latinos through its 700 chapters \nnationwide has served as a model to many other emerging coalitions.\n  Millions of Hispanic-Americans have worked tirelessly to provide for \ntheir families, strengthen their communities, and enrich our national \nculture. I wish LULAC and its members every success as they work on \nbehalf of Hispanic-Americans across our State and Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S601-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communication was laid before the Senate, together with \naccompanying papers, reports, and documents, and was referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-4880.

A bill to amend chapter 1 of title 17, United States Code, \nto provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain \nnonprofit organizations to display live football games, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation which \nwould modify the limitations on churches showing the Super Bowl under \nthe NFL copyright franchise. Churches across the country were notified \nby the NFL not to show the Super Bowl on a big screen because it \ninfringed their copyright. There is an exception under the copyright \nlaws for bars. It is anomalous that you can go to a bar and see the \nSuper Bowl, but you cannot go to a church for a social gathering and do \nthe same. This legislation will correct that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my full statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nIntroduction of Legislation Exempting Religious Establishments From the \n            Public Performance Right for Sports Programming\n\n       Few images are more distinctly American than that of a \n     religious community coming together not only in prayer but in \n     fellowship to watch a major sporting event. For years, houses \n     of worship across this country have opened up their doors and \n     welcomed their congregation into their halls to watch the \n     Super Bowl. They have provided families with an alternative \n     to going to the local bar down the street to cheer for their \n     favorite team. However, if the National Football League has \n     its way, such gatherings will come to an end.\n       A strict reading of the copyright code prohibits virtually \n     anyone from bringing a large group of people together and \n     watching the Super Bowl. The one exception to this general \n     rule is ``food service and drinking establishments.'' This \n     exemption allows sports bars to show a sporting event, so \n     long as they do so on screens that do not exceed fifty-five, \n     55, inches. Although the law is nearly impossible to enforce \n     for Super Bowl parties held in places other than food service \n     and drinking establishments, the NFL has turned its sights on \n     churches and other houses of worship, which use the large \n     screens normally reserved for displaying hymns to show the \n     Super Bowl to their congregation.\n       Over the past several years, the NFL has begun sending \n     churches across the country cease-and-desist letters, warning \n     them not to show the game on their big-screen televisions and \n     threatening them with a copyright infringement suit if they \n     do. These religious establishments--many of which do not have \n     enough money to even think about defending themselves against \n     a giant such as the NFL--have had little choice but to shut \n     down these gatherings.\n       This is unfortunate because many houses of worship have \n     used these events to reach out to their members, as well as \n     potential new members, particularly young people. As Reverend \n     Thomas Omholt, senior pastor of St. Paul's Lutheran in \n     Washington, DC, stated in a recent Washington Post article, \n     ``It takes people who are not coming frequently, or who have \n     fallen away, and shows them that the church can still have \n     some fun.'' These churches do not charge their members to \n     watch the game nor have they used them as fundraisers. \n     Rather, these events provide churches with a means of \n     connecting with the greater community and new potential \n     members of their congregation. The uniqueness of these events \n     is underscored by the fact that these churches do not use the \n     Academy Awards or other popular television programming as a \n     means of outreach.\n       When Congress created the sports bar exemption in 1998, \n     they did so based on the rationale that the display of \n     copyrighted performances--such as football games--in sports \n     bars and similar establishments did not negatively impact the \n     overall viewership for the game and value of the rights to \n     the game. The same rationale applies to churches. Allowing \n     churches to show the game would not diminish the overall \n     viewership for the Super Bowl. If anything, it increases the \n     viewership by making it a social event and bringing people \n     out to watch the game who might not have watched it at home \n     or in a bar.\n       Today, I am introducing legislation that will create a new \n     exemption for religious establishments. This legislation will \n     provide churches and other houses of worship with \n     the protection that they need to gather to watch the Super \n     Bowl without fear of being sued for copyright \n     infringement. This exemption will have limitations. For \n     example, in order to qualify for the exemption, a church \n     may not charge a fee to view the game. This will ensure \n     that religious establishments do not unfairly profit from \n     the NFL's copyright. Further, the exemption only applies \n     to the live broadcast of a professional football game at \n     the church or house of worship. A church may not tape the \n     game to show at a later date or rebroadcast the game to \n     another location. In other words, the legislation simply \n     provides churches with a limited yet justifiable exemption \n     to allow them to bring their congregation together to \n     watch the Super Bowl.\n       I am aware that some may argue that this bill implicates \n     constitutional concerns. This is not the first time that we \n     have recognized the unique needs of the religious community \n     in the Copyright Code. Indeed, the section of the Copyright \n     Code that we are amending already has an exemption for houses \n     of worship and other religious assemblies for the use of \n     copyrighted works of a religious nature. Although the \n     Constitution does not require the creation of an exception in \n     this case, it is reasonable to pursue one. In preparing this \n     measure, my staff has researched the issue and spoken with \n     some of the foremost experts in the field of First Amendment \n     law. They share our view that this legislation appears \n     consistent with the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. \n     This legislation will not further entangle Government with \n     religion but instead accommodates the needs of houses of \n     worship and recognizes their important role in the \n     communities they serve.\n       In a time when our country is divided by war and anxious \n     about a fluctuating economy, these type of events give people \n     a reason to come together in the spirit of camaraderie. We, \n     Congress, need to recognize the unique need that these events \n     satisfy and provide religious establishments with the \n     protection that they need. I urge my colleagues to join me in \n     this effort.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

I know the managers are interested to move ahead, so I \nask unanimous consent that the full text of my statement be printed in \nthe Record, along with an article published, which I wrote, in the \nPhiladelphia Tribune on January 27 of this year.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Honoring the Late Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr.\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to join \n     Senator Casey in introducing a resolution to pay tribute to \n     the late Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr.\n        Judge Higginbotham was a Philadelphia lawyer, legal \n     scholar, jurist and statesman who did not give in to \n     prejudice, despair, or age. From his appointment at the age \n     of 35 to the federal bench until his death at age 70, he \n     pursued civil rights, justice and equality for all Americans. \n     His message was positive--while much had been accomplished, \n     even more remains to be done. Initially studying engineering \n     in college, he said he was motivated to study law when he was \n     living off campus in an unheated attic, the outside \n     temperature hit zero, and the university president said he \n     was denying the request to allow Higginbotham to live in a \n     heated section of the dorm because ``the law doesn't require \n     us to.'' He said another incident was a second catalyst: when \n     traveling as a member of his college's debate team, \n     Higginbotham was denied a room in a hotel with his classmates \n     and was required to stay at a rat-infested ``colored YMCA.''\n       After his graduation from Yale Law School in 1952, \n     Higginbotham received a chilly reception and no job offers \n     from law firms in Philadelphia. Undeterred, he began his \n     career as a law clerk for Judge Curtis Bok of the \n     Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. Having demonstrated \n     himself to be a capable and intelligent lawyer, he was hired \n     by then district attorney Richardson Dilworth. In 1954, he \n     left the office to become a founding member of the first \n     African American law firm in Philadelphia: Norris, Schmidt, \n     Green, Harris, and Higginbotham. From 1960 to 1962, he \n     continued to advance civil rights by serving as president of \n     the Philadelphia chapter of the NAACP.\n       The Senate confirmed Judge Higginbotham's appointment to \n     the federal bench in 1964, despite procedural obstacles in \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee. When he parked his car on his \n     first day as a judge, a guard made a derogatory comment and \n     told him the lot was reserved for judges. Judge Higginbotham \n     later described the incident as ``typical of a lot of things \n     which have happened to both minorities and to women.'' \n     Indeed, Higginbotham was also a strong advocate for women's \n     rights. As the first African American trustee of Yale, he \n     pushed for opening the University to women. His first law \n     clerk was Eleanor Holmes, who later became Eleanor Holmes \n     Norton, who currently serves as the Delegate to the U.S. \n     House of Representatives for the District of Columbia.\n       Judge Higginbotham was a prolific writer who focused on \n     facts and careful legal analysis. In his nearly three decades \n     as a judge, Judge Higginbotham authored more than 600 \n     published opinions, taught at the University of Pennsylvania, \n     and wrote important books on the history of race in America--\n     books such as ``In the Matter of Color'' and ``Shades of \n     Freedom''.

I am \n     grateful for the opportunity to have known this extraordinary \n     man and his passionate and steadfast dedication to civil \n     rights and the betterment of this country. As we celebrate \n     Black History Month, I am honored to co-sponsor with my \n     colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, a resolution \n     honoring the lifetime achievement of the late Judge A. Leon \n     Higginbotham, Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Philadelphia Tribune, Jan. 27, 2008]\n\n                           Leon Higginbotham\n\n                           (By Arlen Specter)\n\n       Two weeks before his death in 1998, A. Leon Higginbotham, \n     Jr. appeared before the House Judiciary Committee to state \n     his view that the charges against President Clinton did not \n     warrant removal from office. When a Congressman said that \n     ``real Americans'' thought otherwise, Higginbotham replied: \n     ``Sir, my father was a laborer, my mother a domestic. I came \n     up the hard way. Don't lecture to me about the real \n     America.'' After the hearing, C-SPAN cameras showed committee \n     members and staffers surrounding Higginbotham to request \n     photographs, while he leaned on the cane he used following \n     three life-threatening operations.\n        Leon Higginbotham was a Philadelphia lawyer, legal \n     scholar, jurist and statesman who did not give in to \n     prejudice, despair, or age. From his appointment at the age \n     of 35 to the federal bench until his death at age 70, he \n     pursued civil rights, justice and equality for all Americans. \n     His message was a positive one: while much had been \n     accomplished, even more remains to be done. Initially \n     studying engineering in college, he said he was motivated to \n     study law when he was living off campus in an unheated attic, \n     the outside temperature hit zero, and the university \n     president denied the request to allow Higginbotham to live in \n     a heated section of the dorm because ``the law doesn't \n     require us to.'' He said another incident served as a \n     catalyst: when traveling as a member of his college's debate \n     team, Higginbotham was denied a room in a hotel with his \n     classmates and was required to stay at a rat-infested \n     ``colored YMCA.''\n        After his graduation from Yale Law School in 1952, \n     Higginbotham received a chilly reception and no job offers \n     from law firms in Philadelphia. Undeterred, he began his \n     career as a law clerk for Judge Curtis Bok of the \n     Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. Having demonstrated \n     himself to be a capable and intelligent lawyer, he was hired \n     by then District Attorney Richardson Dilworth. In 1954, he \n     left the office to become a member of the first African \n     American law firm in Philadelphia, Norris, Schmidt, Green, \n     Harris, and Higginbotham. From 1960 to 1962, he continued to \n     advance civil rights by serving as President of the \n     Philadelphia chapter of the NAACP.\n        The Senate confirmed Judge Higginbotham's appointment to \n     the federal bench in 1964, despite procedural obstacles in \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee. When he parked his car on his \n     first day as a judge, a guard yelled ``Hey, boy'' and told \n     him the lot was reserved for judges. Judge Higginbotham later \n     described the incident as ``typical of a lot of things which \n     have happened to both minorities and to women.'' Indeed, \n     Higginbotham was also a strong advocate for women's rights. \n     As the first African American trustee of Yale, he pushed for \n     opening the University to women. His first law clerk was \n     Eleanor Holmes, who later became Eleanor Holmes Norton, who \n     currently serves as the Delegate to the U.S. House of \n     Representatives for the District of Columbia.\n        Higginbotham was a prolific writer who focused on facts \n     and careful legal analysis. In his 13 years as a trial judge \n     and his tenure on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals from \n     1977 to 1993, Higginbotham authored more than 600 published \n     opinions, taught at the University of Pennsylvania, and wrote \n     important books on the history of race in America in Shades \n     of Freedom and In the Matter of Color. After retiring from \n     the bench, Judge Higginbotham founded the South Africa Free \n     Election Fund and helped South Africa's newly-elected \n     government draft a new constitution.\n        Nelson Mandela said ``Judge Higginbotham's work and the \n     example he set made a critical contribution to the course of \n     the rule of law in the United States and a difference in the \n     lives of African Americans, and indeed the lives of all \n     Americans. But his influence also crossed borders and \n     inspired many who fought for freedom and equality in other \n     countries . . . .'' Jesse Jackson said of Judge Higginbotham: \n     ``What Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston were to \n     the first half of this century, Judge Higginbotham was to the \n     second half.'' After his funeral, Rosa Parks commented, ``I \n     think he really had a great idea that we are all equal \n     people.''\n        As Yale Law graduates, former District Attorneys and \n     public servants, Higginbotham and I often crossed paths. I am \n     grateful for the opportunity to have known this extraordinary \n     man and his passionate and steadfast dedication to civil \n     rights and the betterment of this country. As we celebrate \n     Black History Month, we should consider the lessons we can \n     learn from the life and words of Leon Higginbotham.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Just a few personal comments.\n  Mr. President, I knew Judge Higginbotham and am honored and proud to \nhave called him a personal friend. He graduated from Yale Law School a \nlittle ahead of me. He found it very difficult to get a job because of \nracial prejudice, which was present in Philadelphia at the time in the \nearly 1950s. It was the same era when William T. Coleman, Jr.--who had \nbeen a law clerk to Justice Felix Frankfurter and later was Secretary \nof Transportation in the Ford administration--could not find a job and \nhad to travel to New York City to find a job.\n  Leon Higginbotham clerked for a very distinguished common pleas \njudge, Curtis Bok--really an outstanding scholar and later a \nPennsylvania Supreme Court justice. He found a job with the district \nattorney, a very distinguished district attorney, Richardson Dilworth, \nwho later became mayor of Philadelphia.\n  Judge Higginbotham then was a founding partner of an African-American \nlaw firm: Norris, Schmidt, Green, Harris & Higginbotham. That is what \nhad to be done in those days to find a job and develop a law practice \nif you were an African-American in the city of Philadelphia--really \nacross our country.\n  Senator Casey has referred to the indignity Judge Higginbotham had as \na student at Purdue, when he was excluded from living in a heated \ndormitory because it was not required by the law.\n  He was a noted scholar, an author, and wrote the books ``In the \nMatter of Color'' and ``Shades of Freedom.'' In my prepared text, I \ncomment about compliments paid to Judge Higginbotham by Nelson Mandela, \nJesse Jackson, and Rosa Parks.\n  This is a good occasion--Black History Month--to pause for a few \nmoments to pay tribute to a great American and a great jurist, a member \nof the Federal Trade Commission, a Federal judge at 35, and later chief \njudge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution \nhonoring the lifetime achievements of Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. \nThe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, as well as my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter, join me as original cosponsors of this \nresolution. We are honored to pay tribute to a remarkable lawyer, \njurist, scholar and advocate whose story inspires us.\n  The Bible says, ``There were giants in the earth in those days.'' \nLeon Higginbotham was a giant. He stood six feet six inches all and \ntowered above most of the rest of us in his intellect, his compassion \nand his commitment to equality. Today, those who knew him and worked \nwith him, and those who, like me, admired him from afar, have gathered \nin our Nation's Capital to honor his life and his legacy.\n  Aloysius Leon Higginbotham was born 80 years ago this month. The \nUnited States was about to enter the Great Depression and many \nAmericans suffered under the yoke of racism and institutional, \nlegalized segregation. Leon's young mother, who left school in the \nseventh grade, and his father, who worked in a Trenton, NJ factory, \nfaced a world where most avenues to success were closed to African \nAmericans.\n  Young Leon Higginbotham grew up in a household that valued hard work \nand education, yet the African-American community had few resources to \nsupport good schooling. ``Separate but equal'' grade schools offered a \nlimited curriculum, small schoolhouses and often one teacher for \nmultiple grades. This left black students effectively unable to gain \nadmission to the nearby white high schools. In fact, in the four \ndecades preceding Leon's entrance into\n\n[[Page S606]]\n\njunior high, no black student from his school in Ewing Township, NJ had \never enrolled in a white high school. Without the required \nprerequisites, especially training in Latin, the doors to academic \nsuccess were nailed shut.\n  Fortunately, Leon's parents believed those doors could be pried open. \nHis mother, Emma Lee, who worked for a wealthy family, constantly told \nher son that education was the ``sole passport to a better life.'' In a \nbold, unprecedented move, she negotiated Leon's entrance into one of \nthe best high schools in Trenton. Despite having no foundation in \nLatin, Leon managed to pass his freshman course. Impressed by his \nintellectual ability, Leon's Latin teacher offered to tutor him over \nthe summer. Between jobs as a busboy in a local hotel and as a laborer \nin factories, he rode his bicycle nearly 20 miles to his teacher's \nhome, several times a week, to improve his Latin skills. Mirroring his \nfather's work ethic and his mother's passion for learning, Leon \novercame the odds and earned his high school diploma.\n  In 1944, at age 16, Leon enrolled in the engineering program at \nPurdue University, where the student body had 6000 white students and \n12 black students. Leon and his 11 fellow students were required to \nlive in the unheated attic of a campus building. As autumn became \nwinter, snow found its way through the flimsy roof, and the 12 students \nshivered their nights away, wearing earmuffs, shoes and multiple layers \nof clothing to bed. As the Midwestern winter grew colder, Leon \nrequested a meeting with the university president to negotiate for a \nwarmer place to sleep, noting that all of the white students slept in \nheated dormitories. The president responded, ``Higginbotham, the law \ndoesn't require us to let colored students in the dorm. We will never \ndo it, and you either accept things as they are or leave the university \nimmediately.'' Leon found the president's comments especially troubling \nin light of the thousands of African Americans who were then serving \ntheir nation in World War II. He left the president's office determined \nto find a way both to serve his country and bring about lasting change.\n  Leon continued his academic pursuits at Purdue and became an avid \ndebater, qualifying to attend the Big Ten debate championships. After \nbeing forced to, sleep in a YMCA overrun with mice, while his white \nteammates were lodged in a comfortable hotel, Leon finally decided to \nleave Purdue and enroll in Antioch College. His strong academic \nperformance at Antioch persuaded members of the faculty and the board \nof trustees to encourage him to enroll in law school. Leon received an \noffer of assistance from a benefactor which would cover his first \nsemester at Yale Law School, but Rutgers University offered him a full \nscholarship. Characteristically, Leon resisted pressure from friends \nand family and chose the steeper path, Yale.\n  He arrived at Yale with a cardboard suitcase and little understanding \nof the challenges that lay ahead. He was overwhelmed at first by the \neducation and polish of his fellow students, many of them sons or \nrelatives of lawyers, judges, or prominent politicians. As he recalled, \n``my father was a laborer, two books in the house. One, we had \npurchased, a Bible; the other, my mother had gotten out of the trash of \none of the people she worked for, an old dictionary. . . . I did not \nbegin Yale at the same starting line as many of my contemporaries.''\n\n  Leon balanced his time between working at a corner store in New Haven \nand wrestling diligently with the law. As a research assistant to Prof. \nJohn P. Frank, Leon demonstrated ``an extraordinary verbal talent'' and \nachieved what Dean Wesley Sturges described as more honors in oral \nadvocacy than anyone else in the law school at the time. Leon later \nsaid that the most significant event in his law school career was \ntraveling to Washington, DC, to witness Thurgood Marshall's passionate \nadvocacy before the Supreme Court in the Sweatt v. Painter case. From \nthat moment on, Leon committed his considerable talents to the fight \nfor what he called the ``promise of freedom'' for all people. The child \nwho rode his bicycle to Latin lessons graduated from Yale Law School as \nthe towering man with the deep baritone voice, who would succeed in a \nworld almost unimaginable to his parents.\n  Leon decided to begin his legal career in Philadelphia. This was not \nan easy task in the Philadelphia of the early 1950s, but a few people \nrecognized his potential and helped him become a clerk for Judge Curtis \nBok of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. He worked hard and soon \nbecame the youngest--and first ever African-American assistant district \nattorney--under Richardson Dilworth, who later served as mayor of \nPhiladelphia. After 2 years in the DA's office; Leon left to found, \nwith another future Federal judge, Clifford Scott Green, and others, \nPhiladelphia's first African-American law firm, Norris, Schmidt, Green, \nHarris & Higginbotham. The Norris firm became the launching pad for a \ngeneration of successful African-American lawyers. At the same time, he \npushed for social change in various roles, including president of the \nPhiladelphia chapter of the NAACP, Special Hearing Officer for the \nUnited States Department of Justice, Commissioner of the Pennsylvania \nHuman Rights Commission, and Special Deputy Attorney General of \nPennsylvania. While juggling these public commitments, Leon always \nmaintained close ties to the community as a director of numerous legal, \npolitical and nonprofit organizations.\n  In 1962, President John F. Kennedy appointed Leon to the Federal \nTrade Commission, making him the first African-American ever to serve \non a Federal regulatory commission. Soon thereafter, Kennedy recognized \nLeon's work as a lawyer and public servant and nominated him for a \nFederal judgeship in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. However, his \nconfirmation faced strong resistance and repeated delays engineered by \nsome Members of the United States Senate. After President Kennedy's \ndeath, President Lyndon B. Johnson overrode the resistance to Leon's \nnomination by giving him a recess appointment to the Eastern District \nCourt. At the age of 35, Judge Leon Higginbotham became one of the \nyoungest men ever appointed to the Federal bench.\n  From the beginning of his career on the bench, Judge Higginbotham was \nknown for his scholarly, well-written opinions and his imperturbable \njudicial temperament. His tenure was also marked by his focus on the \ngenerations to follow him, what many came to call his ``people \nlegacy.'' His warmth extended particularly to those on what he referred \nto as ``the lower end of the Courthouse bureaucracy.'' The Judge \npermitted young clerks and staffers to accompany him in all his \nactivities so they could learn the full nature of the legal profession. \nStudents from Philadelphia public high schools could be found working \nas interns in his office. He soon developed a diverse entourage that \nbecame known as the ``Higginbotham menagerie.'' Many of his proteges \nmoved on to lead outstanding careers in the public arena. In fact, one \nof our congressional colleagues, Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton \nof the District of Columbia, served as his first law clerk and is a \nliving symbol of Judge Higginbotham's legacy.\n  In 1968, in the wake of the assassinations of Martin Luther King and \nRobert Kennedy, despair and violence escalated across our country. \nPresident Johnson repeatedly called on Judge Higginbotham for advice on \nhow to restore hope and optimism in the hearts of the American people. \nJohnson recognized Judge Higginbotham's wisdom in the face of crisis \nand appointed him to the Commission on Causes and Prevention of \nViolence. Judge Higginbotham used that opportunity to push for ways to \nquell the violence of the time and to shrink the divide between Black \nand White America. The Judge also exerted his influence beyond racial \nissues and advocated for women's rights. As a trustee of the Yale \nCorporation, he successfully fought to allow undergraduate enrollment \nfor women at Yale College.\n  In 1977, Judge Higginbotham's accomplishments, both on the bench and \nin civic matters, led President Jimmy Carter to appoint him to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Judge \nHigginbotham sat on the Third Circuit for 16 years, served as chief \njudge from 1989 to 1991, and as senior judge through the completion of \nhis judicial career in 1993. He described his judicial philosophy as \n``evolutionary in terms of what is fair and just in\n\n[[Page S607]]\n\na society.'' Through his rulings and subsequent writings, he reminded \nus that when our country was founded, the hope and promise of the \nDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution were tarnished by the \nfact that the United States had over 500,000 slaves. Judge Higginbotham \nbelieved that equality for all under the law requires progressive \ninterpretation of our founding documents and continued focus on the \ninequities that still exist.\n\n       As he put it, ``. . . It is possible that with the obvious \n     pride we have in the few who make it, that we may fail to \n     recognize how long the road behind us is and how many there \n     are on that road who still are deprived by history of the \n     utilization of their talents. . . . We cannot become \n     anesthetized by the success of a few and oblivious to the \n     deprivation of the many.''\n\n  In 1993, Judge Higginbotham retired from the bench and began a new \nphase of his quest to achieve racial equality under the law. Even after \nthree decades of remarkable public service, Judge Higginbotham took no \ntime to rest, often quoting Robert Frost's words, `` I have promises to \nkeep. And miles to go before I sleep.'' He focused his post-judicial \nlife on the future, often asking who in the next generation would \n``carry the baton into the new millennium.'' As a professor at Harvard \nUniversity, he poured his energy and passion into preparing tomorrow's \nleaders to take that baton. He taught numerous courses and many of his \nstudents recall his oft-repeated words: ``If you do not stand up for \nsomething, you'll fall for anything.''\n  Judge Higginbotham's work as a scholar and historian helped transform \nour Nation's perception of race in America. His thorough research of \nnearly 250 years of legal documents involving racial issues formed the \nbasis for a flood of books and articles in which he dissected the many \naspects of discrimination embedded in America's legal system. For \nexample, he hosted a conference on the centennial of Plessy v. \nFerguson, using the occasion to urge the young minds of the next \ngeneration to take full advantage of the hard-won opportunities created \nby Brown v. Board of Education. He once commented to a group of recent \nlaw school graduates, ``What should be our theme to America?. . . It is \nthat in the long, bloody and terrible history of race in America, there \nis no more time for foolishness.'' His words and his actions still \ncompel each of us to face the ugly parts of our Nation's history as \nwell as the glorious ones, and to respond, with commitment, to the \npublic arena.\n  Many remember Judge Higginbotham as what we now call a multitasker, \nespecially during his retirement. When he wasn't teaching, he was \nfrequently in a car on the way to the airport, dictating one of the \nover 100 speeches he delivered each year. When not addressing \naudiences, he often could be found testifying in front of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, attending monthly meetings of the United States \nCommission on Human Rights, serving on numerous boards of trustees, \nincluding the New York Times and National Geographic, or arguing voting \nrights cases on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus before the \nSupreme Court. He extended his fervor for equal justice overseas as a \nconsultant to President Nelson Mandela on the formation of the South \nAfrican Constitution and as an advocate for democracy education in \nSouth Africa.\n  Not surprisingly, Judge Higginbotham was recognized with numerous \nawards for his leadership as jurist, historian, scholar, advocate, \nmentor and ordinary citizen. His many honors include the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom, the Raoul Wallenberg Humanitarian Award, the NAACP \nSpingarn Medal, the ACLU Medal, the National Human Relations Award from \nthe National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Silver Gavel Award \nfrom the American Bar Association, the Lifetime Achievement Award from \nthe Philadelphia Bar Association, the Outstanding Young Man Award from \nthe Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, and honorary degrees from over 60 \nuniversities.\n  Judge Higginbotham is remembered by many, including me, as a true \nAmerican hero: a giant among men, who began his life in the most modest \nof circumstances, yet rose to extraordinary heights. Rosa Parks, \nanother American whose own story continues to inspire us, appropriately \nnoted after his passing, ``I think he really had a great idea that we \nare all equal people.'' Rosa Parks'' words capture what I believe to be \nthe essence of Judge Higginbotham's legacy: he helped pry open the \ndoors leading to the American dream for ordinary people from all walks \nof life.\n  So in this month when we celebrate the achievements of African \nAmericans, I am honored to pay tribute to Leon Higginbotham's life of \ncourage and commitment to justice; of integrity and intellect; his life \nof advocacy and action, service and scholarship. Judge Higginbotham's \nlife was a testament to the enduring power of the words ``we shall \novercome.'' Leon Higginbotham helped our Nation move closer to the \nideal expressed on the building across the street from this chamber: \n``Equal Justice under Law.'' We are proud to have his wife, Evelyn \nBrooks Higginbotham, as well as numerous family members, friends, \nformer clerks and colleagues here with us today as we honor his life \nand work and seek to keep the flame of Leon Higginbotham burning ever \nbrightly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S607-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3979.

McCARTER\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the Rules Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S.J. Res. 25 and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the joint resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 25) providing for the \n     appointment of John W. McCarter as a citizen regent of the \n     Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to support the appointment of \nJohn W. McCarter, Jr., to serve on the Smithsonian Institution's Board \nof Regents.\n  The Board of Regents is vested with authorities typically given to \nboards of trustees of not-for-profit and educational institutions \nthroughout the United States. The Board considers a variety of issues \nrelated to the Smithsonian Institution, including budgets, planning \ndocuments, proposed programs and construction, appointments to \nSmithsonian advisory boards, and legislative initiatives. Given the \nvariety and importance of the Board's responsibilities in managing the \ntone of America's most cherished cultural institutions, members of the \nBoard of Regents serve a critical leadership role for the Smithsonian \nInstitution.\n  That is why I am pleased to support John McCarter's appointment. He \ncurrently serves as president and chief executive officer of the Field \nMuseum, one of the greatest cultural attractions in Chicago. The Field \nMuseum attracts over 1 million visitors each year. The museum was \noriginally founded to house the biological and anthropological \ncollections assembled for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. The \noriginal collection has been expanded to include some 20 million \nspecimens, due in part to its continued worldwide expeditions and \nassociated research.\n  Under John McCarter's leadership, the Field Museum has undertaken a \nseries of projects to rebuild and restore the museum. Research \nactivities have expanded along with the physical structure--the Field \nMuseum is an international leader in evolutionary biology and \npaleontology in addition to archaeology and ethnography.\n  Before he joined the Field Museum in 1996, John McCarter was with \nBooz Allen & Hamilton as a senior vice president and was president of \nthe DeKalb Corporation. He has also worked in government, serving as \nbudget director for the State of Illinois in 1969 and as a White House \nFellow during the LBJ administration.\n  John McCarter brought this diverse work experience to the not-for-\nprofit museum he now leads. During his tenure at the Field Museum, John \nhas created several new permanent and traveling exhibits, including the \n``Evolving Plant'' exhibit in March 2006, the exhibit of Sue, the T. \nrex, in 2000, and the ``Tutankhamen and the Golden Age of the \nPharaohs'' exhibit in 2006. These exhibits drew huge crowds to the \nField Museum, expanding the reach of the museum's rich cultural \nexperiences to new and diverse audiences. John's leadership has led to \na new emphasis on developing museum exhibits that tell stories. This \napproach attracts more visitors and better educates those who are drawn \nin. The museum has also formalized its educational role in the \ncommunity, establishing partnerships with science teachers in the \ncommunity and organizing activities for inner-city schools.\n  It is my honor to support the appointment of John McCarter. His \nextensive experience in the government, private, and nonprofit sectors \nmake him a great addition to the Smithsonian Institution's Board of \nRegents.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the joint resolution be \nread three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 25) was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

Massey of Georgia, is filled by the appointment of \n     John W. McCarter of Illinois, for a term of 6 years, \n     effective on the date of the enactment of this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/04/senate-section/article/S609-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S609-S611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING THE NEW YORK GIANTS ON THEIR VICTORY IN SUPER BOWL XLII\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 441, submitted \nearlier today by Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 441) congratulating the New York \n     Giants on their victory in Super Bowl XLII.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I have asked for time because I rise to \nspeak about something that happened in Arizona yesterday.\n  I rise to congratulate the New York Giants on their much deserved \nSuper Bowl victory last night, which very few thought would happen. But \nwe Giants always knew we could prevail; we just couldn't pick the \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. President, I will also be offering on behalf of myself, my \ncolleague from New York, Senator Clinton, and my two colleagues from \nour neighboring State of New Jersey, in which the Giants stadium is \nlocated, Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. Menendez, this resolution.\n  The Big Blue, for the few of you who missed the game--I heard it had \none of the biggest TV ratings we have had in a long time--the Big Blue \ndefeated the heavily favored New England Patriots in what will go down \nas not only one of the greatest Super Bowl upsets in history but one of \nthe most exciting and closely contested games in all of sports history.\n  Today, I am wearing the red, white, and blue. I usually enjoy wearing \nthe red, white, and blue because I love America, but today I am \nparticularly enjoying wearing those colors because I love the Giants.\n  Under enormous pressure, facing one of the most talented, methodical \nteams ever assembled, the Giants came from behind, battling back twice, \nto take that title.\n  Since the beginning of the season, the chattering class said the \nPatriots were an unstoppable force that would march untouched to a \ncomfortable,\n\n[[Page S610]]\n\nsome even said ``large,'' Super Bowl victory, with the Giants a mere \nafterthought, a stepping stone on their road to greatness.\n  Well, the Giants proved them wrong again and today we are world \nchampions. Now, I have been a Giant fan since I was 5 years old. I \nremember ``Chuckin'' Charlie Connerly and Sam Huff and Frank Gifford \nand Alex Webster. Back then the two most important Roosevelts to me \nwere Brown and Grier.\n  The Giants have won Super Bowls before. But this victory, coming from \nbehind and defying the odds, makes this win to Giants' fans the \nsweetest of all.\n  The Giants showed the grit and determination New York is known for. \nThey would not be denied at any point in the game, keeping the pressure \non through all four quarters. Throughout the game, the Giants excelled \non both sides of the ball. I am particularly amazed and impressed with \nthat Giant defense. The Patriots have one of the best offenses in \nfootball ever, certainly the best this year. But the Giant front--\nMichael Strahan, Osi Umenyora, Justin Tuck--stifled them. They put the \npressure on Tom Brady so he actually missed passes. That did not happen \nvery much, and the usually unflappable quarterback was back on his \nheels for most of the game.\n  And then the Giant offense. The doubters of Eli Manning were silenced \nfor good--Two touchdown passes, that game-winning drive at the end, \nwhere no one thought the Giants could do it. And what a catch by David \nTyree. He used his helmet, his face mask, his shoulder pads, and his \nchest gear to catch that ball and pave the way for that final \ntouchdown.\n  Tom Coughlin, though bruising at times, kept the team together and \nfocused, proving yet again that it ain't over until it is over. The \nhard-fought win sent shockwaves through the football establishment and \nsent New Yorkers cheering into the streets until the wee hours of the \nevening.\n  New Yorkers certainly deserve every minute of sweet celebration, and \nwe look forward to that great tickertape parade I hope I will be able \nto go to if the voting schedule works out.\n  I spoke to Commissioner Goddell today and congratulated him on an \nexciting Super Bowl. It was not only a great day for New York football \nbut a great day for football in general.\n  Just a note. Two members of the Giant family were lost in recent \nyears: Wellington Mara, the heart and soul of a team if there ever was \none, and Bob Tisch, a good friend of mine. And their steadfastness led \nto this success. I am sure they are looking down from heaven and \nsmiling.\n  So I, on behalf of all New Yorkers, and the Senate, or at least most \nof the Senate, congratulate the New York football Giants for winning \nSuper Bowl XLII and celebrating their extraordinary victory. I would \nlike to send congratulations to my New York colleague, Senator Clinton, \nwho, of course, is on the campaign trail today. But I know she was \nthrilled about the victory, as were my colleagues from New Jersey, \nSenators Lautenberg and Menendez.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona, \nMr. Kyl, for his statement about the Super Bowl game that was played \nyesterday, and his congratulations to the Giants. And notice, I did not \nsay the New York Giants, though that is the name, and we are as proud \nof that team as we in New Jersey could be.\n  But pride in my birthplace, my home all my life, the State I am \nprivileged to serve in the Senate, forces me to remind everyone that \nthough we treasure our neighbors' interests in New York, the Giants' \nhome is in New Jersey, many of the players live in New Jersey, the home \ngames are played in New Jersey, and there cannot be any doubt about the \nfan loyalty and the attendance of our proud New Jersey residents.\n  But to take nothing away from that smashing victory--that wonderful \ngame, by the way, that was said by everyone I have met and talked to--\neven though our pride, our hopes were with the Giants, the fact is, it \nwas a wonderful football game, and we cannot take away the greatness \nalso of the New England Patriots football team.\n  After a tremendous season, a remarkable run through the playoffs, and \na miraculous achievement against the AFC's best--the New England \nPatriots--our Giants are now the Super Bowl champions for the third \ntime in history.\n  Last night, the Giants did what those of us in New Jersey and across \nthe country believed they could do: They took the crown from the king. \nTo capture the crown, they made key plays under pressure. The game \nstarted with a field goal, but the Patriots came right back and held \nthe lead for much of the game. But with 2 minutes left, and their backs \nagainst the wall, the Giants came from behind to score the winning \ntouchdown. The team showed guts and strength and courage, as they had \nthroughout the season and through the playoffs. Last night, we saw them \nat their best. By winning the Super Bowl, our Giants are truly \nnominated to be the best team in the NFL, and they brought the Super \nBowl trophy right back to its rightful place in New Jersey. From their \nhome turf in East Rutherford, NJ, to the Super Bowl win in Arizona--and \nit was a wonderful setting and an outstanding opportunity to display \nour Giant greatness--the Giants stood tall and showed that against all \nodds they were champions.\n  What a pleasure it was to see the quarterback, Eli Manning, show his \nchampionship colors by hanging on as the Patriot defense came after him \ntime and time again. What a wonderful family place that is to have two \nsons who are such expert football players. But Eli finally was able to \ncome out of the shadow and take his place alongside his brother's great \nplay.\n  David Tyree, a New Jersey native, scored the first touchdown and had \nan incredible catch with barely a minute left in play, falling back and \npinning the ball tight against his helmet as he fell to the ground. He \nwas holding onto that ball, and nothing could pull it from his arms.\n  Plaxico Burress caught the game-winning touchdown.\n  The offensive line, anchored by Rutgers University alumnus and New \nJersey resident Shaun O'Hara, showed the way.\n  And don't forget, they say that defense wins championships. We saw a \nlot of that yesterday. The defensive line, led by Michael Strahan, also \na New Jersey resident, stopped the record-setting Patriot offense in \nits tracks. It was no minor accomplishment.\n  In fact, our defense allowed only 14 points against a team that \naveraged more than 36 points a game during the regular season--an \nincredible accomplishment.\n  The Giants ran and passed, and they sacked their way to a \nchampionship and into the record books. The Giants have long had a \nplace in the hearts and minds of New Jerseyans.\n  While the team does bear the New York name, their home has been in \nNew Jersey for more than 30 years. Right now, one can see--if you pass \nthe area where the Meadowlands in New Jersey is--they are building a \nbrandnew stadium to keep them playing and winning in New Jersey for \nmany years to come.\n  From Rutgers University to the Giants and the Jets, we have a proud \nand deep tradition of winning football in the Garden State. I am so \nproud the tradition lives on.\n  I congratulate the Mara and Tisch families, Tom Coughlin, the rest of \nthe coaching staff, and the entire Giants team for an incredible Super \nBowl victory. Giant fans cannot wait to bring the trophy back home.\n  On behalf of all New Jerseyans and our fans across the country, I am \npleased--so pleased--to be able to call our Giants ``champions.''\n  The play that was displayed was magnetic, was fascinating. It will go \ndown as one of the great Super Bowl games in history.\n  So we note, once again, just a reminder: Do not always call them the \nNew York Giants. Just say Giants. That is enough. While we are under \nfull cover of our pride and our allegiance, we call them the ``Jersey \nGiants.''\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, even though I supported the New England \nPatriots, I will not object.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelated to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S611]]\n\n  The resolution (S.
