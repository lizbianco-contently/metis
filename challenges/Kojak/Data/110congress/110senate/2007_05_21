Mr. President, over the weekend, 7 U.S. soldiers were \nkilled in Iraq--in 2 days--bringing the total this month to over 70 and \nthe total since the war started to 3,422 American soldiers.\n  On Friday, the State of Nevada lost PFC Alejandro Varela, a 19-year-\nold from Fernley, NV. As he traveled south from Baghdad, his vehicle \nwas hit by a makeshift bomb, and he was killed.\n  Alejandro was known in high school and by his family as Alex. Serving \nin the military was his ambition, and he worked very hard to earn his \nGED so he could arrive at the goal of being able to join the military.\n  For lack of a better description, my heart and the hearts of Nevadans \nand all Americans ache with the loss of this 19-year-old man. Yet we \nhave to be proud of his willingness to serve and his courage and we are \ncertainly humbled by the sacrifice he made in giving his life.\n\n\n                         emergency supplemental\n\n  Mr. President, this week the Senate will continue the conference on \nthe emergency supplemental bill. Negotiations have not been easy as \nPresident Bush continues to stand isolated to his commitment to this \nendless war. We will continue to negotiate in good faith and in the \nspirit of bipartisanship. We will send the President a bill that fully \nfunds our troops. We stand firm in our commitment to change course and \nbring the war to a responsible end.\n\n\n                           immigration reform\n\n  While the supplemental conference committee continues to meet, we \nwill begin addressing the complex, crucial issue of immigration reform, \nand we will do that today. We all agree the current system is broken.\n  Employers don't know whom they can hire and whom they can fire. \nProduce is dying on the vine because farmers cannot find enough workers \nto harvest crops. There are no winners under the current system, only \nlosers.\n  The Senate will have an opportunity this afternoon to vote on whether \nto begin debate on comprehensive immigration reform.\n  The bill we debate and eventually pass will give us the chance to \nstrengthen border security, put in place an effective and efficient \nemployer verification system, design a\n\n[[Page S6362]]\n\nnew worker program to take pressure off the borders, and give the 12 \nmillion undocumented immigrants the opportunity to come out of the \nshadows and into the light of America. Improving border security is \nonly part of the puzzle. As long as the identities of those who cross \nthe border are unknown, our national security is at risk.\n  There is no question but that we need more Border Patrol agents with \nbetter technology and equipment. But there is also no question that \nenforcement alone cannot solve the problems of immigration.\n\n  We have tripled the number of Border Patrol agents over the last 20 \nyears and increased the Border Patrol budget 10 times over. Yet the \nprobability of catching someone illegally crossing the border has \nfallen from one-third to only 5 percent. That is a startling figure.\n  A population as high as that of Las Vegas crosses the border every \nyear. That is almost a million people who find their way into the \ncountry, despite our best efforts at enforcement. Fences alone would \nnot stop them. Years of dangerous border crossings show us that \nmillions will risk their lives for the opportunity to reach what is on \nthe other side of that border.\n  We must not forget that just as these immigrants depend on America \nfor opportunity, our economy depends on them as well. The overwhelming \nmajority of undocumented immigrants have lived here for years, \ncontributing to our economy lawfully and honestly, causing harm to no \none.\n  Many have children and spouses who are U.S. citizens or permanent \nresidents. Many own property and contribute to their communities. Yet, \nunlike us, they live their lives in hiding. If they are a victim of a \ncrime, they cannot report it. They cannot do that because they have to \navoid contact with the police. If they are treated unfairly in the \nworkplace, they have almost no recourse. If they are discovered, they \nface deportation and separation from their families. Their families, as \nwe have indicated, are, many times, U.S. citizens.\n  We should not allow them to jump to the front of the line for a green \ncard, in front of those who have played by the rules, but we should \ngive them a place in line--a chance for citizenship--if they do what we \nask of them. We could continue to track down the undocumented \nhousekeepers, dishwashers, and farm laborers who live among us or we \ncan provide them the chance to earn their citizenship with all the \nresponsibilities it requires and refocus our limited resources on those \nwho would do us harm, rather than those who would do us proud. We could \nembrace the unrealistic rhetoric calling for mass deportation, or we \ncould pass laws that require them to pay taxes and learn English. If we \nput rhetoric aside, we have the opportunity to pass a law that treats \npeople fairly and strengthens our economy.\n  Over the past several weeks, a group of Senators has spent countless \nhours and days negotiating in good faith and in the spirit of \ncompromise.\n  Last week, Democrats and Republicans, standing with the Secretaries \nof Homeland Security and Commerce, announced they had finally reached \nan agreement on immigration reform. The bill they have drafted will be \noffered as a substitute amendment this evening for us to debate and \namend this week.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues for their hard work. Reaching \nagreement on an issue as controversial as immigration requires \nextraordinarily hard work, compromise, and consensus building. They \nhave taken that important first step.\n  I was not heavily involved in the negotiations, but similar to some \nof my colleagues, I have reservations about the agreement that was \nreached. The bill impacts families in a number of ways that I believe \nare unwise. The bill also allows 400,000 low-skilled workers to come to \nAmerica for three 2-year terms but requires them to go home for a year \nin between. This is impractical both for the worker and for the \nAmerican employers who need a stable, reliable workforce.\n  Senator Bingaman will offer an amendment almost immediately when the \nbill is laid down to reduce that number to at least 200,000.\n  We must not create a law that guarantees a permanent underclass--\npeople who are here to work in low-wage, low-skill jobs but don't have \nthe chance to put down roots or benefit from the opportunities that \nAmerican citizenship affords.\n  Allowing these temporary workers to apply for possible citizenship \nthrough a new points system is not good enough. There must be certain \nopportunities for those who are willing to work hard and contribute to \nour economy.\n  Finally, I will say a word about the idea of this so-called \ntouchback, which would require the head of each household eligible for \nlegalization to return to their home country to file their application \nfor a green card.\n  I understand this concept is important to many of my colleagues, but \nit seems to be a plan that will cause needless hardship for immigrants \nand needless bureaucracy for the Government.\n  Nearly everyone agrees that the existing bill is imperfect. The \nproblems I have outlined will be addressed in the Senate and in the \nHouse and, of course, in conference. What we have now, though, is a \nstarting point.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we can begin an open \ndebate. The bipartisan legislation before us is not perfect, but I \nthink we can agree the spirit of bipartisanship behind it is \nencouraging.\n  If we continue along that road in the coming days, I am confident we \ncan write another chapter in America's great immigration story that \nmakes our county safer, treats people with dignity, and keeps our \neconomy moving in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6362-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1348, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 144, a bill (S. 1348) to \n     provide for comprehensive immigration reform, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, is recognized for up to 3 hours.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there are more than 3 hours' worth of \ndiscussion that needs to go on concerning this bill, that is for \ncertain.\n  I appreciate Senator Reid's comments, but I express some concerns \nabout what I understood him to say a few moments ago. He is the \nDemocratic leader. He does have the power to call up legislation in the \nend and to try to set the agenda but not the total power to do so. I \nthink I heard him say he would like to see this bill--he wants to see \ndebate and amendments this week.\n  I have to say there is no way this bill can be voted on and amended \nonly this week. We have had legislation such as WRDA that we took up \nfor 2 weeks, a re-authorization of the water resources bill. When we \nworked on the bankruptcy reform bill, which mainly was a reworking of \nthe existing bankruptcy law, with some changes, we debated that for \nmonths. So there is no way we can or should produce this bill after 1 \nweek of debate.\n  If that is so, the American people can know we have had a railroad \njob for sure. Hopefully, that does not reflect Senator Reid's firm and \nfinal opinion on the question of the schedule for this week.\n  Also, I wish to say I am not pleased, and I oppose the motion to \nproceed to last year's bill.\n  When we talked about the comprehensive immigration bill last year, I \npointed out 17 loopholes in the bill in a series of speeches, and \npeople began to take to heart a number of points I made, frankly. The \nnegotiators of the new bill have come back with a bill that has some of \nthe intention to or at least purports to deal with some of the concerns \nI had last year.\n  I have to say I was pleased to hear that we were considering a point \nsystem, such as Canada's, that we were considering a temporary worker \nprogram. I was told by the people who met and drafted this legislation, \nthat the guest worker program would be for temporary workers and it \ncould work to serve our economy.\n  I am afraid, that if you read the legislation, that the needed \nimmigration\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\nreform is not so. That is not what we have in either case and to any \nsignificant degree; it is a bit of window-dressing of some movements in \nthose areas and some fairly significant steps, frankly, that we need to \nhold on to and need to be a part of a fundamental reform of \nimmigration. There are some positive steps, but they are just not \neffective enough, as I will discuss later.\n  I reject the idea that a movement to a system such as Canada's or \nAustralia's that is based on merit and skills for immigration is \nsomehow, as I think Senator Reid said, an attack on the family. I am \noffended by that statement. A person who wants to come to this country, \nhas to ask to be admitted into the United States of America, and say \nthat: I have not been a criminal, I meet the standards for admission, \nand I want to be a productive citizen. Then after we give that person a \ngreen card, that person can become a citizen and have the right to \ndemand that his or her parents be allowed to come here, the aging \nparents who will be fundamentally supported by the American taxpayers, \ndemand that his or her brothers and sisters and their spouses and \nchildren be allowed to come. So how is this an attack on your family if \nwe say: You can come, you can be a citizen, but right up front, you \ncannot bring your parents, adult children, and siblings, you don't have \nany special rights to do so, but they can apply if they qualify, just \nlike everybody else, based on their own merit. But why should the fact \nthat we give one person a glorious thing--citizenship in the United \nStates--entitle them to bring maybe tens of other people? It just does \nnot make sense. I reject the argument that moving to a merit based \nsystem is an attack on family. Canada does not believe it. Sure, you \ncan bring your nuclear family--spouse and children. I am not talking \nabout stopping nuclear family from being together. I am talking about a \nreform of the current system that focuses on the extended family.\n  This chart shows three approaches to immigration by nations similar \nto the United States. Fifty-eight percent of the people who come to our \ncountry are family based--58 percent are family based, and only 22 \npercent are skill based. We have a policy that gives 16-percent of \ngreen cards for humanitarian reasons and those are unconnected to the \nskills they might bring. And 4-percent of green cards are given through \na visa lottery. I may talk about that issue later. This bill wisely \neliminates the lottery.\n  Look at Canada. They had 60 percent merit based immigrants; that is, \nthey asked those people: Are you educated? Do you have language skills? \nCan you speak in English or French? What kind of skills do you have \nthat Canada needs? What prospects do you have as an immigrant to be \nsuccessful in Canada, to be a productive citizen who will contribute to \nCanada, make Canada a stronger and better nation? That is what Canada \ndoes. Australia does the same. They have 62 percent skill, merit based \nimmigration. I reject the idea that it is some sort of an attack on the \nfamily to do that.\n  Senator Reid and others have said that this bill which will be \nintroduced--it has not yet been introduced--is a good starting point. \nThat makes me a bit nervous, I have to say, because the bill can be \nmoved through perhaps this week with some real strong-arm tactics, \nwhich would be a very sad thing, but perhaps it could be. The House of \nRepresentatives does not have the free period of debate that the Senate \ndoes. The House leadership, Speaker Pelosi, could bring this bill up \nand hammer it through in a matter of days even and then it goes to a \nconference committee. The conference committee will be picked by and \nwill be dominated by and absolutely controlled by the appointees of \nSenator Reid and Speaker Pelosi. They can alter the bill in any fashion \nthey wish. So it is a good starting point, they say. Well, what might \nhappen in conference?\n  The American people have a right to be nervous. They have a right to \nbe cynical about how we in Congress have handled immigration. We have \nconsistently protested that we want a lawful system of immigration. \nPeople have run for President for the last 25 years or last 50 years \nsaying they believed in a lawful system of immigration, but, in fact, \nthey don't do anything about it. They never take the steps necessary to \nmake the system lawful, to make it principled, and to do what it \nabsolutely must do as a matter of national priority; that is, the bill \nshould serve our national interests. Think about that simple concept. \nAny legislation we pass should be a product that serves our national \ninterest, not special interests.\n  One of the things that has worried me about my colleagues who have \nbeen having these secret meetings is that there is some talk about them \nhaving stakeholders, I believe Senator Kennedy said that. I think \nSecretary Gutierrez from the White House, Secretary of Commerce, said \ninterest groups. I don't know whom they pretend to be meeting with and \ndeciding these issues, but I will tell you who was not in those \nmeetings, and that was the American people. Not only were we not there, \nwe were excluded from those meetings, and we had not been informed how \nthose decisions were reached or what is in the bill--until perhaps \nSaturday morning.\n\n  This started brewing last week when Majority Leader Reid said he was \ngoing to bring up last year's bill. He gave the people who were working \non this legislation a limited amount of time. He told them they had to \ncome up with a bill by Wednesday. So they fiddled around and worked \nhard and compromised and rushed and rushed and rushed and came forward \nwith a bill on Thursday. They announced they had reached a grand \ncompromise and that all Americans could take a deep breath and relax \nbecause they had met and fixed the problem of immigration, a \ncomprehensive fix, that we could all just relax and not worry about it \nanymore because they fixed this problem.\n  We were told--and I was promised directly--that the bill would be \nready Thursday. Senator Kennedy, at the press conference, said it would \nbe ready Thursday, and it wasn't ready Thursday. They said it would be \nready Friday. It wasn't ready Friday. It came in early Saturday \nmorning, 2 a.m. Staff had been working all night, bleary-eyed, trying \nto put this grand compromise together in some sort of fashion. Small \nprint, it is 326 pages, I believe. That is about this thick, all these \npages together. That is about what the stack looks like at 326 pages.\n  One of the few times since I have been in the Senate, perhaps the \nonly time I can recall, we have had a major piece of legislation not \nwritten, not reviewed by the committee that is here to review language \nand write it in bill format. They didn't do it. So all we have seen is \na bill written on a computer by somebody who works for the executive \nbranch, as I understand it. It is about 300-something pages. Why didn't \nthey ask the Legislative Research Service to write up a good bill? They \ncan't do it. How can you take 326 pages and put it in proper \nlegislative language overnight when the thing comes in at 2 a.m. \nSaturday morning? And truly, if it is put in proper bill language--and \nI hope it will be at some point because the group that works on the \nlanguage really does a good job of professionally making sure it is \nwritten in a proper way, and they find a lot of errors just doing that. \nIf the bill is re-formatted by legislative counsel, it will turn out \nnot to be 326 pages but closer to 1,000 pages of bill language, about \ntwo times or more this thickness.\n  Are we going to pass that bill this week? How many amendments will we \nbe able to take up this week? People need to talk about, first and \nforemost, the fundamental principles and policies embodied in good \nimmigration reform. We should also talk about what is going to be \ncoming up in the legislation.\n  As I understand the plan, the majority leader intends to file cloture \nthis afternoon on last year's bill, and then he purports that he--and \nthat uses up a lot of time, see. If we started with a new bill, we \nwould have to wait until it is printed, then bring it up, then move \ncloture on the motion to proceed, cloture on final passage, and other \nprocedural matters. They have been moving on a bill they said they \nnever intended to bring up anyway, last year's fatally flawed bill that \nshould never ever become law. That is what we are going to do this \nafternoon. We are going to move to cloture on that bill.\n  Then we are told this entirely new bill is going to be substituted as \nan amendment. So the first amendment\n\n[[Page S6364]]\n\nwill be a substitute to wipe out the old bill, last year's bill, and \nget an accelerated start without the opportunities for debate on a new \nbill. Presumably that is how we can ram this bill through in record \ntime. I predicted that is what the plan was last week several times, \nand it does look as if that is where we are going.\n  So we have a flawed process, I suggest, in a lot of ways, and it \nshould cause the American people to be troubled and Members of the \nSenate to be troubled.\n  I don't deny that the people who attempted to work on the \nlegislation, draft this new bill, are good people, good Senators, but \nthey put themselves in a situation, based on what I see of their \nresults, in which the document does not have the strength, the \neffectiveness needed to be a solution for our immigration problems \ntoday. I wish it was different. I wish I could say it is something we \ncould be excited about and should support.\n  It is all right that they met. I have affectionately referred to them \nas ``masters of the universe.'' They would go into these secret \nmeetings, and they would get together and talk to special interest \ngroups and would listen to everybody, I guess, but the American people \nand put together a bill. But that is what they have done. The bill has \nsome good parts and some troubling parts.\n  So we are at a point in our history when the time is right for \ncomprehensive immigration reform. The Senate, however, in my view, is \nnot ready for debate today. The plan, as we are moving today, is \nunwise. It has been produced as a result of undue pressure and \nartificial timelines, which we have no responsibility or need to meet, \non the Members who are meeting in this group involved in the \nnegotiations. So the majority leader says: OK, you guys go off and \nmeet, but you only have so many days or we won't bring up this bill, we \nwill bring up the old bill, and we will do these things. They felt this \npressure, and they produced.\n  When I first heard about the plan on Friday, May 4, I stated that the \nDemocratic leadership in the Senate acts as if this is just another \npiece of everyday legislation, but it is not. The immigration bill is \none of the most important bills to come through the Senate in the \ndecade I have been here.\n  Staff drafting of the bill was not finished until Saturday morning, \nand legislative counsel has not yet converted the bill into the proper \nformat. Even today, we have no assurances that the product they \nproduced that had across the top of it ``Draft: For Discussion Purposes \nOnly,'' are the final agreements in the bill and will be the document \nactually introduced, presumably tonight.\n\n  At last week's press conference, two individuals remarked, and with \ngreat pride and enthusiasm, they were taught as children that is--what \nthey had been doing--how a bill becomes law. One said:\n\n       I have never been more proud to be a member of the Congress \n     and a member of the Senate. This is what my ninth grade \n     teacher told me government was all about, and I finally got \n     to experience it a bit. We have been in rooms together, early \n     in the morning and late at night.\n\n  Hopefully, they weren't smoke-filled rooms. They used to be smoke-\nfilled rooms.\n\n       Going line by line trying to figure out what started to be \n     how to deal with illegal immigration and it wound up being \n     what it means to be an American.\n\n  Well, that is good. Actually, Secretary Chertoff said:\n\n       This is pretty much what I was taught in grade school about \n     the way the process works; not that everybody gets what they \n     want, but everybody works together to achieve the best \n     results for the most people.\n\n  Well, I want to share a few things about how a bill should become law \nand what we were taught in grade school about it. Last Tuesday, I \nagreed to move forward. We have a cloture vote today. We were told we \nwould have a bill by Wednesday or Thursday. We were not given that. So \nwe have moved forward and the bill is being rushed forward at this \npoint. I remain concerned that what I heard Senator Reid say earlier, \nthat he hoped to debate and amend the bill this week, indicates, I am \nafraid, that he intends to see it passed this week.\n  How does a bill normally become law? A bill normally becomes law, if \nit is a bill of importance, when it is filed in the Senate and referred \nto the proper committee. To a degree, that was done last year, although \nthere was a tremendous effort last year to rush that bill through to \ncompletion. Many of the tactics utilized this year are very similar to \nthe tactics utilized last year.\n  Let us talk about what happened last year. The bill was introduced--\nMcCain-Kennedy--and it went through the Judiciary Committee. It was \nreferred to the Judiciary Committee. Senator Specter, I believe, had \nhis own bill as a working document, but it wasn't long in committee \nnegotiations before the Kennedy-McCain bill was substituted for it. \nThen the majority leader, Bill Frist, gave them a deadline: You have to \nfinish this bill, as I recall it, by next Monday. If you don't bring up \nthe bill out of the committee next Monday, I am going to offer on the \nfloor of the Senate a tough law enforcement bill that will focus on \nborder security. This was supposed to be an incentive for the committee \nto act. Apparently, it worked, because a bill passed out of committee, \nworse by far than the bill Senator Specter had introduced, and here it \nwas on the floor and hardly had been written. Nobody had seen what was \nin it. Yet they were bringing it up the next morning, Tuesday morning, \nand we were on the floor in debate.\n  Senator Reid, then the Democratic leader, pushed to have no \namendments and have the bill voted on that week. It became a big \nbrouhaha. Senator Kyl, Senator Cornyn, myself, and others had \namendments we wanted to talk about. So we pushed back and complained \nand complained. Finally, then Majority Leader Frist said, let's pull \nthe bill down. We are not going to bring it up until we have an \nagreement to have a full debate and an opportunity to offer amendments. \nAnd that is what happened. It was brought back up and we spent 2 or \nmore weeks on it.\n  I point out, however, the legislation which was on the floor was in \nthe Judiciary Committee and, even though rushed out, it passed out of \nthe Judiciary Committee and it had several weeks of debate on the \nfloor. That was that fatally flawed bill from last year, the bill we \nare now talking about going to but will be substituted by an entirely \nnew piece of legislation which Senators have not had an opportunity to \nsee, except from Saturday morning, if they were here, and most Senators \nhave been at home this weekend.\n  So that is what is going to be brought up. It has not gone through \nthe committee process, as classically a piece of legislation should, \nand it is not known to the Members of this body what is in this bill of \nperhaps a thousand pages, and we are hearing they might want to move to \nit this week. That is a matter that is breathtaking in its scope. We \nshould not do that.\n  This is how the Heritage Foundation describes the process on its Web \nsite. The Heritage Foundation is one of our Nation's most August and \nrespected institutions that deals with public policy. They have been \nengaged in major issues for several decades. They say this on their Web \nsite:\n\n       Working behind closed doors for months, a handful of \n     Democrat and Republican staffers, along with a few Senators \n     and principals from the administration, have been drafting a \n     ``comprehensive immigration reform package.'' Until Saturday \n     morning, the legislation was unavailable to any other Senator \n     or staff, let alone the media, policy analysts, or the \n     general public. This legislation would be the most \n     significant reform of immigration policy in 40 years, \n     affecting not only our national security and homeland defense \n     but the fiscal, economic, and social future of the United \n     States for several generations. For the sake of open \n     deliberation and public education, the Heritage Foundation--\n     which got a copy of the bill somehow--is making this \n     legislation in draft form publicly available to encourage \n     widespread debate and discussion.\n\n  Well, thank goodness they did make it public, but who knew they had \nit on their Web site? I don't know, maybe it was Sunday they did so, \nbut it is not an opportunity for the American people to know what is \ninvolved. The Heritage Web site goes on to say:\n\n       The document made available here, although marked ``Draft: \n     For Discussion Purposes Only,'' is being relied upon by \n     Senators and staff as the final language to be debated \n     beginning Monday, May 21st, with the expectation of a vote on \n     final passage without congressional hearings, committee \n     markup, fiscal analysis--and we will talk about that in a \n     little bit, that means how much it costs--expert testimony, \n     or public comment before the end of the week.\n\n\n[[Page S6365]]\n\n\n  As Mr. Hugh Hewitt wrote yesterday, in an on-line article entitled \n``Summary of the Fine Print'':\n\n       I have spent a lot of my weekend reading the draft bill, as \n     requested by both John Kyl and Tony Snowe. There are so many \n     problems with this bill that it should not be introduced in \n     the Senate absent a period of open hearings on it and the \n     solicitation of expert opinion from various analysts across \n     the ideological spectrum. Even if it were somehow to \n     improbably make its way to the President's desk, if it does \n     so before these problems are aired and confronted, the \n     Congress would be inviting a monumental distrust of the \n     institution.\n\n  In other words, a monumental distrust of the Congress and the Senate. \nHe goes on to say:\n\n       There is simply too much here to say ``trust us and move \n     on.'' The jam-down of such a far-reaching measure, drafted in \n     secret and very difficult for laymen, much less lawyers to \n     read, is fundamentally inconsistent with how we govern \n     ourselves.\n\n  Not what we were taught in grade school, I assure you, and I couldn't \nagree more. This is not how the process is supposed to work. We should \nnot be asked to trust our colleagues and vote to put a bill on the \nfloor when we do not know that the bill text is even finalized, that \nthe bill has not been drafted by legislative counsel, the bill has not \nbeen introduced or even given a bill number, the committee process was \nskipped and not followed, a Congressional Budget Office score may not \nhave been requested.\n  What is that, a Congressional Budget Office score? Before a piece of \nlegislation is passed, you are supposed to have a score, which is how \nmuch it costs. How much will the bill cost? How much will it impact our \nbudget and our deficit if we pass the legislation? How basic is that? \nCongress shouldn't be passing bills if we don't know what they cost. \nLast week, they haven't even asked for a CBO score, although we had one \nfrom last year that said the bill was exceedingly costly in the first \n10 years and much more costly in the years outside of that.\n  I am going to talk a little bit about what Heritage Foundation says \nabout a score, and it will take your breath away when we discuss that. \nIt is almost something you hate to discuss, but it is something we have \nto discuss because this is supposed to be a serious institution.\n  One reason, of course, they haven't requested a score last week is \nyou have to send the bill language to the Congressional Budget Office. \nWell, they don't even have the language, I guess, yet. It is still \nbeing called draft language, and it will be over 800 pages in the \nproper format. How would you score how much a bill like that will cost? \nHow long do you think it would take? So there is some sort of problem \nhere.\n  The majority leader is saying we are to spend 1 week on this bill, \nand we don't have a score, we don't have an idea of how much it is \ngoing to cost from the official institution, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, that is charged with doing those things? Not good policy, in my \nview.\n  In 1914, former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis wrote:\n\n       Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants, electric \n     light the most efficient policeman.\n\n  So I want to trust my colleagues. I do trust them. But I have to \nverify, because this bill is very complicated. It should be introduced \nin the proper way, as a new bill. It is very different from last year's \nbill in a number of areas. It should have been introduced as a new \npiece of legislation. It should have been referred to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary, the primary committee of responsibility, and we should \nhave had hearings and debate on it. We should have called policy \nexperts from Harvard and the University of Chicago, as we did a little \nbit last time, at my insistence, to find out what it means to our \neconomy, to the working people of America. Are they going to have their \nwages crushed down because of a flood of low-wage workers, which is \nwhat those experts told us last year would occur? That is what they \ntold us.\n  That is what should have happened. We are not there. Maybe these \nMembers of the Senate who have been meeting think they got it right and \nthe bill is ready to come to the floor, but there are 85 other Senators \nhere who have no idea what is in it. There is no way they could. For \nmany, today is the first day they are back in DC after the new bill \ntext has been made available for them to read. This bill needs some \ntime to be disinfected by the light of day before it is ready for this \nfloor and before we should be voting on it. That is fundamental, \nbecause it is so important.\n  We have small bills, and bills that come before us that we have dealt \nwith that are legitimate to bring up on fairly close notice. But a bill \nof this importance, one of the longest piece of legislation, possibly \nthe greatest number of pages of any legislative bill since I have been \nin the Senate, is not something that ought to be popped through here, \nplopped down as an amendment to the bill, substituting out an entire \nbill and then going forward to final passage. I don't like that and I \ndon't think we should do it. It is not the right thing to do, and it is \nnot fair to the American public.\n  The American public cares about this issue. They know more about this \nissue, oftentimes, than the politicians themselves. The American \npeople, for the last 40 years, have had the right instincts. They want \na lawful and fair immigration system. They do not want to end all \nimmigration. They know we are a nation of immigrants. They believe in \nimmigration. But they want a system that works, that does not pull down \nthe wages of working Americans, that furthers our economy, does not \nenhance the welfare state and is lawful--is consistent with our \nprinciple of law. They want the law enforced.\n  It is the politicians who have failed them consistently. The \npoliticians, similar to last year, seem to be on the move. Their move \nis we don't want this bill on our floor long. The longer it stays here \nthe more the people will get upset, the more they are going to find out \nabout it, the angrier they will get with us. So we do not want them to \nknow what is in it. We will bring this new bill up, we will plop it \ndown, we will vote it out this week, and get it off our plate. Maybe \nthey would not know. Maybe they would not care.\n  But it is too important for that. We are beyond that. The American \npeople do care. They are engaged. We might as well have a public and \nopen debate about it and discuss these hard choices--and there are some \ntough choices to be made. We know that.\n  It would have been better if this group had conducted their meetings \nin public, had open meetings and everybody discussed it for several \nmonths. They might have made the American people feel better about the \nsystem.\n  When I first heard the White House PowerPoint presentation, this was \na presentation made by Secretaries Chertoff and Gutierrez, members of \nthe President's Cabinet. They had a PowerPoint presentation. It leaked \nto the press at some point. They presented it to certain Senators. I \nwas invited to participate. I believed we had made some big strides \nfrom last year. It did, in fact, indicate a movement to a Canadian-type \npoint system. They did assert they had created a temporary worker \nprogram that was actually temporary. Last year's temporary worker \nprogram was exactly the opposite of what they said it was. It was not \ntemporary at all. The big print in the bill last year was ``temporary \nguest worker.'' Do you know what those workers were and how it would \nactually be carried out? A person could come to the United States as a \ntemporary guest worker and, when you got to the fine print, they could \ncome with their family, they could stay for 3 years, they could reup \nfor another 3 years, another 3 years and another 3 years and they could \napply for citizenship--or apply for a green card, permanent resident \nstatus in the United States the first year they were here.\n  That was not a temporary guest worker program. It was a joke, a sham, \nan attempt to mislead the American people. Forgive me if I am a little \nbit cautious this time about reading the fine print.\n  We were told we would have a better temporary worker program this \nyear. Let me discuss some of the concerns I have about this \nlegislation, as we understand it today, and how it actually meets with \nthe public presentation of the principles and outlines and framework, \nas stated in the White House PowerPoint.\n  It has been my hope that negotiations would produce a bill that \nfollowed the principles laid out in the 23 White House PowerPoint \npresentation. That was released in March. Those were much closer, those \nprinciples, to\n\n[[Page S6366]]\n\nthe framework of a bill that I said last year should be in any \nlegislation. I stated I thought the framework from the PowerPoint could \nproduce a bipartisan piece of legislation that could become law and \ncould even become law this year. But I stated clearly I intend on \nreading the fine print.\n  I have not had time to read all the fine print, but I have had time \nenough to know I will have to oppose the bill in its current form. The \nquestion Members should ask themselves is this: If we invoke cloture \ntoday on last year's fatally flawed bill, this old bill, will the new \nbill the leader will file as a substitute amendment fulfill the \npromises laid out in the White House plan? Let's look at the four \nprinciples and see.\n  Principle No. 1 is an enforcement trigger. Among the first \nprinciples, the PowerPoint was to ``secure the U.S. borders'' and ``not \nrepeat the 1986 failure.'' Before any new immigration programs or green \ncard adjustment could begin, the White House PowerPoint stated \n``enforcement triggers'' would have to be met.\n  Several items were listed under the trigger: 18,300 Border Patrol \nagents; so many miles of fencing; the end of catch and release; and the \ninitial implementation of a workplace verification system. That is the \nsystem at the workplace that ends the job magnet so the businesspeople \nwill stop hiring people illegally because they will have to produce a \nwork card, an identification card, that is very difficult to forge. \nThat is something I think could be very effective.\n  But I didn't think this list was going to be exhaustive, the things \nthey had on their agenda as a trigger would be the only things in the \ntrigger, that they would be the only things needed to ensure that we \n``secure U.S. borders'' and make sure we did ``not repeat the 1986 \nfailure.''\n  Does the new bill fulfill the principle No. 1? Will the enforcement \ntrigger guarantee we are not repeating past mistakes? No, it falls \nshort. It will not ensure that the same promises of enforcement made in \n1986 do not meet the same fate.\n  First, the trigger only applies to the guest worker program. All \nother amnesty programs will begin immediately--the Z visa probationary \nstatus begins 24 hours after the Department of Homeland Security begins \naccepting applications. If the trigger is not met, it is unclear that \nstatus will ever expire.\n  Second, the trigger only requires enforcement benchmarks we are \nalready planning on meeting. It requires nothing new, and it leaves out \nmany very important enforcement items. Let me tell you about the debate \non the trigger. It was a very important debate. Senator Isakson offered \nit. It was something I had offered in committee. He worked on it. I \noffered it on the floor of the Senate. The trigger basically said \nnobody gets amnesty until we fix this system.\n\n  The reason that was important was because, in 1986, when that big \namnesty occurred, people said: OK, we are giving you amnesty. American \npeople, we will not have amnesty again. We are going to fix the border. \nWe are going to have a law enforced at the border. But of course it \nnever happened. Three million people were given amnesty in 1986, they \nwere given that on the promise we would have enforcement in the future, \nand today we have 12 million people here illegally and that enforcement \nnever occurred. So the American people are cynical on this point. I am \ncynical on this point. I know how this institution works. The concept \nin the trigger was we would insist on the critical components of the \nenforcement mechanism being in place before any kind of legalization or \namnesty occur.\n  That is that. That is why it was important. It was a very important \npart. We have been told: Don't worry, we have a trigger in the bill.\n  Let me tell you some of the things that are not in it. The US-VISIT \nexit system is not included as a requirement of the trigger. In 1996, \n11 years ago, Congress required the administration--it was the Clinton \nadministration then--to set up a system that recorded the exit and \nentry of persons across the border. I mean, people go to work, they put \ntheir cards in the machine. You go to the bank, you take out money by \nsticking a card in the machine. It is not difficult to have an exit/\nentry system at the border if you make up your mind to do so.\n  We later gave ourselves more time to finish the exit portion because \nthe exit portion was not completed. We moved the date of the exit \nportion from US-VISIT to the end of 2005. The exit portion of US-VISIT \nis essential to ensure that future guest workers or new-parent visa \nrecipients or new-family visa recipients do not overstay.\n  It is one thing to be recorded when you come in. But if you come in \nfor a 30-day visa or you come in for a 1-year work permit, how do we \nknow you left? This is fundamental, to know when the person leaves. \nAnybody who suggests this is beyond the capability of the United States \nof America technologically to accomplish, I think is blowing smoke. Of \ncourse, we have the capability of doing this if we desire to do so.\n  It is not a part of the trigger, so I am not sure how valuable it is \nto have an entry check as part of the US-VISIT but not have the exit \ncheck. It is important, I would say, if you intend, when we pass this \nbill, to actually see it enforced and actually have people go home when \nthe bill says they are supposed to go home. But if you do not put it \nin, then we have a problem.\n  A separate section of the bill, section 130, only requires the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to submit to Congress a schedule for \ndeveloping and deploying the exit component. There is no requirement \nthat it be finished as part of the trigger. But I would say the trigger \nhas been very much weakened. They promised a trigger. They knew what \nthe debate was all about and why it was important. The masters of the \nuniverse, I affectionately call them, who wrote this thing, said they \nput a trigger in. But it is not an effective trigger.\n  Operational control of the border is not required by the trigger. \nCurrent law requires that by April 26, 2008, 18 months after the Secure \nFence Act was passed and was signed into law, that:\n\n       The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all actions \n     the Secretary determines necessary and appropriate to achieve \n     and maintain operational control over the entire \n     international land and maritime borders of the United States.\n\n  Eighty Senators voted on that last year right before the elections, \nthat this should be the standard that we would have, operational \ncontrol over the border.\n  Only 18,000 Border Patrol agents have to be deployed by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security under this deal. This is 300 agents \nless than the PowerPoint listed. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004 requires 2,000 new Border Patrol agents to be \nhired each year through 2010, so we are already on track now to have \nthat many people in the next 2 or 3 years. We have already funded the \nhiring of over 14,000 Border Patrol agents, and DHS is already planning \non hiring the 18,000 with upcoming appropriations.\n  This trigger didn't require anything new, nothing other than what we \nhad done.\n  The 370 miles of fencing, which was part of the bill offered last \nyear, and 200 miles of vehicle barriers, are yet to be built. So they \nare being built. But that was a key part of the trigger.\n  The trigger said we must end the catch and release, and some progress \nhas been made to end this situation that happened when individuals \ncoming across the boarder are apprehended. If they are from Mexico, it \nwould be pretty easy to transport them back to Mexico, or Canada if it \nwere on the Canadian border, but what about somebody caught on the \nborder who is from Brazil? What about someone caught on the border who \nis from China? Or Indonesia? Or India? Or Africa? What about that? What \nhappens to them?\n  What we were doing was apprehending people such as that, taking them \nbefore some administrative officer, releasing them on bail and asking \nthem to come back for a hearing to be deported. Of course, 95 percent, \nthe numbers show, were not showing up.\n  We have ended some of that already. Secretary Chertoff has made some \nprogress in ending that situation, where those other than Mexicans are \nactually moved out rather quickly, except in a few instances.\n  The catch-and-release provision of the bill directly conflicts with \nthe bill sponsors' claim that the catch-and-release will be eliminated \nforever as part\n\n[[Page S6367]]\n\nof the trigger. That section, found on page 10, lines 3 through 23, \nallows persons ``other than Mexicans'' caught at the border to be \nreleased on $5,000 bond. Being released on a bond is being released. \nThe practice of catch-and-release of the persons ``other than \nMexicans'' isn't ended by this bill; it just now calls for bond. People \npay $5,000 to have some coyote bring them across, and they bring \nanother $5,000 bond and they can post the bond and be released \nimmediately into the country.\n  Another question that came up as part of that debate was to have \nsufficient prison capacity to detain people while they are being \ndeported instead of releasing them on bail. You cannot end the catch-\nand-release if there is no place to hold persons apprehended.\n  The Senate has appropriated money for 9,000 new beds already, \nbringing us to a total of 27,500 beds. This is the money already \nappropriated. It is the current level of funding. So nothing new is \nadded by this trigger that would strengthen our capacity.\n  Later in the bill, a separate section, 137, requires Homeland \nSecurity to conduct or acquire 20,000 additional beds. That should be \nin the trigger. How do we know it will ever be done? Well, we want to \nauthorize or require 20,000 more beds to be built because we have \ndecided we need those. But let me tell you, American people, just \nbecause we authorize something like this does not mean in any sense \nthat somewhere down the line a future Congress will put up the money to \npay for it. You cannot build bed spaces without money. What is not \nappropriated will not be built.\n  Additionally, 27,500 beds is far less than the 43,000 detention beds \nrequired under current law to be in use by the end of 2007, as required \nby the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. So we are \nbelow where we need to be. That should be in part of the trigger if we \nare to guarantee we are moving in that direction.\n  Finally, there is no guarantee that the additional enforcement items \nin title I, Border Enforcement, and title II, Interior Enforcement, \nwill ever be funded. There is no guarantee that the additional \nenforcement items will be funded. The phrase ``subject to the \navailability of appropriations'' is used 18 times in the first two \ntitles. The phrase ``authorized to be appropriated'' is used 20 times \nin Titles I and II of the bill.\n  We all know this does not require any money to be available or any \nmoney to be appropriated. So that should make us nervous, ladies and \ngentlemen, that the language in the bill says we will do this and we \nwill do that, build the items in title I and title II of the bill, but \nit will be done ``subject to the availability of appropriations.''\n  Then they go on to repeat many times, ``moneys that are authorized to \nbe appropriated.'' In other words, this bill is an authorization bill. \nIt would authorize border enforcement. It would authorize bed spaces. \nBut it does not fund it. It does not require it to be done.\n  Two other trigger elements--workplace enforcement tools and \nprocessing of applications of aliens--are fine, but they do nothing to \nmake sure the border is secured before the new guest worker amnesty \nprogram begins.\n  So I am disappointed that the promise of an effective trigger is not \nwhat we see in the reality of the bill language.\n  Principle 2: a future flow temporary worker program, the so-called Y \nvisa. The principle is outlined in a new program for temporary foreign \nworkers. That is what was in the framework in the PowerPoint. The \nPowerPoint proposed a new program where workers would be admitted for 2 \nyears and could have their visas renewed two times, for a total of 6 \nyears. Each period of admission would be separated by 6 months at home.\n  Get that. This is what is in this new bill, as we understand it and \nread it. So this is going to be a temporary worker program. Workers \nwould be admitted for 2 years. That could be renewed two times, for a \ntotal of 6 years, but each period would be separated by 6 months at \nhome.\n  I stated I was very concerned about this time frame. I argued last \nyear that a genuine temporary worker program should be a 1-year program \nand that workers would come without their families and work on the max \nto be about 10 months, was my suggestion, then they would return home \nto be with their families, and that this could be renewed year after \nyear as long as they were satisfactorily employed and the employers \ndesired to hire them again and they had work to do.\n  But I like the fact that the PowerPoint stated--this is what they \npromoted a few weeks ago or a month or so ago in the PowerPoint--that \nworkers would not be allowed to bring spouses or children but could \nreturn home for visits with their spouses and children. The PowerPoint \ndid not say spouses and children would be coming to the United States \nto visit the worker.\n  Though no numerical cap was specified in the plan, the plan \nenvisioned an annual cap set by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \nconsultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Commerce to set this \ncap, how many would come.\n  Secretary Gutierrez told me he thought it might be around 200,000--\n200,000. If workers wanted to apply for green cards, the PowerPoint \nstated they would be able to apply for permanent residence--a green \ncard--but they would have to follow the normal merit-based channels and \ncompete for the green card. Just because you are allowed to come into \nthe program and work temporarily in a low-skilled job did not give you \na leg up on somebody who was applying because they had a master's \ndegree in mathematics. Also, they would have to leave the country when \ntheir work period expired, even if their green card status had not been \ngranted but was pending. That is essential to the success of the \nproject.\n\n  Well, does the new bill fulfill the principles in principle No. 2 \nthat were stated to us? Will a truly temporary worker program be \ncreated that is comparatively simple and efficient as promised? I have \nto say the answer is no. There are at least three flaws that will make \nthis program unworkable.\n  First, the periods are too long. The bill sets up a program where \nworkers come for 2 years at a time. I strongly believe 1 year is a \nbetter time period. I think 2 years is just too long.\n  The periods, curiously, are limited. The bill only permits workers to \ncome for two or three 2-year periods. Why do you limit that? It makes \nno sense to me to prohibit a worker who has come here for 2 years, gone \nhome, 2 years, gone home, is a fine, skilled worker, the employer wants \nthem, why they cannot keep coming, although I prefer 10 months at a \ntime every year. After 6 years, the bill would cut off the worker from \ntheir employer unless they apply for a green card.\n  So this is a plan, I suggest, that is not supportive of circularity, \nwhere a person comes and circulates back to their home country, \nmaintains their base in their home country, but encourages persons--in \nfact, puts pressure on them, if they want to continue to work--to do \neverything they can to become a citizen when they may have no desire to \nbe a citizen.\n  We were in Colombia last year with Senator Specter. I met with \nPresident Uribe, and he talked about their temporary worker program. He \nwas concerned. He thought the United States was being hostile to \nimmigration. He expressed concern about that. He said: Why don't you do \nlike Canada. We have people who fly up to Canada, they work and come \nback, and nobody ever has any problem. Well, I said: Mr. President, \nthat is exactly what we should do. We would love to see that. But our \nsystem is so convoluted and so lawless, it is not working at all. We \nare not against immigration. We are not against the workers. But we \nwant to make sure the number of workers is a legitimate number and that \nthe system works. Our system is not working. I would love to have your \nsystem.\n  Now, the numbers are way too high, I have to tell you. The bill sets \nthe initial number of guest workers at 400,000 per year, not 200,000, \nthen it adds an escalator clause based on ``market demand.'' So the \nreal cap is 600,000 a year after a few years. Due to the fact that the \nbill's market escalator--15 percent--is available in the first year of \nthe program, the new program can result in just under 1 million workers \nbeing present in the United States in the second and third years of the \nprogram. About one million guest workers will be present in any given \nyear under that program after the second year.\n\n[[Page S6368]]\n\n  Now, that will have an impact on wages in America. It will be about \n920,000 in year 2 here, the 2-year program, and 989,000 in year 3. \nThese numbers do not include the 20 percent of workers who will be \nallowed to bring their families with them for their 2-year stay. So \ninstead of complying with the promises that we would have a temporary \nworker program without families, we ended up with 20 percent of the \ntemporary workers being able to bring their families with them for the \nfull 2 years.\n  So that is what makes this new temporary worker program unworkable. \nFamilies can come with a worker. The new temporary worker program \nallows workers to bring their families--spouses and children--with them \nin one of their 2-year stays and for 30 days at a time on parent-\nvisitor visas. So there is going to be a parent-visitor visa, which \nmeans you can bring children and spouses for 30 days at a time.\n  There is no reason for a temporary worker program that should allow \nworkers to bring their families with them. Workers can easily go home \nfor a week or two at a time. The cost of travel for one person to \ntravel would be cheaper than for a family to travel for a visit.\n  Allowing workers to bring their families for either the 2-year period \nor the 30-day period will cause many practical, complicated ripple \neffects. Now we have got to be serious about this. We do not have \nenough Federal people to go out and search for everybody who is \noverstaying in our country and not complying with our laws. We need to \ncreate a good framework that reduces the number of people who are here \nillegally so they do not have to be run down and apprehended.\n  So these are some of the things which will happen with children \ncoming for 2 years: Local school costs will escalate as the children of \nthese guest workers attend schools; the language barrier will create \nadditional problems for No Child Left Behind requirements; difficult \nproblems for teachers and principals who have to have language skills \nthey did not have to have before; local emergency room and health care \ncosts will likely escalate.\n  So we are creating a magnet for dual citizenship. What worker would \nnot want to bring their spouse in during her eighth month in pregnancy \non a 30-day visa? This would guarantee that the spouse would receive \ngreat medical care during her delivery and would give the child dual \ncitizenship.\n  Down the road, Members of Congress now purporting to be enforcement \nhawks, when they have to talk about removing a family, leaving a child \nhere who is a citizen of the United States, what will they do then? I \nsubmit they will crumble. You have to create a situation in which that \nis not likely to occur, not create a bill that encourages or \nincentivizes this kind of thing to happen. It is going to be too hard \nto require families who overstay go home. They have kids who are going \nto be in school; some will be U.S. citizens. That is not going to work.\n  The temporary guest worker program in this legislation is set up to \nfail.\n  Principle 3 in the PowerPoint presentation was that green card \nallocations would be adjusted to focus more on merit and chain \nmigration, and the visa lottery program would be ended. This is a good \ndeal. That was a good principle, a historic move in the right \ndirection, following Canada and Australia. It was something that was \nnever even discussed last year, except by me. Senator Mike Enzi on the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee agreed to have a \nhearing at my request to discuss that. We could never get a hearing in \nthe Judiciary Committee where the immigration bill came forward. We \nlearned a lot about it. Everybody who learned about the merit-based \nsystem liked it. So the White House PowerPoint stated the bill would \nchange the way we distribute green cards to focus more on merit. It \ndescribed how the current green card system is ``out of balance'' and \n``favors those lucky enough to have a relative over those with talent \nand education.''\n  It noted how the United States currently dedicates 58 percent of the \n1.1 million green cards issued each year to relatives and only 22 \npercent to people selected for their disabilities.\n  This is the chart we had. It reflects that this is what the United \nStates does; 58 percent of the immigration was based on relative \nability, not merit. The PowerPoint noted how in other developed \ncountries, Canada specifically, 60 percent of the green cards go to \nemployment-based immigrants selected for their abilities. The \nPowerPoint described that in the initial years ``all diversity visas \nand some parent-preference visas would be used for merit based \nselection--creating 100,000 openings in year one.''\n  Finally, the PowerPoint stated we would ``launch a visa system that \nsorts applicants according to national needs and merit.'' The system \nwas described as a way to ``boost U.S. competitiveness, emphasize \neducation,'' and ``make it easier for the best foreign students earning \nSTEM (science, technology, engineering, or math) degrees at U.S. \ncolleges to stay and work.''\n  Negotiators describing the merit system described the implementation \nof a point system which selects legal permanent resident applicants \nbased on their skills, education, language abilities, and age. That is \ngood, isn't it? You would evaluate people who apply based on their \nskills, education, language, and age.\n  To give you an insight into how significant this is, we have a \nlottery. Anybody in the world from any country can apply to be a \nresident of the United States. They can submit their name and it goes \ninto a pot. They draw 50,000 names from that pot. If your name is drawn \nout, you get in regardless of whether you have any skills, merit, or \nanything else, other than perhaps you couldn't get in if you had a bad \ncriminal record. To give some perspective on the situation the United \nStates now finds itself in, 1 million people in the year 2000 applied \nfor those 50,000 slots. Correction. My fabulous staffer Cindy Hayden \nhas corrected me. Hold your hat. I was wrong. Not 1 million people \napplied for the 50,000 lottery slots; 11 million people applied for the \n50,000 lottery slots. What does this mean if we are trying to establish \nan immigration policy that serves our national interest? What does that \nmean? It means we have far more people who have applied to come to our \ncountry than we can ever accept. Professor Borjas at the Kennedy School \nat Harvard, himself a Cuban refugee, has said in his book ``Heaven's \nDoor'' that for a poor person anywhere in the globe, coming to the \nUnited States is a tremendous benefit to them. All of them will \nbenefit; almost universally they will benefit by coming here. It is not \na question of whether the individual will benefit if they come here; it \nis a question of who can come here since we can't allow and have no \ncapacity to come close to allowing everybody to come to America who \nwould like to come here.\n  What have Canada and Australia done? They said: We are going to set \nan immigration policy that serves our national interest. How \ncommonsensical is that? Our national interest. We had a committee \nhearing on it. I asked Secretary Chertoff at one of the hearings: Do \nyou believe that policies should serve our national interest? I was \nproud of him. He said, just like that: Yes, sir, it should serve our \nnational interest.\n  I believe it was the columnist Charles Krauthammer, in one of his \ncolumns about this subject, who mused as to whether we shouldn't be \nlike the NFL football draft and look out all over the world and pick \nthe best and brightest who would flourish in America and strengthen our \nNation and make us a better, stronger, more vigorous, and talented \ncountry. There is much to be said there. That was the promise we were \nmade, that this new bill was going to make a move toward the Canadian \nsystem. There are some steps in that direction but, unfortunately, not \nenough.\n  I expressed concern at the time that the White House plan appeared to \nincrease the number of green cards available each year. Page 21 of the \nbill indicated 1.4 million would be available each year, now at 1.1. I \nalso stated it would be critical to examine how the point system was \nactually written, that the actual test had to ensure that low-skilled \nworkers would not receive preference for green cards over high-skilled \nworkers. Even though some business may think that is great, to have a \nbunch of low-skilled workers, that may not be the best thing for the \nnational interest. Nor does the bill fulfill that principle we were \ntold should be included in an immigration bill.\n\n[[Page S6369]]\n\nWill green card allocations be adjusted to focus more on merit? Will \nchain migration be ended? The new bill will only do a fraction of the \ngood it could have done. That is what is so frustrating to me. It came \nclose. It made some progress, but it could have been so much better. We \ncould have made a cleaner move to this kind of enlightened approach to \nimmigration.\n\n  They say we are going to end chain migration. Chain migration would \nbe the ability to bring brothers and sisters into the country if you \nhave been made a citizen. Also I thought it meant you would end the \nability to bring in aging parents, but typical of the cutting the baby \nin half, the political compromise basically cut the number of parents \nin half who could come. So a number of aging parents will still be able \nto chain migrate in if their children have obtained citizenship. That \nis in the future, however. But between now and 2015, chain migration \ndoes not end but is actually accelerated. I kid you not. Instead of \nactually ending chain migration, the new bill only stops accepting new \nchain migration applications. The bill's sponsors take the numbers they \neliminate from chain migration categories, about 200,000 per year, and \nthen allocate those to adjusting the backlogged chain migration \napplications. In other words, people who have applied for chain \nmigration get to come in.\n  If this were not enough, the bill's sponsors then take the green card \nnumbers freed up through elimination of the visa lottery program--\n50,000--and also dedicate those numbers to processing not high-skilled \npeople but the chain migration backlog applications. Even after 8 \nyears, when the chain migration backlog is supposed to be eliminated, \npoints for family members will be issued through the merit system. So \nwe are creating a so-called merit system, but it is skewed also, not to \nmerit but to family. Six points are given for adult sons and daughters \nof permanent residents; four points for siblings of citizens and \npermanent residents; and two extra points if you have applied for a \nchain migration category between May 1, 2005 and now. So we are giving \nsubstantial points, tipping value points to lower skilled workers \nbecause they happen to be involved in the chain migration process. I \ndon't think that is a good principle. It undermines the move we have \nbeen promised occurs through a merit-based system.\n  Let me make this point. The merit system as proposed in the \nlegislation will not receive ``100,000 openings in year one'' alone, as \nthe PowerPoint presentation we were given promised. For the first 5 \nyears, current employment-based visa levels are kept the same--\n140,000--until 2015. Only after 8 years will the number of employment-\nbased, skill-based, green cards be increased to 380,000. So in reality, \nchain migration numbers between now and 2015 will skyrocket. Chain \nmigration is going to increase until 2015. The portion of family-based \nmigration versus merit-based migration will be worse than it is today, \nperhaps much worse. Think about that. The PowerPoint we have been sold \nis that this is going to move to merit. Yes, it says that. Yes, it \ndoes. But when you look at the real numbers through the next 8 years, \nthe numbers are going to be more chain migration, and it will be worse \nin terms of merit-based migration than exists today.\n  Additionally, several characteristics of the merit-based system will \nwork to undermine its stated purpose, which is ``to boost U.S. \ncompetitiveness,'' to ``emphasize education,'' and ``make it easier for \nthe best foreign students earning STEM degrees at U.S. colleges to stay \nhere and work.''\n  The merit-based system will set aside 10,000 green cards a year for \ntemporary workers, new Y visa holders. These workers will not have to \ncompete on a level playing field with all other merit system \napplicants. Instead, they will only be competing among themselves for \nthe 10,000 annual slots. Additionally, the merit-based system includes \npoints for characteristics that low-skilled workers in the United \nStates are sure to have. In other words, you create a temporary worker \nprogram that can bring in almost a million people in a 2-year period to \ndo low-skilled work. Then you create a permanent system of immigration \nfor those low-skilled workers when it is supposed to focus on \nmerit. But the system then turns around and provides extra points for \nlow-skilled workers to help them get into this system. Sixteen points, \nfor example, are given for employment in a ``high demand occupation.'' \nThis list, to be produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is sure to \nconclude jobs in the service industry, the construction industry, food \nprocessing industry, et cetera.\n\n  Two points per year--up to 10--are given for the years of work the \napplicant has done for a U.S. firm. It is easy to see how a temporary \nworker, who is allowed to work in the United States for 6 years, will \nget 10 points here. That undermines the merit system in many ways, so \nthere are a lot of subtleties here.\n  Now, when Senator Kennedy and the others had their press conference \nto announce the grand compromise, Senator Kennedy or his staff, about \nthat time, indicated only 30 percent of the people would come into our \ncountry based on merit and that, not to worry, we were still going to \nbe, as one of his staffers said, a family-based system, a chain \nmigration system, not a merit-based system. As we look at the numbers, \nI am afraid Senator Kennedy is more correct than I wish were so.\n  There is another principle: the illegal alien population program, the \nZ visas. These are the people who are here illegally.\n  The White House PowerPoint described how the proposal would give \nlegal status to illegal aliens currently in the United States through \nnew Z visas, but would provide them with ``no special path to \ncitizenship.'' The Z visa sounded better to me than the plan last year, \nwhich was very bad and should never have become law.\n  Specifically, the PowerPoint told us the Z visa holder would be able \nto apply for green cards, but ``only through regular programs,'' \nthrough ``point-based merit selection.'' According to the PowerPoint, Z \nvisa holders would be ``ineligible for `adjustment of status' from the \nU.S. . . . Heads of household would need to return to their home \ncountry and follow the normal channel'' to be admitted into the country \non a permanent basis.\n  Well, does the new bill we have been presented with Saturday morning \nat 2 a.m. fulfill principle No. 4? Will the current illegal alien \npopulation be treated compassionately but not given a special path to \ncitizenship, as they promised? The answer, I am afraid, and I am sad to \nsay, is no. The new bill clearly creates a system whereby current \nillegal aliens are treated differently than those who try to come to \nthe United States lawfully. It may not be ``jackpot'' amnesty, but it \nis some form of amnesty.\n  My definition has been: Those who broke the law to come here should \nnot receive every benefit this Nation has to offer, like those who come \nlawfully; namely, citizenship and certain economic benefits. If you \ncome unlawfully, you should never get those things. That is an \nimportant principle.\n  Mr. President, 1986 should have told us that. We need to establish \nand say from 1986 onward we are never going to let you be a citizen if \nyou come unlawfully. We may say you can stay here with your family and \nyour children--you are working, you have been here many years--maybe we \ncan accept those kinds of compassionate realities. But to give them \nevery benefit of citizenship as a result of breaking in line ahead of \nother persons is not the right thing.\n  I was very glad our Republican leader in the Senate, Senator \nMcConnell, when interviewed yesterday by George Stephanopoulos on \n``This Week,'' drew a line in the sand for the Republican position on \nthis issue. He stated:\n\n       One thing is for sure: If this bill gives them any \n     preferential treatment toward citizenship over people who \n     came into the country in the proper way, that's a non-\n     starter.\n\n  Well, I agree. The one thing we can all agree we should not do is \ntreat the illegal alien preferentially. So I am sad to say that after \nreading the bill I think there are several ways in which the language \ngives preferential treatment toward citizenship to the illegal alien \npopulation over people who have waited in line to come the proper way.\n  First, illegal aliens who rushed across the border between January 7, \n2004--the date contained in last year's Senate bill--and July 1, 2007, \nwill be eligible for amnesty. That is on page 260, line 25 of the \nlegislation. This includes\n\n[[Page S6370]]\n\nillegal aliens who have been here a mere 5 months.\n  I want to repeat that. Last year, the bill that was so fatally \nflawed--I thought was not principled--said if you wanted to be part of \nthe amnesty it contained, you would at least have to have been in the \ncountry before January 1, 2004. This bill says you get amnesty if you \nwere in the country up to January 1, 2007--just a few months ago, 4 or \n5 months ago.\n  We put National Guard on the border. We have enhanced our Border \nPatrol. We put up fencing and all of this. But if somebody beat the \nsystem last October, last November, last December 31, and got into our \ncountry, they are going to be given amnesty under this bill. That is \nnot sensible. It indicates we are thinking politically and not as a \nmatter of principle.\n  Advocates for this bill claim this bill is necessary because illegal \naliens have deep roots in the United States and are, therefore, \nimpossible to remove. This is simply not true in all cases. It is not \ntrue in all cases. For some cases, they are tough situations, I admit. \nBut illegal aliens who have rushed across the border in the last few \nyears, without their family--and including those who came 5 months \nago--will be given all the same amnesty benefits as those who have been \nliving here for 10 or more years in the United States, and raised \nchildren in the United States, and have never been arrested or done \nanything wrong.\n  The American people may want us to treat the illegal alien population \ncompassionately--and they do--but there is no reason to lump all \nillegal aliens into the same amnesty program regardless of when they \ngot here or how deep their roots are into the United States.\n\n  The bill also contains a provision that makes anyone who filed an \napplication to come lawfully after May 1, 2005, have to start the \nprocess over by applying for a green card through the merit system. So \nif you applied lawfully after May 1, 2005, you have to start your \nprocess all over again--a burden to the lawful applicant. It is \nfundamentally unfair those who would come here 5 months ago should be \nput on this guaranteed path.\n  Second, under this bill, only illegal aliens will be eligible for Z \nvisas--visas that allow them to live and work here forever, as long as \nthey are renewed every 4 years, and they have a special point system \nthat allows the Z visa holder to adjust status to permanent status \nwithout regard to numerical limits. These visas are not available to \nanyone living in the United States who came here to work legally and \nwho will have to go home once their visa expires.\n  Third, under the bill, unlike any alien who wants to come the proper \nway, those illegally here will get legal status 24 hours after they \napply, even if their background checks are not completed.\n  Fourth, under the bill, unlike any alien who wants to come the proper \nway, illegal aliens may be exempted from a long list of inadmissibility \ngrounds, including fraud or misrepresentation to obtain immigration \nbenefits, and false claims of U.S. citizenship; and their prior \ndeportation or removal orders can be waived, even if they never left. \nIn other words, if they have been apprehended in some fashion, have \nbeen ordered deported and given a removal order, they can still be \nexempted from that, even if they refused to leave the country, as they \nwere ordered to do so, if they can show hardship to their families.\n  Fifth, it is important to remember that under the bill, unlike an \nalien who wants to come the proper way, a Z visa holder will be able to \nget a green card through their own separate point system, and without \nbeing subjected to the regular annual numerical limits, which is a real \nadvantage, I would submit, to them.\n  I see my colleague Senator Bunning is in the Chamber. I understood he \nwants to speak, and I will be pleased to yield to him at this time.\n  But we do have a responsibility to fix this immigration system we \nhave today. It is comprehensively broken. It is a lawless system. We \narrest at the borders of the United States every year--hold your hat--\n1.1 million people. That is because the word is out all over that we do \nnot enforce our laws and you can come into this country unlawfully and \nget away with it.\n  Now, we have to make a decision as a nation: Will we create a system \nthat is lawful, that is principled, and that will work? Will we do \nthat, or will we not?\n  I have said in the last couple years when someone comes up with an \nidea that will actually work to enforce our law and end the \nlawlessness, that is what gets objected to. If you come up with an idea \nthat will not work, will only have an incremental benefit, people are \nglad to pass it and say they did something about immigration. But that \nis not the way we have been doing it.\n  In my mind, it is no good--this is the analogy I use--if someone \nattempts to jump across a 10-foot ravine and he jumps fully 9 feet but \ndoes not get across and falls to the bottom, how good is that? That is \nwhat we have been doing in immigration law. We have been passing bills. \nThey have had loophole after loophole, gimmick after gimmick, \nimpossibility after impossibility, and they have never worked. I think \nit is because in our base, in the Congress--we and the Presidents--they \nhave not wanted it to work.\n  It is time for us to listen to the American people. Their heart is \nright on this subject. They believe in immigration. They believe in a \nlawful system of immigration that can serve our national interest.\n  Mr. President, it is a pleasure to yield the floor to my colleague \nfrom Kentucky. He understands this issue with great clarity. He is a \nman of principle and courage. He also is a man you do not want to be \nbattling against with two outs and two people on base, our Hall of Fame \nbaseball pitcher, Jim Bunning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I thank Senator Sessions and thank him \nfor his input and insight into what has gone on for the last 8 weeks or \n10 weeks. I thank the Senator for his explanation today on his \nperception of what is in this bill. I wish to add a few other comments, \nand I do have a couple charts that are on their way down to the \nChamber.\n  I rise to address some of the concerns I have about last week's so-\ncalled immigration compromise and the way it is being shoved--or trying \nto be shoved--through the Senate this week. Last week's so-called \nimmigration agreement is not a compromise in the traditional sense of \nthe word. The proposal was written in secret by a small group of \nSenators and our current administration. This bill may not be a \ncompromise, but it is compromising to this country's economy, national \nsecurity, and the very foundation as a democracy rooted in the rule of \nlaw.\n\n  America is a democracy operating under the rule of law. Since the \nvery beginning of the American experiment, people came from all over \nthis world--many countries with corrupt governments--where the law only \napplied to some and could be bought by the highest bidder for others. \nThey came to live where the Government respects the individual and \nwhere the individual respects the law.\n  From our recent history, we have seen an alarming increase in \nimmigration from people who don't think they have to wait in line or \nplay by our rules. Instead of punishing these people, a few Senators \nand the administration have crafted a large-scale ``get out of jail \nfree'' pass. No matter what you call it--X, Y, or Z visas--this bill \nwill grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants all over this \ncountry. My wife and I, our 9 kids, and our 35 grandkids are all \ndescendants of immigrants. Mary and I have taught our family to be \ngrateful for our Nation's rich tradition of immigration. But more \nimportantly, we have tried to instill in our family a deep respect of \nlaw. Appreciating the contributions the immigrant brings to our Nation \ndoes not mean we will surrender the right of our Nation and its \ncitizens to decide who comes here.\n  Like many people in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and all over this \nNation, I have serious concerns about an immigration policy that \nrewards lawbreakers. Is granting amnesty to those who were lucky enough \nto be born or get to one of our border countries, and enter our country \nillegally, fair to those potential immigrants who have been waiting in \nother parts of the\n\n[[Page S6371]]\n\nworld? I wonder what message does rewarding those who willfully break \nthe law send to our Nation's young people? What message does it send to \nthe rest of the world? Doesn't it make everyone who is trying to play \nby the rules seem foolish? More practically, how many people do you \nthink are going to come over our borders? Are you going to reward 5 \nmillion people for breaking the law or will it be 10 million or maybe \n20 million? Isn't it a distinct possibility this bill will grant \namnesty to those who came here only to do our Nation harm? These are \nquestions I am willing to get serious about for the American people, \nbut is anyone else?\n  Today we are going to have a vote to move the process forward. Some \nthings are clear. This bill will grant amnesty to millions of illegal \nimmigrants, period. It is true. It also creates a massive new guest \nworker program for low-skilled workers that does not truly limit costs \nto the system. What remains unclear is how much this great compromise \nwill cost. If you look closely, the numbers are staggering.\n  In 2004, there were about 4.5 million low-skill immigrant households \nin the United States--about 5 percent of our population. That number \nhas only gone up. Let's look at this chart. Each of these households \npays about $10,500 in taxes. That is less than almost every other \nAmerican household. What is more alarming is how much they are \nreceiving. Each of these households receives an average of $30,000 a \nyear in immediate benefits. So they earn, or bring in, $10,000, and \nthey get benefits of $30,000. That means each low-skilled amnesty \nhousehold could cost the American taxpayer approximately $20,000 each \nyear. Well, actually, $19,588, or twice what they are paying in.\n  Let's go to the second chart. If we look at a breakdown in what they \nare receiving, that $30,000 a year in Social Security, Medicare, and \ntransfer programs, cash, food, housing, social services, medical care, \npublic education, and population-based services such as police and \nfire, $30,000 seems like a pretty hefty welcome basket just for \ncrossing our borders. Here shows all the other benefits, and it all \nadds up to $30,160. These are the benefits I described.\n  We will go now to chart 3. Most American families are taxpayers \nduring their working years and tax-takers during their retirement \nyears. Not so with the low-skilled amnesty family. The low-skilled \namnesty household takes more from the Government than it pays in at \nevery level. Therefore, claims that we save Social Security and other \nprograms by importing young immigrant workers are simply a myth. You \ncan see that households under 25 pay in $8,000 and take out $14,295; \nheads of household from 25 to 34, $10,000 paid in, benefits of $25,485; \nhouseholds whose head is 35 to 44, $12,000 paid in, $34,000 in \nbenefits, all the way down to where the biggest burden is when that \nimmigrant family and the head of that household becomes 65 or over, and \nthey pay in $4,500 in taxes and other things, and receive $37,500 in \nbenefits.\n  The most expensive group, of course, is the 65 and older crowd. They \ncost the American taxpayers on an average of almost $32,000 every year. \nIf we consider only the illegals given amnesty, those costs would add \nup to over--and this is shocking if you want to think about it--$2 \ntrillion--that is trillion with a T--over the lifetime they are here, \nfrom very young when they come in at 25 to when they become 65. There \nare currently 8 million nonelderly immigrants in low-skilled \nhouseholds. Eight million. Can you imagine the strain on Social \nSecurity when these people reach retirement age? Right here, where they \nare receiving the $32,000 in benefits that they don't pay in--they \ndon't match. At that moment the program will be going into crisis--that \nvery moment--because if you add them now, the baby boomers, and they \nwill reach the age of 65 about at the same time. Our Social Security \nsystem can't handle that now. What are we to do if we add 10, 15, 20 \nmillion more?\n  The upcoming budget stifles the economy by levying the largest tax \nincrease ever--ever--on American businesses and taxpayers, and what \nhave we left our kids and grandkids? The biggest bill ever that they \nwill not--I say will not--be able to pay.\n  These may be hard numbers for some people to understand, but I wish \nto talk for a moment about who will be paying these bills. Look no \nfurther than your neighbor, families who have two mid-wage earners, now \nfall into the top 40 percent of our Nation's wealthy, according to the \nInternal Revenue Code--wealthy. My daughter Amy and her husband are now \nwealthy--with four children to raise.\n  A recent study by the Tax Foundation found these working families, \nthe middle class, are carrying the weight of the Nation's tax burden on \ntheir back. And let's not forget about our small business owners. \nForty-three percent of the people in the top 20 percent of the tax \nbracket have business income, meaning they are creating jobs and wealth \nin our economy. Can you imagine the effect that continued tax \nincreases, which will be inevitable to fund this kind of amnesty \nprogram, will have on our middle-class families and our economy? Is \nanyone willing to get serious about this for the American people?\n  I don't know about my colleagues, but these numbers, over $2 \ntrillion, are pretty hard for me to comprehend. What is even more \nunbelievable is no one is talking about them. In fact, the Senate is \nbeing asked to pass this incredibly expensive bill in less than 1 \nweek--less than 1 week.\n  How our Nation chooses to deal with immigration is one of the most \nserious questions Congress must address. Our immigration policy \ndirectly affects our economy, communities, and the rule of law. It \nrequires a thorough, thoughtful, and serious debate. We should be \ndebating each and every one of these issues I have put up here on the \nchart on the floor of the Senate--not rushing to get something through \nso that the President can sign it.\n  But here we are about to vote to proceed to a bill that is not even \nin bill form. It is 326 written pages. By the time it goes into bill \nform, it will be close to 1,000 pages, and we don't even have a CBO \nestimate on the cost--not one CBO estimate. It didn't go through the \ncommittee process. At least last year we had a bill that went through \nthe committee process. It was voted out. We spent 2 weeks on the floor \nof the Senate debating it. So at least last year we had a much more \nthorough discussion.\n  The bill we dealt with and are dealing with this year has not even \nbeen considered in committee, and we are supposed to pass it by \nMemorial Day. That is a seriously flawed process. With the many \nquestions that are currently being asked about this bill, we need to \ndebate it thoroughly--each and every questionable paragraph--when they \nfinally get it into bill form.\n  We are going to have a substitute amendment shortly, after we pass a \nbill that means absolutely nothing. If they do pass cloture on last \nyear's bill, then the majority leader will propose a substitute to this \nnew bill. Wouldn't it be interesting if someone objected and made the \nclerk read every sentence in that bill? How long do you think that \nwould take? Two days, maybe more. I know the clerk would be very tired \nby the time the reading of the bill would be over. I am sure everyone \nin the Senate would realize exactly the seriousness of this bill. So I \nam asking all my colleagues in the Senate, let's not rush to judgment \non this so-called compromise immigration bill we have before us. Let's \nconsider it like the Senate should consider it. If we are the most \ndeliberative body in the whole world, we should deliberately look at \nall the nooks and crannies in this compromise bill. I ask my colleagues \nto do this.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Alabama for the time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I \nhope people heard what he said and saw the import of the charts he \nproduced. The numbers are so large it almost goes beyond our ability to \ncomprehend. But according to the senior fellow at the Heritage \nFoundation, Robert Rector, one of the most acknowledged experts on \nsocial welfare in America and the architect of the historic welfare \nreform that worked far better than critics ever said it would work, at \na press conference that Senator Bunning hosted this morning to give \nthose figures, he said in his opinion--correct me if I am wrong--and he \nstudied this and added up the numbers for days, weeks, and months, and \nhe came up with the\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\nfigure of $2.3 trillion as a net loss to the U.S. Treasury over the \nlifetime of those persons who would be given amnesty out of the 12 \nmillion; is that correct?\n  Mr. BUNNING. He used the figure 12.5 million.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Based on the fact that half of those were high school \ngraduates, that was a key factor. He was passionate; would you not \nagree?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Regarding the damage this would do to the financial \nwell-being of our country.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I know how desperate some of my construction people are \nin Kentucky, my horse farmers, the general farm community, the service \nindustry, and the motels and hotels, for workers to be here, but they \nhave to be here in legal form. They cannot be here and cheating to get \nacross the border. We have to have legal immigration to service those \njobs. I don't think this bill gets us there. That is why I have serious \ndoubts that it is the right vehicle to take care of those workers we \nwant to make sure get here to service our economy.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I agree. We are at the point of \nneeding historic reform. I believe we could do that, but we ought to \nconsider what Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have done to avoid the \nfinancial catastrophe we are headed for if we don't watch out.\n  I yield such time as he might use to Senator Vitter from Louisiana, \nwho is a lawyer and a Tulane graduate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. I, too, rise today to strongly oppose the motion to \nproceed that we will be voting on in a few hours and to strongly oppose \nthis absolute rush to judgment on this bill, rush to pass legislation \nthat will have a huge impact on our country for 25 to 50 years or more.\n  I start by thanking Senator Sessions for his hard work in defending \nthe Senate procedure that is in place for a very good reason--to ensure \nthe deliberative process, to ensure that important, weighty matters get \ncareful consideration. That is what the American people deserve.\n  That is what is absolutely threatened by this rush to pass this \nlegislation, starting with the motion to proceed that we will be voting \non in a few hours.\n  The Senate is supposed to be the world's most deliberative body. Yet \nI and many other Senate offices have not had adequate time to look \ncarefully at this so-called compromise proposal before this very \nimportant vote this afternoon. The first time the legislation was \navailable to me or any other Senator was at 2 a.m. on Saturday. Yet \nright now, Monday, in a few hours, we are being asked to essentially \nstart voting on it through the motion to proceed.\n  I am especially disappointed because I joined 16 fellow Senators \nurging the Senate leadership to provide 1-week prior notice before we \nare asked to cast votes on this massive immigration reform bill. Rather \nthan 1 week, of course, we barely get a day of the work week. As I \nsaid, this bill was not available for anyone's consideration until 2 \na.m. Saturday. Here we are on Monday about to start voting on this \nmassive bill of 800 to 900 pages, at least. Maybe it will be near a \nthousand pages when it is put into proper bill form, which hasn't \nhappened yet.\n\n  There has been no committee consideration, no committee markups and \nvetting, which is the normal course of action, which at least happened \nlast year during Senate consideration of immigration reform. Senator \nReid, the majority leader, is rushing and urging us to finish this week \nbefore the Memorial Day recess. Folks haven't had any chance to study \nthe bill yet and we are going to rush to try to finish it this week and \nthere is no estimate whatsoever of its cost, no CBO score.\n  In fact, the proponents of the bill haven't even requested, as I \nunderstand it, a CBO score to date. That should tell you something. I \nurge my fellow Senators to vote against this motion to rush to \njudgment, because that is what it is, and join the American public in \nurging the leadership to postpone any vote until it has had a proper \nchance to review carefully this massive proposal.\n  I am not against all immigration reform. I am against voting on a \nbill that only a few Senators participated in crafting and that all \nSenators have not had adequate time to study carefully.\n  Mr. President, an obvious question: Why are we in the midst of this \nrush to judgment, rush to pass this bill? I believe there is a very \nsimple political answer, and it is that if the American people fully \nunderstood what was buried in this bill, there would be a massive \noutcry against it, and Senators--politicians at heart--would have to \nreact to that outcry. I believe that is the simple, cold, hard \npolitical fact behind this rush to judgment and rush to pass this bill.\n  Of course, the biggest item that I would argue falls into that \ncategory is the Z visa section of this massive immigration reform \nproposal. It would grant amnesty--I truly believe there is no other \nappropriate word for it--to millions of illegal aliens who have broken \nour laws to come into this country, who have broken more laws to stay \nin this country and, in many cases, get jobs. But this Z visa section \nof this proposal--better known as Z visa amnesty--would give all these \nmillions and millions of illegal aliens the opportunity for pure, \nunadulterated amnesty. Make no mistake, this Z visa is amnesty, pure \nand simple. It rewards folks for breaking the law and lets them stay in \nthis country without ever having to return to their homeland forever.\n  I have an amendment that will strike the entire text of title VI and \nremove the Z visa amnesty program from the bill. I hope at least we \nhave time for consideration of that and other crucial amendments. I \nwill certainly offer this amendment, and the American public absolutely \nwants to have all Senators vote on record on that amendment and other \nimportant amendments.\n  Again, we should not absolutely rush to judgment and rush to pass \nthis bill, 800 to 900 pages or more. We don't know because it is not in \nproper bill form yet, with language only available to all Senators \nstarting 2 a.m. on Saturday, and yet here we are Monday, the first day \nof the workweek, rushing to start voting on this bill.\n\n  What is more, there is no estimate of the cost of this measure, costs \nthat will be with us for decades and decades to come, no estimate of \nthe cost, and to date the proponents of the bill haven't even asked the \nCongressional Budget Office to start working on an estimate, which \nshould give us some inkling of what that cost estimate might look like. \nYet in the midst of this, the majority leader is pushing for final \nconsideration of the bill this week, before we leave this week. Yet \nmost of us have only begun to look at its exact language.\n  Surely our Founding Fathers did not intend for this to be the \nlegislative process. Surely they did not intend for a very few to \nrepresent the many, even in the Senate. We have 100 Senators who have \nvotes in this body. All of them, not just the proponents and crafters \nof the bill, all of them, all of us should have a reasonable \nopportunity to digest this massive bill.\n  The legislative process should afford elected officials and our \ncitizens the opportunity to read, amend, and debate bills. Can we \nhonestly say we have honored that principle by going forward with votes \non this legislation starting today, with the leadership rushing to try \nto finish the entire process in the Senate by the end of the week?\n  I ask my fellow Senators, is this a precedent we really want to \nestablish for future very important legislation, legislation such as \nthis that will affect our country for decades and decades to come? \nClearly, this is not the right precedent. Clearly, we should have time \nto read the bill before we start voting on it, and we don't here. \nClearly, we should have time to hear from the American people about the \nvery important elements in this bill, and we don't. Clearly, all of us \nshould know the cost estimate of this bill. We should get a CBO score \nbefore we start voting on this bill. And we don't. We are not likely to \nhave that score before the end of Senate consideration with the \nproponents not even having asked for a CBO score, to my knowledge, to \ndate. Clearly, something is up with this rushed process.\n  Clearly, this process needs to go beyond this week, through the \nMemorial\n\n[[Page S6373]]\n\nDay recess, so we can have an adequate and full national debate; not \njust Senate debate but a national debate among all our citizens and \nthen be allowed to come back, flesh out details, offer more amendments, \nhaving digested the entire bill.\n  On any vitally important matter, on any key bill numbering 1,000 \npages or so, on any legislation that will affect our country for \ndecades and pose costs in the trillions and trillions of dollars, that \nis the right course of action. One has to wonder in that context why \nthe Senate leadership is pushing for exactly the opposite course of \naction.\n  Again, I urge all of my colleagues, however they are leaning on this \nbill, which they have only begun to read, to vote no on this motion to \nproceed to preserve the integrity of the Senate, the deliberative \nprocess, and to respect the American people enough to give them, as \nwell as ourselves, the time to digest all important aspects of this \nmassive bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana and \nvalue his insight into these matters and so many other matters in the \nSenate. He has an incisive mind and is committed to the principles that \nhave made America great.\n  I wish to follow up on a few points that indicate to me the \nunhealthiness of where we are. Here is an Associated Press article from \nSaturday. Once again, we are hearing statements from the people who met \nto write this bill, as we did last year, that any amendments threaten \nthe whole bill and it may not pass. It might fall apart if somebody in \nthe Senate were to disagree and offer an amendment that was different \nthan something the self-appointed negotiators agreed upon; and not just \nthey agreed upon, but maybe some outside influences and special \ninterests who have been working behind the scenes to see this \nlegislation become reality from the beginning.\n  I remember last year in the debate having an exchange with one of my \ncolleagues who objected to amendments and said that we couldn't do this \namendment, that the compromise that these groups had worked on together \nmight collapse if a trigger amendment, I believe it was, that Senator \nIsakson was offering passed.\n  I remember asking: Who was in this room where you all met? Were you \nelected to be in this room? Did outside groups submit information and \napprove or disapprove various provisions contained in the legislation? \nAre those the people who are going to be unhappy if some Member of the \nSenate, duly elected by the people of their State, disagrees and votes \nit down? Who gets to decide what is in a piece of legislation? The \nwhole Senate or not? I just see some of that same little tendency out \nthere today.\n  I have an article by the Associated Press. This article goes on to \nnote:\n\n       Any one of the changes has the potential to sink the whole \n     measure, which was unveiled with fanfare Thursday but still \n     was being drafted late Friday.\n\n  That is what Julia Hirschfield Davis said. She goes on to quote \nCommerce Secretary Gutierrez, who helped negotiate the compromise who \n``cautioned against revisions that could upset the framework.''\n  I would like to have seen the bill follow the framework that \nSecretary Gutierrez and Secretary Chertoff provided when they said we \nwere going to have a new bill. That framework sounded pretty good to \nme, but the details of it are not holding up to the principles of that \nframework.\n  Secretary Gutierrez said:\n\n       You take something out and you're creating a problem \n     throughout the system--you may think that you're only \n     tweaking one part. . . . We've got to be very careful as to \n     what is proposed to change.\n\n  In other words, don't be messing with what we worked on.\n  Interest groups also seem to be well informed:\n\n       \"We're going to fight like mad to fix the parts we don't \n     like,'' said Tom Snyder, the national political director of \n     Unite Here!, a service workers union comprised largely of \n     immigrants.\n\n  Not a normal union, a service worker union, comprised of immigrants.\n  Then liberal activists who call the measure a good start but object \nto parts, but they say they have `` `a couple of bites at the apple' to \nchange it as it makes its way to President Bush's desk, said Frank \nSharry, the executive director of the National Immigration Forum.''\n  And another:\n\n       ``We're not sure that our support will continue if the bill \n     that approaches the finish line has these kind of problems in \n     it,'' says Cecilia Munoz of the National Council of La Raza.\n\n  So they make their points. All I am saying to my colleagues is that \nit is our responsibility as Members of this body to take extremely \nseriously the responsibility we have been given to craft an immigration \npolicy that will serve--surely we can all agree--the national interest \nof the United States and the people who live here--a just, legitimate \nnational interest. That has to be the pole star of what we are doing, a \nguiding star of how we are going to do our work. If we don't commit to \nthat, then we are going to have real problems. We are going to try to \nadjust immigration policy based on special interest groups, what they \nthink is important to them in the short run.\n  If you are a business and hire people and don't have to have health \ncare for them and they get sick, you don't have to take care of them, \nbut they can go down to the local emergency room and have it paid for \nby the city and the county in which that person lives and you have \ngained an economic advantage.\n  Why would you want to hire a lawful American citizen if you have to \nhave more benefits or pay more wages? This is a real factor. We have to \ntalk about it. You can bring in enough workers and, in fact, we are \nalready doing it, to the degree it will drive down the wages of decent, \nhonest, hard-working American citizens and prohibit them in this time \nof economic growth and prosperity of seeing their wages rise as those \ncorporate leaders are seeing their wages rise in this time of \nprosperity with profits up.\n  In fact, Professor Borjas of Harvard, who has written the book \n``Heaven's Door,'' himself a Cuban refugee, is very concerned about the \nlarge flow of low-skilled immigration workers into America. Professor \nBorjas says, in his estimate it has reduced the wages of lower skilled \nAmerican workers by 8 percent. That is real money. Not only that, it \nhas prohibited people from having a chance to progress and rise in the \nranks and be promoted and get an even larger paycheck than just the \nlower scale at which they may have started.\n  On the Mall--not even on the Mall, at the foot of this Capitol--last \nyear during this debate, I was taking a Saturday morning walk. An \nindividual, an African American from Montgomery, AL, spoke with me. I \nwent over and talked with him. He was going to visit relatives in New \nJersey, and he stopped by with the family to see the Capitol.\n  I asked him what he did. He said he was in the drywall business in \nMontgomery. I asked him how he was doing. We first talked about how \ngood the economy in Alabama was doing. We had good economic growth and \na lot of building had been going on. I asked him how things were going \nwith him. He said: Yes, the county and the city are doing wonderful, \nbut we're not doing so well.\n  I said: What do you mean?\n  He said: My father started this business as a young man, and we have \nbeen carrying it on. Really these are as bad a times as we have ever \nhad.\n  Why? Montgomery is growing, houses are popping up everywhere. There \nis economic growth in the commercial area in addition. I said: Why? Do \nyou think it has anything to do with immigration?\n  He said: I don't have anything against immigrants. I like them. But, \nyes, it really has. We have lost a lot of work.\n  So I am saying to my colleagues, it is not always true that nobody \nwill do this work. Sometimes it is a question of whether they will or \ncan do it at a salary and an income level we want them to have, at a \nsalary and income level that will allow them to take care of their \nfamily, that will provide a retirement benefit or health care for their \nfamily if someone gets sick. There are thousands, tens of thousands and \nhundreds of thousands of individuals similar to this man I just \ndescribed who are seeing their piece of the economic pie being eroded.\n  People disagree about that. They say it is not so. But I submit it is \nbasic economics.\n\n[[Page S6374]]\n\n  We grow cotton and corn in Alabama. If someone were to bring into \nthis country huge amounts of cotton, causing the price of cotton to \nfall, we would hear from our farmers, and people would oppose that, \nsaying that is not proper. If they brought in huge amounts of corn and \ndepressed the price of corn, wouldn't we be concerned about that? Is \nanybody concerned about the low-skilled worker, where we are seeing \nunprecedented numbers of people doing low-skilled work and adversely \nimpacting the wages of workers in America today? It is happening.\n  Do we need immigration? Do we have jobs that can't be filled by \nAmerican workers? I think so. I have talked to business people in my \nState. I have had them tell me what is happening and share their ideas, \nand I am convinced we do. That is why I proposed last year that we \ncreate a legitimate temporary worker program, one that would actually \nwork.\n  The proposal in last year's bill was breathtaking in its lack of \nwisdom. The bill last year had a provision called temporary guest \nworker. But when you read it, what it said was that a temporary guest \nworker could come to America for 3 years as a temporary worker and they \ncould bring their families with them; after 3 years, they could reup \nagain for another 3 years and another 3 years and another 3 years. \nAfter the first 3 years here, they could apply to be a green card \nholder or a permanent resident and then be put on the road to \ncitizenship. That is not a temporary worker program. Those people were \nsupposed to go home after a certain period of time. But the way that \nproposal was set, they would not go home. Their children would be born \nhere, their families would be settled here, and their roots would be \ndeep in American soil and in the American community. Their kids would \nnow be in junior high school, and somebody is going to walk in and say: \nSorry, it is time for you to go back home to Mexico or Honduras or \nChina or wherever they may have come from? That is not a practical \nsolution. That makes no sense.\n  We know we are not going to want to confront that kind of situation, \nso we objected to that and urged the idea that they have a legitimate \ntemporary worker program and a legitimate program that is a temporary \nworker program, which would mean the worker came here without their \nfamily for a limited period of time and, with circularity, would go \nback home after their period of work had occurred.\n  That is being done throughout the world today. A group from Colombia \napplies, and they go to Canada and they work for a season and then \nreturn home to Colombia. They never have any problem with that. They do \nnot bring their families. They do not settle in for 3 years and then \nthe Government of Canada expects them to go home. They have created a \nsystem that actually works because it is based on common sense and \nhuman nature.\n  What I suggest is that we create a genuine temporary worker program \nwhere people can come to our country to meet those needs certified by \nthe Department of Labor and that are in crisis. For example, my \ncolleague, Senator Vitter from New Orleans, and I have talked about \nHurricane Katrina. That is a national crisis. There are not enough \nworkers to do the roofing and other things that need to be done. That \nwould provide a basis for the Department of Labor to allow temporary \nworkers--maybe more than normal--to come to the United States to help \nus through this crisis program. You could do that and still not pull \ndown the wages of American workers, yet fill a critical need.\n  I believe that if we are to avoid the problem of permanence, avoid \nthe problem of a system that will not work because it invites people to \nsink their roots into the United States, it must be a system that does \nnot allow families to come with the temporary workers. I believe \nstrongly and I urge my colleagues to let us have a temporary guest \nworker program that allows people to come for 10 months and no more and \nspend at least 10 months at home. With a good ID, they could go back \nand forth throughout the year if they chose to. That would work.\n  Some say: Well, some companies aren't seasonal. Some companies need \npeople all year. Well, you could stagger the number, for heaven's sake. \nThe return-home periods could be staggered. Maybe you would need for a \ngiven business 12 workers instead of 10, but you could cover the whole \nperiod. The system would be clear that the person would come just for \ntemporary work and would go home. Frankly, I am not aware of why we \nwould want to say that type of program should end. As long as a person \nwanted to come and as long as a business wanted them there to work, I \ndon't see why they should be required to end after 6 years or 8 years \nor however many.\n  Now, under this bill, what we find is this: Under the temporary \nworker program that is supposed to be without family, we find that 20 \npercent of them do bring their families. Not only that, they do not \ncome for 1 year or less; they would come for 2 years, have to go home \nfor 6 months, come back for 2 years, go home for 6 months, come back \nfor 2 years, go home, and never return, which is sort of weird, to me. \nSo I am just not sure that this has been thought out carefully.\n  I believe we could create a better, more practical immigration \nsystem--one which we could be proud of and which would actually work--\nand provide the amount of labor we really need in our economy without \nhaving an amount that depresses the wages of American workers. We have \nto be careful about that. We really do.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator Corker from Tennessee is here, my \nneighbor, super mayor of Chattanooga, just across the Alabama line. If \nyou can't be from Alabama, Chattanooga is a good place to be. I yield \nsuch time as the Senator would consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank my neighbor from the great State \nof Alabama, and I rise today to express concerns over the speed at \nwhich this legislation is being addressed this week.\n  I thank the many Senators and all the staff members who have worked \nfor weeks and months to put forward this piece of legislation--a piece \nof legislation we received at 1:58 on Saturday morning. This is a \ncondensed form. In its bigger form, it could be three times this size. \nThis evening, at 6 o'clock, I will be meeting with other Senators to \nwalk through this legislation to see its impact on the citizens of this \ncountry, to see its impact on neighborhoods, on public hospitals, on \nschools, on counties, on judicial systems, on sheriffs, on businesses, \nand on people throughout this country.\n  Many of the pieces of legislation we deal with in this body relate to \ntax reform or they are pieces of legislation that may deal with a \nprogram. I don't know of any piece of legislation that touches as many \npeople in as many ways as does this piece of legislation. So I rise \ntoday to encourage my fellow Senators to take a break, to give us the \nopportunity to actually digest this legislation.\n  Again thanking the Senators who spent so much time in giving us this \npiece of work here for us now to debate, I rise today to encourage my \nfellow Senators not to rush into this debate, to give us the time to \nactually look through the intricacies of this bill and see how it \naffects everyone involved.\n  This is one of the most major pieces of legislation we will deal with \nin this Congress. My attempt today is in no way to stonewall, in no way \nto not deal with an issue that is important to our country, but instead \nto make sure we, the ``greatest deliberative body in the world,'' \nactually deliberate, that we actually look at this bill in detail, that \nwe actually take our responsibilities seriously.\n  I have great concerns over the content of this legislation. My guess \nis that many of the people involved in drafting this legislation have \ngreat concerns over this legislation. We all should take the time this \nweek to go through and look at what this legislation actually says and \nto hear from groups that are actually affected seriously by this piece \nof legislation. Perhaps we should take our normal recess, or work \nthrough it if we need to, but come back and then, as the ``greatest \ndeliberative body in the world,'' actually deliberate and debate this \nlegislation.\n  Again, I have great concerns, and I am rising here in the Senate to \nask other Senators to join me in urging caution, to make sure we put \nforth a\n\n[[Page S6375]]\n\npiece of legislation that truly reflects the values of this country and \naddresses this immigration issue in the way it ought to be addressed.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the great Senator from the State of \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, and \nI believe he is telling us correctly that the way we were taught in \nschool is that Senators ought to have an opportunity to understand what \nis before them before they vote. We are dealing with an extremely \ncomplex piece of legislation, and the more you get into it, the more I \nhave been involved in it as a member of the Judiciary Committee and in \nthe floor debate last year, the more I see you have to be realistic and \npractical and thoughtful and principled if you want to make this system \nwork, and we are a long way from that.\n  I think what Senator Bunning said earlier about the cost of this bill \nis important for us to consider. I understand some work is being done \non a CBO score. I don't know if that is true, but I have heard that the \nCongressional Budget Office is attempting to score this, but it is \ndifficult, I assume. They can't give a real score because we don't even \nhave the bill in final form yet. It is still referred to as a draft and \nhasn't even been introduced. So until something is actually introduced, \nthere is no way we can get a score. But I can tell you a little bit \nabout the way this thing was handled last year.\n  Those of us who were concerned about it last year asked for a score \non the bill from the Congressional Budget Office to find out how much \nit would actually cost. We got a troubling number, and we used that \nnumber a day before we had a final vote, and then a month or so later, \nwe got a more complete score from the Congressional Budget Office. I \nthink that bill was probably less complicated than the one we are \ndealing with today, and they scored the bill, over 10 years, to be $127 \nbillion in cost. Now, they excluded from that the money we spent on \nenforcement. I didn't count that. This was based on lost tax revenue, \nit was based on the welfare and other direct benefits to people who \nwould be legalized under that bill and how much more they would draw \nfrom the Treasury than they would pay into the Treasury, and they came \nup with a cost of $127 billion over 10 years. Similar to last year's \nbill, this bill puts things off for 10 years. That is what the Budget \nOffice scores normally on, a 10-year cycle. They score it on that \nbasis, and that is how they came up with $127 billion.\n  When we asked them--I believe at a public hearing--what about the \nnext 10 years, they said: Well, it would definitely escalate. It will \ndefinitely be higher. Okay. Why? Well, because the lineup and the \nmovement of people to green cards and citizenship was delayed by the \nbill. They were legalized in our country and they could stay, but they \ndidn't get a permanent resident status, which gives you many welfare \nbenefits and other benefits and citizenship, until the second 10 years. \nDo you understand that? That is when the big money is out there. That \nis what Robert Rector told us today at this press conference. That is \nwhat his study at the Heritage Foundation points out. He convinced us \nall last year. One thing you don't hear as much as you used to--oh, we \nneed this immigration flow, these hard-working, low-skilled immigrants; \nthey do a good job for us, and that is going to help us with Social \nSecurity and Medicare because we are an aging population, and we need \nthose people coming into the country. They are going to help us with \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n\n  Mr. Rector demolished that argument. It is completely bogus. It is \noff the table. I hope nobody will suggest that anymore. Those were the \npeople I called the masters of the universe up on Wall Street somewhere \nthinking they know: ``Oh, well, we don't want to be like Europe, we \nwill just bring in this immigration and that will solve our debt \nproblems for the future.''\n  Isn't that wonderful. But it doesn't work that way. Mr. Rector \nexplained it last year and today with tremendous passion at a press \nconference. Half of the 12 million people here--at least half, maybe \nmore, maybe 60 percent, there are different estimates--do not have a \nhigh school degree. Some of them are illiterate even in their own \nlanguage. Mr. Rector studied the numbers on that. He used a framework \nof the National Academy of Sciences study in 1990. That study tried to \nanalyze the economic impact of immigration. He took this \ndisproportionate number of low-skilled and uneducated workers and he \ndemonstrated, as Senator Bunning told us, that it is not this year and \nnot next year the crisis will hit us, but in the outyears. Do you know \nwhat Mr. Rector said? He said they will begin to draw the biggest \namount of money about the time the baby boomers are drawing the biggest \namount of money out of the Treasury, and Medicare and Social Security \nwill be damaged tremendously by this program.\n  It is hard to talk about that. It is painful to talk about it in \nthose terms, I have to tell you. We hate to do that. But a nation like \nCanada has had to deal with it. They wrestled with it and they decided \nit makes sense for them, since they cannot accept everybody who wishes \nto come to Canada--it would overflow the country, and more people want \nto come than they can accept--that they would accept people who have \nthe job skills, the education, and the language skills that will be \nsuccessful in Canada and therefore they will pay more in taxes than \nthey will take out in benefits.\n  Mr. Rector calculated what happens when you take the workers, the \nlow-skilled workers who will be provided permanent legal status--call \nit amnesty or not--in this country, who will all be able to stay. He \nfactored out a mortality rate. He was very complex and detailed in the \nanalysis, following the principles of the National Academy of Sciences. \nHe concludes it would cost the U.S. Treasury, over the lifetime of the \npeople who will be provided amnesty, $2.3 trillion.\n  A trillion is 1,000 billion. I got into an argument down here about \nattorneys' fees and I talked about attorneys getting $50 million and \n$100 million. One attorney in Mississippi got a $100 million check and \nno bank in Mississippi could cash the check. I was winning the \nargument. Then we started finding out they got billion dollar fees. The \nBaltimore Orioles guy got $2 billion in legal fees. We started talking \nabout billions and I lost everybody. Nobody understood what we were \ntalking about. It was too big; nobody could comprehend it and the steam \nwent out of the debate.\n  But I am telling you, $2.3 trillion is a lot of money; $2,300 billion \nis what that is. Pretty soon you are talking about real money. We have \nto think about this. I hope we will--very much.\n  I will raise it as a moral issue. Remember, we have a certain zero \nsum game. We will put an ultimate level on the number of people who can \nenter our country. The question is, who will enter our country? We \nknow, as I noted earlier, in the year 2000, 11 million applied for the \n50,000 lottery slots. Think about that, 11 million want to come to \nAmerica and they applied for those lottery slots. Only 50,000 names \nwere drawn out of that 11 million. We can't accept everybody, and we \nshould focus on what we can do for the people who will most likely \nflourish here, will pay more in taxes than they will take out in \nrevenues, and who have proven themselves acceptable. Since we can't \ntake everybody, let's raise this question.\n  Under the current law, here is the choice for the immigration \nofficial. You have a person who dropped out of high school, has not \ndone very well, has no English skills, but has a brother in the United \nStates who is a citizen. Compare that to another young man in Honduras, \nsay, who finished at the top of his class, and was the valedictorian. \nHe took English classes because he wanted to take English. People all \nover the world learn English today. It is an international language. \nMillions of people know English all over the world. So he knows \nEnglish. He took the technical and college courses he could get there. \nHe had a couple of years in college. They both apply to be citizens. \nWho gets in? The answer is crystal clear: The brother with no \neducation, no skills, is going to get in, and the other one will have \nzero chance to get in.\n  We need family reunification. Everybody who becomes a citizen needs \nto be able to bring their parents. Why?\n\n[[Page S6376]]\n\nChurch groups are asking that. I ask, Why? If somebody leaves their \nfamily, goes to the United States of America, decides to be an American \ncitizen and now feels they have a constitutional right to bring their \naging parents in to be taken care of by the American health care \nsystem, why is that? If that parent is brought in, it denies that young \nperson in Honduras, who has worked hard, studied hard, learned English, \nand dreams of being an American and dreams of the opportunity of coming \nto this country--because we have a limit to how many people can come. \nSee? If we can't accept everybody, what basis do we use to decide who \ngets to come?\n  I think that is an important concept. I urged and was very pleased \nwhen the White House and members of this group who are negotiating this \nbill said they were going to move to the Canadian point system, a \nmerit-based system. That is the right thing for us to do. It only makes \ncommon sense. It is what Australia, New Zealand, as well as Canada, are \ndoing. I understand the Brits are moving in that direction. I think \nthey are moving towards it in The Netherlands and other advanced \ncountries.\n\n  We ought to be moving in that direction. I am disappointed the move \nwas so small, and such an incremental step. I am not even sure that is \ngoing to be acceptable because prominent Democratic Senators have \nsaid--and Senator Reid earlier today used this phrase, which made me \nnervous,--``this is a good start.''\n  What does a ``good start'' mean? It means, well, it may change on the \nfloor of the Senate. Then it could go to Nancy Pelosi and the House of \nRepresentatives, and they may take out the merit-based point system. Or \nit could go to conference where the conference committee will be formed \nto work out differences between the House bill and the Senate bill, and \nwho will dominate the conference? Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. She will \nappoint a majority of the House Members and Harry Reid will appoint a \nmajority of the Senate Members, and the bill then comes right out. What \nthey say is going to be in it. Senator Reid a while ago indicated his \nconcern about a move away from family migration.\n  I don't know; I am nervous about this legislation. Here we go, are we \ngoing to get together and hit the bait? They throw out a point system, \na merit-based system like Canada, and this is going to be a big deal \nand we all bite it and it is not there. We get hooked.\n  What we do know is it is a very small step. It may be an important \nstep, but a small step. According to Senator Kennedy in his press \nconference and his statements through his staff, they calculate this \nwill move the merit-based system in the United States from the 22 \npercent we have today to 30 percent. About 8 or 10 percent is all it is \ngoing to increase merit-based immigration into America. That is what he \nsaid.\n  He said it to the leftist groups that have all been hollering about \nthis and objecting. He says, Don't worry, there is nothing to it, it is \nnot a point system at all. His staff, I believe his press secretary, \nsaid flat out, ``This is a family-based immigration system.''\n  You tell me what it is. Canada got to 60 percent, Australia 62 \npercent, on merit based. They are very happy with that. I have met with \nthe director of the Canadian system. I met with an individual from \nAustralia who is involved with it. I asked him how it was working, are \nthey happy? Yes, they are.\n  They considered things such as if you are willing to go to a more \nrural province that needs workers, you get more points. Because that \nserves the Canadian or Australian interest. A lot of things such as \nthat can be made part of a thoughtful bill, which we do not have here, \nI am afraid.\n  Why is it important we go to the merit-based system? There are 2.3 \ntrillion reasons why.\n  Look at immigration. Rector explained it to us last year. He is a \nsenior fellow at Heritage. You get sort of a skewed picture. If you \ntake the smaller number who come to America with any college, he said--\n2 years of college or above--they tend to do fabulously well. They tend \nto be very successful. They and their children almost never go on \nwelfare. They pay their medical bills. They do well and they prosper. \nMany of them are providing scientific expertise that may be the cure \nfor cancer and other diseases and have other capabilities, so that has \ntremendous benefits to us.\n  When you add it all up and average them out, it makes the fundamental \nsystem look better than it is. But if you take the lower skilled \nworkers, their productivity is not as great.\n  I do not believe we ought to create a system that denies people, \nthose who come in initially on a lower skilled workforce basis, the \nright to apply and compete on a merit basis. So if you choose to come \nas a low-skilled worker, you work as a bricklayer or something of the \nkind, you take advantage of junior college courses and you learn \nEnglish and you get a few hours or some years of credit in college, and \nthen you apply. They should be very competitive. They will know English \nprobably by that time. We are not creating an underclass that gives \nthem no chance to apply. But the system should apply, I suggest, in \nsuch a way that temporary workers can apply for permanent resident \nstatus and compete against anybody else. I believe that will work.\n  We have very little increase in the bill as we see it in the high-\nskilled workers. We have not made a lot of progress toward dealing with \nthose, many of the highly educated people who graduate from our best \nuniversities. They come here, advance to the top of their class at a \nuniversity, and we often send them straight home.\n  I think we have a strong feeling that we should fix that. But, so \nfar, our evaluation of the bill indicates that it is not fixed very \nwell at all.\n  Congress needs to seize the moment. We need to pass legislation that \nwill improve our immigration policy, a policy that serves our national \ninterests, our legitimate, just national interests, and that will \nsecure our border and create a lawful system.\n  These goals will not be accomplished by last year's bill. That is \nwhat we will be voting on in a few minutes, cloture on last year's \nbill, which I have a great deal of concern with and could delineate a \nhost of reasons it is a total disaster. And they won't be accomplished \nwith a new bill that we are forcing through today.\n  So that is a concern for us. I do believe the principles set forth in \nthe PowerPoint presentation attracted my attention, got my interest up \nbecause I thought it would move from a framework that last year's bill \nhad, which was a failed framework, to a framework that could actually \nbe effective to accomplish what we want.\n  I am disappointed, almost heartbroken, because we made some progress \ntoward getting to this new framework, but the political wheeling and \ndealing and compromising and splitting the baby has resulted in a \ncircumstance that--we just did not get far enough. I wish we could do \nbetter. We have got to do better. This is a historic opportunity.\n  If we do not grab the bull by the horns now, we are going to be \nsorry. I would suggest that my colleagues say now is the time to pass a \nbill. I agree. But what I would say in addition is, let's pass a good \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Nelson. I \nbelieve he wanted to share some remarks. I would be glad to yield to \nhim in a moment and just say that I appreciate his service to the \ncountry on the Armed Services Committee. I was a member of his \ndelegation. We got back a few weeks ago from Iraq.\n  Senator Nelson, thank you for your leadership of that delegation. It \nwas a meaningful visit to Fallujah and other places. Thank you for your \nprincipled and effective leadership on immigration. I yield to you at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nAlabama. It is true that we did have a very eventful trip to Iraq to \ntalk about what needs to be done there.\n  But today the opportunity arises to discuss the concern that I have \nwith the latest attempt by some of my colleagues to push forward with a \n``comprehensive'' immigration reform bill.\n  We have been here before. Last year, the Senate pushed through a \nmammoth bill that sought to reform our immigration laws on a \ncomprehensive basis. Yet, as predicted, that bill failed. It was a ``do \neverything'' bill that ended up doing nothing.\n\n[[Page S6377]]\n\n  Well, here we are again this year watching efforts to push through \nanother ``do everything'' bill. What is more, this year the language \nhas yet to be finalized, and certainly no Member of this body has been \ngiven the kind of time needed to review the proposal and analyze its \nprovisions.\n  Our immigration system is broken. But, apparently, so is our system \nfor fixing it. That is why last year I tried to change the debate on \nimmigration reform. Along with my colleague, Senator Sessions, and our \ncolleague, Senator Coburn, we introduced a bill that focused solely on \nthe most important component of immigration reform, and the first \ncomponent of immigration reform, border security.\n  Last year during this debate, I tried time and time again to convince \nmy colleagues that a comprehensive bill would get nothing accomplished \nand that we needed to concentrate on securing the border first. Today \nwe find ourselves right back where we were last year: debating a \ncomprehensive bill that has not been finalized, has not been given \nproper consideration, and that, again, will not achieve any of the \ngoals we had. So, again this year, I emphasize to my colleagues we must \nconcentrate on border security first.\n  We can only hope to solve our immigration problems if we take it one \nstep at a time. There are three steps to resolving this problem: First \nis border security; second is fixing legal immigration and the process \nof legal immigration; and third is addressing those who are here \nillegally.\n  Now, we can take steps 1 and 2 at the same time. So we made some \nprogress on the first step last year. We passed the Secure Fence \nInitiative, and the folks at DHS have made some progress on fixing and \nsecuring the border. We should give the border security provisions a \nchance to prove that they will work and can effectively slow and stop \nillegal immigration. But instead we are being asked to jump to step 3 \nbefore steps 1 and 2 are completed.\n  We need to concentrate on accomplishing border security first, as the \nfirst step for the first leg of this stool. We still have a lot of work \nto do to fix our current system of legal immigration. Why would we jump \nthis step and reward these who are here illegally and effectively \npunish those trying to enter this country legally, the right way?\n  The current immigration process has left so many people frustrated \nwith trying to do the right thing and enter this country legally. \nClearly, we should make sure to help those individuals first. As I have \nsaid time and again, we need to close the back door to illegal \nimmigration while we open the front door to legal immigration. Instead, \nthis bill adds more complications and more complexity to our legal \nimmigration system that is currently overworked with backlogs and long \nwait times for people who want to enter this country the right way.\n\n  We cannot change the letters for a visa from H to Y or Z and expect \nit to work better. We cannot add some complicated and difficult point \nsystem and expect it to work. We have to fix the system for legal \nimmigration, not make it more complicated and even more unworkable. \nThis bill will add more problems onto a broken system. We are digging \nourselves deeper.\n  Therefore, I believe only after we have accomplished the first two \nsteps, which we can do, and can demonstrate that we have made \nconsiderable progress toward solving those problems, only then can we \nproceed to the third step and turn our attention to handling 10 or 12 \nor more million people who are here illegally.\n  We must secure the borders so we do not have millions more illegal \nimmigrants. If we do not, we will only encourage millions more to cross \nthe border illegally in the hopes of being part of the amnesty offered \nunder this legislation.\n  From what I have seen and read thus far, I think this bill is only \nabout half right. Since it has a series of so-called triggers, the \ncurrent compromise certainly seems to recognize that we have to do \nborder security first. So if we recognize we cannot solve our \nimmigration problems without first securing the border, then why do we \ncontinue to insist on mixing in the comprehensive provisions at the \nsame time?\n  If we can understand the need for triggers based on border security \nand workplace enforcement, then we should understand that we cannot \nsolve this problem all at once. Why do we continue to rush to pass some \n``comprehensive'' measure when we can approach this problem one step at \na time?\n  I propose that instead of triggers, we should consider only passing \nthose provisions dealing with border security and enforcement and those \nprovisions dealing with worksite and interior enforcement. Instead of \npushing through everything at once, we need to start solving the \nproblem at the border and working from there.\n  In conclusion, I will vote for cloture on the motion to proceed, but \nnot because I support the underlying bill. I will support cloture only \nbecause I hope we can significantly improve this bill so that it \naddresses the problem properly: at the border first and then fixing the \nlegal immigration system. If we do not come up with a bill that \nproperly addresses the issue the way I believe it needs to be \naddressed, then I will not be able to support the final product.\n  I will vote to give us a chance to create a bill that focuses on \nsecuring the border first and that fixes our broken system for legal \nimmigration. I will not, however, support a comprehensive amnesty-based \nbill that creates more problems and that fails to secure our borders \nfirst.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceed to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I had time set aside. Has that time \nexpired? How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 1 minute 20 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, well, I see my colleagues here. I \nthank Senator Nelson for his work on immigration last year and this \nyear. I see others here prepared to speak. I yield back the remainder \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the remaining time \nuntil 5:30 p.m. shall be equally divided and controlled by the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 38 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nColorado might use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, let me first begin by making some \nacknowledgments as we move forward on this debate on immigration reform \nfor our country.\n  First, to the majority leader, Senator Reid, for having kept the feet \nto the fire in this Chamber so that we finally will have an opportunity \nto move on to one of the most important national security issues that \nour Nation faces today. I appreciate his efforts and his leadership to \nhelp lead our country in a way where we deal effectively with this very \ndifficult and contentious issue of immigration reform.\n  I also thank the President of the United States, President Bush, and \nhis Cabinet Secretaries Chertoff and Gutierrez for the work they have \ndone now over the last 3 months as we have tried to put together a \ncomprehensive immigration reform proposal that will work for our \ncountry.\n  I thank my colleagues in the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, \nwho have come together in good faith to try to deal with this very \nimportant issue. I know we have a long week ahead of us as we move \nforward with the immigration debate on the reform proposal in the \nSenate. I am confident at the end of the day the national security of \nthis\n\n[[Page S6378]]\n\ncountry will require us to move forward with passage of legislation \nthat will bring our Nation into the 21st-century reality of the \nimmigration challenges that we face.\n  As I approach this debate and I have worked on this legislation over \nthe last 4 years--I am mindful of several things: First, that this is \nnot a new debate; this is a debate where last year, for 1 month, we \nspent 1 month of the time of the Senate on this floor dealing with the \nvery same issues that we are going to deal with again.\n  So for those on the other side who might say this is coming upon us \ntoo fast, I will simply remind them of two things: First, we spent an \nentire month dealing with immigration reform last year, and we were \nable to get a bipartisan consensus to vote a bill out of the Senate \nlast year. And, secondly, we were given very ample warning by Senator \nReid when he said to all of us that this was an important issue that we \nwould be working on in the last timeframe remaining before the Memorial \nDay break.\n  So here we are now. The time has arrived. We must not let our country \ndown. We must move forward and deal with immigration reform in a way \nthat makes the most sense.\n  Now, as I approached this issue, I asked myself the following \nquestion: What is the aim? What is the aim?\n  Well, the aim is about the national security of the United States. \nHow is it that we are going to provide a greater amount of security to \nthe United States of America? In my view, the bipartisan legislation \nthat has been put together is a tough law-and-order bill and a real \nbill, a realistic bill that provides realistic solutions.\n  It is not a bill that is liked by those who want essentially not to \nhave any progress on immigration reform because they would rather the \ndebate go on not 2 years, not 5 years, but 10 or 20 years. It is not \nabout satisfying them. This issue, from our point of view, is making \nsure the national objectives are objectives that we are able to \naddress.\n  Let me talk to you to let you know what it is that is on my mind. \nFirst, we need to secure our borders. As a nation, we have a sovereign \nright to make sure our borders are secure. As a nation that is very \nconcerned--rightfully so--about the threat of terrorism, it is \nimportant we know who it is that is coming in and leaving our country. \nWe need to know our borders are, in fact, secure.\n  Second, we need to know the laws within our country are being \nenforced. For far too long on the issue of immigration, our enforcement \nmechanisms have looked the other way. That has allowed a system of \nlawlessness and illegality to continue. We need to have a system of \nlaws that will, in fact, be enforced. That honors a fundamental value \nof our Nation, which is that we are a nation of laws. For us simply to \nlook the other way is not the American way. This bill will accomplish \nthat.\n  Third, we need to secure the future of America's economic realities \nand challenges. We do that with a process that will penalize those who \nare here illegally. We will have them pay fines that will put them at \nthe back of the line, that will require them to learn English and to \nremain crime free. Then if they survive a purgatory of, on average, 11 \nyears, at that point in time they would be eligible for a green card. \nSo for those on the other side who might say this is an issue of \namnesty, they are wrong. When you have to march through that kind of \npain and pay the fine and do the time for having violated the law, it \nis far from anything that anyone ought to be labeling as amnesty.\n  Let me spend a few minutes talking about each of the components; \nfirst, securing America's borders. It is true that there are about half \na million, maybe 600,000 people who come across our borders illegally \nevery year. What we have done in the legislation we crafted together is \nwe have required that there be a set of triggers that have to be met \nwith respect to securing our borders. We will require that there be \n18,000 new Border Patrol officers helping us secure our borders. We \nwill require 370 miles of fencing to make sure that in those areas that \nare vulnerable on our border, those areas are secure. We will require \n200 miles of vehicle barriers in other places to make sure that that \nborder is secure both on the south end as well as the northern. We will \nrequire 70 ground-based radar and camera towers so we can keep watch on \nthe entire border. We will require seven UAVs, unmanned aerial \nvehicles, to make sure we know what is happening across our borders, \nand we will require new checkpoints for ports of entry.\n  When this legislation is introduced, passed, and when this \nlegislation gets implemented, as it will be, one thing we can tell the \nAmerican people is we will have a secure border. Securing our borders \nis not enough, because the other aim has to be enforcing our laws \nwithin the interior of the country. Some people say it is all of the \nillegals across the southern border that has led to the current reality \nof 12 million undocumented workers. The fact is, many of the people who \nare undocumented workers entered this country through legal means. They \nsimply overstayed their visas. Time and time again, it is estimated \nthat probably more than one-third of those who are here illegally \nactually came into this country legally. We need to create a system \nthat will make sure that at the end of the day, we are enforcing our \nlaws against those who are here illegally.\n  How have we done that? We have done that in a variety of ways in this \nlegislation. We increase the detention capacity to 27,500 beds daily. \nWe add 1,000 new I.C.E. investigative personnel. We add 2,500 Customs \nand border protection workers. We require reimbursement to State and \nlocal communities that detain criminal aliens. We create a new employer \nverification system. We require 1,000 new worksite compliance \npersonnel. I could go on and on with respect to how this legislation \nwill create interior enforcement on immigration that will be effective.\n  Finally, the third thing this legislation does is secure America's \neconomic future. It secures America's economic future through the \nadoption of a program which Senator Craig and Senator Feinstein and 67 \nof us have cosponsored, the AgJOBS Program, because we know that across \nAmerica our farmers and ranchers are suffering because they have not \nhad the labor they need. We also have included in this legislation the \nPresident's new temporary worker program. It is a program that will \nallow employers to match up with employees on a temporary basis, to \ncreate circularity with respect to those workers who will come into \nthis country.\n  Finally, it will create a realistic solution for America's \nundocumented workforce, the 12 million or so people who are here. That \nwill be accomplished by requiring them to pay significant penalties and \nfees. We will make sure that as they move forward in the process, they \nalso go to the back of the line so they don't get any advantage over \nthose who enter the country legally.\n  We will require them to return home prior to the time they apply for \na green card. We will require them to learn English, and we will \nrequire them to remain crime free.\n  Let me conclude by urging my colleagues to vote yes on the motion to \nproceed. The time is now for us to deal with the immigration reform \nissue which is so difficult and so contentious. At the end of the day, \nthis bipartisan proposal which we have put on the table will allow us, \nfirst, to secure our borders. It will allow us to make sure we are \nenforcing our laws. Lastly, it will deal in a realistic and humane \nmanner with the economic realities that face our businesses and workers \nin America today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nColorado for his statement and his inspired leadership. We have worked \non a number of different issues. I can recall the extraordinary \nleadership the Senator from Colorado provided last year when we debated \ncomprehensive immigration reform. He brings to this issue a knowledge \nand understanding and perspective which is very special in terms of any \nissue, particularly this one. I have enjoyed working with him and look \nforward to continuing to do so. I hope our colleagues listened \ncarefully to his message because he has demonstrated a thoughtfulness \nabout this issue, as so many others have, a very strong, balanced \njudgment on these questions. I thank him, as always, for an excellent \npresentation and\n\n[[Page S6379]]\n\nlook forward to continuing to work closely with him as we move through \nthe debate on whether we are going to take the opportunity to mend our \nbroken immigration laws.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado.\n  Madam President, today, we take up the solemn task of immigration \nreform--not just because we may but because we must.\n  Our security is threatened in the post-9/11 world by borders out of \ncontrol.\n  Our values are tarnished when we allow 12 million human beings to \nlive in the dark shadows of abuse as undocumented immigrants.\n  Our economy is harmed when our immigration system fails to protect \nthe American dream of a good job and decent wages.\n  Our competitiveness in the global economy is at risk when our \nemployers cannot find the able workers they need.\n  Our immigration system is adrift and urgently needs an overhaul from \ntop to bottom.\n  The answers are not simple or easy. We cannot meet this challenge by \nsimply building fences. We need comprehensive and commonsense solutions \nthat meet the immigration needs of this century.\n  We begin this debate mindful that immigration issues are always \ncontroversial. There are strong views on every side of this question \nbecause the issue goes to the heart of who we are as a nation and as an \nAmerican people.\n  But we should remember in this debate that we are writing the next \nchapter of American history. Immigrants made the America of today and \nwill help make the America of the future.\n  I am reminded of this awesome responsibility each time I gaze from \nthe windows of my office in Boston. I can see the Golden Stairs from \nBoston Harbor where all eight of my great-grandparents set foot on this \ngreat land for the first time. They walked up to Boston's Immigration \nHall on their way to a better life for themselves and their families.\n  So many Americans can tell similar stories of ancestors who came from \nsomewhere else. Some built our cities. Some toiled on our railroads. \nSome came in slavery--others to raise their families and live and \nworship in freedom.\n  That immigrant spirit of limitless possibility animates America even \ntoday.\n  Today, immigrants harvest our crops, care for our children, and own \nsmall businesses.\n  They serve with pride in our armed forces--70,000 in all. At this \nvery moment, many are risking their lives for America in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Immigrants contribute to scientific discovery, to culture and the \narts. They help make our economy the most vibrant one on the planet.\n  Our strength, our diversity, our innovation, our music, our hard \nwork, our love of country, our dedication to family, faith and \ncommunity--these are the fruits of our immigrant heritage and the \nsource of our national strength. They have made America the envy of the \nworld.\n  As President John F. Kennedy so eloquently wrote, the secret of \nAmerica is that we are ``a nation of people with the fresh memory of \nold traditions who dared to explore new frontiers, people eager to \nbuild lives for themselves in a spacious society that did not restrict \ntheir freedom of choice and action.''\n  Last week, we reached a historic agreement on a far reaching \nbipartisan immigration plan that lives up to this heritage. It involved \nhard negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, and it has the \nsupport of President Bush. Our plan is strong, realistic, and fair. It \nis a commonsense immigration policy for our times.\n  It is tough at the border. It doubles our Border Patrol from 14,000 \nagents to 28,000. It hires 800 new investigators and 800 antismuggling \nofficers. It builds more fences and more detention centers, and \nprovides more state-of-the-art, high-tech border enforcement equipment.\n  It is tough on employers who hire illegal immigrants in defiance of \nthe law. Today, it is too easy for an employer to hire an undocumented \nworker and pay them substandard wages in sweatshop conditions. That \nhurts American workers. It depresses wages. It allows employers to \navoid paying payroll taxes.\n  Our bill says no more worker abuse. Under our plan, employers must \nverify that they hire only legal workers. If they do not, they can be \nfined up to $5,000 for a first offense and up to $75,000 for subsequent \noffenses. They can even go to jail.\n  Our bill says that these tough enforcement measures must be in place \nfirst before we move forward with changes in future immigration. Future \nworkers cannot come in until we have doubled the Border Patrol, built \nmore fences, enhanced our equipment and technology along the border, \nand the employer verification system has begun. It is enforcement first \nand future workers later.\n  Our plan also addresses the 12 million undocumented immigrants who \nare in America today. They have something to contribute. They are men \nand women of dignity. They work hard every day. They care for their \nfamilies. They revitalize decaying neighborhoods. They sit in our pews \non Sundays.\n  We witnessed this recently in my own State of Massachusetts. An \nimmigration raid in New Bedford disrupted the lives of scores of \nfamilies who had laid down roots in the New Bedford community. Their \nchildren were in our schools, many of them born in America. They worked \nevery day in a factory making equipment for our troops in Iraq.\n  We are not going to round up these 12 million men, women and children \nand send them home. That is not the American way. So our plan allows \nthese families to earn the privilege of remaining here and working \nlegally.\n  They have to pay a $5,000 fine over an 8-year period. They have to \nwork and pay taxes. They have to learn English. They cannot be \ncriminals or national security risks and they must obey our laws.\n  The heads of family must make a trip home for a day or two sometime \nin the next 8 years to submit their applications for a green card at an \nAmerican consulate just like other immigrants applying to come here. \nThen they are guaranteed the right to come right back to America right \naway to rejoin their families while they wait for their green card \napplications to be considered.\n  Finally, they have to get in line for their green cards behind \neveryone else who has been waiting to come here legally.\n  If they meet these tests, they will be welcomed into the sunshine of \nAmerica. They will have no fear in coming forward and joining the \nAmerican family. They will not be deported. Instead, we welcome them as \nour neighbors and as our friends and as future citizens of this great \nland.\n  Our plan also continues to stress family reunification--a \nlongstanding tradition under our immigration laws.\n  Today, if you are trying to bring your relatives here legally, you \nmight have to wait 22 years to get visas for them. As a result of this \nbacklog, 4 million family members of American citizens and legal \nimmigrants are on the waiting list to come here. Our plan expedites the \nreunion of these families and eliminates the waiting list in 8 years.\n  In the future, our plan continues to make family reunion the highest \npriority. It says if you are an American citizen or a legal immigrant, \nyou can bring your immediate family here to join you--your wife or \nhusband, your minor children, and your parents.\n  Of the 1 million green cards we issue each year, two-thirds will be \ndedicated to reuniting these families.\n  But under our plan, more distant relatives will no longer have an \nautomatic right to immigrate. They must first prove that they have the \nskills, education, and English abilities to contribute fully to our \neconomic strength.\n  Finally, our plan recognizes that our economy will continue to need \nhardworking people who are willing to come here for a few years. We \nneed nurses and home health care aides. We need farm workers and \njanitors and hotel workers. We need computer programmers and scientists \nand engineers. So our program will allow them to come as guest workers \nunder a program with strong labor laws that protect American jobs and \nwages.\n  Our plan is a compromise. It involved give and take in the best \ntraditions of the U.S. Senate. For each of us who crafted it, there are \nelements that we\n\n[[Page S6380]]\n\nstrongly support and elements we believe could be improved. No one \nbelieves this is a perfect bill.\n  But after weeks of negotiations and years of debate, this bill \naccomplishes our core goals. It provides tough new enforcement at the \nborder and the work site. It allows a realistic path to family security \nand eventual citizenship for millions of men, women, and children \nalready here. And it provides a new system for allocating visas in the \nfuture that stresses family reunion and national economic needs.\n  I don't usually quote Republican Presidents, but President Reagan \nunderstood the integral role that immigration plays in our country's \nfuture. As he said so eloquently in one of his last speeches before \nleaving the White House:\n\n       We lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw \n     our people--our strength--from every country and every corner \n     of the world. And by doing so we continuously renew and \n     enrich our nation. While other countries cling to the stale \n     past, here in America we breathe new life into dreams. We \n     create the future, and the world follows us into tomorrow. \n     Thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of \n     opportunity, we're a nation forever young, forever bursting \n     with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge, \n     always leading the world to the next frontier. This quality \n     is vital to our future as a nation. If we ever closed the \n     door to new Americans, our leadership in the world would soon \n     be lost.\n\n  The world is watching to see how we respond to the current crisis. \nLet's not disappoint them.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to proceed to this debate and to support \nour new plan.\n  Madam President, we have two of our colleagues on our side, I \nbelieve, who are on their way to the floor at the present time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What is the status of the time allocation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining on the Republican side is \n38 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 10 minutes, and afterwards I add to that Senator Martinez be \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am delighted to hear the Senators. \nWould you like to have one speaker on our time and one on the \nRepublican time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, that would be fine. My 10 minutes will \ncome from Senator Kennedy's time. Is that OK?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have a couple Senators who are on their way over. I \nthank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I thank Senator Kennedy and Senator \nMartinez.\n  I am in the fifth year of my first term, and we are finally dealing \nwith an issue I think the country would love to have dealt with years \nago. We are on the verge of doing something big and important. There \nare many reasons why you never do the big things and the hard things. \nThat is why they stay unresolved.\n  The country is running out of time on this particular issue to think \nof reasons why we won't solve this problem. Before 9/11, I would argue \nillegal immigration was a social and economic problem. After 9/11, I \nwould argue it is a national security problem. We have millions of \npeople in our country roaming around and we do not know who they are or \nwhat they are up to. The good news is most of them are here, \nunfortunately illegally, to work and to try to make something of \nthemselves and add value to our country.\n  It is clear from Fort Dix, NJ--and maybe other things to come--some \npeople are here illegally who are up to no good. They want to hurt us. \nThe hijackers on 9/11--all of them came here. Most of them overstayed \ntheir visas. They did not come across the border. They had four or five \nfake drivers licences. It should be a wake-up call to this country we \nhave people in our midst and we do not know who they are and there is \nno way to find out who they are.\n  One thing every Member of the Senate, I hope, will agree upon is that \nif you wanted to, you could get a Social Security card made by midnight \ntonight somewhere that would pass for the real thing. When you drive by \na construction site, and you see people working who are Hispanic or \nother folks you think are here from outside the country, I bet you \nevery employer has documentation on file that appears to be legal. It \nis almost a nightmare for employers to comply with the current system.\n  People tell me, enforce the law. If you can enforce this law, you are \ndoing better than anybody since 1986. There is a reason this has \nhappened. Why do 12 million people come here? Because we do not have a \nway to bring people here legally so they can work in a legal status. \nThere are not enough Americans doing these jobs. Unemployment is below \n5 percent. It is illogical to say this illegal workforce has driven \nAmericans out of work. We are at historically low unemployment. We need \nworkers. But what we need more than anything else is we need to be able \nto secure our border, control who comes, on our terms, and have \nverifiable information about what status you are in. Because if we do \nnot do that, then what happened on 9/11 is more likely to happen again.\n  So there are many reasons to say no to this bill. There are many \nreasons to say no to someone else's proposal. But there is no good \nreason to not solve this problem. I do hope those who come down on the \nfloor to amend this bill, to make it better, will lead us to a better \nsolution. Those who come down on the floor with a goal of taking this \nbill down, I hope you feel some obligation to substitute it with \nsomething else that could pass.\n  Democracy is a wonderful thing. When I was at my State convention, a \nlady told me: I don't like compromise. I said: Well, don't run for \noffice. Because this is all about compromising. Isn't it, Senator \nKennedy? It is. What I like about my country is that Republicans, \nDemocrats, and Independents historically have been able to do the hard \nthings to make us a better nation.\n  I say to my friend from Florida, Senator Martinez, you have been a \ndelight to work with.\n  Breaking the law is something that has occurred in large proportion \nwhen it comes to immigration. The reason people have been breaking the \nlaw to this extent is the rest of us have not been that excited about \nenforcing it. I think the rest of us have sort of looked the other way \nand allowed the illegal immigration problem to grow because we have not \nasked the hard questions about: Where are all these people coming from? \nAnd what are they doing?\n\n  There are lots of people, to their credit, who have been very upset \nabout this issue for a very long time. I think many people in this \ncountry have gotten the benefit of this illegal workforce in terms of \nthe labor and have sort of turned their eye, and now everybody is \nlooking at it anew.\n  To those who have been shouting from the rooftops that the \nimmigration system is broken, you have done us a great service. To \nthose who believe illegal immigration is a national security threat, an \neconomic threat, and a social threat, you have done us a great service. \nBut you are not going to do us a great service if you only shout about \nthe problem. I want you to do more than tell me it is broken and it \nneeds to be fixed. I want you to do more than just say: Lindsey Graham \nand Ken Salazar have it wrong. I want you to do what we have done. That \nis the only thing I ask of any of my colleagues: Sit down with a \nDemocrat and Republican and try to fix it--and good luck because it is \nhard.\n  You are right to come here and amend this bill and change it, and to \ntake the floor and tell us why we have it wrong. I will listen. If we \ncan fix it, we will. But do more than just tell me where I am wrong. Do \nmore than just tell the American public we have to do something about \nthis illegal immigration problem. Do more than just shout\n\n[[Page S6381]]\n\n``amnesty.'' If you think saying ``amnesty'' absolves you from having \nto participate in this debate, you are wrong. This debate is about the \nfuture of the United States when it comes to our national security, our \nemployment needs, our ability to compete with the world for the labor \nforce that exists. At the heart of this debate, it is about who we are \nas a people.\n  Now, tomorrow, I am going to read a report issued by the Government \nabout immigrants. Some of it is very tough. Let me give you a preview:\n\n       As a class, the new immigrants are largely unskilled \n     laborers coming from countries where the highest wage is \n     small compared to the lowest wage in the United States. They \n     bring little money into the country and they send or take a \n     considerable part of their earnings out. More than 35 percent \n     are illiterate as compared with less than 3 percent of the \n     old immigrant class.\n       The new immigration movement is very large. There are few \n     if any indications of its natural abatement. The new \n     immigration coming in in such large numbers has provoked a \n     widespread feeling of apprehension to its effect on the \n     economic and social welfare of the country. They usually live \n     in cooperative groups and crowd together. Consequently, they \n     have been able to save a greater part of their earnings, much \n     of which is sent or carried abroad. Moreover, there is a \n     strong tendency on the part of the unaccompanied men to \n     return to their native countries after a few years of labor \n     here.\n       These groups have little or no contact with American life, \n     learn little of American institutions, and aside from the \n     wages earned, profit little by their stay in the country.\n       Unquestionably, the hordes of immigrants that are coming \n     here have a good deal to do with crimes against women and \n     children. You will notice these particular crimes are done by \n     fellows who can't talk the English language.\n\n  Now, this is a Government report about the effect of immigrants, the \nnew immigrants, on our country. These quotes were taken in 1910 from \nthe Dillingham Report, and one of the Senators on that commission was \nfrom South Carolina. It went on, and I will talk more about it, to talk \nabout how these immigrants are ruining America. They live among \nthemselves. They have disease. They won't learn our language. They \ncommit crimes. They are a burden on society, and we need to do \nsomething about it. The report was begun in 1910, it was finally issued \nin 1913. The people they were talking about became the ``greatest \ngeneration.''\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as the Senate prepares to vote on the \nmajority leader's motion to proceed to a comprehensive immigration \nreform bill, I continue to have concerns about the proposal announced \nlast week. But I wish to commend Senator Kennedy for working so hard \nover the last several months to revive a bipartisan bill. He worked \nclosely behind the scenes with Senator McCain for several months. When \nthose efforts failed, he didn't give up. In fact, he was not deterred, \nas many who supported this process before went the other way. On the \ncontrary, he spoke to a number of Republican Senators who had actively \nworked with us last year. When they wouldn't join him in a bipartisan \neffort, he continued on and joined the process Secretary Chertoff had \nbegun with opponents of last year's bill. In extended discussions he \nand others have had, they have now come forward with a proposal. I \ncommend Senator Kennedy's commitment and his efforts.\n  I would also like to thank the majority leader. He had intended to \nset aside 2 full weeks this month for Senate consideration of \ncomprehensive immigration reform. When the informal discussions were \nnot completed on time, he gave those discussions more time. He was \nright that this issue warrants a significant commitment of the Senate's \ntime, and I am glad to work with him to make sure that consideration is \nfair and comprehensive.\n  Now, I am going to support the motion to proceed and the majority \nleader's cloture petition to go to the bill in order to allow the \nSenate the opportunity to work its will on the matter. Obviously, that \ndoesn't presuppose how I will vote on the final product. Many of us \nhave said that the bipartisan proposal, the Kennedy-Kyl-Chertoff \nproposal, represents a starting point for consideration.\n  As the authors of the proposal know, this Senator from Vermont feels \nvery strongly about the provisions that affect dairy workers and the \ncircumstances of that important industry. But I also take a particular \ninterest in the provisions that affect seasonal workers for the \nhundreds of Vermont businesses that require them, as well as the needs \nof our leading high-technology companies, many of which have \nsignificant operations in Vermont. The diverse coalition that put the \nAgJOBS bill together recognized that certain sectors of agriculture \nrequire special circumstances.\n  It is really a shame that the AgJOBS legislation which Republicans \nand Democrats worked so hard to produce and which had gotten strong \nbipartisan agreement will not be fully respected. I believe that is a \nsignificant mistake and one I will consider in my final determination \nof how to vote. Notwithstanding that mistake, I will continue to work \nwith the bill's authors to make sure our Nation's dairy farmers have a \nviable temporary worker program for the future.\n  Beyond these provisions, I have a number of fundamental concerns I \nhope the Senate will address in the days and perhaps weeks ahead. In \nhis radio address of May 12, President Bush restated that comprehensive \nreform must ``treat people with dignity.'' He said we must ``honor the \ngreat American tradition of the melting pot'' and that we must help \nimmigrants ``embrace our common identity as Americans.'' I agree with \nPresident Bush. I believe part of that common heritage is our welcoming \nof immigrants and families.\n  America is a land in which families matter, in which our values call \nfor us to provide not just for ourselves at the cost of severing family \nties but for our families. As the Statue of Liberty proclaims, America \nis a country that welcomes the poor and those yearning to breathe free, \nnot just the well-educated and those who already speak English. It \nwelcomed my grandparents who did not speak English and were not \nwealthy. We never know who among those immigrating to our shores will \nturn out to be the next great military leader, the next great \nentrepreneur, the next great inventor, the next to lift this Nation to \ngreater heights.\n  I want the bill we pass to recognize the best of America and our \nvalues and the best of our traditions as a land of immigrants, the land \nthat brought my grandparents and my parents-in-law to this country. I \nalso want it to be practical and workable.\n  The so-called triggers in the White House proposal do two things. \nFirst, they appear to put off implementation of most immigration reform \nto the next President and the next Congress. Somehow, I don't \nunderstand that, why we can't face up to it ourselves. Second, they \nrequire absolute faith in the Department of Homeland Security and the \nBush administration. Given the record of this administration, I see \nlittle basis for such faith.\n  When this administration's representatives say to us that in the next \n18 months they will secure the borders and they will devise and \nimplement identification verification measures and they will do that \nwithout fail, I remember the last 24 months in which they failed the \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina and the Gulf States. I see an \nadministration that has ignored immigration enforcement for years. I \nsee an administration that does not deal realistically with the \nnorthern border. I see an administration that has all but destroyed the \nJustice Department and severely undermined its traditions as a neutral \nlaw enforcement agency above politics. I see an administration that \ndenied global warming, disregarded science and, most egregiously, has \ndisregarded the realities of its current disastrous engagement in Iraq.\n  I say this because we are called upon to just put total faith in the \nadministration. Some of us believe very much in the slogan President \nReagan made up for the Russians when he said, ``Trust, but verify.'' In \nthat regard, I am a Reaganite.\n  I have urged the President to invest himself in the process and work \nwith Congress. I did so on the first day of this Congress and at the \none Senate hearing held on this matter in February. The path chosen by \nthe administration was not one I recommended. Instead, the \nadministration remained on the far right of the immigration debate and \nhas pushed the bill and the debate in that direction.\n\n[[Page S6382]]\n\n  We have before us a measure that is the product of closed-door \nmeetings between the administration and Republican Senators, which was \nthen put to Democratic Senators as the framework from which any further \nnegotiations could proceed. Senator Kennedy has done his best. He has \nmade improvements in the proposal. He deserves our thanks. But whether \nthe proposal is where it should be is what this debate will begin to \ndetermine.\n  The substitute bill the administration endorses creates a temporary \nworker program with no opportunity to pursue the American dream. This \nbill risks the creation of a permanent, revolving underclass of workers \nwith limited rights. A temporary worker program with no opportunity to \nshare in the promise of America creates an incentive for overstays and \nrisks creating a new population of undocumented individuals, just as we \nwork hard to bring millions of people out of the shadows of our \nsociety. I also worry that the temporary worker program included in the \nbill doesn't effectively serve the needs of American employers. I am \nworried that it is unrealistic. This part of the proposal is opposed by \na wide array of interests and constituencies, including organized \nlabor, business, and advocates for immigrants. I hope we listen \ncarefully to their concerns as we proceed.\n  The substitute bill also erodes our traditional commitment to family \nunity by removing whole segments of family-based immigration. No longer \nwill certain family members be allowed to be sponsored by their loved \nones in the United States. Instead, proponents seek to create a \nsupposedly merit-based green card system subject to a point system, \nwhere family ties are de-emphasized, and immediate contributions \nthrough education and job skills already attained are valued. I \nrecognize that we may benefit in the short run from a more highly-\nskilled foreign labor pool, but I have grave concerns about doing so at \nthe expense of our traditional commitment to family unity and fostering \nstrong families. Where are the family values here?\n  The substitute bill also will require all Americans--not just foreign \nworkers--to verify their citizenship before obtaining a job. Like the \nREAL ID Act that was forced on the American people outside the normal \nlegislative process, this requirement is yet another example of the \nAdministration's consistent denigration of Americans' rights, including \nthe right to privacy. The Administration is telling all Americans that \nwe can no longer trust you--that Big Brother will control hiring for \nall jobs in America. From America's country stores to our largest \ncorporations, employers will now be de facto immigration officials, and \npotential employees will be presumed illegal until they prove \nthemselves citizens. I hope we can reconsider this ill-conceived \nprogram, which cuts so hard against the presumptive decency and honesty \nof American citizens. America's democracy works because law-abiding \nAmericans choose to comply with our laws, pay their taxes, and \nparticipate in our civil society.\n  I am pleased that significant parts of AGJOBS have been included in \nthis bill. The legalization provisions for currently undocumented farm \nworkers will go a long way toward helping farmers and removing the \ncloud of fear from so many workers. I commend Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Craig for their work in this regard. But the bill also rejects \nparts of the monumental compromise reached between farm workers and \nagricultural employers in the AGJOBS bill, which provides much needed \nreforms for America's farmers, dairy operators, and farm workers. I am \nextremely disappointed that American dairy farmers who want to hire \nfuture legal foreign workers end up losing out to the talking point \nthat ``temporary means temporary.''\n  The bill also neglects the real needs of the high-tech community, \nwhich has been vigilant in seeking reliable sources of high-skilled \nworkers. Instead of adding sufficient H-1B visa numbers to allow \ncompanies to stay competitive and remain the world's leaders, the bill \ncreates a green card system that doesn't truly address the technology \nindustry's needs and removes hiring decisions from the company and \nplaces them with the Federal Government. It says: Trust us; we are from \nthe Federal Government; we can make a better decision for you. Some of \nus are skeptical.\n  But there are some good aspects of the bill. It incorporates the \nDREAM Act, a bill I have long supported. It has provisions that can \nmove millions of undocumented people in this country on a path to \ncitizenship, if not unrealistically delayed by the so-called triggers.\n  Regrettably, it currently includes a provision to require immigrants \nto return to their home country before applying. In my view, that is \nunrealistic in many circumstances, and it is inflexibly harsh in \nothers. Those who struggled to get here--who escaped oppressive and \ndysfunctional governments--should not be required to repeat that \njourney to share in the promise of America. This provision is driven by \nideology, not by an American sense of fairness, and it should be \nrevisited in our legislative process.\n  I am also encouraged that we may be past the anti-immigrant \nopposition that stalled our efforts last year. I hope that we are past \ntrying to make criminals out of undocumented immigrants. I hope that we \nare past trying to make criminals out of the clergy and advocates that \ntry to help hard-working immigrants seeking a better life for their \nchildren. I hope we are past trying to build fences and walls around \nAmerica and the American dream. I hope that we are past the anti-\nimmigrant rhetoric and the anti-Hispanic slurs that accompanied the \ndebate and electioneering last year.\n  We need to keep working to make sure our legislation is one that \ntakes a commonsense, realistic approach to this situation. I will \ncontinue working to produce legislation that treats people with dignity \nand respects our great traditions as a welcoming nation. We have much \nwork to do before this bill becomes worthy of the Senate and of our \ngreat history and tradition as a nation of immigrants, a nation that \nbrought my grandparents and my great-great-grandparents and my parents-\nin-law to this country.\n  I will vote to support the Majority Leader's effort to proceed to \ndebate on comprehensive immigration reform. I hope that as we move \nthrough amendments and debate, the Senate will work toward making this \na better bill. We all know that had we insisted on taking up the \nSenate-passed bill of last year, we would not have the votes to \nproceed. Many who voted for last year's Senate's bill were prepared to \nabandon their support. The Majority Leader has demonstrated his good \nfaith. I hope that Senators will join together and work together to \nproduce a bill of which we can be proud and that will honor our parents \nand grandparents as well as our neighbors and grandchildren.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, for over 3 months, I have engaged with a \nnumber of my colleagues and administration officials in an \nextraordinary series of meetings and discussions designed to reach \nbipartisan consensus for solutions to the many problems we face \nregarding our immigration system. I have done so in good faith and in \nkeeping with my long held belief that we must have a comprehensive \napproach to immigration reform.\n  I believe we should continue to try to move forward, generally, and \nthat this problem is too important not to come up with an appropriate \nsolution.\n  That having been said--I am very concerned about the process that led \nto today. First, we have not undertaken the normal legislative pocess--\nbypassing the Senate Judiciary Committee--leading to a public \nperception of nontransparency and distrust. Second, most of the Members \nof the Senate and their staff did not receive even a draft of the \n``final'' language until 2 a.m. on Saturday morning, just a little over \n48 hours ago. Third, I am told that the bill will not go to Senate \nlegislative counsel--a significant departure from the normal course and \na departure that makes it more difficult for legislative counsel to \ndraft amendments due to lack of familiarity with the text. Finally, I \nam told the CBO cost estimate for the bill will not come out until \nWednesday--only 2 days before the legislation may well receive a final \nvote depending on leadership decisions in the coming days.\n  Moreover, I remain very concerned about the substance of the bill. \nFor instance, my staff's preliminary review indicates that there are \npotentially\n\n[[Page S6383]]\n\nsome very problematic provisions in the language. In addition, because \nof the ``rush'' to produce language to meet the Monday deadline for a \ncloture vote, there are a number of technical drafting errors which \nalso have a substantive effect and were being worked on as late as this \nafternoon.\n  I have been open about my concerns with respect to interior \nenforcement--concerns that I still hold today. For example, the draft \nbill does not, to my knowledge, do enough to curb one of the core flaws \nthat undermined the 1986 amnesty bill--that of unlimited judicial \nreview. Indeed, just 2 weeks ago a judge ordered DHS to revisit whether \na class of aliens should get the 1986 amnesty. It appears that if this \nbill passes, these aliens whose only real claim to participate in our \nsystem, will be able to take advantage of the new visa holder because \nthey were able to delay through litigation. There are no limits on the \nnumber of motions to reopen the administrative process or times an \nalien can appeal to an article III court. If the American public is \ngoing to have confidence in this system, they need/to be assured there \nwill be limits.\n  In addition, I would note that the New York Times wrote that the 1986 \namnesty bill produced the largest immigration fraud in the history of \nthe United States. President Clinton's INS general counsel testified \nthat statutory restrictions on law enforcement's ability to use the \ninformation contained in amnesty applications impeded their ability to \ndetect the fraud. To my knowledge, this bill continues to require \nconfidentiality in certain cases where the application is denied.\n  In the end, as much as I believe we should continue to work together \nto reach consensus on the critical issue of immigration reform--a \nmatter of national import but that is particularly important to my home \nState of Texas--I cannot in good conscience agree to proceed to \nlegislation which we anticipate replacing with language we received at \n2 a.m. on Saturday--without appropriate committee review--the text of \nwhich is hundreds of pages in length, the provisions of which are as \ncomplicated as any legislation we will take up and the impact of which \nwill be felt, for better or worse, for generations to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I am delighted we have come to this \npoint where, after much hard work and discussion for days and weeks and \neven months, we can present to the Senate for its consideration an \nimmigration reform bill that I believe seeks to serve the needs of this \ncountry. I have had the pleasure and the privilege of working with a \nnumber of colleagues from this body during the last many weeks as we \nsought to put together something that would serve the country's \ninterests.\n  We have worked bipartisanly, with help from very dedicated Cabinet \nmembers, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of \nCommerce, in a very comprehensive and dedicated way over days and days \nof discussions and difficult negotiations that were oftentimes \nemotional and always, I think, with the idea that we would do something \nthat was good for the country and that obviously was not going to be \nunanimously praised. Hearing the Senator from Vermont express \nmisgivings about it and having earlier heard the Senator from Alabama \nequally express himself, each from different sides of the spectrum, it \nadds to the thought I have had that this is a bill which strikes it \ndown the middle pretty well.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wanted to ask unanimous consent that the time from \nnow until the vote be allotted to the Senator from Florida and to the \nsenior Senator from New Mexico and that there is no time remaining on \nthe Democrat side, unless Senator Kennedy wants some of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Senator is typically kind and \ncourteous. There were one or two Senators who said they might need a \nmoment or two, but they haven't been back in touch. If they are, I \nmight ask for a minute or two from the Senator. I thank him for his \nthoughtfulness.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time be \nallotted to the two of us and, if necessary, we can allot time to \nsomebody else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for yielding and thank him for all \nthe hard work he has put into this bill.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, it is a pleasure to be on the floor \ntalking about this subject with the Senator from New Mexico. We did \nthat last year, as I recall, as well, and the Senator has a rich \nimmigrant history in his family that all of us in different ways share.\n  I guess I should say, as the only person who has the privilege of \nserving in this body who is an immigrant and as truly someone who has \ncome here having been born elsewhere, it is an incredible privilege for \nme to talk on this subject and have an opportunity to be a part of this \ndebate.\n  I really think it is a moment that brings us all to the roots of what \nour Nation is about. We understand that this is a nation of immigrants, \na nation that through its history has had this tradition of welcoming \npeople from all over the world, from all different lands, and manages \nin this magical way to bring people into the fullness of what it means \nto be an American. I have experienced it in my own life. I can speak \nabout that for days. It has been that same kind of miracle I have seen \nhappen to others.\n  And I think that opportunity is still out there for many to enjoy, at \nthe same time understanding we are a country that has a tradition of \nlaws and they ought to be obeyed and observed. So it is in that tug \nbetween those two principles that are so ingrained in our country that \nwe come to this very important moment and debate.\n  I don't think there is any question that much has been said about \nthis bill before people have had an opportunity to even know what is in \nit. I will say some things about it I think are important. I believe it \nis a product of a bipartisan compromise. Anytime you come together with \npeople from different points of view, there are going to be those who \nwill say it goes too much in one direction or the other.\n  Here are some of the things it does do. It provides for border \nsecurity. It will secure our borders in a way that will make Americans \nunderstand that the Government is serious about securing our borders. \nBefore mentioning any of the other elements of this bill, I thank our \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, for the idea that we should \nhave triggers in it. Before those other issues would be implemented, \nthere will be an opportunity for a certification--not subjectively but \nobjectively--with measurable results: How much fence has been built? \nHow many border agents were hired? How many other promises were \nfulfilled toward the issue?\n  One of the important ones is a tamperproof ID card that employees \nmust have to present to employers so we can verify that they are \nworking in America legally and that there are no phony Social Security \nnumbers that can be used. That is a tamperproof, biometrically induced \nID. We need to have those in place before the bill becomes a reality. \nBorder security must and ought to be first and foremost. I have heard a \nlot of discussion from people who have not read the bill who suggest \nthat 12 million illegal aliens are receiving a guaranteed, automatic \nright to remain in the United States. That is not the case. They are \ngoing to have an opportunity--after paying fines, after coming out of \nthe shadows and registering, after background checks--to pay a fine for \nbreaking the law and then go on probationary status. They will then \nhave a card, which will become a visa, if they apply for it.\n  It is a paradigm shift in what immigration is like in our country. It \nwill require a new paradigm, which some find that, for a country that \nwants to be competitive in the 21st century, may be a wise thing. It is \na merit-based system, without throwing aside the issue of family. It \ncontinues to involve family consideration, but it is not the only \nconsideration.\n  Illegal aliens who are here and wish to regularize their status \nshould have an opportunity to become citizens, but it ought not be an \nautomatic or direct path to citizenship. They will have to return to \ntheir home country under this bill and apply outside the country\n\n[[Page S6384]]\n\nlegally. It will be a long and difficult road, where they have to pay \nadditional fines and other backgrounds checks will be done and, at the \nearliest, anybody who would be in this country illegally today, after \nhaving applied outside the country, it is going to be as lengthy as 13 \nto 15 years before they can become citizens of this country.\n  The people in line and the people who have done it the right way will \nbe first to become citizens, ahead of those who have come illegally.\n  As to the guest worker program, this is truly a guest worker program. \nWhen somebody outside the country comes here to go to school, they ask \nfor a student visa and they understand they are coming for a period of \ntime to study and go to school and then they are to return to their \ncountry. The guest worker program will be much the same thing. They \nwill come for 2 years, understanding it is a 2-year visa. At the end of \nthat 2 years, they have to return home. They are not coming to \nimmigrate; they are coming to work. That is the understanding. It is \nthe understanding before they ever come here. As they do, they will \nhave an opportunity to work and taste the American dream, but they also \nhave an obligation to return to their country. At the end of 6 years, \nor three work periods, they will return home and not be allowed to \nreturn again as a guest worker. They could have a path to citizenship, \nif they so chose to apply for regular immigrant status. They could be \nconsidered for that, but at the same time there would be no guarantees \nby the fact that they were here. They will have earned points by \nworking here, and it is going to be a merit-based system. So they will \nhave an opportunity to be considered for citizenship.\n  This is a problem that begs an answer. There are many who would say \nthis is amnesty, and therefore it should not even be considered. I \nsuggest to them they ought to read the bill so they understand the \ndetails and how it is not amnesty. So to those who dismiss it as \nsomething that is no good and not workable, I suggest this: What is \nyour answer? What do you suggest? What is your solution to this problem \nthat for over 20 years has been vexing our country?\n  It is time to grapple with this and tackle it. We know how to solve \nproblems in the United States. We can solve this problem if we continue \nto work together in the spirit of this group of ours, which at times \nhas been quite contentious but is also forging ahead to solve a \nproblem. The spirit that group has had is the spirit that the Senate \nand the Congress needs to tackle this issue.\n  I commend the President for having had the steadfast support on the \nproposal. He has been there with criticism even for members of our own \nparty. He has been terrific in terms of sticking to it, continuing to \nsupport it, having members of his Cabinet working with us day and \nnight. We are at the threshold of a tremendous opportunity to do \nsomething truly good for the country. I thank the Senator from New \nMexico for his interest. I will yield to him for his comment on this \nimportant legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Florida for \nhis dedicated work on this bill and for his efforts heretofore a couple \nof years ago, when he worked very hard on this issue. We didn't have \nsuccess, but maybe this bill, in spite of all the early talk against \nit, may succeed. Maybe with some amendments and some work it may become \nthe new law with reference to illegal aliens for the United States of \nAmerica. It is good enough for America. It is sufficiently clear for \nAmerica. It will clear up the status of the 10 to 12 million \nundocumented aliens who live here. It will clear that problem up. \nEverywhere you look, we have let the problems of illegal aliens grow \nout of all proportions.\n  It is a hard job to put a bill like this together. It is not easy. It \nis one of the most difficult jobs you can have to put legislation \ntogether to try to fix the last 15 years of letting our laws be \nignored. We have not cared about them, letting the borders become \nporous, letting millions of people in illegally, which has caused all \nkinds of problems. But I can tell you, if you look at this bill \ncarefully and you don't look at it with any preconceived ideas or \nideology, but look at it and ask: What are the practical problems and \nwhat are the practical solutions here? I submit that it comes close to \nsolving these problems in the very best way possible.\n  I am sorry I already heard this morning Senators talking for a very \nlong period of time about why they are against this bill. In the end, I \nlistened and, after listening, I concluded that most of them had it \nwrong. I don't like to say that about my fellow Senators, but they had \nit wrong on the major issues, which they said made up their mind to be \nagainst the bill.\n  Let me tell you what is going to happen under this bill. Before \nanything else in this bill is used or implemented, our borders must be \nsecure. Let me repeat: whatever you hear from Senators that this bill \nis going to do, none of those provisions are going to be implemented \nunless and until we have secured the border. I don't know how we can \nsay it any clearer. Senator Kennedy and Senator Jon Kyl from Arizona, \nthe leaders on each side on this issue with Senator Specter, maybe what \nyou are going to have to do is pull the text of this bill that secures \nthe border and distribute it to the Senators so they will have it right \nin front of them to see that there is a border security part of this \nbill. It is there. It says, before you can implement the other \nprovisions of this bill, the border will be made secure.\n  It doesn't stop there. It tells you what a secure border is. It says \n18,000 Border Patrol agents must be hired. We are well on a path of \ngetting them hired and trained. We can do this because we finally, for \nthe last 3 years, we have been funding. We have been hiring thousands \nof them. But the bill says none of the bill's other provisions shall go \ninto effect until the border is made secure.\n  Then it says that secure means 370 miles of border fencing must be \nbuilt. The Department of Homeland Security is committed to building 370 \nmiles by December 31, 2008. We are being honest. We didn't have to say \nthat date. We didn't have to talk about it. But we cannot get fencing \nbuilt any sooner. So that period of time is going to have to be used \nbefore we do other things in the bill. The bill cannot change anybody's \nstatus this year because those provisions are dormant until the border \nis made secure. They are dormant.\n  It also says 200 miles of vehicular barriers must be in place. It \nsays 70 radar and camera towers must be on the southern border. It says \nfour unmanned aerial vehicles must be in operation we have to leave \nundocumented aliens apprehended on the border in detention facilities \nto wait until they are deported. Right now if you don't have a place \nfor them, the judges release them. That has been one of our problems. \nThe bill has 27,500 detention beds to end the ``catch and release \nprogram'', which we are aware of, those of us who represent the border. \nYou have to have all that done before the bill becomes operative.\n  So if any one of those is not done, it is just like not having an \nimmigration reform bill; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. That is right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. People say you are going to do immigration reform \nbefore the border is secured. How are we going to do that when the law \nsays you throw the rest of the bill away until we have secured the \nborder, and then it tells you what border security is? That has been \nworked on day and night. That has been done to try to calm so many \nthousands of people who have been indoctrinated to believe that the \nonly thing we should do is make the border secure. So all they are \ngoing to ask you when you go home is: Did you secure the border, \nSenator? And, Senator, I heard from such and such that you didn't \nsecure the border.\n  Senators ought to carry around a piece of paper that has this border \nsecurity provision on it, and you ought to take it out and read it to \nyour constituents. They deserve the truth. They want the truth. We are \nnot trying to do anything to hide what we did. We are trying to make \nsure they know it.\n  I mentioned the name of a Senator from Arizona. He is not here, but \nJon Kyl will be here tomorrow, so all the Americans out there will \nunderstand that Jon Kyl was one of the Republican who spent literally \nhundreds upon hundreds of hours as a dedicated\n\n[[Page S6385]]\n\nleader on this issue, with Senator Kennedy on the other side. Senator \nKennedy will acknowledge--if he hasn't already--that without Jon Kyl we \ncould not have this proposal. People should know that Senator Kyl knew \nthis was the chance of a lifetime for this great country. You could not \nget everything you wanted because there are other people playing. If \nyou have 10 Senators working on it, and they are Democrats and \nRepublicans and they each believe one thing or another, you have to \ncome to a practical compromise.\n  That is what it means to be a Senator who writes the law well. He \nworks with his fellow Senators to come up with what they can use and do \nin a practical manner. That is what happened with this bill. It is \npractical, yet it is doable; and it is not only doable, it is right.\n  If America accomplishes this bill in its totality, we will have made \none of the largest changes for the better for the United States, and I \ndon't think there is any doubt about that. It is tough, and it is going \nto be hard.\n  I wish to talk about another provision, and then if Senator Specter \nis back and wants time, I will yield to him.\n  This bill is difficult because everybody wants to know two things \nabout this bill. There are other pieces, but there are two major \nquestions. One is, did you secure the border, and I just talked about \nthat because I am just like every other Senator. My telephone is \nringing and most people want to know: Did you secure the border? Or \nthey tell you that you did not secure the border and you have to be \nsure that you set them straight and they understand that you did secure \nthe border.\n  The money has been rolling in every year to secure the border, and it \nwill be coming in again this year to get this work finished because if \nit can't get finished, the other provisions cannot be carried out. One \nof those other provisions is a brand new effort on the part of this \ngreat country to take 10 to 12 million aliens who live in our country, \nwho live kind of as hideouts--they are everywhere and they are nowhere. \nSome live running from one place to another. Others have found a way \nwith illegal cards to find their way into society. They are your \nneighbors with their kids going to school just like yours. We have \ndecided, because the country has asked us to, that we have to do \nsomething about that 10 to 12 million people.\n  For those who are interested, just ask your Senators about the bill \nas it is written, ask what we are going to do. We are going to tell \nthose illegal aliens who are here working: If you want to take \nadvantage of this law, you have to come forward and turn yourself in, \nand the United States will then begin to work with you on a path toward \ngiving you a document that you can carry with you, that you can use to \nobtain work, and you will be legal 4 years at a time.\n  The bill also says after 8 years of that process, you will have an \nopportunity to choose, if you want, to move in the direction of \nbecoming a citizen. But you still have at least 5 years to wait, and \nyou must return to your home country and file your application. You \nmust pay another fine. You must learn English. That is the first time \nwe have had that provision. And you must learn U.S. civics.\n  All of that must happen: 8 years of work, make a choice to pursue \ncitizenship, wait at least 5 more years for a total of 13 years, and \nthen if you can pass the citizenship test, you can become a citizen if \nyou so choose. You can choose another route and you don't have to \nbecome a citizen or ultimately you can go home. There might be many \npeople who will do that. We don't know.\n  Before I turn the time over to Senator Specter--and I don't have \ntime--but my friends, a couple of Senators have heard me talk before \nabout my family, average people who got involved with the laws of our \nland as immigrants.\n  Madam President, how much time would Senator Specter like?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It looks like we have 6 minutes. Is that what it is?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think there is 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will take 4 minutes telling about my family, and \nSenator Specter can have the rest.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, will the Senator from New Mexico yield \nfor a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I appreciate the distinguished Senator \nyielding. I ask unanimous consent that at the end of the time on the \nRepublican side, I have 5 minutes to speak before the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I would normally not object, but I \nunderstand the leaders have set the time at 5:30 p.m. for the vote, and \nthis request will extend the time. I don't think I have the authority \nto extend the time for a vote. Madam President, I ask Senator Kennedy, \nam I thinking right? I wasn't here when we agreed to take this up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as I look at it, we have 11 minutes. \nThe leaders had indicated to different Senators earlier that they \nwanted 5:30 p.m., and everyone is on notice for that to happen.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is at 5:30 p.m. we are going to vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is the time we were told.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have to object.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I say to the distinguished Senator that before his time \nexpires, we are going to try to work it out with the two leaders to \nmake sure it will be appropriate to ask consent again. So before the \nSenator's time expires, I will again ask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is fine. If the Senator from New Jersey has \npermission, he can come back and do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I wish to tell about both my parents \nwho came to this country as aliens, but I don't believe in 3 or 4 \nminutes that I can do that adequately. So I will try to find another \ntime in the next 5 or 6 days to tell you, Americans, who are listening, \nthat you have a Senator whose parents were both born in a foreign \ncountry, whose parents came here as youngsters.\n  It is a very interesting story because on my mother's side, she \nmarried my father after consultation with a lawyer about citizenship \nrequirements. They were told that my mother was a citizen once they got \nmarried because my father was a citizen. He became a citizen because he \nserved in the First World War. He came over right at the turn of the \ncentury and was drafted into the First World War.\n  It turned out that the lawyer gave them wrong advice, and my mother \nwas not a citizen. She raised her children here and lived here as a \nperfect model citizen.\n  Then one day during the Second World War, she was arrested by several \nmen who came in black cars to the back door while we four children were \nplaying with marbles, or whatever we did. In came the people, the \nagents that work for the U.S., saying this lady was an illegal alien \nand she should be arrested.\n\n  Of course, that was a shock, needless to say. My father came hurrying \nhome from work and, guess what, the lawyer who had given him advice, my \ndad brought him along. He went over to his office and got him and said: \nYou got us in this trouble, maybe you ought to come over and get us \nout.\n  Sure enough, the lawyer was very upset. By evening, my poor mother \nwas released because she had a good lawyer. A lot of people don't have \nthat, and we know what happens to them under our laws.\n  Next, I will tell you about my father and what happened to him. That \nwill be the next episode, shall we say. For now, I yield the remainder \nof the time that we have to Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I have been told by the leadership that \nwe can extend the debate by 10 minutes--5 minutes for the Senator from \nNew Jersey and, if necessary, 5 minutes on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S6386]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I am always fascinated by Senator \nDomenici's floor statements, about his immigrant parents. I will take \njust 60 seconds to talk about my immigrant parents.\n  My mother came here when she was 6 years old in 1906. My father came \nin 1911 when he was 18. The Czar wanted to send my father to Siberia. \nHe lived in Ukraine. That is where the Czar wanted to send all the \nyoung Jewish men, to Siberia. My father didn't want to go to Siberia \nbecause he heard it was cold there. He wanted to go to Kansas instead. \nIt was a close call, and he got to Kansas where I was born.\n  They didn't have enough money to hire a lawyer, but, fortunately, \nthey didn't have any problems either. In Wichita, there weren't many \nbig black cars, so the family lived happily ever after.\n  On the issue before the Senate, I urge my colleagues to vote for \ncloture to proceed. We have been engaged for the better part of 3 \nmonths in extraordinarily extensive and complicated negotiations. Every \nweek from 4 to 6 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, we would \nmeet. Those hours were extended. We are trying to tabulate the total \nnumber of hours we worked. So far, nobody can count that high. But we \nhad 10 Senators working almost full time, and we came to a compromise \nand a combination, which is the way we work around here.\n  I knew at the outset that working on immigration was going to be the \nthird rail. The third rail is that rail that electrocutes you. We have \nlong talked about Social Security as the third rail. Immigration is \nequally a third rail.\n  There is no way to satisfy all facets of the political spectrum. We \nare accused on the right of amnesty. We have done everything we could \nto avoid that charge. I think we succeeded. Those undocumented \nimmigrants will have to pay a fine, they will have to pay back taxes, \nthey have to learn English, they have to fit into our culture, they \nhave to hold jobs and be responsible, and go to the end of the line. \nThey can't begin to qualify until 8 years have passed. It may be as \nlong as 13 years which have passed. So it is not amnesty.\n  Right now we have anarchy--anarchy. Those 12 million undocumented \nimmigrants are going to be in this country one way or another. We can't \ndeport them. If we have a registration procedure, there is a chance \nthat we will identify undocumented immigrants who have criminal records \nwho ought to be deported. It is possible to deport a small number, but \ncertainly not all 12 million.\n  The new program will have detention space for 27,500 people, but we \ncan't begin to detain 12 million people, to litigate the deportation \nprocess. It cannot be done. But that is not stopping those on the right \nfrom calling it amnesty.\n  Those on the left think it is not sufficiently compassionate and \nobject to the provisions on the touchback and think that there is not \nsufficient emphasis on family unification. If I had my druthers, many \nof those provisions would not be in the bill. But every time we find a \npoint which is objected to, that point doubtless is in the bill in \norder to get two other considerations that somebody would like. It is \nan accommodation.\n  The old saying, you never want to see legislation or sausage made \ndoesn't apply here because what we have had to deal with wouldn't even \nqualify for sausage. It would be so unpalatable really. But what we are \nreally facing here is a broken system. We have anarchy. We have borders \nwhich are porous. This bill will fix that with fencing, with barriers, \nwith 6,000 additional Border Patrol to the 12,000 there now, and we \nwill eliminate the magnet for jobs for illegal immigrants because now \nwe have a way to identify who is legal and who is not legal.\n  So we are in a position to impose tough sanctions on employers who \nhire those who are illegal. We have the need for a workforce for \nrestaurants, for hotels, for landscapers, for farms. The Chamber of \nCommerce doesn't like the bill because it doesn't provide a sufficient \nworkforce.\n  We have tried to calculate a point system. We have to produce a lot \nof green cards for the undocumented immigrants, and we have tried to \nprovide a point system which will give due regard for the low-skilled \nworkers for the workforce and due regard for the high-skilled workers \nso we can be competitive. We have also given consideration to family \nties. So we have done the best that could be done under these \ncircumstances. If anybody has a better idea, we are open to \nsuggestions. At least we should be able to proceed to have a debate and \nto proceed to the consideration of the bill. If people have amendments, \nthe Senate will work its will.\n\n  We have a fragile coalition, however, it ought to be noted. The \ncoalition is fragile. If the basic tenets of the proposed legislation \nare not fulfilled, some will withdraw their support. At a bare minimum, \nafter what has been done in a very forceful, good-faith effort by \nDemocrats and Republicans working very hard, very sincerely, in good \nfaith to come up with a bill, we have one pending. At a minimum, it \nought to be considered.\n  Whether it will be passed remains to be seen, but we have drawn from \nall segments of the political spectrum, and the consideration of this \nlegislation ought to proceed. I urge my colleagues to vote cloture on \nthe motion to proceed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I think we have 5 minutes remaining, \nand I yield the time to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I don't support and can't embrace the underlying \nagreement that has been struck, but I do believe every Senator should \nvote for cloture, and I want to talk about that.\n  If you vote ``yes'' on cloture, you are voting to give the Senate an \nopportunity to move forward with tough, smart, and comprehensive \nimmigration reform that secures our Nation's borders. If you vote \n``no'' on cloture, you are voting to maintain the status quo of failed \nlaws and a broken immigration system that is weak on enforcement, \nleaves our borders and our citizens unsecured, while also allowing for \ncontinued exploitation and human trafficking.\n  If we have to wait a couple of years, and that is what will happen if \nwe don't move this now, then States and municipalities will pass their \nown laws, which often violate equal protection laws, can discriminate \nagainst those who are U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, and \ncreate conflict within otherwise peaceful communities.\n  By invoking cloture, we have the opportunity to strengthen the \nscreening process at our consulates and points of entry, to better use \ntechnology along our borders, to make sure our agencies have both the \nnecessary staff and the resources to do their jobs, thus effectively \ntightening our border security and workplace enforcement. By invoking \ncloture we have the opportunity to create an equal playing field and \nensure that America's workers, wages, benefits, and health and safety \nstandards are not undercut.\n  Finally, by invoking cloture we have the opportunity to realize the \neconomic realities in our society in which undocumented workers are \ndoing the worst work that we cannot get many Americans to do, such as \npicking the fruits you had for breakfast, cleaning the hotel rooms for \nyour stay, or plucking the chicken you had for dinner last night. We \nhave an opportunity to vote to create a pathway to earned \nlegalization--not amnesty but earned legalization that will take many \nyears, considerable fines, payment of taxes, and a new English standard \nthat will be required for permanent residency for the first time in our \nhistory.\n  That is what is at stake in the vote this evening. It seems to me we \nhave to move closer to once again controlling our borders, restoring \nthe rule of law, and maintaining our long, proud history as a nation of \nimmigrants.\n  Last Thursday, the administration and a group of our colleagues came \nto an agreement that is often referred to as the ``grand bargain.'' \nUnfortunately, there are a number of details in this deal that, in my \nmind, create an unfair and impractical immigration system, undercutting \nthe more sensible provisions. It is my intention, working with many \ncolleagues, through a series of amendments, to help lead a charge to \nimprove the deal by ultimately creating on the Senate floor tough, \nsmart, and fair immigration reform.\n\n[[Page S6387]]\n\n  Very briefly, I believe the ``grand bargain'' has at least three \nserious flaws that must be fixed--an antifamily bias that clogs the \nsystem, a temporary worker program that creates a permanent working \nunderclass, and exorbitant fines. If we don't improve the ``grand \nbargain,'' we could tear at the fabric of family reunification by \neliminating four out of five family-based green card categories and \ncapping green cards for parents at 40,000 a year. So much for family \nvalues not stopping at the Rio Grande River, as the President has \ntalked about.\n  If we don't improve the ``grand bargain,'' we would enact a truly \ntemporary worker program that labor doesn't support and that bars most \ntemporary workers from any path to permanent residence. Without such a \nchance, these workers would be driven underground and could be \nexploited while creating yet another underclass of undocumented \nworkers.\n  If we don't improve the ``grand bargain,'' we will require a family \nof four to pay up to $19,000 in fines and fees, which is far more \npunitive than what I have seen in the Federal criminal code for a \nvariety of criminal offenses, such as the possession of firearms, \npossession of narcotics, and other things, and is impractical to luring \nthose in the shadows to come forward and be identified and regularize \ntheir stays in this country.\n  I believe what this country does on immigration represents the core \nof American values. How we treat this subject will either show the best \nor worst of America, and so while I am not supportive at this stage of \nthe bipartisan comprehensive agreement that has been reached here, I \nurge Senators on both sides of the aisle to stand up, to vote for \ncloture, and to permit a comprehensive debate to start in the Senate \nand, hopefully, to work a bill we can ultimately be proud of, that can \nsecure the Nation, fuel our economy, and at the same time guarantee we \nbring millions of people out of the darkness and into the light.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, do we have 1 minute or so?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired. The \nminority's time is 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I am advised Senator McConnell, our \nleader, is on his way to the floor, so he will be arriving shortly and \nwe will use the balance of our time.\n  Until he arrives, would either Senator on our side of the aisle care \nto make a statement?\n  Well, if no one else will, I will use the time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question? \nPerhaps we could mention, so all the Members understand, this then is \nthe cloture vote on the motion to proceed, which will permit the Senate \nto begin the debate. So a vote in favor would permit at least the \ndebate on this issue, which is of fundamental importance in terms of \nour country; am I correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \ncorrect, this is a cloture vote on the motion to proceed. This will \nenable the Senate to take up the bill.\n  Again, I emphasize the very laborious efforts of more than a dozen \nSenators, meeting many hours, structuring what has occurred. It is easy \nfor anyone to pick out a provision of this bill he or she would not \nlike, but for every provision that is in the bill which the Senator \nmight object to, that was probably placed there in consideration for \nother provisions in the bill which that Senator might agree to. There \nare many tradeoffs in coming to the conclusions which we have, so that \nwhen we proceed to the consideration of the bill, obviously any Senator \nmay offer any amendment he or she chooses, but I would again comment \nthat the coalition which has brought this bill to the floor is a very \nfragile coalition. If there are any changes on the fundamental so-\ncalled ``grand bargain,'' a term originated by Senator Lindsey Graham, \nwe are going to run the risk of losing Senators.\n  The issues are enormous. This is an enormous issue facing the \ncountry. No domestic issue is of greater importance than this one, and \nwe ought to do our utmost to find an answer to it because today, on \nimmigration, we have anarchy. There are people complaining about \namnesty, but the 12 million will be here no matter what we do. When we \ntake a look at the specifics, it is not amnesty. There are fines to be \npaid, there are taxes to be paid, there is English to be learned, there \nis hard work to be done, and undocumented immigrants are going to have \nto earn their way to citizenship. They start at the end of the line \nwith a minimum of 8 years and perhaps as long as 13 years.\n  Madam President, I am told Senator McConnell is within sight. How \nmuch time remains, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Maybe we will head him off at the pass and tell him not \nto come.\n  Senator McConnell is here, and he has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, \naccording to the timekeeper. He may have some leadership time, who \nknows.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, voting for cloture is a vote simply \nto begin the debate on this legislation. Normally, cloture is used to \nend debate, but here it is to begin.\n  This is an extremely complicated, comprehensive piece of legislation, \nworked at on a bipartisan basis over a period of time. It needs to be \nfinalized. I understand there was a modification to the substitute this \nafternoon, agreed to, I believe, by Senator Kennedy and Senator Kyl. We \nneed to make sure whatever substitute is offered is, in fact, \nreflective of exactly where this legislation is.\n  The other point I would make is we shouldn't be in a hurry to finish \nthis bill. Last year, there were 35 immigration amendments. Twenty-\nthree amendments were voted on before cloture and 12 after cloture. \nThis is, by any standard, at least a 2-week bill, and I think any \neffort to finish up this bill, one way or the other, this particular \nweek would be unsuccessful. This is clearly a 2-week bill.\n  This is an important subject. I think there is widespread discontent \nwith the status quo in our country on the status of illegal \nimmigration. It is time for the Senate to take this up and to give it \nadequate time for consideration. Hopefully, at the end of 2 weeks, we \nwill be able to pass a bill on a broad bipartisan basis that improves \nthe current situation.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 144, S. 1348, Comprehensive \n     Immigration Reform.\n         Barbara Boxer, Harry Reid, Patrick Leahy, Carl Levin, \n           Jack Reed, Dick Durbin, Daniel K.

On this vote, the yeas are 69, the nays are \n23. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for all Senators, I have had a number of \nconversations with the distinguished Republican leader. I think it \nwould be in the best interests of the Senate--I am confident that \nSenator McConnell agrees because it was his suggestion--that we not try \nto finish this bill this week.\n  I think we could, but I am afraid that conclusion wouldn't be \nanything that anyone wanted. There simply is not enough time on this \nmassive, massively important piece of legislation to do it all on \nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n  So, reluctantly; I kind of guard this schedule like my best friend, I \nthink I am going to have to give my best friend 1 less week to do other \nthings. When we come back the week after the Memorial Day break, we \nwill spend that on immigration. I think the country deserves it. I \nthink the Senate deserves it. We can come up with a better piece of \nlegislation in that period of time.\n  I do appreciate the suggestion of my distinguished Republican \ncounterpart. Also, Mr. President, as I have said, this is an imperfect \npiece of legislation. But what in the world would anyone expect? This \nis a tremendously important piece of legislation. The immigration \nsystem in our country is broken. It needs fixing. We have an obligation \nto fix it, as hard as it is, because it is required that we take \npositions on issues we would rather not.\n  So I would hope, during the next couple of weeks as we are working on \nthis matter, that people will legislate in a bipartisan manner. No one \nis trying to get an advantage over anyone else with this piece of \nlegislation. We have blame for both Democrats and Republicans.\n  But whatever we do in the Senate is not the last word. After we \ncomplete the legislation, the House will have to do something on that. \nThey will come up with what they feel is the best way to handle \nimmigration. We will then go to conference.\n  During these entire three steps, we will be working with the White \nHouse to try to come up with something to fix a broken system. Now, are \nwe going fix it perfectly? Probably not. But it is something that is \nbadly in need of fixing. We are going to make it much better at the end \nof the process than it is now.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \nmajority leader. It reflects the conversation he and I had earlier this \nafternoon, where I indicated there was a strong feeling on this side of \nthe aisle that this was a 2-week bill.\n  Last year when we took up this matter, there were 35 amendments voted \non. Twenty-three amendments were voted on before cloture, 12 were voted \non after cloture. Clearly, this is an extraordinarily complex and \nchallenging piece of legislation.\n  So I wish to thank my friend, the majority leader, for realizing this \nis not going to go anywhere unless we have a full and thorough debate \nof at least 2 weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6388-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6388-S6389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT OF 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the motion to proceed \nis agreed to.\n  The Senate will proceed to the consideration of S. 1348, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1348) to provide for comprehensive immigration \n     reform, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the chair for the effort he has \ntaken. I hesitate very much to impose on the time of the Senate. But \nthere ought to be a time now and then when one might impose on the time \nof the Senate.\n  Let me read from the Standing Orders of the Senate, Standing Order \n105.\n  Hear this: ``Resolved, That it is a standing order of the Senate that \nduring yea and nay votes in the Senate, each Senator shall vote from \nthe assigned desk of the Senator.''\n  I always try to do that, Mr. President. That was by S. Res. 480, 90th \nCongress, second session. October 11, 1984. I will tell you who \nauthored that resolution. That was my former colleague, my former late \ncolleague Jennings Randolph. I have never forgotten it. Once in a \nwhile, I vote from the well of the Senate, and sometimes I cast my vote \nfrom here. But that is what this book says: ``Resolved, that it is a \nstanding order of the Senate that during yea and nay votes in the \nSenate, each Senator shall vote from the assigned desk of the \nSenator.''\n\n  There was a reason for that. I won't take the time of the Senate this \nevening to talk about this further, but I will have something to say \none day about that. ``[E]ach Senator shall vote from the assigned desk \nof the Senator. S. Res. 480, 90th Congress, second session, October 11, \n1984.\n  May God bless his name, Jennings Randolph.\n  I thank the Senate, and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as always, we thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for insisting that Senate decorum be enforced. All of us \nunderstand his devotion to this institution and to its ability to \nfunction in an effective and efficient way. He reminds us, and we need \nto be reminded at times. We thank him. I remember Jennings Randolph \nmaking those points time and time again about standing at one's desk. \nThat was back at another time, but I certainly remember his service to \nthe country.\n  So we have some idea of the way we are going to proceed, I have been \nnotified, although I haven't had an opportunity to talk either to \nSenator Specter or Senator Kyl or others on the other side, that we \nhave two amendments at least that are going to deal with the temporary \nworker provision, one which would effectively strike all of the \ntemporary worker provisions that will be probably offered by the \nSenator from North Dakota, and another amendment which will be the \namendment to reduce the number of temporary workers from 400,000 to \n200,000. Those were amendments similar to the ones we had the last time \nwe had the immigration bill. We had a good discussion, and we will have \nthat debate, but we don't expect, obviously, that we will be voting \nthis evening. We are prepared to involve or engage in the debate or \ndiscussion, if those Members want to, but it will be our hope that \nthose amendments would be done in a timely way for tomorrow. It is a \ngood way to get the debate started because it is an issue that is broad \nenough in scope that certainly those of us who were here during the \nlast debate remember it quite clearly. Others can understand it quite \nwell because it is a fairly obvious issue. It is about what is going to \nbe the number, whether we are going to have a temporary worker program \nand whether we are going to have temporary workers at this dimension, \n400,000 reduced to 200,000.\n\n[[Page S6389]]\n\n  I hope that will be the beginning of the debate. We will talk to \nthose Members to try to give the membership as much notice as possible \nto address those issues in a timely way. They have indicated their \ndesire to start with those. We would expect that to be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6389-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, let me comment a little bit on the same \npoints Senator Kennedy made.\n  This is an extraordinarily important piece of legislation. The \nAmerican people--certainly our colleagues in the Senate--need plenty of \ntime to digest and debate and discuss it. It is certainly nobody's \nintention that this would be rushed. That is why the majority leader \nmade comments earlier this evening that assures all of the Members of \nthis body that not only will we have this week to debate and perhaps \namend the legislation, but that upon our return from the Memorial Day \nrecess, we will take up the bill again and, as he indicated, would have \nanother week, if we needed it, to continue work on the legislation.\n  While it is true the legislation did not go through the committee \nprocess, I assure my colleagues it was never anyone's intent that there \nnot be the fullest opportunity for discussion and debate. That will in \nfact occur. We are now on the bill formally. It is also my \nunderstanding that technical changes from the draft legislation will be \ncompleted tonight and the first amendment will be the amendment of that \nsubstitute version. If the distinguished chairman of the committee has \nany other point on that, perhaps he could make it. But that would then \nput before the body the exact language we would begin the debate and \ndiscussion on.\n  I have about another 5 minutes of comments unless Senator Kennedy \nwants to say anything else.\n  It would be in order to thank Secretary Chertoff and Secretary \nGutierrez for their work in helping us in the Senate to craft this \nbipartisan consensus legislation. So much of the enforcement of the \nlegislation will depend upon action by the administration. They had to \nhelp us ensure this was a bill that could be enforced in the future.\n  I know during the last election so many of my constituents asked the \nquestion: Why should we create a new law for you to enforce when the \ncurrent law is not being enforced? That is a good question. So one of \nthe things we tried to do in drafting this legislation was to put \ntogether a bill that actually would and could be enforced, and the \nadministration has helped us by providing expertise in what it would \ntake for Homeland Security and other departments to actually provide \nthe enforcement the American people so desperately want.\n  There was general agreement that return to the rule of law was the \ncentral component of any bipartisan compromise, starting with securing \nthe border, working right up to more enforcement in the interior of the \ncountry, and especially at the workplace, to make sure nobody in the \nfuture would be hired unless it could be established they were entitled \nto be hired. That is one of the critical changes in this legislation \nfrom the previous law which was not enforceable and, as virtually \neverybody who knows this subject appreciates, the law is not being \nassiduously enforced particularly at the workplace. So that is a \ncritical component of what we have talked about doing.\n  There are a great many other things that will be discussed as we \nproceed with the legislation. Referring back to my recent campaign, the \nvoters in my State of Arizona, which is being overrun by illegal \nimmigration, had one message loudly and clearly: Do something about \nthis problem of illegal immigration. So I was returned to the Senate \nby my constituents with an obligation to do my best to get in and do as \nmuch as we could to secure the border, return to the rule of law, \nensure that only people who are eligible to work here are permitted to \ndo so, deal with the people who are here illegally in a humane and just \nway, and try to set up a temporary worker program for temporary workers \nonly, rather than to recreate the problem we have today with a great \ndeal of foreign-born workforce that isn't legal in the United States \nand is now demanding to become legal.\n\n  In order to get engaged in that process and do something about it, it \nwas important to sit down with people of the other side as well as the \nadministration. Of all the criticism I have received for being one of \nthe sponsors of this legislation, the one I don't quite understand from \nmy constituents is, why would I sit down with Senator Kennedy? What I \nhave tried to tell them is, I understand your anxiety about sitting \ndown with Senator Kennedy, but on the other hand, in a body of 100 \nSenators who are supposed to try to work together to find solutions to \nproblems, do you not at least acknowledge that every now and then you \nhave to sit down and talk to each other, even when you are on the other \nside of the aisle? Senator Kennedy right now happens to be in the \nmajority, in addition.\n  As a result, it is, in my position, important to sit down, articulate \nwhat the people of Arizona have told me they would like in any \nimmigration reform, and do my best to try to see that those principles, \nas much as possible, are included in this legislation. If I didn't sit \ndown with Senator Kennedy, I doubt he would include very much of what I \nwanted in the legislation he could otherwise draft. So what we have \ndone, in a bipartisan fashion, is to get Senators on both sides of the \naisle, with many different views, agreeing to try to put together \nsomething that can pass this body, pass the House of Representatives, \nand be signed into law. I know every one of us will stand up here and \nsay: This is not the bill I would have drafted if I were king of the \nworld or queen of the world. There is a lot in this bill I don't like \nvery much. But I know that in order to get something, you have to give \nsomething. At the end of the day, in order to do something about the \nproblem of illegal immigration that is hurting my own State of Arizona \nin ways I can't begin to describe, we have to try our very best to work \ntogether to get something that will actually pass the Senate. That \nmeans an agreement with the administration, with Democrats, and with \nRepublicans.\n  I hope as my colleagues consider what we have put together, they will \nacknowledge you have to start somewhere, but that if there are \namendments that go to the heart of this agreement and that break the \nagreement apart in substantial ways--not ways at the periphery or \ntangentially but that go to the guts of this agreement--that they can \nfully expect it will no longer enjoy the support of those of us who \nworked hard to put the agreement together. If you want to try to kill \nthis legislation, go right to the heart of it and change any of the \nmajor pieces of it, you will find it will quickly lose support, \nincluding mine.\n  We fully expect Members to have a lot of amendments that deal with \ndifferent aspects of the bill. There are a million different details, \nand that is all fine. But if we go to the guts of the legislation and \nthat basic agreement is destroyed, then I think we will see support for \nit evaporate quickly, including mine.\n  I am looking forward to working with my colleagues and debating and \ndiscussing this legislation. But at the end of the day, I conclude \nthere is no option of doing nothing, that our only option is to do \nsomething. That means sitting down, working together, and trying to get \na good bill passed.\n  I appreciate the spirit in which all of my colleagues who have joined \nin this effort have worked toward this end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \ncomments and for his general assessment of the circumstances we find \nourselves with. I can certainly give the assurance to the people of \nArizona that Senator Kyl is a person of extremely strong views, who has \nfelt very deeply\n\n[[Page S6390]]\n\nabout the positions he has, but is a person who believes in comity and \nrespect for other views. He understands you can fight for your views \nand still compromise without compromising your values. I respect \nSenator Kyl for that position.\n  As has been pointed out at other times, this has been a long, \ncomplex, difficult process, but it is one for which I share with \nSenator Kyl that failure is not an option. This country cannot tolerate \na continued border system which is fractured, which it is today, and \nwith all the uncertainty that exists, whether it is on the borders, or \nthe exploitation of workers, or in terms of the lives of many of the \npeople who are here. We have tried to fashion a program, and we are \ngoing to work together to try to see that it is successful.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments, and we are looking forward to \ngetting good discussion and debates on these issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Arizona. \nI do not know if there is a greater champion in this body on the rule \nof law on border security. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for \nbeing the master at the art of figuring out how to get it done. As a \nformer mayor, I have great appreciation for that. When I was mayor, if \nit snowed, and the snow wasn't plowed, the next day I heard about it. I \nthink we are here to fix problems. The system we have today is broken \nand needs to be fixed.\n  I thank both my colleagues for their work on this issue. There will \nbe a lot of conversations as time goes on, a lot of debates, but in the \nend the status quo is not acceptable and we have to fix it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6390-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6390-S6391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I want to switch subjects.\n  I see my colleague from Connecticut in the Chamber.\n  I rise to engage in a colloquy with truly my friend, the Senator from \nConnecticut, about an issue facing every American and every citizen of \nthis world--an issue on which he is a true leader in the Senate, and \nfor which he has had great vision, great perseverance, and for which I \napplaud him. That is the issue of climate change.\n  There is now a preponderance of evidence from the scientific \ncommunity that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil \nfuels, have increased the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide \nby 36 percent from preindustrial levels, leading to a dangerous \nincrease in global average temperatures.\n  The temperatures speak for themselves. According to NASA, 2005 was \nthe warmest year globally on record since readings began in 1880, with \n1998 a close second. And 8 of the last 10 years are amongst the warmest \nyears on record. The effects are increasingly tangible. Since 1979, \nmore than 20 percent of the polar ice cap has melted.\n  So often in this Chamber we talk about the future. We talk about \ndoing things for our kids. Well, if we care about our kids, and we care \nabout our future, we better care about what will happen if we do not \ntake action soon to reduce greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to \nprevent the temperature increases forecasted for this century.\n  Thankfully, we are a nation of innovators, of entrepreneurs, of \nindividuals with bold initiative. The technologies necessary to \nstabilize our atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases in time to \nprevent a dangerous increase in temperature are right at our \nfingertips--from biofuels and plug-in hybrid vehicles to nuclear energy \nand carbon sequestration for coal plants, and many more. It is time for \nCongress to provide the strong market signals necessary to press these \ntechnologies forward, which is why I believe Congress should work for \nan economywide response to climate change with an idea I have \nchampioned: provide utilities incentives to increase the percentage of \ntheir electricity sales they generate using clean energy sources such \nas renewables, nuclear, and clean coal with carbon capture technology.\n  Yet it is not enough for the United States to act alone. China is \nprojected to be the largest greenhouse gas emitter by the end of this \nyear. Climate change legislation must not put America's workers at a \ncompetitive disadvantage with the Chinese, and it must not send \nmanufacturing jobs overseas. A greenhouse gas reduction program must \nnot put Americans out of work or drive more hard-working families into \npoverty.\n  When I drive on the streets, such as Grand Avenue in St. Paul, and it \nis minus 10 degrees, minus 15 degrees, and I see that mom sitting at a \nbus stop waiting to catch a bus, or see that senior, I care about the \ncosts they have to pay for energy. So those are things we have to think \nabout. I refuse to look at this, or any other issue, without \nconsidering the effect it will have on those who are trying to support \ntheir family or, as I said before, the effect it will have on the \nelderly, struggling to survive on a fixed income.\n  Accordingly, I have been working with Senator Lieberman over the last \nseveral months on an agreement that allows us to work together on his \nClimate Stewardship and Innovation Act in a way that meets my concerns \nabout what mandatory greenhouse gas reduction legislation should look \nlike.\n\n  Today, we have arrived at that agreement, and I believe together we \ncan work in a bipartisan way to address this very serious issue.\n  I earlier introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution stating that \nany comprehensive, mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reduction program \nenacted by Congress should include provisions requiring a process of \nreview of the program if it is found that other countries are not \ntaking comparable action and if the unemployment or the poverty rates \nare found to be increasing as a result of the program. This sense of \nthe Senate also states such a program should include incentives for \nutilities that increase their portfolio of clean energy.\n  I say to Senator Lieberman, I wish to ask to be added as a cosponsor \nto your Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act and thank you for your \ncosponsorship of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and finally your \ncommitment to work on EPW to examine my clean energy portfolio proposal \nin a committee hearing, and to fight during EPW markup of climate \nchange legislation for inclusion of: No. 1, congressional review of \ngreenhouse gas caps, if other countries are not taking comparable \nclimate change action; No. 2, congressional review of greenhouse gas \ncaps, if the unemployment and poverty rates are increasing due to a \nU.S. greenhouse gas reduction program; and, No. 3, provisions to reward \nelectric utilities that increase the percentage of their electricity \nsales generated with ``clean energy'' or energy for noncarbon-emitting \nsources such as nuclear and clean coal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to thank my friend, the Senator from Minnesota, \nfor his kind words. More importantly, I thank him for the commitment he \nhas expressed to protecting all of our children and grandchildren from \nthe impacts of unchecked global warming.\n  Senator Coleman, in stepping forward today, has put himself at the \nvanguard of the next crucial wave of bipartisan support in the Senate \nfor climate stewardship legislation.\n  I am proud to cosponsor his resolution which, in a very thoughtful \nway--not an obstructionist way--recognizes two of the most significant \nreasons why people have hesitated to step forward and do something \nabout climate change. One is the equities here: that no matter how much \nwe do in the United States of America to curb the emission of \ngreenhouse gases--and we must because we are the largest emitter of \nsuch gases; we must lead here; it is our responsibility, ultimately our \nmoral responsibility--but no matter how much we assume that leadership \nrole, if other developing nations such as China and India do not do \ntheir part, because we all live in the same global environment, the \nproblem of global warming will continue to increase and be more serious \nfor those who follow us here on Earth.\n  Second is his recognition of a thoughtful way to deal with the \nconcerns people have--even those who desperately want to do something \nto impede the advance of global warming--as to the impact of what we do \nwill have\n\n[[Page S6391]]\n\non our economy. It is clear Senator Coleman has been a leader here, and \nthat is why his cosponsorship of our legislation makes a critical \npoint. There is no conflict between protecting our world and all who \nlive in it from catastrophic climate change and also protecting \nAmerica's economy, protecting America's consumers, and protecting \nAmerica's workers. We can, must, and will do both. For those who may \nhave had doubts about our capacity to do that, I think Senator \nColeman's cosponsorship of the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act \nis critically important. The fact is everyone who works with Senator \nColeman knows he cares deeply about the well-being of low- and middle-\nincome Americans and of America's workers, and he would not be \ncosponsoring the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act--stepping \nforward to take a leadership role in the battle against global \nwarming--if he felt the components of that act would adversely affect \nour economy.\n  I am very honored to have earned the support of my friend from \nMinnesota on this crucial issue. I promise him I will work to ensure he \nis not disappointed by the outcome of our efforts. In particular, it is \nmy honor to chair a subcommittee on climate change in the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, and I will work to ensure that the bill we \nreport from our subcommittee and full committee embraces the principles \nset forth in the resolution my friend from Minnesota has introduced \ntoday, and of which I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  The good news is I will not be working alone. I believe a bipartisan \nmajority of the Environment and Public Works Committee wants to report \nto the Senate floor this year comprehensive legislation that reduces \ngreenhouse gas emissions substantially enough and quickly enough \nto forestall the disastrous climate change so many reputable scientists \nare warning us of, and that does so in a way that does not weaken the \nposition of the United States economically or otherwise impose hardship \non our citizens.\n\n  I further say to my friend from Minnesota that before we vote on that \nlegislation in our subcommittee, we are going to be having additional \nhearings. Senator Warner, my ranking member, is committed also to \nseeing that the subcommittee produces legislation this year that deals \nwith the problem of global warming and the challenge of its impact on \nour world. I want to ensure my friend from Minnesota that one of those \nhearings will include a witness who can educate the committee and \ndiscuss the proposal of the Senator from Minnesota for a clean energy \nportfolio standard. Personally, I think his idea is a constructive one, \na thoughtful one, a progressive one, and deserves serious \nconsideration.\n  I am eager to explore ways to further encourage electric power \nproducers to increase their use of advanced technologies that can \nprovide reliable, affordable baseload electricity without injecting \nmore greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by again thanking my friend from Minnesota \nand asking unanimous consent--and I do so with great gratitude to him, \nas I believe his leadership here is significant--that the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Coleman, be added as a cosponsor to S. 280, the Climate \nStewardship and Innovation Act of 2007, which Senator McCain and I \nintroduced earlier this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend from Connecticut \nfor his remarks, his commitments. Let me say, first, I am proud to be \nworking with him as cosponsor of S. 280, the Climate Stewardship and \nInnovation Act of 2007.\n  The Senator from Connecticut approaches this issue, which is an \nimportant issue--it is a real issue; we have to deal with it--in a way \nwhich he is known for in this Senate, which is in a thoughtful, \nconstructive way, a way which takes into account the concerns and the \nimpact upon employees, upon consumers, and, perhaps most importantly, \nupon our kids and grandkids in the next generation. For that I thank \nhim and say it is a privilege to work with him--a man of great \ncharacter and great dedication.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6391-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6391-S6392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           U.S. TRADE POLICY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the trade policies set in Washington and \nnegotiated across the globe have a direct impact on places such as \nToledo and Steubenville, on Cleveland and Hamilton. That is why voters \nin my State of Ohio and across the country sent a message loudly and \nclearly in November demanding a new direction, a very different \ndirection for our Nation's trade policy.\n  Working men and women in Ohio know that job loss doesn't just affect \nthe worker or just the worker's family; job loss--especially the kind \nof job loss we have seen in the last 5 years, the kind of manufacturing \njob loss--when we see that kind of job loss in the thousands, that job \nloss devastates communities. It hurts the local business owner, the \ndrugstore, the grocery store, the neighborhood restaurant. It hurts \ncommunities. It hurts schools. It hurts police forces. It hurts fire \ndepartments.\n  Two weeks ago, leadership in the House of Representatives and in the \nWhite House announced a new outline for trade policy, one that included \nlabor and environmental standards. The fact that the Bush \nadministration was willing to negotiate at all, the fact that they were \nwilling to pay even lip service to labor and environmental standards, \nunderscores the November elections' importance.\n  Every Member of Congress, in the Senate and in the other body, the \nHouse of Representatives, is now on notice that we will be held \naccountable for our trade votes--accountable to workers, accountable to \nbusiness owners--accountable for our trade votes and accountable for \nAmerican trade policy when we go home. However, since the announcement \nmade by the Bush administration and some congressional leaders in the \nHouse about labor and environmental standards, backpedaling by the \nadministration and sidestepping by supporters of the deal indicate that \nwe may be in for another round of more of the same in our trade policy.\n  The administration already has hinted at side deals for labor \nstandards instead of putting those standards in the central, core part \nof the agreement. They are talking now about not reopening negotiations \nwith Peru and not reopening negotiations with Panama but instead adding \na little sidebar, a little letter, a little statement of support for \nenvironmental labor standards but not actually putting them in the \ncentral core of the agreement. If that is the case, if these labor and \nenvironmental standards are not in the agreement but in a side letter \nof some sort, then really, frankly, nothing new is being offered. It is \nthe same old jalopy with a new coat of paint.\n  Voters in my State demanded real change, not symbolic gestures.\n  What is even more disturbing about the new outline is it appears to \nrely in good faith on the administration to enforce standards. Given \nthis administration's abysmal record on enforcement of labor standards \nand environmental standards, not just in trade agreements but \nenforcement of those standards in our domestic economy, we know what \nthis administration--we know its failed environmental policies. Given \nthis administration's abysmal record on enforcement, relying on blind \ntrust isn't just foolish, it is downright irresponsible.\n  The Jordan Free Trade Agreement passed by the House--I supported it \nand many others did; it passed in both Houses overwhelmingly--the \nJordan Free Trade Agreement was once held up as a standard in labor \nprovisions. It had strong labor and environmental standards in it. It \npassed in the year 2000, but come 2001, with a new President of the \nUnited States, George Bush, and a new U.S. Trade Representative, Bob \nZoellick, the Bush administration simply turned the other way while \nrampant human-trafficking plagues that nation of Jordan. Shortly after \nthe Jordan agreement was enacted, the new USTR, Bob Zoellick, sent a \nletter to Jordan's Trade Minister saying the United States simply \nwouldn't enforce the labor provisions. So even though we passed a trade \nagreement with labor standards inside the core agreement, this \nadministration, this same crowd who now says they will enforce labor \nstandards and\n\n[[Page S6392]]\n\nthey now will enforce environmental standards, this same crowd sent a \nletter to the Jordan Trade Minister saying: We are not enforcing, we \nare not going to push you, we are not going to push you on dispute \nresolution to enforce those labor standards.\n  Today, as a result, Bangladeshi workers enter Jordan--from one of the \npoorest countries in the world--they have their passports confiscated, \nand work in some cases up to 20 hours a day without breaks. Then Jordan \nexports those goods to the United States. There is no enforcement of \nlabor standards, no enforcement of environmental standards. There is \nsimply the continuation of the exploitation of some of the poorest \nworkers in the world in order to reap more profits and backdoor those \nproducts into the United States.\n  If that is the plan, if that is the Bush administration plan--forget \nwhat they talk about on labor standards, forget what they promise on \nenvironmental standards--if that is the plan for Peru, if that is the \nplan for Panama, if that is the plan for Colombia, if that is the plan \nfor South Korea, then they will simply not get the support for these \ntrade agreements. They will not get the support from those who talked \nabout fair trade in their campaigns, not from small business owners, \nnot from small manufacturers such as the local tool and die shop in \nAkron, the local machine shop in Dayton, not from workers across the \ncountry who say: We don't want more of the same.\n  That is what the elections last fall were all about. I believe every \nsingle new Democratic Member of the Senate--there are nine of us--every \nsingle one of us has talked about fair trade, not free trade. If this \nadministration thinks by simply saying: We are for labor standards, we \nare for environmental standards, we will put it in a little side letter \nhere, and then a wink and a nod to their friends in the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, a wink and a nod to the large \ncorporations that benefit from slave labor and child labor, simply \ngiving them a wink and a nod, if they think this Senate and the other \nbody are going to pass this kind of legislation, they are wrong. We \nknow our trade policies have failed. As I said, if they bring back this \nkind of trade agreement for Peru, for Panama, for Colombia, for Korea \nwithout labor and environmental standards in the core agreement and \nwithout real commitments to enforce those labor and environmental \nstandards, then those trade agreements aren't going to fly here.\n  We know our trade policies have failed. When I first ran for \nCongress, our trade deficit in 1992 was $38 billion. Even in those \ndays, President Bush--the first President Bush--said a $1 billion trade \ndeficit represented about 13,000 jobs, mostly manufacturing--many \nmanufacturing jobs. So if you had a $1 billion trade deficit, it meant \nit was costing your country a net loss of 13,000 jobs. If you had a \ntrade surplus, it was a gain of 13,000 jobs. That was then a $38 \nbillion trade deficit in 1992. In 2006, our trade deficit was in the \nvicinity of $800 billion--$800 billion. That means the trade deficit \nhas grown by a factor of 20. If it is 13,000 jobs for every $1 billion \ntrade deficit, you do the math. It is clear this trade policy has \nfailed. It has failed our workers. It has failed our small \nmanufacturers. It has failed our restaurants and our drugstores in \nthose communities that suffer devastating job loss. It has failed our \nfamilies. It has failed our country.\n\n  The current system is not sustainable. Senator Dorgan has said: We \nwant trade, and plenty of it, but under new rules. That means \nbenchmarks. When we pass trade agreements, we have to show how much \nthis has done for America's wages, how much it has done for American \njob creation, and we want accountability, something we have never \nbrought to the table on these trade agreements. That does not mean \ntrying to pass off more of the same kind of trade policy, packaging it \nin a different way, speaking of all the platitudes of the \nadministration and that some others in the House and Senate have spoken \nabout, just simply saying it is new and improved.\n  Now is not the time for more bad trade deals. We need to pause. We \nneed to have a national conversation about a new direction for trade in \nthe 21st century, a conversation that includes everybody.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to express some thoughts about \nthe earlier statement of the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, that he \nwas not going to attempt to bring this bill up for a vote this week. I \nthink that is the only right choice that could have been made. He has \nbeen talking about bringing it up this week and actually getting a vote \non Friday on a bill that we only got the paperwork on Saturday morning \nat 2 a.m. It hasn't been substituted yet, to my knowledge.\n  This is a piece of legislation of enormous complexity which has not \ngone through the proper committee--the Judiciary Committee. It was \nwritten by a group of people who claim they have reached an agreement. \nThe agreement is that on both sides, they are saying nobody can offer \nan amendment that goes to what they consider the core of it because \nthey will all band together and vote against it. So I guess that means \nif anybody has a different view about how immigration should be \nhandled, the people I really love and respect, whom I affectionately \ncall ``masters of the universe,'' are just going to all get together \nand vote no. So I am not sure what the purpose of having votes is. But \npresumably, the rest of us, now that we have had a chance to read it, \nwill be able to at least nibble around the edges and offer a few \namendments that might make it a little better, and I look forward to \nthat opportunity.\n  I think it is very important that this bill was not rammed through \nthis week and no attempt was made to do that. I think it would have \npoisoned the atmosphere. It would have been a very bad scene had that \noccurred. So now we are talking about 2 weeks of debate. There is no \ndoubt in my mind that this Senate could spend a month easily on this \nbill--maybe more. It is a critically important piece of legislation. It \nhas much impact on our whole economy, our culture, and our rule of law. \nWe could do better with it if we spend time on it. So I hope we are not \nin a situation where the leadership--the conferee group which has been \nmeeting--is going to lock together and just vote down anything that \ndispleases them or one side or the other says this is important and \nshouldn't be amended. So I am worried about that. We will see how it \ngoes.\n  I hope the American people will take the opportunity to study the \nlegislation. It does have some good things in it. It does have \nprovisions in it that are quite superior to the bill I referred to as \nfatally flawed last year. But the cloture vote we just took was to move \nto last year's bill, and unless I am mistaken, we have not seen the new \nbill that is supposed to be substituted. We haven't seen anything other \nthan a draft of the former bill. It has not been put in legislative \nlanguage, even in the smaller print in the draft version that has been \nfloated since Saturday. It is 326 pages, but in normal bill language, \nit will turn out to be probably 800, maybe 1,000 pages with each one of \nthe clauses and phrases. Based on our history of dealing with \nimmigration, it has to be read carefully because experts seem to have \nthe ability--some of these lawyers, particularly--to slip in phrases \nthat can have significance far beyond what might appear to be the case \nwhen you first read it. So it needs to be studied carefully.\n  A lot of people wanted to ram this through before the Memorial Day \nrecess.\n  I am glad Senator Reid has abandoned that and will allow the American \npeople the opportunity to have an extra week to look at it.\n  I thank my colleagues who have worked on the bill. They are good \npeople. They have it in their heads that they want to fix immigration, \nand it is time for a comprehensive fix of immigration. There are tough \ndecisions to be made. But I get a little bit worried when time after \ntime I hear people say: Well, there is a lot in it I don't like,\n\n[[Page S6393]]\n\nbut you know, you just have to live with it. I am not sure we ought to \nlive with anything that doesn't make sense. I am not sure we ought to \nlive with anything that is bad policy. Why do we have to do that? \nBecause this group has met and they said no serious amendments can be \nchanged--adopted that would alter the core of the bill, the basic \nphilosophy of it, I worry about that. We are troubled that a number of \nthings don't quite reach the promised principles that have been floated \nas part of this discussion.\n  The trigger is in the bill, but I think it is far too weak. The \ntemporary guest worker program is preferable to last year's, but it is \nvery unsettling to me. I have an odd feeling that this temporary worker \nprogram that is in the bill is not going to work. We should not pass \nanything that won't work. It needs to be done in a better way.\n  The hoped-for move to a more merit-based system, a point system like \nCanada does, is troubling because no significant move in that direction \nappears to be on the horizon for 8 years. It is 8 years before the \npoint system will really take effect. So I am worried about that.\n  These are fundamental. Will the workplace system be effective? We \nneed to study that language because if it is not done right, it won't \nwork. I will have an opportunity to talk more about this.\n  I thank my staff and a lot of other staff who have worked their \nhearts out Saturday, Sunday, and into the night last night and all \nmorning today, trying to read and digest this bill to see what it \nreally means so we can do a better job of serving our constituents.\n  Finally, the guiding principle, the overarching goal of an \nimmigration bill, must be to serve the national interest. It is not to \nserve special interests, groups of special interests, businesses, or \nimmigration advocacy groups.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the founding dean \nof the William S. Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada Las \nVegas, Richard ``Dick'' Morgan. Dick came to Nevada to take on the \ndaunting task of starting Nevada's first law school. When given the \ntimeframe for starting the school, Dick said it could not be done; then \nhe went out and proved himself wrong many times over. Dick's \noutstanding success with Boyd School of Law now serves as the model on \nhow to create a new law school of exceptional quality.\n  Under the Dean's steady hand, Boyd Law School has achieved both \nprovisional and full accreditation with the American Bar Association in \nrecord time. The school has received special recognition for its work \nwith the Saltman Center for Conflict Resolution, the Nevada Law \nJournal, client counseling training, Society of Advocates, and legal \nwriting programs. With amazing rapidity, the school has earned an \noutstanding reputation for scholarship and high-quality graduates. \nAlready, the school's alumnae are having a tremendous impact on the \nlegal profession in Nevada. They serve as judicial clerks, pro bono \nattorneys, respected members of law firms throughout the State, legal \ncounsel in Federal and State agencies, and even on my own staff.\n  On June 30, 2007, Dean Morgan is stepping down as the head of the law \nschool. Although he will be sorely missed, his legacy is tremendous. \nUNLV's law school dean is leaving us with an outstanding institution \nthat will continue to train the minds of many of our best and brightest \nstudents. I am confident that the attorneys trained by the school will \nbe instrumental in guiding the future growth and progress of our State.\n  When he came to Nevada, he had served as a law professor and as dean \nof both the Wyoming and Arizona State Colleges of Law. Reflecting on \nhis experience in legal education, Dean Morgan recently honored Nevada \nby characterizing his 10 years with Boyd School of Law as ``the best'' \nof his 27 years in legal education. I am grateful he spent his best \nyears with us. He has certainly been invaluable to the Nevada legal \ncommunity.\n  Going forward, Dean Morgan plans a community-service semiretirement. \nBased on his dedication to UNLV, I am confident that he will be a \ntremendous asset to any organization he is associated with. I offer \nDean Morgan my sincere thanks for all he has done for Nevada and wish \nhim the best on his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6393-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TED STEVENS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, look up Senator Stevens' name in media \nreports and you will find a long list of adjectives: tenacious, \ntemperamental, scrappy, gruff, hot-tempered, tireless. And you will \ncome across a long list of nicknames: one of the Senate's ``old bulls'' \nfor his institutional knowledge, ``Uncle Ted'' to the people of Alaska \nwho are grateful for his aggressive advocacy for their interests, \npioneer for flying Army Air Corps missions during World War II and \nmigrating to our rugged 49th State after law school, a mentor to up-\nand-coming elected officials, reportedly by his wife, a nutrition \nenthusiast for his devoted consumption of greens and whole grains, in \nthe case of his longtime friend, Senator Inouye of Hawaii, ``my \nbrother.''\n  I would like to add a few adjectives of my own.\n  First, Ted Stevens is an Alaskan. It is impossible to think of Alaska \nwithout thinking of its senior Senator. Alaska and Ted Stevens are \ninseparable. Anyone who knows Senator Stevens knows he wakes up every \nmorning fighting for the people of Alaska and doesn't stop until he \nsleeps, which apparently isn't much. Their commercial industry, health \ncare, electricity, water, transportation--even the cost of rural mail \ndelivery--all earn his scrutiny. He has delivered again and again on \npolicy to improve Alaskans' quality of life.\n  Second, and just as important, Ted Stevens is loyal. He is loyal to \nthe institution of the United States Senate. Bipartisanship is natural \nfor him. He understands that the art of compromise is critical to \ngetting things done. For example, he is known to have helped reach a \nbipartisan deal on how to conduct the impeachment trial of President \nClinton to minimize the partisan bickering that would have sullied the \nSenate and made a tense time even more tense.\n  He is more than willing to look across the aisle and find kinship \nwith people of like interests. His friendship with Senator Inouye, a \nDemocrat, is steadfast and legendary. They have found plenty of common \nground in delivering good policy to the people of their uniquely \nsituated States. Despite what seems like a gruff exterior sometimes, \nSenator Stevens has a reputation for extending generous kindness to his \ncolleagues, such as flying across country to attend the funeral of a \nformer Senator whose vote had once been helpful.\n  Senator Stevens' approach to policymaking is guided by Rotary \nInternational's ``Four-Way Test,'' a copy of which is framed on his \ndesk in the Senate Chamber. The test reads: ``Is it the truth? Is it \nfair to all concerned? Will it build goodwill and better friendships? \nWill it be beneficial to all concerned?''\n  That four-way test was written in 1932, but like Senator Stevens--and \nhere are more adjectives--it is common sense, inspirational, and \ntimeless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6393-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6393-S6394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IDAHO COURTHOUSE AND CHURCH SHOOTINGS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this weekend we witnessed an act of \nsenseless violence in Moscow, ID, the home of the University of Idaho, \nwhere someone reportedly laid siege to a courthouse, killing a police \nofficer and\n\n[[Page S6394]]\n\nwounding a sheriff's deputy and another person. The gunman then \nretreated into a church, where he apparently killed a church sexton and \nthen took his own life.\n  The attack at the courthouse in Idaho is another reminder of the need \nto provide resources and protections crucial to our Federal and State \ncourts. It was 2 years ago when the mother and husband of Judge Joan \nLefkow of Chicago were murdered in their home. Judge Lefkow's \ncourageous testimony in our committee hearing in May 2005 is something \nnone of us will forget. Later that year a Georgia State court judge was \nkilled at a courthouse in Atlanta and there was an attack on a State \njudge in Nevada.\n  Last month, by a vote of 97-0, the Senate passed S. 378, the \nbipartisan Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. I introduced this \nmeasure in January along with Senator Specter, the majority leader, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Cornyn and others. House Judiciary chairman \nJohn Conyers introduced an identical measure in the House also with \nbipartisan support.\n  Among the bill's many protections are provisions expanding the access \nof State courts to grant programs for their security. The additional \nresources provided by this bill may not have prevented what occurred \nthis weekend, but we must do what we can. I wish this legislation had \nbeen enacted last year. Despite our efforts, despite Senate passage of \nthis measure twice last year, the House last Congress did not take up \nand pass these measures to improve court security. I expect that the \nnew House soon will take up and pass S. 378 in this Congress. It should \nnot be a struggle to enact these measures to improve court security.\n  Our Nation's Founders knew that without an independent judiciary to \nprotect individual rights from the political branches of Government, \nthose rights and privileges would not be preserved. The courts are the \nultimate check and balance in our system. We need to do our part to \nensure that the dedicated women and men of the Federal and State \njudiciary have the resources, security, and independence necessary to \nfulfill their crucial responsibilities. This weekend serves as another \ntragic reminder that we owe it to our judges and those protecting our \ncourthouses to better protect them and their families from violence and \nto ensure that they have the peace of mind necessary to do their vital \nand difficult jobs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6394-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I am here today to talk about another \npotential failure by the FDA that may have endangered the lives of \nmillions of Americans. Avandia is a drug that was approved by the FDA \nin 1999. It is a diabetes drug and is used to lower blood sugar. This \nis important because lowering a diabetic's blood sugar can help prevent \nor at least postpone two of the biggest killers among diabetics: heart \nattacks and strokes.\n  But today, Dr. Steven Nissen, the chairman of Cardiovascular Medicine \nat the Cleveland Clinic and the immediate past president of the \nAmerican College of Cardiology, and his colleague, Ms. Kathy Wolski, \nreported in the New England Journal of Medicine that there is a serious \nproblem with Avandia. Avandia, according to Dr. Nissen and Ms. Wolski \nis increasing the likelihood that a diabetic will have a heart attack \nand maybe even die. I want everyone to pay attention to the fact that \nthe New England Journal of Medicine accepted this analysis of Avandia \non a ``fast track'' review. The New England Journal of Medicine did \nthat because it was requested by the authors and because in its \nopinion, the analysis of adverse effects related to Avandia suggests \nserious patient health risks.\n  Dr. Nissen and Ms. Wolski based their finding on an analysis of 42 \nclinical trials.\n  FDA also decided to say something to the American people today in \nresponse to Dr. Nissen's analysis. Around 1 p.m. today, the FDA told \nthe American people that they intend to call for an advisory board \nmeeting to discuss Avandia and that they could not yet reach a ``firm \nconclusion'' on what to recommend to people taking Avandia. It was \ninteresting to listen to the call because Dr. Dal Pan, who is the head \nof the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, didn't say a word, \nalthough he is in charge of postmarketing surveillance. I guess the FDA \nthinks that the decision to go to an advisory committee meeting takes \nthe heat off what looks like another failed decisionmaking process. We \nwill see.\n  Avandia has a long history. It has been on the market for about 8 \nyears. Tens of millions of prescriptions have been written for Avandia, \nand Medicare and Medicaid have paid hundreds of millions of dollars for \nthis drug.\n  There have been many clinical trials involving Avandia over the years \nand there have been numerous postmarketing changes to Avandia's label. \nI also understand that FDA has known about the possibility of problems \nwith this drug since about October 2005. That is about 19 months ago.\n  The article appearing today in the New England Journal of Medicine \nraises a lot of serious questions for me about the real story behind \nthe safety of Avandia. When I couple that article with the FDA \nconference call that ducked lots of questions I become very suspicious.\n  Over the last 3 years, my investigations into the FDA showed that the \nagency was too cozy with the drug industry and did not always put \nsafety of the American people first. The FDA is supposed to regulate \nthe drug industry, but in the case of Vioxx, just to name one debacle, \nAmerican lives were endangered unnecessarily.\n  My question today is, Do we have another Vioxx on our hands with \nAvandia? I am not sure, but I intend to find out. In fact, today \nSenator Baucus and I sent out several document requests including one \nto the FDA and one to the drug sponsor. We want to understand what did \nFDA know about this drug, when did it know it, and what did it do about \nit?\n  The authors of the New England Journal of Medicine article report a \n43 percent increase in the risk of myocardial infarction/heart attack \nand potentially a 64 percent increase in the risk of cardiovascular \ndeath. I need the FDA to tell me why a diabetic would take a drug that \nmay increase the risk of the very thing they are trying to avoid--a \nheart attack. I also want to know why the FDA did not require the drug \nsponsor to conduct long-term safety studies instead of small, short-\nterm trials that resulted in few adverse cardiovascular events or \ndeath. I want to know what the FDA has been doing for the last 18 \nmonths. We want to know the same from the drug sponsor.\n  Interestingly, in an editorial that accompanied the study, two other \nveterans of the Vioxx controversy--Dr. Bruce Psaty of the University of \nWashington and Dr. Furberg of Wake Forest University--write that: ``. . \n. the rationale for prescribing rosiglitazone at this time is \nunclear.'' Additionally they call for the FDA to take regulatory action \nand note that bigger and better long-term studies of long-term \ntreatments for conditions such as diabetes should be completed as soon \nas possible after a drug is approved.\n  Let me also say something else to all those FDA employees trying to \ndo their job who probably know the answers to many of my questions: \nPlease feel free to call the Finance Committee if you have any \ninformation about this drug and how the FDA handled the situation. You \ncan also call or contact us anonymously if you want. If you want to fax \ninformation to me, here is my fax number: 202-228-2131. We welcome your \nhelp and insight because I know that many of you want to protect the \nAmerican public first and foremost and sometimes that is not as easy as \nit should be at the FDA.\n  You will also remember that just a few weeks ago I came before the \nSenate several times to talk about drug safety. I told everyone then--\nas we were discussing S. 1082, a bill that was intended to dramatically \nimprove postmarketing drug safety, that I was concerned that the bill \nwould not do that. In my mind and in light of all the work I have done \nover the past 3 years on the FDA, I told everyone that the litmus test \nfor me was whether or not the new drug safety bill would prevent \nanother Vioxx.\n  My position has consistently been that S. 1082 did not go far enough \nand would not prevent another Vioxx. That was why I proposed and \ninsisted on a vote giving joint authority between the office that \napproves new drugs for the market and the office that is responsible \nfor postmarket safety. Forty-six Senators listened to what I had to \nsay, but I was one vote short and the amendment did not pass.\n  Drs. Psaty and Furberg also said in their editorial, and I quote, \n``On May 10, 2007, the Senate passed the Food and Drug Administration \nRevitalization Act. Although the Senate bill has many strengths, \nincluding the allocation of new authority to the FDA, none of its \nprovisions would necessarily have identified the cardiovascular risks \nof rofecoxib or rosiglitazone in a timely fashion.''\n  The drug industry has brought us miracle drugs. These drugs have \nvastly improved the lives of millions throughout the world. At the same \ntime, we all know that drugs have risks and benefits. Each of us tries \nto consider those risks and benefits when we consult with our doctors \nto make the best decision for ourselves or our family members as to \nwhether we will take a particular drug. But we can't do what is best \nfor ourselves or our family members if we don't know all the relevant \ninformation in a timely manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6395-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6395-S6396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ISLANDER AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, during the month of May we celebrate \nAsian Pacific Islander American Heritage Month. I would like to join \nthe Nation in honoring the many contributions of Americans of Asian \nPacific Islander descent and pay tribute to their efforts in \nstrengthening and nourishing our history, commerce, cultural identity, \nand resolve.\n  This month-long tribute would not be complete without recognizing the \nvisionaries who founded Asian Pacific Islander American Heritage Month: \nU.S. Senator Daniel Inouye, former U.S. Senator Spark Matsunaga, former \nSecretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta, and former U.S. \nRepresentative Frank Horton. As a result of their steadfast leadership, \na joint resolution established Asian Pacific American Heritage Week in \n1978, and the celebration was later expanded to an entire month in \n1992.\n  This celebration takes place in May to mark the first Japanese \nimmigrants' arrival in America in 1843, as well as the completion of \nthe Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 which would not have been \nfinished without the hard work and dedication of Chinese laborers.\n  This month is also a time to honor the Japanese-American survivors of \nthe forced internment camps established during World War II. The \ninternment of Japanese Americans during\n\n[[Page S6396]]\n\nWorld War II was a grim chapter in America's history. But by sustaining \nthis history, we can hope to prevent a similar travesty from occurring.\n  That is why it was so important to designate Tule Lake as a National \nHistoric Landmark within the lifetimes of the few surviving Japanese-\nAmerican internees, before many of their stories were lost. And thanks \nto the efforts of Interior Secretary Gale Norton, the Tule Lake \nSegregation Center will help future generations understand the pain and \nsuffering that Japanese Americans endured during World War II.\n  Despite these hardships, members of the Asian Pacific Islander \ncommunity have continued to take positions of leadership and have \nworked hard to secure a brighter future for all.\n  Today, California boasts 20 elected officials of Asian Pacific \nIslander heritage. There are now nine Asian Pacific Islander Americans \nin the State legislature; four on the State board of equalization, \nincluding John Chiang as the State controller; and a number of others \nin local government. A new generation of leaders has emerged with a \nvision of a politically empowered Asian Pacific Islander American \nelectorate.\n  Additionally, over 62,000 Asian Pacific Islander Americans are on \nactive duty in the military, and nearly 8,000 are deployed across the \nworld to fight terrorism. And Asian Pacific Islander Americans are \namong the thousands of Americans who have sacrificed their lives for \nour country.\n  The United States draws great strength from the diversity of this \npopulation. At present, Asian Pacific Islander Americans constitute one \nof the fastest growing minority communities in the United States. And \nCalifornia is home to the greatest number of Asian Pacific Islander \nAmericans. In fact, there are over 13 million Asian Pacific Islander \nAmericans in the Nation, with more than 4.5 million living in \nCalifornia.\n  As the second largest ethnic minority group in California, Asian \nPacific Islander heritage continues to enrich our State with famous \nenclaves such as San Francisco's Chinatown, Los Angeles' Koreatown, \nWestminster's Little Saigon, and the city of Artesia's Little India.\n  We must recognize that the Asian Pacific Islander American community \nis diverse, not only in language, culture, and foods but in education \nand socioeconomic levels as well. That is why it is so important to \nprovide talented students who have clearly embraced the American dream \nthe incentive to take the path toward being a responsible, contributing \nmember in our civic society.\n  I have cosponsored the DREAM Act of 2007 to give undocumented high \nschool students who wish to attend college or serve in the Armed Forces \nan opportunity to adjust to a lawful status and pursue these goals. If \nit becomes law, the DREAM Act would help Asian Pacific Islander \nAmericans and others triumph over adversity.\n  As future generations of Asian Pacific Islander Americans continue to \nstrive for excellence in our educational system, economy, and \ncommunities, I am pleased to honor and distinguish the many triumphs \nand accomplishments of the Asian Pacific Islander American community \nand their role in shaping our Nation's identity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6396-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    VA HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, last week the Senate passed a resolution \ndesignating May 14 to 18, 2007, as National Health Information \nTechnology Week. In connection with this resolution, it is important to \nrecognize the leadership and progress that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs has shown in the area of health information technology.\n  By passing this resolution, the Senate has recognized the tremendous \nimportance of information technology in improving health care for all \nAmericans. RAND Corporation has estimated that by improving health \ninformation technology and practices more than $81 billion can be saved \nannually in the United States.\n  Such savings are only one aspect of the promised impact of better \nhealth information technology. The other, more important aspect is that \nimproved health information technology can help save lives by providing \nhealth care providers with more accurate and timely patient \ninformation.\n  As an increasing number of veterans return from the current conflicts \nin Iraq and Afghanistan with complicated injuries, they must receive \nthe quality care earned through their service. Information technology \nhelps VA provide that care.\n  Over the past decade, VA has become a leader in the use of electronic \nhealth records. Through VA's veterans health information system and \ntechnology architecture, commonly referred to as VISTA, clinicians can \naccess and update electronic health records throughout the Nation's \nlargest health care system. Clinicians can also view medical images, \nsuch as x rays, pathology slides, and other critical records that can \nbe placed immediately into a patient's record. In addition to their \nelectronic records system, VA is reducing medication and prescription \nerrors through a point-of-care system to verify that patients receive \ncorrect dosage at correct times, visually alerting staff when errors \nare made. For its development and employment of this system, VA was \nawarded the 2006 Innovations in Government Award, sponsored by Harvard \nUniversity.\n  While VA's health care system is by no means perfect, its use of \nhealth information technology has improved the quality of care received \nby veterans, while reducing the costs to our taxpayers. I hope the \nDepartment will continue on their path of progress, and I commend VA \nfor its work thus far.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6396-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         IN RECOGNITION OF STAFF SERGEANT HAROLD GEORGE DANLEY\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a \nman who died in the service of his country 64 years ago, but never \nreceived the proper recognition he was due.\n  Harold George Danley was one of four brothers from Lincoln, NE, who \njoined the armed services during World War II. Three of those brothers \nreturned home to their families; Sergeant Danley, who was 22 years old, \ndid not.\n  Sergeant Danley was serving in the 18th Army/Air Force Anti-Submarine \nSquadron aboard a B-24D Bomber, which crashed while patrolling the East \nCoast of the United States somewhere near the Virginia/North Carolina \nshoreline on April 21, 1943. Despite the efforts of search parties, his \nbody was never recovered; therefore, no memorial service was ever \nperformed on his behalf. It was some time later that the family was \nnotified that Sergeant Danley was officially listed as FOD, ``Finding \nof Death.''\n  Sergeant Danley left behind his wife Thelma; his daughter Merriam, \nwho was born several months after her father's death; his father \nHarrison and stepmother Anna; three brothers, LTC Earl E. Danley, SGT \nBob E. Danley, and SGT Lloyd K. Danley, now deceased; and three half-\nsiblings, Marvin, Delores, and Betty. His mother Ella preceded him in \ndeath.\n  On May 18, 2007, a memorial service was held at Arlington National \nCemetery to honor Harold G. Danley as a son, brother, husband, and \nfather, as well as a man who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service \nof his country. My thoughts are with the Danley family as they honor \nthe memory of Staff Sergeant Danley, a Nebraska hero from the Second \nWorld War.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6396-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING HEIDI WENTZLAFF\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \ndecade-plus of\n\n[[Page S6397]]\n\nservice that Ken Crockett has dedicated to the State of West Virginia. \nFor the last 11 years, Ken has served as the director of the West \nVirginia Japan Office in Nagoya, which sits in the Aichi Prefecture of \nJapan.\n  West Virginia has opened trade offices throughout the world in order \nto encourage economic relationships with our State. The Japan Office \nhas helped draw a number of Japanese businesses to open new locations \nin West Virginia, as well as helped the businesses already in West \nVirginia export their products to Japan. In addition to the economic \nbenefits of this relationship, the Japan office has facilitated a \nnumber of cultural and educational exchanges--all under Ken's \nleadership.\n  In Ken's years as director of the West Virginia Japan Office, our \nState and Japan have seen a dramatic, if not astronomical, rise in \ntheir economic relations. West Virginia is currently home to 19 \nJapanese companies that have created thousands of direct and indirect \njobs for our State's citizens. Japanese investors have been, and \ncontinue to be, outstanding corporate citizens of West Virginia--\ncontributing economically and culturally to the quality of the State.\n  I have seen Ken's work firsthand on a number of occasions in Japan on \ntrade missions with various Governors. Ken's relationships and his \npresence in Nagoya have been very valuable for our development efforts. \nHe operated with a strong dedication to our collective goals and an \nunderstanding of both Japan and West Virginia.\n  Very soon, Ken will be embarking on a new career with NGK Spark \nPlugs--West Virginia's first major Japanese investor--and a trailblazer \nfor our State's Japanese automotive industry. Ken will bring to that \njob the same determination, commitment, and hard work ethic he brought \nto the State's economic development efforts. We look forward to working \nwith him in his new position as we continue to strengthen our ties with \nour State's existing Japanese investors.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate and ask that my colleagues join me \nin recognizing Ken's service to my State and wish him the best in his \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6397-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CHARLES WOFFORD\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Charles \nWofford. Mr. Wofford is retiring from the position of Alabama area \ndirector of the Social Security Administration after over 45 years of \ndedicated service. He has served as the Area Director in Alabama since \nSeptember 1979.\n  Mr. Wofford graduated from the University of Alabama in 1961 with a \nB.S. degree in biology. He began work with Social Security that same \nyear as a claims representative trainee. He held additional \nincreasingly responsible jobs as a claims authorizer, field \nrepresentative, operations supervisor, branch manager, assistant \ndistrict manager, district manager, and has been an area director since \nApril 1977 and came to Alabama in 1979 to serve as the Alabama area \ndirector at that time.\n  He is the senior area director in the United States, and has received \nnumerous awards throughout his career for superior performance. He \nreceived a service award for spearheading an intense direct deposit \ncampaign and a cash award in recognition of exemplary achievement in \nthe area of DDS and field office relations. He has strived to build a \nstrong management team and has worked to ensure that all employees are \nfully trained to perform to the best of their ability. He received the \nDeputy Commissioner's Citation for Outstanding Contributions as a \nmember of the National Training Vision Workgroup.\n  I congratulate Mr. Wofford on his retirement. He has been a valued \nemployee and wise mentor to many other employees. He enjoys traveling, \nand we wish him well in the future as he has more time to enjoy this \nfavored pastime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6397-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR. DAVID TAWEI LEE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to honor Dr. David \nTawei Lee, who has been Taiwan's chief representative to the United \nStates. Dr. Lee will be assuming his new post as Taiwan's top envoy in \nCanada this month, leaving his post in Washington to take on this new \nrole in Ottawa.\n  I have known David for decades, and he has been a staunch ally and \nstrong advocate for West Virginia. He has helped me, and our State, to \nmake inroads in the Taiwanese economy and has been instrumental in the \ncontinuing success of businesses with roots in both Taiwan and West \nVirginia. This ongoing economic relationship is enormously important \nfor both sides and has allowed West Virginia to continue to grow its \nburgeoning aviation industry and to explore business opportunities we \nnever thought possible.\n  As a result of the hard work of Representative Lee and others, Sino \nSwearingen Aircraft Company continues its push toward mass production \nof one of the most impressive business jets in the world. In addition, \nin my personal interactions with David, he has always been \nstraightforward, honest, compassionate, and well-informed. I knew he \nwould level with me during any difficult time and that I could count on \nhim to fairly and accurately relay the results of our meetings to his \npeople.\n  Representative Lee has worked hard during the last 2\\1/2\\ years to \nrenew and strengthen the political, economic, and social ties that bind \nthe United States and Taiwan. On many difficult occasions, David Lee \nhas risen to the challenge, and as Taiwan's Chief Representative to the \nUnited States he has given countless hours assisting lawmakers, \nadministration officials, and the private sector in understanding the \ncomplex relationship between our people and ensuring that our \nlongstanding friendship continues.\n  Representative Lee was educated at the National Taiwan University and \nreceived his Ph.D. in foreign affairs from the University of Virginia. \nDavid is a true democrat, firmly committed to the principles of \ndemocracy and capitalism. He has been an asset for both Taiwan and the \nUnited States, and he has served Taiwan with honor, integrity, and \ndistinction.\n  Dr. Lee's record of distinguished public service to his people spans \nmore than two decades. He began his career at the Coordination Council \nfor North American Affairs, Office in Washington, DC, in l982 as a \nstaff consultant and soon rose to various important posts in Taiwan's \nforeign ministry. From l997 to l998, he was Director-General, \nGovernment Information Office, and Government spokesman for Taiwan. \nFrom l998 to 2001, he served as Deputy Foreign Minister; from 2001 to \n2004, he was Taiwan's Representative to the European Union, stationed \nin Belgium. Since the summer of 2004, he has served as the Republic of \nChina's chief representative in the United States.\n  Our loss here in Washington will be Canada's gain. In his new role as \nTaiwan's representative to Canada, David will continue to be a strong \nadvocate for policies that will encourage expanded trade and a \ncontinuing good relationship between Taiwan and the rest of the world. \nAgain, I would like to take this opportunity to wish Representative and \nMadame Lee the very best of luck. They are our good friends, and we \nwill miss them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6397-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6397-4", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6397-5", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6397-S6398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  The following message from the President of the United States was \ntransmitted to the Senate by one of his secretaries:\n\n[[Page S6398]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6397-5", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6397-S6398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  The following message from the President of the United States was \ntransmitted to the Senate by one of his secretaries:\n\n[[Page S6398]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6398-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n RESPECT TO IRAQ AS DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13303 OF MAY 22, 2003, \n   AS RECEIVED DURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE ON MAY 18, 2007--PM 15\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act to provide competitive status to certain Federal \nemployees in the State of Alaska; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, last year, as we approached the \nbeginning of National Police Week 2006, our Nation was saddened by the \ntragic loss of two Fairfax County, VA, police officers, Detective Vicki \nArmel and Master Police Officer Michael Gambarino, in an ambush at the \nSully District Police Station. Once again, as National Police Week 2007 \ndrew to a close, the Nation found itself in mourning at the loss of an \nofficer who was ambushed over the weekend. I am referring to Moscow, \nID, Police Officer Lee Newbill, a husband and a father of three who was \nfatally shot on Saturday night. We do not remember our fallen law \nenforcement officers for the way they gave their lives but for the way \nthey lived them. The people of the State of Alaska extend our \ncondolences to Officer Newbill's wife and three children. We are also \nthinking about Brannon Jordan, a Latah County sheriff s deputy who was \nshot in the incident, but who is expected to recover, according to \nmedia reports.\n  I would like to take this opportunity once again to speak about the \nlife and accomplishments of the late Thomas P. O'Hara, a National Park \nService protection ranger and pilot who gave his life in the line of \nduty, an Alaskan hero.\n  Thomas P. O'Hara was assigned to the Katmai National Park and \nPreserve in the Bristol Bay region of western Alaska. On December 19, \n2002, Ranger O'Hara and his passenger, a Fish and Wildlife Service \nemployee, were on a mission in the Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife \nRefuge. Their plane went down on the tundra.\n\n[[Page S6402]]\n\n  When the plane was reported overdue, a rescue effort consisting of 14 \nsingle-engine aircraft, an Alaska Air National Guard plane, and a Coast \nGuard helicopter quickly mobilized. Many of the single-engine aircraft \nwere piloted by Torn's friends. The wreckage was located late in the \nafternoon of December 20. The passenger survived the crash, but Ranger \nTorn did not.\n  Tom O'Hara was an experienced pilot with 11,000 hours as a pilot-in-\ncommand. He was active in the communities of Naknek and King Salmon \nwhere he grew up, flying children to Bible camp and coaching young \nwrestlers. Tom provided a strong link between the residents of Bristol \nBay and the National Park Service.\n  Although Tom O'Hara was a most valued employee of the National Park \nService, he did not enjoy the same status as National Park Service \nemployees with competitive career status. Tom was hired under a special \nhiring authority established under the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act, ANILCA, which permits land management agencies like \nthe National Park Service to hire, on a noncompetitive basis, Alaskans \nwho by reason of having lived or worked in or near public lands in \nAlaska, have special knowledge or expertise concerning the natural or \ncultural resources of public lands and the management thereof.\n  Tom O'Hara possessed this knowledge and offered it freely to the \nNational Park Service. But because he was hired under this special \nauthority, his opportunities for transfer and promotion within the Park \nService were limited, even though his service was exemplary.\n  As a lasting memorial to Tom O'Hara's exemplary career, I am \nintroducing legislation today that will grant competitive status to \nANILCA local hire employees who hold permanent appointments with the \nFederal land management agencies after the completion of 2 years of \nsatisfactory service. In Tom's honor, the short title of this \nlegislation is the Thomas P. O'Hara Public Land Career Opportunity Act \nof 2007.\n  It is my sincere hope that the enactment of this legislation will \nencourage other Alaskans, particularly Alaska Natives, to follow in Tom \nO'Hara's footsteps and seek lifelong careers with the Federal land \nmanagement agencies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1440\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Thomas P. O'Hara Public Land \n     Career Opportunity Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. COMPETITIVE STATUS FOR CERTAIN FEDERAL EMPLOYEES IN \n                   THE STATE OF ALASKA.\n\n       Section 1308 of the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3198) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections \n     (d) and (e), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:\n       ``(c) Competitive Status.--An individual appointed to a \n     permanent position under subsection (a) shall be converted to \n     competitive status after--\n       ``(1) if the appointment is full time, the completion of 2 \n     years of competitive and satisfactory full time service; or\n       ``(2) if the appointment is less than full time, the period \n     that is equivalent to 2 years of competitive and satisfactory \n     full time service.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 1435. A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \nincrease the capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in 1975, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nwas established, after the Arab oil embargo, to lessen the impact of \nfuture severe energy supply disruptions. Since 1975, the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, SPR, has served as our Nation's energy insurance \npolicy.\n  The legislation I offer today expands the capacity of the SPR from 1 \nbillion barrels, as authorized in the Energy Policy and Conservation \nAct, to 1.5 billion barrels.\n  Memorial day marks the beginning of the summer vacation season, and \nthis summer all of our constituents are facing escalating gasoline \nprices. Expanding our domestic supplies of oil, gas, and petroleum has \nbecome crucial.\n  Increasingly, internationally traded oil originates from unstable \nregions of the world. The United States' economic security is \nthreatened by vulnerability to disruptions in world oil supply and \nvolatile oil prices. The Nation's transportation sector, major \nindustries, and military are dependent upon petroleum, and so it is \ncrucial that we do what we can to minimize disruptions in the world oil \nsupply.\n  The existing inventory in the SPR represents only 56 days of net \nimports. The United States' obligation to the member countries of the \nInternational Energy Agency requires it to maintain the equivalent of \n90 days of net petroleum imports. Though the inclusion of private \ninventories allows the U.S. to satisfy the IEA obligation, increasing \nthe authorized capacity of the SPR to 1.5 billion barrels will help \nensure the United States meets its international obligations, \nregardless of commercial inventory trends.\n  In December of 2006, the Department of Energy chose the salt domes in \nRichton, Mississippi as their preferred site for the construction of a \nnew Strategic Petroleum Reserve facility to lead the expansion efforts. \nI am proud that Mississippi was chosen to lead the efforts of such an \nimportant program, and I know that the community of Richton, which \nsuffered in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, is thrilled to begin \nconstruction on a project that will strengthen its economic \ndevelopment. Current SPR sites in Texas and Louisiana will also gain \nreserves.\n  I urge the Senate to support this bill. The entire country's energy \nsecurity and stability depends on a combination of efforts to increase \ndomestic supplies of oil, gas, and petroleum. I am pleased that my \ncolleagues in the Senate are promoting new renewable energy \ntechnologies through legislation, and it is through a combination of \nthese efforts that we might finally reduce our dependence upon foreign \noil.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Obama, Mr. Brown, Mr. Reid, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Menendez, Mrs. Feinstein, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1437. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the semicentennial of the enactment of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of a bill \nthat directs the Treasury Department to mint 350,000 $1 coins marking \nthe semi-centennial of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 greatly expanded civil rights \nprotections by outlawing racial discrimination and segregation in \npublic places and places of public accommodation, in federally funded \nprograms and employment, and encouraging desegregation in public \nschools, and has served as a model for subsequent antidiscrimination \nlaws.\n  This landmark legislation once implemented, had effects that were far \nreaching and that, clearly from its inception to today, fundamentally \nchanged the course of our Nation.\n  Equality and access to education were two of the hallmarks of the \ncivil rights movement.\n  The United Negro College Fund, UNCF, is the Nation's largest, oldest, \nmost successful and comprehensive minority higher education assistance \norganization. UNCF provides operating funds and technology enhancement \nservices for 39 member historically black colleges and universities, \nHBCUs, scholarships and internships for students at about 900 \ninstitutions and faculty and administrative professional training.\n  Since its inception in 1943, the UNCF has raised more than $2 billion \nto help a total of more than 350,000 students attend college and has \ndistributed more funds to help minorities attend school than any entity \noutside of the government.\n  Besides being a noble tribute, this commemorative coin will assist \nthe UNCF provide scholarships and internships for minority students and \nassist\n\n[[Page S6403]]\n\nwith technology enhancement services for historically black colleges \nand universities.\n  In Michigan, the on-time graduation rate for African American \nstudents is less than half that of the overall rate for high school \nstudents. Moreover, the percentage of Michigan high school freshmen \nenrolling in college within 4 years is just 38 percent, the rate for \nthe top States is 53 percent. These statistics are astounding. Michigan \ncurrently is working to invest more State dollars into improving high \nschool education and reforming graduation requirements to some of the \nmost rigorous in the Nation. If we make scholarships like this one \navailable to students, and organizations like the UNCF helping African \nAmericans get into colleges and stay in colleges, not just historically \nblack colleges and universities, these statistics will improve. I am \nconfident this coin bill is a step toward improving the state of \ncollege attendance and graduation rates for African American students.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 1440. A bill to provide for judicial determination of injury in \ncertain cases involving dumped and subsidized merchandise imported into \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nthe Unfair Foreign Competition Act of 2007, legislation providing a \nprivate right of action for domestic manufacturers injured by the \nillegal subsidization and dumping of foreign products into U.S. \nmarkets. These unfair, and illegal, trade practices steal jobs from our \nworkers, profits from our companies, and economic growth from our \neconomy.\n  Dumping occurs when a foreign producer sells a product in the United \nStates at a price that is below that producer's sales price in its home \nmarket, or at a price that is lower than its cost of production. \nSubsidizing occurs when a foreign government provides financial \nassistance to benefit the production, manufacture, or exportation of a \ngood. Under current law, the International Trade Commission, ITC, and \nthe Department of Commerce conduct antidumping and countervailing duty \ninvestigations and 5-year reviews under title VII of the Tariff Act of \n1930. U.S. industries may petition the ITC and Commerce for relief from \ndumped and subsidized imports. If Commerce finds that an imported \nproduct is dumped or subsidized and the ITC finds that the petitioning \nU.S. industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury, \nan antidumping duty order or countervailing duty order will be imposed \nto offset the dumping or subsidies.\n  However, since current administrative remedies are not consistently \nand effectively enforced, I am introducing private right of action \nlegislation to enforce the law. My legislation allows petitioners to \nchoose between the ITC and their local U.S. district court for the \ninjury determination phase of their investigation. Doing so gives our \ninjured domestic producers the opportunity to display their vigor as \nprivate plaintiffs in seeking enforcement of our trade laws. If injury \nis found, U.S. Customs and Border Protection would then assess duties \non future importation of the article in question. The legal standard \nfor determining dumping margins which is established by the Commerce \nDepartment would remain unchanged.\n\n  I believe that introduction of this legislation will have an \nimportant deterrent effect on the practices of China and our other \ntrading partners. Aggressive policy measures such as this legislation \nare necessary to prevent China, in particular, from causing a major \ncrisis in the near future for our domestic steel industry. China has a \nwell-documented history of engaging in unfair trade practices, as \nevidenced by the 61 antidumping orders in place with respect to various \nproducts as of October 23, 2006. The statistics on China's steel output \nare staggering. In 2005, China made more steel than the next four \nlargest producers combined and data show that China continues to become \nmore export-oriented. Through the first 10 months of 2006, China's \nsteel tonnage exports to the U.S. market more than doubled over 2005. \nIn total, Chinese steel output grew 26 percent or more than 71 million \nmetric tons in 2005. The explosive growth of Chinese steel over the \npast decade would not have been possible without the support of the \nChinese Government.\n  This legislation is similar to legislation which I have introduced as \nfar back as 1982 where I originally sought injunctive relief. Since its \nlast introduction in the 106th Congress, several relevant statutes have \nbeen challenged at the World Trade Organization, WTO, prompting further \nmodification to its current form. In each case, the United States has \ntaken action to comply and avoid retaliatory actions by protesting WTO \nmember countries. The United States took action in December 2004 to \ncomply with WTO rulings on the Antidumping Act of 1916, which provided \na private cause of action and criminal penalties for dumping, by \nprospectively repealing the act. Also, the United States took action in \nFebruary 2006 to comply with WTO rulings on the Continued Dumping and \nSubsidy Offset Act, CDSOA, which required the distribution of collected \nantidumping and countervailing duties to petitioners and interested \nparties in the underlying trade proceedings. In both cases, the WTO \npanel found that U.S. law allowed an impermissible specific action \nagainst dumping and subsidization. The legislation I introduce today \nadapts to these changes in law and allows for a determination of injury \nin accordance with our international obligations.\n  We have too long sacrificed American industry and American jobs \nbecause the executive branch, whether it is a Democratic administration \nor a Republican administration, has made concessions for foreign policy \nand defense interests. For many years, foreign policy and defense \npolicy have superseded basic fairness on trade policy. I received a \ncomprehensive education on this subject back in 1984 when there was a \nfavorable ruling by the ITC for the American steel industry, but it was \nsubject to review by the President. At that time my colleague Senator \nHeinz and I visited every one of the Cabinet officers in an effort to \nget support to see to it that the International Trade Commission ruling \nin favor of the American steel industry was upheld. Then-Secretary of \nCommerce Malcolm Baldrige was favorable, and International Trade \nRepresentative Bill Brock was favorable. We received a favorable \nhearing in all quarters until we spoke with then-Secretary of State \nShultz and then-Secretary of Defense Weinberger who were absolutely \nopposed to the ITC ruling. President Reagan decided to overrule the \nITC, and U.S. trade policy and workers again took second place to \nforeign policy concerns.\n  I was reminded of this reality again in 2005 when I testified on \nbehalf of the domestic pipe and tube industry in a section 421 \nsafeguard case against China. This safeguard provision was inserted as \na protective measure when unique and permanent trade status was granted \nto China, a measure which I opposed. It seemed to me that based upon \nthe record that China had, that normal relations could not exist \nbecause they have a record of not observing the law. With these \nconcerns in mind, Congress inserted the section 421 safeguard \nprovision. The ITC agreed with the overwhelming evidence supporting the \nclaim that a surge of imports from China were creating a market \ndisruption. However, President Bush decided not to uphold the ITC's \nruling. Since that time, jobs in my state have been lost. The Section \n421 provision was included to provide protection for our domestic \nmanufacturing base. Yet, none of the five petitions previously filed \nhad been granted either. It is difficult to understand how safeguards \nfor situations where China's conduct is excessive and unfair could be \nignored, especially after giving special consideration by way of trade.\n  While it is my hope that the administration, whether Democrat or \nRepublican, would take a more objective look at trade remedies for our \ninjured domestic manufacturers, I introduce this legislation today to \nprovide a valuable tool for domestic industry. Strict enforcement of \nour trade laws is critical to ensuring that our domestic manufacturers \nhave a fair shot at competing with foreign steel. In the current \nenvironment, I believe that it is necessary\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\nfor an injured industry to have an opportunity to go into Federal court \nand seek reliable enforcement of America's trade laws, which are \ncurrently not being enforced adequately.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me now in supporting this legislation. I \nbelieve in free trade. But the essence of free trade is selling goods \nat a price equal to the cost of production and a reasonable profit. \nWhere you have dumping or subsidization, it is the antithesis of free \ntrade. The significant advances made by our manufacturers are \ninsufficient to compete in the face of illegal trade practices such as \ndumping and subsidies. Our steel industry is made up of some of the \nmost innovative, skilled, and efficient producers in the world. Our \nindustry can compete if the playing field is level, but if foreign \nexporters are not held accountable, and can freely undercut American \nproducers with dumped goods and government subsidies, the future of our \nsteel industry will be at risk.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1441. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to modify \nauthorities for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to accept new \napplications for grants for State home construction projects to \nauthorize the Secretary to award grants for construction of facilities \nused in non-institutional care programs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nmake, what I believe to be, vital and necessary changes to one of the \nmost successful Federal-State partnership programs in the Nation today. \nI am speaking of the State Veterans Home Program at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  For those of my colleagues who do not know very much about this great \nprogram, the Federal-State partnership known as the State Home Program \ndates back nearly 120 years. It was August 7, 1888, when a $100 check \nfrom the Federal government helped the State of Connecticut offset the \nfinancial burden of caring for aging Civil War veterans. Since that \ntime, of course, the program has greatly matured. And it has grown into \nthe largest institutional provider of long-term care services for our \nNation's aging veterans.\n  Today, the grant part of the program receives an annual appropriation \nof about $100 million. VA uses the money to pay for two-thirds of the \ncosts of constructing State home beds pursuant to applications \nsubmitted by the States. After a home is built, the State operates the \nnursing facility and maintains the property for the benefit of \nveterans. VA, in turn, pays a daily stipend to the State of \napproximately $60 for each veteran in the home. The States then support \nthe rest of the cost of care either by collecting some money from the \nveterans or through direct appropriation from the State legislature.\n  I realize that my description of this program may have some of my \ncolleagues scratching their heads trying to find out why I believe the \nprogram needs to change and modernize. Let me explain.\n\n  As many of you know, during the 107th Congress, I served as chairman \nof the Senate Special Committee on Aging. I did a lot of work on long-\nterm care issues and held many hearings on the topic. What I learned is \nthat there is a big shift across the country from the traditional \ninstitutional care to a less restrictive, family oriented, home and \ncommunity based approach to care.\n  When I became chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nI found that VA's system is strongly biased toward institutional care. \nWe spend most of our long-term care budget on institutional beds.\n  I realize that nursing homes are sometimes the best place for a sick, \naging person to be properly cared for. Therefore, clearly VA needs to \nprovide that service. But, let's face it. All of us would prefer that \nwe never end up in a nursing home. We would do everything within our \npower to remain in the comfort and safety of our homes and with our \nfamilies.\n  The interesting thing about our human desire to remain in our own \nhomes and out of nursing homes is that our human desire is also a \npositive financial desire. Noninstitutional long-term care services are \nmuch more cost-effective than care provided in an institutional \nsetting. Providing people with long-term care options and the \nopportunity to remain in their homes for as long as possible is exactly \nwhat my legislation is about.\n  There is an old saying that goes ``when all you have is a hammer, the \nwhole world looks like nails.'' Essentially what that means is, we use \nthe tools we have to solve whatever problem arises, even if a different \ntool might be more appropriate.\n  For nearly 120 years, with little exception, the only tool available \nthrough the State Veterans Home Program has been a bed: an \ninstitutional nursing home bed. So, whenever a veteran in a local \ncommunity has independent living challenges, the State home program has \na tool to help them: it has a bed. My Legislation would give the State \nhomes additional tools to offer our veterans.\n  My bill would establish a noninstitutional care State home grant \nprogram. The premise of the new program would be the same as the \ncurrent institutional program. States would submit an application to \nconstruct a building or renovate part of an existing state home to \noffer noninstitutional services to veterans. The State would have to \nprovide one-third of the cost for construction and then take ownership \nand operational responsibility for the building and the care after the \nfacility opens.\n  Similar to the payment structure today, VA would provide a daily \npayment for each veteran who receives services from the facility.\n  My legislation would also make some changes in the state home grant \nprogram that would help it transition into a more modern care delivery \nsystem.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, under the current program, States \nsubmit applications to VA to receive construction assistance. If the \nState can demonstrate that the project meets VA's requirements for \nquality; that its use will be primarily for veterans; and that the \nState has its one-third matching funds, then VA approves the project \nand places it on list according to a statutory priority.\n\n  My bill would create a 2-year window, starting with the date of \nenactment, for States to submit their new bed applications. Similarly, \nit would create a 2-year window for any State to come up with matching \nfunds for any approved application that currently lacks the required \nmatch. After the 2-year window, VA would be prohibited from accepting \nany new applications for new bed construction.\n  I believe the reason we need this change is simple. For fiscal year \n2007, there are $808 million in grant proposals on VA's approved list. \nApproximately $490 million in project proposals are in priority one \nstatus, meaning that the States have provided the required one-third \nmatching funds.\n  At the rate of $100 million per year provided by Congress to fund \nthese grants, it will take nearly 9 more years for Congress to fund all \nof the current projects on the list. That, of course, is assuming that \nno new projects will be added to it. And construction of all of those \nprojects would probably not be completed until about 15 years from now.\n  All of that may sound like long-term planning for future care needs. \nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, the Nation as a whole is moving away \nfrom institutionalizing the elderly.\n  Our aging years are supposed to be our golden years. We conjure up \nimages of sitting on a porch, sipping tea with our spouse of 50 plus \nyears watching the sun set. The reality, unfortunately, is that in many \ncases those years are spent separated from one another as one spouse is \nno longer able to fully care for the other. And the only option \navailable for assistance is institutionalization. We can do better. And \nthis bill will move us in that direction for our veterans.\n  I ask all of us to consider why we have a policy at VA that \nencourages spending nearly $1 billion building 5,300 more new beds in a \nsystem that already has about 20,000 beds when we as a nation are \ntrying to move in a direction that provides home and community based \ncare programs that keep the elderly in their homes and out of long-term \ncare institutions. I think VA and the States should change course for \nthe betterment of our Nation's heroes.\n  I believe that by phasing out the current institutional bias and \nfocusing the\n\n[[Page S6405]]\n\nenergy and finances of the program on noninstitutional alternatives, VA \nand the States will serve more veterans and keep those veterans in \ntheir homes, where they want to be, for a much longer time.\n  I realize that we will still probably fund 5 or 6 thousand more new \nbeds in the State home program just because of the 2-year window. But I \nrecognize that Senators and Representatives will strongly support the \ninstitutional grants so long as their State has an application pending. \nI do not blame the Members. I would do the same thing if Idaho had \nsubmitted an application. So, I want to give everyone's State a fair \nchance to participate in the program.\n  But, I also believe that we need to transition beyond beds. And if we \nfail to set out the transition soon, I believe we will find ourselves \n20 years from now undertaking a painful study on what to do with 15,000 \nempty nursing home beds in all of our States. Noninstitutional service \nis simply the direction of long-term care and health care today because \nfamilies want to be together and home is where they want to be.\n  VA's partnership with the States to provide long-term care to our \nNation's veterans is an unmitigated success. We must continue to \nsupport the 20,000 beds we currently have. And we will. They provide \nthe most compassionate, cost-effective institutional care in the \nNation. But, we also must modernize the program.\n  We must keep up with the trends in health care that are pointing us \nin the direction of home and community-based services and away from \ninstitutions. We must change to find a way to serve more veterans with \nthe same amount of resources. But, most importantly, we must modernize \nbecause it is the humane and right thing to do in responding to the \nwishes of our constituents to stay home in their later years and grow \nold with the people they love.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join in this effort by cosponsoring \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S.J. Res. 13. A joint resolution granting the consent of Congress to \nthe International Emergency Management Assistance Memorandum of \nUnderstanding; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a joint \nresolution that would grant the consent of Congress to the \nInternational Emergency Management Assistance Memorandum of \nUnderstanding, IEMAMOU compact. This joint resolution would formally \napprove of the IEMAMOU compact, a mutual emergency assistance agreement \nentered into by the New England States, including my home State of \nVermont and several Canadian Provinces, who are our neighbors to the \nnorth. This mutual assistance compact, which has been agreed to and \noperating in principle for more than 5 years, allows for cooperation \nbetween emergency responders in the United States and Canada during \nnatural disasters and other serious emergencies. This compact is an \nextraordinary example of the international cooperation and good will \nwhich makes our countries more secure and our citizens safer. Congress \nshould pass this joint resolution to give this vital compact the full \nforce of law.\n  We must all do our best to prepare for the most serious emergencies \nthat can harm our communities. These crises may arise from natural or \nmanmade disasters, or from technological hazards or civil emergencies. \nAs those who live in the Northeast know, extreme weather is not \nuncommon in New England, or in the eastern Provinces of Canada. \nTogether with our Canadian neighbors, we have endured catastrophic \nblizzards and ice storms over the years that have closed roads and \nhighways, shut down power for extended periods, and stranded travelers \nand rural residents for days, or longer. At times, we have also \nsuffered the misfortune of responding to serious accidents, such as \ntrain or plane crashes. Of course, our concerns for safety surrounding \nnuclear powerplants and other industrial sites warrants extensive \nplanning and preparedness for even the possibility of technological \ndisasters. During these events, we turn to our first responders and our \nemergency management professionals to provide assistance and secure \npublic safety no matter how grave the danger, and no matter how \nchallenging the task.\n  The IEMMOU compact was created in response to the devastating ice \nstorm of 1998. In January of that year, an unprecedented 3-day ice \nstorm paralyzed portions of the northern New England States and the \nadjacent Canadian Provinces causing massive damage to the electrical \nand transportation infrastructure. Millions were left in the dark for \ndays and even weeks, leaving more than 30 dead and shutting down normal \nactivities in large cities like Montreal and Ottawa. Following this \ndevastation, the governors and premiers of those regions affected \nrecognized the need for greater cross-border emergency cooperation, and \nthey directed their emergency management leaders to develop and create \na memorandum of understanding on these issues that benefit all parties \nnorth and south of the border. The IEMAMOU compact was the result of \nthis collaborative, international process, and now stands as a model \ncompact for cross-border mutual emergency assistance.\n  The compact allows for international sharing of resources and \nexpertise in times of extreme emergency or disaster. For example, rural \nStates, such as my own, may need to call upon specialized resources \nfound in other larger States or neighboring Provinces to respond \nimmediately to events, such as chemical disasters or mass transit \naccidents. With natural disasters, such as prolonged, severe winter \nstorms, the areas affected may be so vast, stretching across several \nStates or Provinces that no single jurisdiction alone could respond \nfully to the crisis. There are also events that occur along or near our \nborder with Canada which require the immediate response and full \ncooperation of States and Provinces in both nations. The IEMAMOU \ncompact meets these needs with a thoughtful and forward-looking outline \nof how to address issues that face first responders and their managers \nin times of cross-border emergency.\n  This international compact provides a legal framework for cooperation \nand mutual assistance between the States of Vermont, New Hampshire, \nMaine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and the Canadian \nProvinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, \nand Newfoundland and Labrador. The compact requires each participating \nmember, whether State or Province, to formulate plans and programs to \nfacilitate international and interstate or provincial cooperation in \ncase of natural or manmade disaster, technological hazard, or civil \nemergency. The compact also provides for the temporary suspension of \nstatutes or ordinances in each jurisdiction that may impede the \nimplementation of these plans. For example, under the compact, \ngovernment officials and law enforcement authorities from one member \nState or Province can officially work in other jurisdictions during \ntimes of emergency, a circumstance that would not be permitted \notherwise.\n  The compact also creates a formal mechanism for making assistance \nrequests from one state or province to another, and encourages frequent \nconsultation between the emergency management leaders to develop free \nexchange of information and resources across borders. In addition, the \ncompact provides a Good Samaritan provision, which gives liability \nprotection for emergency responders who act in good faith in providing \nassistance in a legal jurisdiction outside their own, and creates \nreciprocal workers compensation and other benefits to emergency \nresponders who may get injured in responding to an emergency under the \ncompact. Finally, the compact allows for reimbursement between members \nStates or Provinces for losses or damages incurred in responding under \nthe agreement.\n  All members of this compact have agreed to its terms and join in \nrequesting Congress's consent for the agreement. Vermont, New \nHampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut have \njoined the IEMAMOU compact, and many of these States have passed \nlegislation adopting the compact under State law. The Premiers of \nQuebec, Prince Edward Island, Labrador, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick \nhave similarly approved of the\n\n[[Page S6406]]\n\ncompact. The IEMAMOU compact has been functioning in principle for more \nthan 5 years, as the emergency management leaders from each member \nState and Province meet twice a year. Planning among the constituent \nmembers of the compact is also ongoing. This compact works well and \nshould be supported by Congress.\n\n  The IEMAMOU compact is an international agreement between States and \na foreign power, and it cannot have the full force of law without the \nformal approval of Congress. The U.S. Constitution requires that ``[n]o \nstate shall . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact with another \nState, or with a foreign Power'' unless with the ``consent of \nCongress.'' U.S. Const. Art. 1, Sec.  10, cl. 3. The joint resolution \nintroduced today provides this necessary consent, and would give legal \nforce to the compact. Congressional approval of this compact would also \nprovide jurisdiction for Federal courts to resolve any disputes under \nthe agreement.\n  This joint resolution is vitally important to the New England States \nand our Canadian Provinces to the north. Congress should support their \ncooperative, international leadership in creating and implementing this \nunique emergency management compact. The Governor of Vermont supports \nthis joint resolution as do the leaders of the North East States \nEmergency Consortium, which represents each of the New England States \nin the compact.\n  This is not the first time I have supported this joint resolution. In \n2001, this joint resolution was introduced by my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Robert Smith, and I joined him as a cosponsor along \nwith Senators Lieberman, Jeffords, Chafee, and Gregg. As Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, I moved the joint resolution through Committee \nwhere it passed by unanimous consent on October 31, 2001. With my \nsupport and that of other Senators, the joint resolution passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent on December 20, 2001, in the last month of \nthe Democratic majority in the 107 Congress. Unfortunately, the House \nnever came to consider the joint resolution, and it failed to become \nlaw. Since then, under the Republican leadership of the 108 and 109 \nCongresses, the joint resolution has only been introduced once and has \nnot moved beyond referral to committee.\n  It is time to take action and pass this joint resolution without \nfurther delay. The IEMAMOU compact provides invaluable international \ncooperation and mutual assistance in times of natural disaster and \nextreme emergency. This compact works well for New England and the \neastern Canadian provinces, and it stands as a model for emergency \nmanagement planning and cooperation across this country. It is a \ncrucial element of the security and safety planning for all communities \nin New England and eastern Canada, and we can wait no longer for it to \nbecome law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 13\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL CONSENT.\n\n       Congress consents to the International Emergency Management \n     Assistance Memorandum of Understanding entered into between \n     the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, \n     Rhode Island, and Connecticut and the Provinces of Quebec, \n     New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and \n     Newfoundland. The compact is substantially as follows:\n\n     ``ARTICLE I--INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE \n                   MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING PURPOSE AND \n                   AUTHORITIES\n\n       ``The International Emergency Management Assistance \n     Memorandum of Understanding, hereinafter referred to as the \n     `compact,' is made and entered into by and among such of the \n     jurisdictions as shall enact or adopt this compact, \n     hereinafter referred to as `party jurisdictions.'

Res. 211\n\n       Whereas, for several months, the President of Venezuela, \n     Hugo Chavez, has been announcing over various media that he \n     will not renew the current concession of the television \n     station ``Radio Caracas Television'', also known as RCTV, \n     which is set to expire on May 27, 2007, because of its \n     adherence to an editorial stance different from his way of \n     thinking;\n       Whereas President Chavez justifies this measure based on \n     the alleged role RCTV played in the unsuccessful \n     unconstitutional attempts in April 2002 to unseat President \n     Chavez, under circumstances where there exists no filed \n     complaint or judicial sentence that would sustain such a \n     charge, nor any legal sanction against RCTV that would \n     prevent the renewal of its concession, as provided for under \n     Venezuelan law;\n       Whereas the refusal to renew the concession of any \n     television or radio broadcasting station that complies with \n     legal regulations in the matter of telecommunications \n     constitutes a transgression against the freedom of thought \n     and expression, which is prohibited by Article 13 of the \n     American Convention on Human Rights, signed at San Jose, \n     Costa Rica, July 18, 1978, which has been signed by the \n     United States;\n       Whereas that convention establishes that ``the right of \n     expression may not be restricted by indirect methods or \n     means, such as the abuse of government or private controls \n     over newsprint, radio broadcasting frequencies, or equipment \n     used in the dissemination of information, or by any other \n     means tending to impede the communication and circulation of \n     ideas and opinions'';\n       Whereas the Inter-American Declaration of Principles on \n     Freedom of Expression, approved by the Inter-American \n     Commission on Human Rights, states in Principle 13,\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\n     ``The exercise of power and the use of public funds by the \n     state, the granting of customs duty privileges, the arbitrary \n     and discriminatory placement of official advertising and \n     government loans; the concession of radio and television \n     broadcast frequencies, among others, with the intent to put \n     pressure on and punish or reward and provide privileges to \n     social communicators and communications media because of the \n     opinions they express threaten freedom of expression, and \n     must be explicitly prohibited by law. The means of \n     communication have the right to carry out their role in an \n     independent manner. Direct or indirect pressures exerted upon \n     journalists or other social communicators to stifle the \n     dissemination of information are incompatible with freedom of \n     expression.'';\n       Whereas, according to the principles of the American \n     Convention on Human Rights and the Inter-American Declaration \n     of Principles on Freedom of Expression, to both of which \n     Venezuela is a party, the decision not to renew the \n     concession of the television station RCTV is an assault \n     against freedom of thought and expression and cannot be \n     accepted by democratic countries, especially by those in \n     North America who are signatories to the American Convention \n     on Human Rights;\n       Whereas the most paradoxical aspect of the decision by \n     President Chavez is that it strongly conflicts with two \n     principles from the Liberator Simon Bolivar's thinking, \n     principles President Chavez says inspire him, which state \n     that ``[p]ublic opinion is the most sacred of objects, it \n     needs the protection of an enlightened government which knows \n     that opinion is the fountain of the most important of \n     events,'' and that ``[t]he right to express one's thoughts \n     and opinions, by word, by writing or by any other means, is \n     the first and most worthy asset mankind has in society. The \n     law itself will never be able to prohibit it.''; and\n       Whereas the United States should raise its concerns about \n     these and other serious restrictions on freedoms of thought \n     and expression being imposed by the Government of Venezuela \n     before the Organization of American States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its profound concern about the transgression \n     against freedom of thought and expression that is being \n     attempted and committed in Venezuela by the refusal of the \n     President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, to renew the concession \n     of the television station ``Radio Caracas Television'' (RCTV) \n     merely because of its adherence to an editorial and \n     informational stance distinct from the thinking of the \n     Government of Venezuela; and\n       (2) strongly encourages the Organization of American States \n     to respond appropriately, with full consideration of the \n     necessary institutional instruments, to such transgression.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/21/senate-section/article/S6408-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 212--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE RELATING TO \n                   LEGISLATION TO CURB GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works:\n\n                              S.
