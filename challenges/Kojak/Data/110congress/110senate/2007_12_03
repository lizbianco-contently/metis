President Bush spoke from the Rose Garden this morning. It \nis hard to comprehend his words, the President of the United States \ngoing to the Rose Garden today, saying he wanted us to use the time \nleft in this congressional year to ``support our troops, and to protect \nour citizens, prevent harmful tax increases. . . .'' He also indicated, \nin that same brief statement, that we as a Congress had little to show \nfor our having been in a year.\n  We passed a budget, the first one in 3 years. It was a balanced \nbudget we passed. We implemented--even though they were years and years \noverdue--the 9/11 Commission recommendations. We passed Homeland \nSecurity funding. We passed a pay raise for our troops--we\n\n[[Page S14672]]\n\nhave consistently equipped our troops with programs and materials that \nthe President did not ask for but we believe the troops needed, and \ntime has proven they were needed. We provided health care for wounded \nsoldiers and veterans. We set benchmarks for Iraq. We focused on the \nneglected National Guard, and I am glad we did that. We passed ethics \nand lobbying reform. We passed a CR that has funded the Government and \nwill to the end of this year. We shortly will be doing an energy bill. \nWe passed one here, but we hope to have one that will be a bipartisan \nbill that we will pass here by the end of the year. We completed a \nminimum wage bill that was 10 years past due. We passed the American \nCompetitiveness Act. We passed a higher education bill, the most \nsignificant piece of legislation since the GI bill of rights, dealing \nwith higher education. We also passed the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Funding Act, which was long past due. We funded Head Start, \nstem cell research--the President vetoed that but we passed it; very \nimportant legislation. We passed SCHIP, the children's health insurance \nprogram. The President vetoed that. We passed FDA reauthorization, \nCoast Guard revitalization, the Corps of Engineers reform, which was \nlong overdue, disaster assistance for small businesses. We have \ncertainly done good work regarding disaster assistance for farmers, \nwhich was also long overdue--3 years past due. With the scandal that \noccurred in the Attorney General's Office, we were able to focus on the \nU.S. attorneys and change the law in that regard.\n\n  These are just a few of the things we have done, but we feel good \nthat we have done them. The President should not demean what we have \ndone here. These are pieces of legislation, some of which he signed. We \nwant to work with the President and we have tried to work with the \nPresident, but the end of this administration, the Bush administration, \nis fast approaching. Frankly, if he wants to talk about \naccomplishments, for 1 year of the Democratic-led Congress compared to \nhis 7 years of the Republican-led Presidency, the comparison is quite \nstark. He has, to show for what he has done, an endless war that we \nhave been involved in, which soon will be in its sixth year, an ever \nshrinking middle class, and a budget gone from record surpluses to \nrecord deficits.\n  President Bush calls on Congress to ``support our troops,'' and we \nhave done that. But it is the President who has stretched our military \nnearly to its breaking point. Editorials in today's newspapers \ncertainly indicate how we are failing in supplying our military with \nmaterials they need, the equipment they need to maintain their \nreadiness. It is this President who has kept our troops abroad for two, \nthree, and four tours of duty. Some have served five tours of duty. A \nwar, I repeat, soon to be in its sixth year, a war that General \nPetraeus has said cannot be won militarily, and we are getting no help \nfrom the Iraqis to get their house in order politically.\n  It is the President who has sent our troops into battle without \nproper protection and neglected our veterans' care when they returned \nhome. I repeat, it was this Democratic Congress that provided funds for \nbody armor, voted for a troop pay increase, provided funds to fix the \nneglect at Walter Reed and other military health facilities so our \ntroops can get the care they need when they return from combat.\n  President Bush calls on Congress to ``protect our citizens,'' but it \nis President Bush who has failed to capture bin Laden, who taunts us \nwith new videos and new threats often. It is this President who allowed \nal-Qaida to regroup and become stronger than ever. It is this President \nwho has consistently underfunded the homeland security priorities that \nkeep us safer in our cities and towns. And it was this Congress that \nfinally implemented the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, so long \nignored by the President and his Republican enablers, which helped \nsecure our most at-risk cities, gives our first responders the \ncommunications tools they need in an emergency, and improves oversight \nof our intelligence and homeland security systems.\n  President Bush calls on Congress to ``prevent harmful tax increases \nand responsibly to fund our Government,'' but it is President Bush's \nreckless fiscal irresponsibility which is growing the national debt at \nan astounding rate of $1 million per minute, for a total increase of \nmore than $3 trillion on his watch.\n  President Clinton was actually paying down the debt by a half \ntrillion dollars. In the last 3 years he was in office, we were \nspending less money than we were taking in. But it is this President \nwho has increased our debt to foreign governments by more than all \nformer Presidents combined. In the 230 years we have been a country, \nall the Presidents combined did not increase the debt like this \nPresident has done. He has increased our debt to foreign governments by \nmore than all former Presidents combined, but it is this President who \nhas stuck this bill for his failed policies squarely on the shoulders \nof our children and grandchildren. Every person in this country--a baby \nof 1 day, a person of 100 years old--owes $30,000 to make up this \nalmost $10 trillion debt that is fast approaching.\n  It is this Democratic Congress that has put working families first, \nwith the first increase in minimum wage in a decade to give hard-\nworking but least paid Americans a little more to help ends meet. \nRemember, the minimum wage affects a lot of people. It is not kids \nflipping hamburgers at McDonald's. For 60 percent of the people who \ndraw minimum wage, that is the only money they get for their families. \nThe vast majority of people on minimum wage are women who work.\n  It is this Democratic Congress which provided health insurance to \nmillions of more low-income children with the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. The President vetoed this. President Bush's veto \nwill cut 5.5 million children off the ability to go to the doctor when \nthey are sick--5.5 million. We wound up with 10. Even if we extend the \npresent bill, we will lose 5.5 million children and wind up with 4.5 \ninstead of 10.\n  It is this Democratic Congress that made investments in Head Start \nand student financial aid so that all children, regardless of the \nwealth of their parents, can get started on the right track and have an \nopportunity to go to college.\n  Unlike Bush, we paid for our priorities in a responsible way. We have \na pay-go system. If we increase a program, change a program in a way \nthat costs money, we pay for it.\n  This President and his allies in Congress have led the American \npeople down a very dark path. This Democratic Congress, in its first \nyear, has made America stronger, safer, and more prosperous. But with \nPresident Bush and the Republicans fighting us, a record number of \nfilibusters--57--with empty rhetoric, obstruction and vetoes, we still \nhave a lot of work to do--and that is an understatement. In this final \nwork period of the year, our plate is full. We have to return our focus \nto finally ending the war in Iraq that has cost our troops and country \nso dearly.\n  Here I wish to cite a statement from a Republican running for \nPresident. Here is what he said: Everything is much worse if we stay in \nIraq. Right now they are very content to bleed us in Iraq, bleed us \nfinancially and by killing Americans. We lose lives. If we spend money \nwe don't have, it furthers our financial crisis. The longer we are \nthere, the stronger al-Qaida gets. Our being there is the greatest \nincentive conceivable to help Osama bin Laden. The evidence is very \nclear that there is more al-Qaida than before, which means we are in \ngreater danger of being hit by terrorists than before. Besides, who are \nall these people telling us there will be a problem if we leave? The \nsame ones who said it would be a cakewalk. What kind of credibility do \nthey have?\n  I repeat, this is a Republican, not a Democrat.\n  We want to take up the House-passed bill that provides $50 billion in \nemergency funds to our troops and requires the President to transition \nthe mission from combat operations to security, training, and \nantiterrorism.\n  Over the Thanksgiving holiday, we began to hear the rumblings of what \nis sure to be an outrageous line of attack from the Bush White House. \nThe week we left here, Secretary Gates told us that the Army had enough \nmoney--with the $460 billion bill we just\n\n[[Page S14673]]\n\npassed--had enough money to fund them until the 1st of March; the \nMarines until the middle of March. That is what Secretary Gates told \nus. But the spin machine of the White House is trying to overrule what \nthe Secretary of Defense told us, saying we are going to have to lay \npeople off, there is not enough money for mine detection equipment and \nthings of that nature.\n  That is totally contrary to what the Secretary of Defense said. This \nSecretary of Defense has credibility compared to his predecessor\n  Secretary Gates has credibility. That is what he told us: The Army is \nOK until the first of March; the Marines are OK until the middle of \nMarch.\n  But over Thanksgiving, we get rumblings from the spin machine at the \nWhite House. The President is saying: We are not sending money to the \ntroops. This is not true. It is cynical politics at its worst. The \nAmerican people are too smart to fall for this. Facts are clear. We \njust passed nearly a half-trillion-dollar Defense appropriations bill. \nThe Department of Defense is fully funded.\n  Before the holiday we offered another $50 billion funding package on \ntop of the $460 billion to support our troops in combat, provided he \nheed the call of the American people and change course. The President \nand his supporters in Congress, which are all Republicans with rare \nexception, rejected that package.\n  The President said no to funding his own war unless he is given a \nblank check to continue his failed policies. Nevadans and the American \npeople know the current course has not brought the political \nreconciliation the President promised.\n  They realize it makes no sense for President Bush to blame Democrats \nbecause he rejected the funding package that we offered. This week we \nwill try again to give the President the opportunity to accept troop \nfunding. We will try to return to the House-passed bill. We will give \nour Republican colleagues another opportunity to stand on the side of \nour troops in battle by passing legislation that contains additional \nfunding and provides a strategy to bring the war to a responsible end.\n  Iraq is just one of the many funding priorities we must pass in the \nweeks ahead. We have to deal with the appropriations bills, in large \npart because the President has been stubborn and unreasonable. Rather \nthan work with us to resolve the differences that amount to less than 1 \npercent of our budget, the President threatened to veto every \nappropriations bill before it was even written.\n  We have offered to compromise with President Bush to split the \ndifference. No. So far it does not appear the President is ready to do \nthe right thing for the American people by accepting compromise.\n  But I hope Senate Republicans will act more responsibly. We have to \ndo something about the AMT. According to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, 19 million American families and 150,000 Nevadans will be \nforced to pay the AMT next spring if we do not take action before the \nyear is out.\n  Before Thanksgiving, the House passed AMT relief. After their vote, I \noffered a consent agreement to hold three votes: one on the House AMT \nrelief bill, one on Senator Lott's amendment to repeal the AMT, and one \non an amendment by Senator Baucus to fund it. Unfortunately, our \nRepublican colleagues blocked these three votes. Despite the \nPresident's warning to them that we must move quickly on AMT, they \nchose to follow obstructionism. I cannot emphasize enough how important \nit is to move forward on this legislation. I hope the Republicans will \nend their obstruction on this vital tax relief so we can move to a \nvote. If they do not, I will have no choice but to file cloture so we \ncan move to vote on the House bill. That is exactly what I will do.\n  In the coming days, we will have to turn to FISA, the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. Earlier this year, the President signed \na flawed temporary law on this subject that will expire in early \nFebruary. Both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees have reported \na bill that improves current law. The House has passed its own version. \nThe full Senate must debate this matter in December to allow sufficient \ntime for negotiations with the House before the February deadline.\n  We need to give our intelligence professionals all the necessary \ntools, while at the same time protecting the privacy of law-abiding \nAmericans and following our Constitution. Vigorous intelligence \ngathering should be accompanied by meaningful judicial review and \nstrong congressional oversight. FISA struck a balance well for 30 \nyears, and now we can make it even more effective. Both of these Senate \ncommittees have worked together in a bipartisan manner. Chairman \nRockefeller and Ranking Member Bond, along with Chairman Leahy and \nRanking Member Specter, are sorting through differences in the work of \ntheir two committees. I hope under the leadership of those four \nSenators we will pass a bill that strikes the right balance and makes \nour country safer.\n  Later this work period, we will move to finish work on the Energy \nbill. In June, this Senate overwhelmingly passed a landmark Energy bill \nto improve fuel efficiency and invest in renewable fuel technology. \nThis bill would save Americans lots and lots of money at the gas pump \nand on their heating bills.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans would not allow us to go to conference on \nthis bill. We continue to work toward a bipartisan resolution so we can \nsend a strong Energy bill to the President's desk before the year is \nup.\n  We will also attempt to turn again to the farm bill. Prior to the \nholiday, we were unable to complete action on the farm bill because of \nthe overwhelming number of amendments filed, many of which had nothing \nto do with farming. Senator McConnell and I are working through these \namendments to come up with a reasonable list.\n  While we have been on the Thanksgiving Day break, staff has been \nworking, and I think we are at a point where we should be able to do a \nfarm bill by unanimous consent.\n  I have outlined seven major legislative initiatives that we must \naddress before the 2007 legislative calendar draws to a close. We need \nto do this for the American people. It is reasonable and necessary. We \nbegan this year with great success. We have restored integrity to \nCongress. We put working families first. We put teeth behind homeland \nsecurity and veterans care. But a funny and unfortunate thing happened \nnext. The President and his Republican supporters in the Senate \ndetermined that while bipartisanship made good policy, obstruction made \nbetter politics.\n  For the past many months, we have seen an unprecedented level of \nobstructionism. That is not rhetoric, it is fact. We have sought more \nthan 40 votes to change the course in Iraq. More often than not, a \nbipartisan majority of the House and Senate supported these votes. \nNevertheless, again and again, the Republican leadership blocked these \nvotes from taking place.\n  Most recently, Republicans blocked the Transportation/HUD \nappropriations bill, which invests in our crumbling roads, bridges, \ndams, tunnels, and our infrastructure. They blocked progress on the \nEnergy bill which would reduce the ever-increasing costs the American \npeople pay to heat their homes and fill their gas tanks.\n\n  They blocked the farm bill, which would stabilize the Nation's food \nsupply and improve the nutrition of our children. They blocked the FHA \nModernization Act, which would have helped families heat their homes in \nthe face of the ongoing mortgage crisis.\n  In all, Republicans have now blocked the priorities of Americans by \nforcing 56 cloture votes, fast approaching the all-time record of 61, \nthat took a full 2-year session. That was too many. But 56, not even \nhalfway through, is significantly headed in the wrong direction. They \nhave already neared an all-time, 2-year obstruction record in less than \na year. That would be like a ball player hitting 73 home runs by the \nAll-Star break. That is not good. This is not normal obstruction. This \nis obstruction on steroids.\n  It is not too late for the Republicans to change course and work with \nus. I find it hard to believe that Republicans truly oppose the AMT \nfix, FHA reform, infrastructure investments, and childhood nutrition. I \nhope my friends on the other side of the aisle believe they stand to \ngain politically by getting the most done for our country, not the \nleast done for our country.\n  But I hope in what little time we have left this year, with so much \nleft\n\n[[Page S14674]]\n\nto accomplish, the march toward the obstructionism record can be cast \naside. And when we recess for the year in a few weeks, I hope we can \nadd meaningfully to the bipartisan change that we have begun to deliver \nthis year. This can only happen if the Republicans decide to work with \nus for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14674-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14674-S14676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          UNFINISHED BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are now in the final days of this \nsession, and congressional Democrats have left an enormous amount of \nwork undone. As we move into the final stretch, let's take stock of the \nunfinished business. On spending, we are 2 full months into fiscal \n2008, and our friends across the aisle are still staring at 11 \nunfinished spending bills out of the 12 they were supposed to do. We \nneed to work together to get those overdue spending bills signed into \nlaw.\n  On troop funding, thousands of American families will have sons and \ndaughters fighting overseas this Christmas, and under the Constitution \nthat falls on us to provide for them. We may disagree about the \nmission, but no one should disagree about getting those courageous men \nand women everything they need while they are fighting in the field. \nCongressional Democrats need to get serious about the troops and get \nthem the funds they need without any more games and without any further \ndelay.\n  We have heard some remarkable reports from Iraq in recent weeks. \nSunni tribes and other militants who turned against al-Qaida are now \nworking with coalition forces to secure Iraqi neighborhoods and towns. \nRefugees are returning to Iraq in droves. Shops are reopening, curfews \nare being relaxed. Al-Qaida in Iraq, we are told, has been pushed to \nthe brink.\n  Americans like what they have heard, and even some congressional \nDemocrats have acknowledged the positive reports. Congressman Murtha, a \nhero of the antiwar left, says the new strategy is a success. \nCongressman Dicks talked about a new feeling of normalcy in Iraq. \nThanks to the increase in U.S. forces and a smart new strategy, we have \nseen a stunning reversal.\n  Unfortunately, talk of congratulations is scarce among the antiwar \nleft. Rather than stop for a minute to acknowledge what we are hearing \nfrom the field, our friends on the other side now seem to be looking \naround for something that is not going well so they can blame that on \nRepublicans.\n  According to press reports, they have settled on gas prices. And we \ndo need to do something to lower energy costs. But the bill our \nDemocratic friends are reportedly about to bring to the floor will not \ndo that. In fact, the bill they are discussing would actually increase \ngas prices at the pump and electricity bills in States that do not have \nan abundance of windmills. An energy bill that raises the cost of \nenergy is not what we need today.\n  Frankly, I am baffled by the congressional Democrats' position on the \nwhole troop funding debate. Earlier in the year, they said sending more \ntroops to Iraq would lead to failure. Then they approved the funds \nanyway. Now they say things are going well, and they want to cut off \nthe funds that are needed to finish the job. So they funded the war \nwhen they thought it would fail, and now they want to defund it when \nthey think it is succeeding.\n  Does this make any sense at all? Reasonable people could be able to \nagree that now is not the time to talk about walking away from our \ntroops in Iraq. Yet this is exactly what Democrats are planning to do.\n  The senior Senator from Massachusetts has said he thinks the \nDemocrats have an obligation, an obligation to cut off funds for the \nwar. And now they are apparently following through with it. Just in \ntime for the holidays, they are forcing the Pentagon to prepare pink \nslips for more than 250,000 employees as a way of getting around the \nthreat.\n  I would urge the majority to rethink its position, to keep its word, \nand to send our troops the funds they need to finish their mission and \nreturn home in success. We have a solemn obligation to assure America's \nmilitary families that their sons and daughters will get whatever they \nneed. Let's not break that trust at this moment of optimism and hope \nand good news from the field at a time when even Congressman Murtha \nsays the surge is working.\n  Congressional Democrats need to get serious about security at home \ntoo. It is no accident that we have not been hit here since 9/11. We \npassed the PATRIOT Act, set up the Department of Homeland Security, and \nmade sure intelligence agents would have the tools they need to do \ntheir jobs.\n  One of those tools is the Protect America Act that we passed in \nAugust and expires on February 1. This essential terror-fighting tool \nrecognizes that we need to be able to monitor terrorists overseas. And \nhowever the Senate deals with its expiration, we must protect its core \nstrengths. But Democrats on the Judiciary Committee seem to disagree. \nThey just voted for a revised version of this law that weakens it in \ndangerous ways. The experts tell us that under this new version, the \nJudiciary Committee version, U.S. commanders could be blocked from \ngathering critical intelligence on foreign targets.\n  Imagine: An American commander prepares to attack a city such as \nFallujah. He gives orders for a blanket surveillance of the city to \npinpoint terrorist activity. Then the lawyers step in and say: Sir, you \ncannot do that. You need to go to the FISA Court first.\n  Well, this is one vision of how to fight the war on terror. \nRepublicans have a different view. We think we need to stop foreign \nterrorists who want to kill innocent Americans, not be paralyzed into \ninaction over their search and seizure rights.\n  Republicans are ready to support the bipartisan, commonsense Senate \nIntelligence Committee bill. In addition to allowing our commanders \ngreater freedoms in the field, this version recognizes that telecom \ncompanies should not be sued for doing their patriotic duty in helping \nintelligence officials to protect American lives.\n  It also recognizes if these companies are exposed to lawsuits, \ntaxpayers should not have to foot the bill, which is exactly what \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee are proposing. They want to make \nsure the trial lawyers are happy one way or another. We need to protect \nthe telecom companies that did their duty and the taxpayers, not the \ntrial lawyers, who want to bring these lawsuits.\n\n  Congressional Democrats have neglected their duty on the 12 spending \nbills. They are threatening to neglect their duty to the troops in the \nfield and to our security at home. Now they are about to slap millions \nof Americans with a middle-class tax hike better known as the AMT.\n  Well, the American people have a right to know how Democrats found \nthe time for 63 Iraq votes over the course of the past year, some of \nthem at midnight, but somehow couldn't find an afternoon to fix a \nmistake in the Tax Code that is about to hit 50 million households. It \nis not as if they didn't see it coming. They have known about the \nproblem all year. Treasury Secretary Paulson reminded us of its urgency \nin October. He sent us a letter, dated October 23, reminding us that \nthe problem was before us. He warned that if Congress didn't act by \nearly last month, about 25 million households would get mistakenly \nwhacked with a major tax hike. He said if we didn't act by the middle \nof this month, 50 million would face delays in getting their refunds. \nEven if we acted today, millions of tax returns will still be delayed. \nWe have already inconvenienced millions of American taxpayers by \ninaction.\n  The IRS oversight chairman reminded us about the problem again last \nmonth, saying the longer we wait, the longer the refund delays would \nbe. Here is a letter from the IRS, dated November 26. This is a tax \nnone of these people were ever intended to pay. Originally targeted at \nfewer than 200 families, it was never indexed for inflation. It is a \nmistake that has never been permanently fixed, and Republicans are not \nabout to let Democrats impose a\n\n[[Page S14675]]\n\nnew tax on a lot of other taxpayers to pay for its correction. \nAmericans don't need to be giving Government an interest-free loan in \nApril by letting the IRS hold on to their refunds. They need to get \ntheir refunds when they expect them. We need to fix the AMT without new \ntaxes, and we need to do it now. The number of families affected is \nstaggering: Democratic foot dragging on the AMT threatens 1.6 million \ntaxpayers in New Jersey, more than 3 million in New York, and nearly \n4.5 million in California. That is more people in California alone than \nwe have in my State. We need to block this giant middle-class tax hike \nnow before voters get stuck with it in April.\n  Senate Democrats need to act on executive nominations, including \nnominees to head the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department \nof Agriculture. The Judiciary Committee needs to do a much better job \nprocessing circuit court nominations. Christmas will be here before we \nknow it, and we have only had one hearing--one--on one circuit court \nnomination since the summer recess. We have only had five hearings for \nfive circuit court nominees the entire year of 2007. During a \ncomparable period in President Clinton's last Congress, the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate held hearings on 10 of President Clinton's circuit \ncourt nominees, including five after the August recess.\n  We have had qualified circuit court nominees up here for months who \nsatisfy the supposed criteria of the Democratic majority. There is no \ngood reason for the Judiciary Committee to bring progress on circuit \ncourt nominations to a standstill. It is time our colleagues on the \nother side acted on nominations and on the other legislative duties I \nhave listed.\n  They have spent nearly a year now focusing on politics rather than \nessentials. Now they are trying to distract the public by shifting the \nfocus at the finish line. We need to pass the bills that keep the \nGovernment functioning. We need to stop taxes from being raised on the \nmiddle class. We need to strengthen the laws that help us catch \nterrorists before they strike, and we need to fund the troops in the \nfield.\n  It is now December, the last month of the year. Senate Democrats have \nmore to do in these last few weeks than they have already done all \nyear. It is time to stop the political show. It is time to focus for \nonce on the fundamentals.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate begins its final work period \nof the year, I wish to thank those members of the Judiciary Committee \nwho have been cooperative and who have worked so hard throughout this \nyear. Much has been accomplished. But much can still be done. We \nreported and the Senate passed an important privacy measure, the \nIdentity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act, S. 2168, just before \nthe Thanksgiving recess. I urge the House to adopt it without delay. In \naddition, the Senate again passed our copyright bill to protect vessel \nhull designs, S. 1640, which I hope will also be adopted by the House.\n  Months ago we reported and passed an important court security bill, \nS. 378, and Freedom of Information Act reform legislation, S. 849. I \nbelieve that we have resolved differences raised by the House and \nshould be able in the short time remaining to us this year to have the \nSenate reconsider these measures in slightly modified form, pass them \nby unanimous consent, and have the House endorse them, as well.\n  I would like to see us consider and pass important matters the House \nhas passed and sent to us. The Free Flow of Information Act, H.R. 2102, \nis on the Senate calendar. It would provide protection to first \namendment values by establishing a Federal privilege and procedure for \nconsidering claims of press protection. For the first time, this year \nthe Judiciary Committee reported a similar bill, S. 2035, and we did so \non a bipartisan basis. We should proceed to enact this legislation into \nlaw.\n  Another important matter sent to us from the House that I would hope \nwe could enact before adjourning this year is one on which we have \nworked for some time, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, H.R. 3685. \nWe also have before us a House-passed version of the Second Chance Act, \nH.R. 1593. While it does not include every provision I would have liked \nto incorporate, we should nonetheless proceed to enact this \nlegislation.\n  I urge the Republican Senator who has a hold on the bill to extend \ntemporary judgeships around the country, S. 1327, to remove this hold \nso that we can provide the relief needed in our Federal judiciary in \nKansas, Ohio, Nebraska, California, and Hawaii. Enacting court security \nlegislation will likewise require the relinquishing of a Republican \nhold. Another matter stalled since this summer by a Republican hold has \nbeen the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, S. 535. I have \nmade statements to the Senate about these consensus measures before. I \nhope that with the year rapidly ending, the Republican Senator holding \nup these worthwhile matters will reconsider the opposition and allow \nbills supported by an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of the Senate \nto pass.\n  A number of other measures reported by the Judiciary Committee have \nbeen delayed by Republican holds too. If it is not possible to move \nthese measures this month, I urge the Senate to take up and pass these \nbills when it begins its second session in January. One such bill is \nthe War Profiteering Prevention Act, S. 119, which was reported by \nthe committee in April. It would provide a significant new tool for \nFederal law enforcement to combat the scourge of war profiteering, and \nit is needed now more than ever, given the ongoing reports of rampant \nfraud, waste, and abuse in Iraq. Another is the School Safety and Law \nEnforcement Improvements Act, S. 2084, which we developed in response \nto the tragedy at Virginia Tech.\n\n  When we return next year, we will have the opportunity to consider \nand enact patent reform legislation, the Leahy-Hatch Patent Reform Act \nof 2007, S. 1145. I hope that we will also make time to consider our \ncomprehensive bipartisan data privacy bill, the Leahy-Specter Data \nPrivacy and Security Act, S. 495, which we reported in May.\n  Next spring I hope we can turn to the Deceptive Practices and Voter \nIntimidation Prevention Act, S. 453, which the committee reported this \nfall, and our bipartisan Leahy-Cornyn Public Corruption Prosecution \nImprovements Act, S. 1946, that adds teeth to our ethics reforms.\n  These are just some of the matters on which the Judiciary Committee \nhas been hard at work this year. We could not have accomplished what we \nhave without the contributions of our members. I want, in particular, \nto commend our newest members, Senators Cardin and Whitehouse, for \ntheir exceptional work. They have initiated legislative efforts, \nchaired important hearings, and been full partners in the work of the \ncommittee.\n  I would also like to thank and commend Senator Durbin for chairing \nour newest subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, \nand for making it one of the most active and productive subcommittees \nwe have. Senator Durbin has originated genocide accountability and \nchild soldier accountability legislation, trafficking in persons \nlegislation, and war crimes legislation, all in rapid succession. He \nhas made the Human Rights Subcommittee into what we hoped it would be, \na vehicle to focus our attention on fundamental aspects of what makes \nus all Americans. We all owe him a debt of gratitude.\n  Of course, we would not be nearly as far along in our work without \nthe help of our Republican members, led by Senator Specter. We have \nproceeded with significant bipartisan legislation on privacy, press \nshield, patents, FOIA, public corruption, and crime. Currently we are \nworking together to improve the FISA legislation about to be considered \nby the Senate by exploring whether we can adopt an amendment that will \nincrease accountability through the procedural device of substitution, \nrather than a blanket grant of retroactive immunity for the warrantless \nwiretapping of Americans that took place from 2001 through 2007. \nSenator Specter and I joined to seek to restore the great writ of \nhabeas corpus but, despite support by a majority of the Senate, we were \nstymied by a Republican filibuster. Likewise, we have joined to achieve \nmajority support for voting rights for the District of Columbia only to \nbe blocked this year by another Republican filibuster.\n  I hope that as we enter these last few weeks of the year, we are \nallowed to\n\n[[Page S14676]]\n\nmake progress on the matters I have outlined here today and that the \nobstruction that has stalled our further progress will not be \ncontinued. Let us move forward together in the best interest of the \nAmerican people. Any Senator can prevent action on an item in these \nwaning days of the session. There is no secret or magic about that. The \nquestion for Senators this month is whether they are willing to put \naside minor differences and partisan agendas to join with us in making \nprogress and moving forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14676-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened with interest to my friend \nfrom Kentucky comment about my statement on Iraq and the importance of \ndisengagement with the withdrawal of American troops. I don't intend to \nrestate my positions on the war this afternoon. I came to the floor to \naddress another issue. But I will point out that one of the best votes \nI have cast in the Senate was in opposition to the resolution, \nsupported by the Senator from Kentucky, that took us into Iraq, where \nAmerican forces have been fighting for a longer time than all of World \nWar II and where we see the continued loss of American lives--some 37 \nAmerican lives lost last month--and billions in taxpayer dollars \nflooding into the sands of Iraq. Still, there is not the reconciliation \nby the Iraqi political leadership to develop some kind of Government \nthat could be the basis for independence in the future. As our brave \nmen and women are fighting gallantly and with great valor there, they \nare entitled to a policy that is worthy of their valor. Today they are \neffectively being held hostage by Iraqi politicians who refuse to \nnegotiate among themselves and form a government. That might be \nsatisfactory to the Senator from Kentucky but not to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. Evidently, the Senator from Kentucky wants to give a \nblank check to the Iraqi politicians: Continue your squabbles over \nthere, while we continue to see the loss of American lives and blood.\n  Not the Senator from Massachusetts. They have had their time. What is \ngoing to convince the Iraqi politicians we are serious? What will send \nthe message is when we demonstrate that we are starting to withdraw \nAmerican troops. Then they are going to make political judgments for \ntheir survival.\n  But not today. If the Senator from Kentucky wants to continue an \nopen-ended commitment with American lives and American treasure, that \nis his position. It is not mine. I don't think that is where the \nAmerican people are.\n  How long is it going to take for the Iraqi politicians to get \ntogether? They are not doing it now. They didn't do it yesterday. They \ndon't appear to be willing to do it tomorrow, even though we have had \nassurances from the administration that success was around the corner.\n  This is a matter of enormous importance and consequence. We will \ncontinue the debate. That is why I am a strong supporter of what our \nleader pointed out earlier today, talking about a proposal that has \nbeen put forward in terms of what is called bridge funding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14676-5", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14676-S14678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to take a few moments to talk \nabout the state of our economy. I do so because during the break, I had \nthe opportunity to talk with a lot of people in my own State of \nMassachusetts. Our State is not greatly different from many other \nStates, certainly in the northeastern and central part of the Nation, \nolder industrial States. The conclusion of working families and the \nmiddle class is pretty consistent across the country, that the state of \nour economy has given working families a good deal of fear.\n  Let me review quickly what our current situation is. The vast \nmajority of Americans are anxious about the economy. This is from the \nlatest poll in November of 2007: 78 percent say the economy is getting \nworse, the most negative outlook in the past 16 years. We have to ask \nourselves: Is this a Democratic, Independent or Republican view? Let's \nlook across the spectrum: 89 percent of Democrats feel that way, and \nthese are representatives of working families; Independents are 78 \npercent. Even among Republicans, 65 percent believe the economy is \ngetting worse.\n  This sense of anxiety about a growing economy has been there for some \ntime. Look where it was in January of 2001. Fifty-six percent of \nAmericans were concerned about the economy. Now look at November of \n2007. It has gone from 56 percent to 78 percent who are concerned about \nthe economy.\n  Let's look at how working families view the future for the next \ngeneration, their children. Working families feel insecure about their \nchildren's economic future. This is a current assessment of how working \nfamilies view what is going to happen to their children: 23 percent \nbelieve their children will be better off than they are today; 30 \npercent believe their children will have the same future as they have; \nand 42 percent believe their children will be worse off than today. \nThis is a defining aspect of what our country is about. It is about the \nAmerican dream. It is about hope and opportunity, not only for \nthemselves but for their children and their children's children. When \nyou lose that hope, you begin to lose working families' views about the \nAmerican dream.\n  This chart shows an explanation of why this has happened. We are \ngrowing further apart in terms of wages and productivity for middle-\nincome families. From 1947 to 1962, as we came out of World War II, as \nproductivity increased, wages increased, and the economy went along \ntogether, all of the different quintiles of the American economy went \nalong together. We all grew together. There was a sense of optimism and \nhope because we had a shared economy, a shared future. But look at what \nhas happened in terms of real wages and productivity. Productivity has \nescalated 205 percent. Wages have effectively gone up about 5 percent \nover the last 7 years in terms of real dollars and the rest of that \nproductivity has gone to the wealthiest individuals.\n  One of the principle reasons is because wages have effectively \nremained stagnant. We have seen what has happened to the price of \ngasoline. It is up 66 percent. Health care is up 38 percent. Education \nis up 43 percent. Home ownership is up nearly 40 percent, and \neffectively wages are stagnant at 5 percent. These are the things that \nfamilies are concerned about, how they are going to get to work. How \nthey are going to be able to afford health care, to send their children \nto school? Are they going to have a home?\n  This is what all of us have seen in many of the colder regions of the \ncountry. As the temperature drops, home heating oil prices have gone \nthrough the roof: $1.83 a gallon in 2001; in 2007, $3.29. It has gone \nup 33 percent in real terms since last year. So homes have gotten more \nexpensive. Education is more expensive. Fuel is more expensive. Health \ncare is more expensive. Heating oil is more expensive. This has all \ncontributed to the growth of insecurity.\n  The price of food has risen faster than the rate of inflation. \nWhether it is a pound of beef or whether it is eggs, prices are rising \nup to 50 percent faster than the rate of inflation. Even milk is higher \nthan the rate of inflation.\n  All of this has been happening while working families have been \nworking longer and harder than those in any other industrial nation of \nthe world.\n\n[[Page S14677]]\n\n  Here, as shown on this chart, we have nearly 40 million Americans--28 \npercent of the American workforce--who work more than 40 hours a week. \nAlso, 1 in 10 workers works more than 50 hours a week. So almost 30 \npercent work more than 40 hours a week. Mr. President, 7.9 million \nAmericans are working two or more jobs. American working hours are the \nsecond highest of any of the developed countries.\n  This chart is a good indicator. Americans' work has increased more \nthan any other industrialized country of the world. Here it is: 20 \npercent from 1970 to 2002. Here, as shown on this chart, is the United \nStates. Workers are working longer. They are working harder. Many of \nthem are getting two jobs. And the essential elements that are \nnecessary for their livelihood have far exceeded their wages and, \ntherefore, they find increasing apprehension about their own future and \nabout the future of their country.\n  This chart is an indicator about where we are in terms of savings. \nCredit card debt has exploded, bringing cash available for an average \nfamily down to $1,600. The credit card debt has gone absolutely up \nthrough the roof. This chart shows that Americans now owe $900 billion \nin credit card debt. This is the escalation: People are borrowing this \nmoney, relying more and more on the credit card; and the fees that are \nbeing charged are extraordinary. But Americans will have to pay them \nbecause they cannot see any other way.\n  This chart is an indicator of where the savings have been going over \nthe period of the last 40 years. The red line indicates that the \nsavings have gone right down. We are talking about working families \nwith virtually no savings. There is an extraordinary escalation in \nterms of the cost, and all of this is happening at the same time.\n  This chart shows that millions of American families are facing losing \ntheir homes. Foreclosures are rising dramatically--177 percent from \n2005. Pick up any newspaper in the country today and you will see that \nkind of pressure that is on working families. With all the apprehension \nthey have, can they afford the mortgage, particularly at this time of \nthe year, Christmastime? Can they afford the mortgage? And can they \nafford to try to celebrate Christmas with their children?\n  These are the mortgage woes that are creating a ``subprime'' \nChristmas for consumers in stores. This is the Harriman family who \nnormally spends about $500 on holiday gifts. This season they have a \nwrenching choice: celebrate Christmas or keep their home out of \nforeclosure. Many families have gone into that situation.\n  There is an increasing number of bankruptcies. This chart shows the \nescalation now in terms of the number of bankruptcies that are taking \nplace among working families in this country--escalating, escalating, \nescalating. As shown on this chart, this is by quarters. This is 2007: \nthe first quarter, the second quarter, the third quarter--and it is \ncontinuing to escalate and grow and grow. Houses are being lost. \nBankruptcies are taking place.\n  This is one of the very distressing charts. This couple and child \nrepresent a middle-class family, middle-income family from the last \ngeneration, which would be 40 years ago. This is the current situation \nfor the last generation's children.\n  You will see that 19 percent rise to the top of the economic ladder; \n17 percent fall to the bottom. Look what the total is: 36 percent of \nthe children of middle-income families rose somewhat, and 41 percent of \nthe children fell--fell slightly or fell to the bottom. These are the \nchildren of middle-income families, the backbone of this country, our \nsociety, and this is what has happened to them. These are the latest \nfigures, and families know that.\n  It is bad enough for the average family, but it has been particularly \ndamaging in terms of a number of the minority groups. In this case, \nAfrican Americans born to middle-class parents have fallen out of the \nmiddle class. In the last 20 years, in middle-income families, 69 \npercent of the children--effectively 70 percent--have fallen into lower \neconomic standing. This has probably been true in terms of other \nminority groups as well.\n  We are growing farther and farther apart, increasing inequality, \nincreasing uncertainty, at a time when the safety nets are effectively \ndisappearing--disappearing in terms of pensions, disappearing in terms \nof health care costs, disappearing in terms of unemployment \ncompensation. All of those safety nets have been put in tatters at a \ntime when working families and their children are in the greatest need.\n  This chart shows the number of uninsured Americans. We are familiar \nwith the figures. They are used daily. Now the number is close to 47 \nmillion. This is even in spite of the fact that the CHIP program was \nimplemented during this period of time and has actually provided health \ncare for up to 7 million children.\n  This chart is interesting because we have too many working Americans \nlacking insurance. Look at this: More than 80 million adults and \nchildren--1 out of every 3 nonelderly individuals--have spent some part \nof the last 2 years without health insurance. Without insurance: 80 \nmillion--80 million in a country of 300 million people. So 80 million \npeople have spent some time over the last 2 years without health \ninsurance. And 85 percent of them were working adults. These are \nworking men and women. These are men and women who are working, in many \ninstances, two jobs--working longer and harder than at any other time \nin the history of our country, and they are still facing this \nsituation.\n  This chart shows that half of American workers do not have any form \nof retirement savings at work. They effectively have no pension \nsavings. That is half of all the workers in this country. It is \na rather important shift and change in recent times. Now it is going in \nthe absolutely wrong direction. Mr. President, 4 million fewer \nAmericans have pensions than 7 years ago. In 2000, 46 million workers \nhad one. Now it is 42 million workers, and these numbers are going \nright on down. They are not going in the right direction. They are \ngoing in the wrong direction.\n\n  This chart is another way of saying that only one in five workers now \nhas a defined benefit pension which will give the workers some \nassurance there will be benefits there. Others have the 401(k)s that \nmay be going up or may be going down, and we have seen a period where \nthey were going down, and they have lost their security in terms of \ntheir future. That has been happening over the period of the last 16 \nyears, where increasing numbers have lost their security.\n  American workers lack access to the needed paid sick days. What is \nhappening in the middle class is there are increasing numbers of \nchildren who need focus and attention because two members of the family \nare working and their child is sick. Also, because parents are living \nlonger, working families have more responsibilities to provide care for \nneedy members of their family. But only 48 percent have paid sick days, \nand 70 percent do not have paid days to care for sick children. So it \nis a very small number of parents who have that. They are caught in the \nsituation where they have a sick child, and they let the sick child go \nto school, where the child gets sicker and, chances are, contaminates \nother children as well.\n  Unemployment has risen under President Bush and his failed economic \npolicies. Unemployment has increased by 1.2 million people from January \n2001 to October 2007. But long-term unemployment has gone up 59 \npercent. This is long-term employment. These are people who have lost \ntheir jobs and are unable to get a job. They effectively were \nparticipants in the job market. This figure is unusually high and it's \nbeen high for an unusually long period of time.\n  There are a final few points I want to mention. The majority of the \nunemployed workers do not receive benefits. We used to think if you \nwere unemployed, you were going to get unemployment insurance. Not \nanymore. Sixty-four percent of unemployed workers receive nothing at \nall from unemployment insurance. For those who do now collect benefits, \nthey are often inadequate. Average unemployment insurance checks are \ndown to 28 percent of income. This is an antiquated system. Now workers \nwho actually pay into it are ineligible to get it for a variety of \ndifferent kinds of technical reasons. We are trying to work with the \nFinance Committee, with Senator Baucus and others to address this \nissue. These are workers who have paid\n\n[[Page S14678]]\n\nin or are otherwise eligible for unemployment compensation and are \nunable to collect it.\n  Effectively, as shown, this is the inadequacy in terms of childcare. \nOnly 14 percent of eligible children have access to Government-assisted \nchildcare.\n  These charts give you some idea why the working families of America \nhave such apprehension in terms of the future and in terms of their own \nlives. We need the programs to be able to deal with this situation. We \nhave a number of recommendations, and I will mention them very quickly \nthis afternoon and will put in additional kinds of information.\n  First, we need to safeguard working families from the turbulence of \nthe modern economy by providing stronger and better support for \nfamilies in crisis. Our country is going through profound economic \nshifts, and too many workers are losing their jobs in the wake of these \nchanges.\n  I have introduced bipartisan legislation, the Unemployment Insurance \nModernization Act, to make sure those who have worked hard and paid \ninto the system get the benefits they deserve. I hope we will see \nprogress on the bill soon so that much more that needs to be done will \nbe done to help Americans who are struggling to find a job.\n  We also need an aggressive agenda to help families facing a health \ncare crisis. We must make more progress toward a universal, \ncomprehensive program that is going to be there and be available and \naccessible to all Americans.\n  In the meantime, we can follow the examples of my own State, \nMassachusetts, which has taken the lead in providing our residents \naccess to quality health care. It is absolutely essential, as these \ncharts pointed out, that we address this problem.\n  Strengthening the safety net alone is not enough. We need to redouble \nour efforts to restore economic opportunity for families. Americans are \nworking harder than ever, and they need the additional kinds of \ntraining. In my State now we have 145,000 unemployed. We have 75,000 \njob openings. They are good jobs. Yet, we have seen a continuing \nreduction in terms of training programs. Those people could get the \njobs and be taxpayers and be committed and productive members of \nsociety. But we have seen over the period of the recent years, \nincluding with this last budget request, a continued reduction in terms \nof training programs by this administration.\n  We know workers have to have a continuing, ongoing upgrading of their \nskills in order to be able to deal with these jobs. I think we need \nlabor law reforms, such as the Employee Free Choice Act, to protect the \nright to organize so employees can stand up and fight for what is fair.\n  I think we need to address again the earned income tax credit to help \nthose at the bottom of the economic ladder who have worked hard and \nplayed by the rules. We have to continue, I think, the progress we have \nmade in the increase in the minimum wage so we do not fall back in \nterms of providing working families with a decent income.\n  The late Barbara Jordan once said:\n\n       What the [American] people want is very simple. They want \n     an America as good as its promise.\n\n  The promise of America is that it is truly a land of opportunity, \nwhere every working family can share in the Nation's prosperity, where \nwe all rise together, and we can be confident that our children have a \nbright future. For decades we enjoyed that vision of shared prosperity. \nI am confident we can make that promise a reality for American families \nagain. We owe it to all the workers who have seen their bills go up, \nwhile their paychecks go down. We owe it to all the parents who cannot \nsleep at night because they are worried about their children's future. \nWe owe it to all the families who are struggling and need a reason to \ncelebrate this holiday season. We owe the American people our best \nefforts, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle in the weeks and months ahead to put working families back \non track.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14678-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 3688\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak in \nconnection with the 2007 farm bill which was being debated on the floor \nof the Senate over the last several weeks prior to the time of \nThanksgiving. As I rise to speak about the farm bill, I wish to say \nthank you to my colleague and good friend from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, for again bringing to the attention of the American public the \nimportance of what is happening economically across the spectrum of \nAmerica today, which is that there is a great sense of concern and \ninstability and nervousness among the American public about what is \nhappening in their own economic lives and whether their children will \nhave access to higher education, whether they will be able to afford \nhealth care and health care insurance, whether gas prices are going to \nessentially force them to not be able to afford the essentials of life.\n  I think within all of that, one of the things Senator Kennedy so \neloquently speaks to is this covenant of America, that somehow we are \nall here as Americans in a common mission to try to create a better \nworld for our children and for our grandchildren and for the rest of \nhumanity. The one thing we cannot afford to do is to allow that \ncovenant to be broken. We in this Chamber of the U.S. Senate, working \nin a bipartisan way, have an obligation to ensure that the covenant of \nAmerica is something we honor, something we give dignity to in our \nefforts through our work.\n  As part of that work, one of the things I think is very critical is \nthat we not forget those parts of America which, in many ways, have \nbeen the forgotten America, and those are the communities of rural \nAmerica. Those are communities like the towns and the counties where I \ncome from and the county of Conejos County, which is one of the poorest \ncounties in the United States of America, which, no matter how well the \nrest of America is doing, seems to be struggling on the vine.\n  So it is important for us in the Senate, in the weeks and days ahead, \nto do everything we can to make sure we pass the farm bill because it \nis a farm bill that is good for America. It is a farm bill that is good \nfor nutrition. As my good friend Kent Conrad and my good friend Senator \nHarkin have kept reminding the people of America, 67 percent of the \nbill we are working on is for nutrition. That aspect of our legislation \nis invented to provide assistance to those who are most in need. So I \nam hopeful that as we move forward this week and next week, we as the \nSenate will come together on a bipartisan basis to move forward with a \nfarm bill that is so essential to the food security of the Nation.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Chambliss for their hard \nwork on this farm bill we have put so much time on for the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears. I also thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley for \ntheir work on the Finance Committee because their contribution to this \nfarm bill has been so essential to get us to a point where we have a \nforward-thinking and balanced bill on the floor. I know that as I speak \nthis afternoon, there are negotiations underway with respect to whether \nwe can narrow the number of amendments to be considered on the floor so \nthat we can move forward to consideration and hopefully final passage \nof this bill.\n  A lot of folks in this country are looking to us in the Senate this \nweek\n\n[[Page S14679]]\n\nand next to see whether we have the courage to pass a farm bill. In my \nview, we must pass this farm bill. It is a bill that helps the 50 \nmillion Americans living in rural communities. It is a bill that helps \nkids who deserve fresh fruits and vegetables with their lunches. It is \na bill that helps put healthy and safe food on the tables of the people \nof this country. It helps us reduce our dependence on foreign oil and \nbuild a clean energy economy for the 21st century, and in my view that \nclean energy economy will be the signature domestic and foreign policy \nissue of our future here in America.\n  A few days ago, I was in the San Luis Valley with my family at our \nranch. Our land, which we have ranched on for five generations, is just \na few miles north of the New Mexico-Colorado border in a county that \nreflects many of the challenges that are facing rural America. Almost a \nquarter of the residents in my home county of Conejos--that is one in \nfour--live below the poverty line, with a median household income of \naround $27,000 a year. In the neighboring county, Costilla County, \nhousehold income is about half the median in the United States.\n  It is an inescapable fact of America that rural communities across \nthe country are struggling. Median income in rural counties nationwide \nis $11,000 lower than the national median. If you live in a rural \ncommunity, that means you are going to be making a lot less money than \nif you live in a nonrural community. Jobs and population are \ndisappearing in these counties.\n  I wish to point out this map. It is a map of what has happened just \nin the last 5 years here in the United States of America. The counties \nthat are in red on this map are counties that have lost \npopulation. These are part of the rural America we are trying to \naddress in this bill by opening a whole new chapter of opportunity that \nwill give the farmers and ranchers and residents of these rural \ncounties and States and communities for the good way of life, the way \nthe rest of America has that good way of life. All of the counties on \nthis map that are either red or yellow are counties that are losing \npopulation and are falling behind the national average. Many of those \ncounties are counties such as the ones in my State. There you will find \nschools with declining enrollments, you will find hospitals and health \nclinics across those counties that are closing, and you will find \nstores on Main Streets that are getting boarded up.\n\n  Here is a picture of downtown Brush, CO. Mr. President, you know \nthese towns and communities in Virginia the way I do in my State of \nColorado. I can go across the eastern plains or the southern part of my \nState, and in town after town out in the rural areas of my State, these \nMain Streets of America are being boarded up and are for sale because \nof the declining economic vitality in those communities. These are \nplaces where the tractor dealerships, the hardware stores, and the feed \nstores are closing down. You know from all of the signs you see out \nthere that farmers and ranchers are struggling.\n  This has certainly been the case in Colorado. We have had a severe \ndrought in my State now for the last 8 years, and we are now just \npulling out of that drought. In 2002, we lost 30 percent of our wheat \non account of the drought. The acres that were harvested had an average \nyield of 23 bushels per acre--not enough to cover the operating and \noverhead costs of producing those 23 bushels per acre. In 2004, it \nhappened again, and we lost 600,000 acres of wheat production in my \nState of Colorado. In 2006, again, our wheat losses amounted to around \n$95 million. But it is not just wheat and corn; it is also what has \nhappened with respect to disasters in my State. This is a picture taken \nin Washington County, named after George Washington, right outside of \nAkron, CO, where you see the results of drought which essentially have \nannihilated this field from any kind of yield or production on the \neastern plains.\n  Over the last few weeks, I have heard people, both in this Chamber \nand especially in the media, paint a rosy picture of our rural \neconomies. They say corn and soy and wheat prices are up, and they \nargue, therefore, that farmers are doing well and perhaps a farm bill \nis not needed. They use this as a ground for attacking and blocking the \nbill that is before us--this bill, which is a bipartisan product. But \nit is no secret that the commodity prices in the business section \naren't a very good indication of how farmers and ranchers are actually \ndoing. If corn prices are up, that doesn't necessarily mean farms and \nranches in Baca County or Yuma County, CO, are doing much better. I can \ntell you that the cattle business, for one--the cattle business, which \nI know well--gets a whole lot more difficult when feed prices are high.\n  Where has Washington been while our farmers and ranchers have been \nfighting to stay afloat? For years, in my view, Washington has turned a \nblind eye to the problems in rural America, perhaps because we in rural \nAmerica don't have the clout people in urban America have because of \ntheir votes. It is a neglect that is surfacing yet again among those \nwho hold this legislation from going forward.\n  This neglect is disheartening when you know just how much possibility \nand promise there is in the rural communities of America. With modest \ninvestments, rural America can be the engine of our clean energy \neconomy, fueling an alternative energy revolution that capitalizes on \nthe hard work, the productivity, and the entrepreneurship of our \nfarmers and ranchers across our great land. It can continue to provide \nus safe and healthy food, and it can continue to protect millions of \nacres of land and waterways that we value.\n  Here is a picture of one of the educational programs in my State \ncalled EQIP which is addressed in this farm bill. This picture shows \nthe farm bill at work, helping to protect our land and our water while \nkeeping our farmers the most productive in the world. These are some of \nour farmers from the Saint Vrain and Boulder Creek watersheds learning \nsome new practices that reduce tillage and increase the yields from our \nfarms.\n  The field day which is shown in this picture was part of a 3-year \nEQIP conservation innovation grant that was done in partnership with \nthe local conservation district, with the local farmers, seed \ncompanies, and farm equipment dealers. At the end of the day, these \nfarmers went home with a few ways to boost their bottom line while \nprotecting the land and water of Colorado and America.\n  The farm bill has an enormous impact on this Nation's land and water. \nWe think about America the beautiful, this great land. Well, non-\nFederal agricultural and forest lands occupy about 70 percent of the \nlands in the lower 48 States. So 70 percent of the lands in the 48 \nStates is what is at the heart of this farm bill. Seven out of ten \nacres in the contiguous United States are affected by the farm bill. \nThese lands provide the habitat and corridors that support healthy \nwildlife populations, filter groundwater supplies, regulate surface \nwater flows, sequester carbon, and provide the open space and vistas we \nall love. As I learned growing up on our ranch in southern Colorado, \nfarmers and ranchers are some of the best stewards of these resources. \nThey want to take care of their land because they know that taking care \nof their land and water is essential for their livelihood.\n  Our farmers also want to be very much a part of a clean energy future \nfor America. This is a picture of an ethanol plant, which is new, in \nSterling, CO. This ethanol plant produces about 42 million gallons of \nfuel a year. This is only one of three plants in our State that have \ncome on line just in the last 2 years and partly as a result of the \nwork that was done in this Chamber in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. It is \npart of the renewable energy revolution that is taking place across \nAmerica. Title 9 of the farm bill addresses this renewable energy \nfuture for our country. A fourth ethanol plant just like this one has \ncome on line in Colorado just in the last week.\n  But it goes beyond biofuels, which is a central part of this section \nof the farm bill. It goes to other kinds of renewable energy.\n  It goes to programs such as wind. Here is a wind farm in Prowers \nCounty in the eastern plains of Colorado, out in that part of the \n``forgotten America.'' It is that part that is so red in my State \nbecause we know that is part of the area that was part of the great \nDust Bowl, which, even at this point in time, in 2007, is a place that \nis so\n\n[[Page S14680]]\n\nsparsely populated but has so much potential for our future. This wind \nfarm in Prowers County is part of an effort in our State whereby, at \nthe end of 2008, we project we will be producing over 1,000 megawatts \nof power from wind in Colorado. That is the equivalent of the amount of \nelectricity produced by three coal-fired powerplants, and we have been \nable to do that in a period of 2 years.\n  We planted the seeds for these kinds of projects in the 2005 Energy \nPolicy Act and in the Energy bills we passed earlier this year, which I \nhope we get to refurbish and pass again in the next several days. But \nthe farm bill is also part of that.\n  The 2007 farm bill takes the next step by helping farmers and \nranchers deploy the renewable energy technologies that have been \ndeveloped in lots of places around our country, including the National \nRenewable Energy Lab in Golden, CO.\n  With the $1.3 billion that this bill devotes to energy programs, \nfarmers will be able to apply for grants to develop biorefineries and \nto improve the handling, harvest, transport, and storage of feedstocks \nfor biofuels. The bill includes tax credits for small wind turbines and \ncellulosic biofuel production. And it stimulates research into the \nmethods and technologies that will allow the most productive lands in \nthe world to provide more and more of our energy. The farm bill, in \ntitle IX, shows us how rural America will help us grow our way to \nenergy independence.\n  Reducing our dependence upon foreign oil will be the central national \nsecurity, environmental security, and economic security challenge for \nall of us in the coming decades. It is also a tremendous opportunity.\n  The country that successfully replaces its imports of foreign oil \nwith clean home-grown energy will reap competitive and technological \nadvantages that will keep it out front in the world for decades to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, it is time to put the interests of rural America \nbefore the politics of obstructionism. I urge my colleagues, Democrats \nand Republicans, to find a way forward in which we can narrow the \nnumber of amendments that have been filed on this legislation, so that \nunder the leadership of Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss we can \nhave an opportunity to vote on a final farm bill as part of the \nChristmas present that we should be delivering to the American people. \nIt is my hope that, as we move forward on the farm bill, we move \nforward with equal fervor in having the Energy bill concluded, which is \nnow on its way to passage in the House of Representatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14680-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3688, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3688) to implement the United States-Peru \n     Trade Promotion Agreement.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, is the business of the Senate at this \npoint the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to speak about that subject, \nand I will confess, as I start, that the old admonition never argue \nwith someone who buys ink by the barrel is something I should have \nlearned long ago. I take issue with a company that buys ink by the \ntanker truck: the Washington Post.\n  Speaking of trade, the Washington Post described, I think, why there \nis not so much of a thoughtful debate about trade as there is a \nthoughtless debate about it. In this editorial, they say this about \ntrade in an attempt to criticize some of those who are running for \nPresident and are distancing themselves from the brand of free trade. \nWhat the Washington Post says is that a candidate said the following \nquote:\n\n       NAFTA was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver \n     what we had hoped it would, and that is why I call for a \n     trade time out.\n\n  One candidate said NAFTA was a mistake, and they quoted the candidate \nsaying it. The Washington Post says:\n\n       Such demagoguery.\n\n  So it is now demagoguery for a candidate for President to allege that \na trade agreement was a mistake. That is demagoguery? I don't quite \nunderstand the Washington Post. The Washington Post says that NAFTA \ndidn't cause the current U.S. trade deficit with Mexico. Really? That \nis an interesting conclusion, with no facts to support it. There are no \nfacts to support that conclusion.\n  I think I will show a chart that shows what has happened to our trade \nwith Mexico since the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, was \nsigned. The evidence is pretty substantial about what happened with our \ntrade between the United States and Mexico: Just prior to negotiating a \nfree trade agreement with Mexico, we had a very small surplus with the \ncountry of Mexico of $1.5 billion. Now, last year, it went from a very \nsmall surplus to a $65 billion deficit. The Washington Post says--about \na candidate that said NAFTA was a mistake--that is demagoguery. Give us \na break. It is not demagoguery to suggest that something doesn't work \nwhen we have gone from a $1.5 billion trade surplus to a $65 billion \ndeficit.\n  The Washington Post also says that the agreements contributed \nmarginally to the shifting of workers from some less competitive \nsectors to others. That is arcane language to describe what happened. \nAfter NAFTA, the three largest imports from Mexico to the United States \nare automobiles, automobile parts, and electronics. The contention was \nmade by those who supported NAFTA that this would only mean the \nmigration of low-skill, low-income work to Mexico. It didn't happen \nquite that way. Automobiles, automobile parts, and electronics \nrepresent the products of high-skill labor in this country, and those \njobs have been lost.\n  I only wished to point out that the Washington Post described for us \ntoday why this debate about trade has largely been thoughtless. Yes, it \nis a global economy, I understand that. There are many faces to the \nglobal economy--some very attractive and some not so attractive. I will \ntry to describe them both today. The global economy has galloped \nforward at a very aggressive pace, but the rules have not kept pace. So \nthe result is we have some very significant problems and dislocations. \nWe are drowning in trade debt in this country, and I will describe \nthat.\n  What is before us is another free trade agreement, the free trade \nagreement with Peru. Let me say that I can count votes. I understand \nwhat will happen in this Chamber. The Senate will support and vote for \nthe free trade agreement with Peru.\n  I maintain again today that I am not going to vote for additional \nfree trade agreements until benchmarks are attached and there is \naccountability for those benchmarks. Had we had benchmarks in the \nNAFTA, we would not have gone from a $1.5 billion surplus to a $65 \nbillion deficit. We would have, at some point, said, wait a second, \nsomething is happening that is not right for our country.\n  First of all, I don't think we should be signing new trade agreements \nuntil we fix some of the fundamental problems in the old agreements. \nTwo, I believe that the Peru agreement represents an expansion of a \nfailed model. It has failed before and will fail again. And, No. 3, I \ndon't think it contains--I know it doesn't contain any benchmarks or \naccountability or a mechanism for withdrawal should the trade agreement \nfail at least relative to what we expect the trade agreement to \naccomplish.\n\n[[Page S14681]]\n\n  So I don't intend to support this trade agreement, not because I \ndon't support trade. I support trade, and plenty of it. I believe, \nhowever, it ought to be fair. And the failed model brought to us time \nand time again I will demonstrate today has failed this country. It has \nnot failed everybody, but it has failed this country, and it is not in \nthis country's best interest. This is language I assume the Washington \nPost would call demagoguery. If they suggest that it is demagoguery for \na candidate for President to say NAFTA was a mistake, when all of the \nevidence demonstrates it was a mistake, I assume they may want to turn \noff their television sets when I am speaking at this point because they \nwill certainly consider that demagoguery. It is rather, however, not a \nthoughtless debate. It is a thoughtful debate from the standpoint of \nthose of us who come to the floor of the Senate who say we want trade, \nwe support trade, we believe expanded trade is helpful to this country, \nbut we insist for a change that the model of a trade agreement be a \nmodel that is mutually beneficial and stands up for the interests of \nboth sides to that agreement.\n  The agreement with Peru by itself will not do damage to this country. \nThat is not what I allege today. Let me describe our trade: With China, \n$343 billion; Mexico, $332 billion; Japan, $120 billion; Peru, $9 \nbillion. I don't allege that trade with Peru, which is about three-\ntenths of 1 percent of our trade, is going to be a serious problem \nbecause of the passage of a failed model. We have very large trade \ndeficits with China, Japan, Mexico, the European Union, and Canada, all \nof whom are major trading partners. Instead of doing something about \nthose significant and growing problems--China, Japan, Canada, the \nEuropean Union, and Mexico--instead of doing something about that, we \nbring the same failed model to the floor of the Senate.\n  I recognize and admit that this model with respect to Peru has labor \nstandards in it that did not exist and environmental standards that did \nnot exist in some other trade agreements. I will talk about that in a \nmoment, especially with respect to Jordan. But the fact is, the \nfoundation of this agreement is the same failed model that we have seen \nin the past.\n  I want to talk about that failed model. I want to talk about the \nissue of China, especially because when we talk about trade--and we \nmust talk about trade, we have to talk about the 500-pound gorilla with \nrespect to our trade problems. This chart represents what our trade \nwith China looks like since 1995 through last year, 2006. Success? No. \nThese red lines going down represent huge trade deficits. Does anybody \nthink that is a success? I think it is a huge failure for our country \nto be so fundamentally out of balance in our trade relationship with \nChina. It just continues and continues and continues.\n  The question is: What will we do about that? Some of the cheerleaders \nfor the free-trade movement and the cheerleaders who would look at this \nwould say: You need to understand something. And, obviously, they would \nsay: Senator Dorgan does not understand it. Here is what it is. They \nsay: We have increased our annual exports to China by $39 billion from \n2000 to 2006. That is what they would say. They would say: Look at \nthis, we have increased our exports by $39 billion in just 5\\1/2\\ \nyears. They just will not tell you the rest of the story, as Paul \nHarvey would suggest. The rest of the story is, yes, we did increase \nour exports to China by $39 billion, but we increased our imports from \nChina by $188 billion. Isn't it interesting the picture you get that is \nvery different if you have both sides of the equation? What will happen \nis those who support the free-trade model who think it works, who want \nto bury their head in the sand with respect to anything that represents \nsomething we should fix in our trade circumstance, they would only show \nyou this $39 billion, only tell you that. They will strut around, \nthumbing their suspenders, puffing on their cigars saying: Look at all \nthis; isn't this wonderful? We had a $40 billion increase in exports to \nthe country of China in the last 6 years. What do you think about that? \nDo you think that is not successful? We are dramatically increasing our \nexports to China. How on Earth can you suggest that is not in this \ncountry's best interest? They would stop the story right there.\n  But if you pick up the story where it should be picked up, you would \nsay: Yes, that is true we had almost a $40 billion increase in exports, \nand good for us. The problem is, it was more than four times that \namount in increased imports to this country, which means we had a net \nreduction in our trade relationship--that is, a net increase in our \ndeficit--with China of over $140 billion. That is the rest of the \nstory.\n  So for every $6 of merchandise we buy from China, the Chinese buy $1 \nof merchandise from us. That is not mutually beneficial trade. There \nare a lot of reasons for this surging trade deficit with China.\n  If I might show the bar chart that shows the surging deficits, there \nare many reasons for this surge, but among them is that we have a \npretty bankrupt trade agreement with China. China is rampant with what \nis called intellectual property theft. Walk down a street in China and \nbuy a brand-new American movie, a CD. Piracy, they manipulate their \ncurrency, they have unfair barriers against U.S. exports, they have an \nunfair relationship in which U.S. jobs go to China because of, in many \ncases--not all cases but in many cases--sweatshop conditions in China. \nAnd so we have these circumstances with China that contribute to \nthis dramatic increase in the U.S. trade deficit with China.\n\n  China has increasingly become a platform for manufacturing that used \nto occur in this country. Why? Because they are better manufacturers? \nNo. It is because you can get products manufactured for a fraction of \nthe price of manufacturing them in this country.\n  I indicated earlier the situation with Mexico. I described the \nsituation with China. The trade deficit increased dramatically with \nChina, and the trade deficit increased dramatically with Mexico. The \nsame is true with Canada. With Japan, it hasn't increased dramatically. \nIt has always been large and never changed because that is the way \nJapan wants it.\n  In the Wall Street Journal on October 4 of this year, there was a \nvery interesting story. It said in the headline: ``Republicans Grow \nSkeptical of Free Trade.'' And the story described a poll--understand, \nthis is in the Wall Street Journal--that by a 2-to-1 margin, Republican \nvoters believe free-trade deals have been bad for our country's \neconomy. I suppose the Washington Post would also suggest that is \ndemagoguery. Again, by a 2-to-1 margin, Republican voters believe free-\ntrade deals have been bad for our economy.\n  The poll found that 59 percent of polled Republican voters agreed \nwith the following statement:\n\n       Foreign trade has been bad for the U.S. economy because \n     imports from abroad have reduced demand for American-made \n     goods, cost jobs here at home, and produced potentially \n     unsafe products.\n\n  Only 32 percent of the polled Republican voters agreed with the \nfollowing statement:\n\n       Foreign trade has been good for the U.S. economy because \n     demand for U.S. products abroad has resulted in economic \n     growth and jobs for Americans here at home and provided more \n     choices for consumers.\n\n  This poll in the Wall Street Journal suggests, I think, a dramatic \nchange in the way Americans view this free-trade movement.\n  In December 1999, the Wall Street Journal did a poll that found that \nonly 31 percent of Republican voters thought free-trade agreements hurt \nour country. But in this past month's poll, they found the number of \nRepublican voters went from 31 percent to 59 percent. These are \nRepublican voters. That is where the substantial support has come from \nfor these free-trade agreements. Clearly, the American people have seen \nthe results of the free-trade agreements. They understand these red \nlines, these giant trade deficits are not just red lines. This isn't \njust some red ink. It represents lost jobs, lost dreams. It represents \nsomebody coming home at night to their family saying: Honey, I lost my \njob, not because I am a bad worker but because I can't compete with 20-\ncent-an-hour labor in Shen-chen, China.\n  When NAFTA was debated in Congress in the early 1990s, its proponents \nargued, as I indicated earlier with respect to the U.S. deficit with \nMexico, the proponents argued this would result in the creation of a \ncouple hundred thousand new jobs in the United\n\n[[Page S14682]]\n\nStates. But it is widely acknowledged by any economist who knows \nanything that this did not lead to the increased promise of U.S. jobs. \nThe 200,000 jobs created annually, that was from a study by Mr. \nHufbauer and Mr. Schott, a couple of economists.\n  I have indicated that I previously taught economics in college, but I \nwas able to overcome that experience. Hufbauer and Schott gave us this \nbest economists' analysis we can find, I guess. They said this will be \na couple hundred thousand new jobs, 170,000 new jobs by 1995, and they \nrounded that up to 200,000 when it was sold to the Congress. We now \nknow at least 412,000 jobs have been certified as lost due to NAFTA \nunder just one program at the U.S. Department of Labor.\n  Ten years after NAFTA had been approved, I commissioned a study from \nthe Congressional Research Service which identified the top 100 \ncompanies that laid off U.S. workers as a result of NAFTA between 1994 \nand 2002. When I asked the question of the Congressional Research \nService: Tell us how many Americans have lost their jobs due to NAFTA--\nthey went to the Department of Labor, which has a program called trade \nadjustment assistance. It is a program that gives temporary benefits to \nthose who are laid off as a result of NAFTA. This program requires \ncompanies to actually certify that they intended to eliminate U.S. jobs \nspecifically because of NAFTA.\n  The question of whether we have lost jobs due to NAFTA is on this \nchart coming from the Congressional Research Service that got the data \nfrom the U.S. Department of Labor. It tells us where these jobs came \nfrom, where they were lost. Vanity Fair, 16,000 jobs; Levi Strauss, \n15,676 jobs. These are certifications by the companies that they intend \nto lay off or did layoff these employees because of NAFTA. You can just \ngo down the list. This isn't me saying it, these are the certifications \nthese companies have made to the Department of Labor that these jobs \nare gone because of NAFTA, and they want trade adjustment assistance \nfor the workers who lost their jobs.\n  Sara Lee, Lucent, Fruit of the Loom, Texas. Fruit of the Loom \nunderwear left. It is not that people stopped needing or wearing \nunderwear. It is just they stopped making them in America. So Fruit of \nthe Loom is gone; 5,352 people who made underwear in this country lost \ntheir jobs. That is certified by Fruit of the Loom to the Labor \nDepartment saying: We laid them off.\n  This is not a question of whether there has been a loss of jobs as a \nresult of NAFTA. Just the top 100 companies have certified to that, the \ntop 100 companies laid off 201,000 U.S. jobs due to NAFTA. And if we \nlook at all U.S. companies, the total number of U.S. jobs certified as \nlost to NAFTA are 412,000, and that is just under this one program, \ntrade adjustment assistance.\n  I wanted to focus on the top 100 companies, but we could have done \nall of them. This is sufficient, however, to show what has happened \nwith respect to NAFTA.\n  Some familiar products: Levi Strauss. I don't know that there is \nanything more American than wearing a pair of Levis, right? So we all \nbuy Levis, except they don't make one pair of Levis in America, not \none. Is it because we don't make good pockets, can't sew good seats? \nNo, not all. It is just that all those jobs migrated out of this \ncountry in search of cheap labor.\n  There is a company called Nabisco. Do you know what it stands for? \nNational Biscuit Company. Nabisco is short for National Biscuit \nCompany. Presumably ``national'' is in this country, except that the \nNational Biscuit Company now belongs outside this country when it comes \nto making cookies. So Fig Newton cookies moved from America to Mexico. \nThe National Biscuit Company Fig Newton cookies migrated to Mexico. Is \nit because they can't shovel fig paste as effectively in New Jersey as \nthey can in Mexico? No. Shoveling fig paste is the same all over the \nworld. It is just you can get somebody to shovel fig paste a whole lot \nless expensively in Mexico than in this country, if you use low-wage \nlabor that is not protected by the kinds of basic labor protections we \nhave in this country. So the National Biscuit Company is no longer \nnational, at least with respect to Fig Newton cookies.\n\n  I mentioned Fruit of the Loom, Mattel. We hear a lot about Mattel \nthese days, of toys from China. They closed their last factory in the \nUnited States, a western Kentucky plant, that produced toys--Barbie \nplayhouses and so on, battery-powered pickup trucks--for 30 years. They \nshipped production from the 980-person plant in Kentucky to factories \nin Mexico.\n  John Deere, 1,150 workers, on this chart--made lawn mowers, \nchainsaws--gone to Mexico.\n  Well, we understand the Peru trade agreement is an agreement that is \nnot going to threaten the economic interests of this country. I don't \nassert that is the case. I do assert, however, that it is a failed \nmodel, and we have seen plenty of it. I have been on the floor of the \nSenate on many occasions saying why don't we fix that which is wrong in \nprevious agreements before we bring new agreements to the floor of the \nSenate. But we never do that. We just keep bringing new agreements to \nthe Senate.\n  The Peru trade deal does include some labor protections. That is \ntrue. And that is a welcomed development. But labor protections in a \ntrade agreement don't mean very much if there is not the political will \nto enforce them. Under the Peru deal, the only party that can seek \nenforcement of labor violations is the administration. And the Bush \nadministration has, apparently, I am told, given assurances to the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce these labor provisions are not going to be \nvigorously enforced. When the deal was announced on May 2007, the U.S. \nChamber issued a statement saying it had received assurances that the \nlabor provisions could not be enforced. Let me quote:\n\n       We are encouraged by assurances that the labor provisions \n     cannot be read to require compliance with ILO Conventions.\n\n  That is from the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He was \nsaying: I am comfortable because these aren't going to work. He was \nreferring specifically to a promise made by the U.S. Trade \nRepresentatives that the Peru agreement wouldn't require that U.S. \nworkers be assured the minimal labor rights guaranteed by the ILO.\n  Mr. President, if the Chamber had been assured the agreement will not \nbe enforced with respect to the rights for U.S. workers, you can bet \nthe labor provisions would not be enforced at all.\n  Even during the negotiations for the Peru agreement, the \nadministration made it very plain it has no interest in having labor \nprotections in the trade deal.\n  In fact, in 2005, the President of Peru offered to include in the \ntext of the original agreement a commitment to comply with the \nInternational Labor Organization's standards for basic labor rights. \nThat came from the President of Peru, saying: We will do this. In fact, \nthe U.S. trade ambassador's office quickly rejected it. They quickly \nsaid no. They vowed not to include a commitment to labor standards in \nthe free-trade agreement. It was only after the 2006 elections, in \nwhich a number of very interesting people were elected to this body on \nthese very issues--standing up for American interests, for the American \neconomy, and for the rights of American workers--only then did the U.S. \nTrade Representative, realizing these trade agreements would not move \nforward, only then did they decide to budge.\n  But I think the true colors were demonstrated the year previous when \nthe administration turned down the request or the offer by the \nPresident of Peru. It is clear to me there is no interest in enforcing \nthese labor provisions, and I have just suggested the evidence of that.\n  It is interesting, the only other previous trade agreement that \nincluded labor provisions was Jordan, and in the Jordan agreement--and \nI give the previous administration some credit, again, for including a \nlabor provision in the Jordan trade agreement. Those provisions have \nnot been adequately enforced, and the result has been the proliferation \nof sweatshops in the country of Jordan--the only country with whom we \nhave a free-trade agreement that includes labor provisions.\n  Now, our trade balance, when we signed the trade agreement with \nJordan, we had a trade surplus of about $243 million. That disappeared \nvery quickly, which is the case with all our trade agreements. That \nsurplus disappeared by 2002, and by 2005, that $200-plus million \nsurplus had turned to a $600-plus million deficit, and our balance with \nJordan has gotten worse\n\n[[Page S14683]]\n\nevery year since the agreement was signed. Let me say that again. Our \ntrade balance with Jordan has deteriorated every single year since the \ntrade agreement was signed.\n  In May of this year, the New York Times exposed how the free-trade \nagreement with the country of Jordan has been used to create sweatshops \nall over Jordan. It turns out that when the agreement was signed in \n1999--this is the story in the New York Times, titled ``An Ugly Side of \nFree Trade: Sweatshops in Jordan''--there began to be imported into \nJordan guest workers--guest workers from Bangladesh, from Sri Lanka, \nand elsewhere--to work in factories and in plants in sweatshop \nconditions.\n  Have you ever heard of a 40-hour work shift? No, I am not talking \nabout a 40-hour week. I am talking about a 40-hour shift. Well, it is \nhappening in some of these plants. Have you heard of people working 100 \nto 110 hours a week every single week, 7 days a week, with 1 day off \nevery 3 or 4 months? Have you heard of people working for a month, a \nsecond month, a third month, and never getting paid; and when asked to \nbe paid, getting beaten? Have you heard of people who spend 3 minutes \nmaking a colorful bikini for a lingerie shop in this country that is \ngoing to be sold for $14 and they receive just a pittance, working in \nsweatshop conditions? A story from the National Labor Committee just \ndescribed such a circumstance with a widely known American company.\n\n  Mr. President, despite the fact labor provisions existed in the \nJordan Free Trade Agreement, no one has sought to enforce those \nrequirements, those labor provisions.\n  Now, the other reason I do not support moving ahead with additional \nfree-trade agreements is, there are no benchmarks. It seems to me, and \nit seems to a number of my colleagues who have introduced legislation \nwith me, that we ought to have benchmarks. Whether it is with \nagreements with China, agreements with Canada, or Mexico, or Japan, we \nought to have benchmarks to decide what is the result of what we have \njust done. It doesn't matter to people in this Chamber, apparently, \nthat we are drowning in trade debt that gets worse and worse and worse, \nand yet the worse the trade debt becomes, the more they come to the \nfloor of the Senate crowing about how wonderful it is. I mean, I don't \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. President, we have proposals to have free-trade agreements coming \nbehind the Peru agreement. One is with Panama, one is with Colombia, \nand one is with South Korea. All of them, by the way, are negotiated \nunder something called fast track, where the legislative branch \ngenerously decided it would wear a straitjacket and promise if an \nadministration, any administration, negotiated trade agreements in \nsecret, behind closed doors, where others weren't allowed to venture, \nand they were brought back after an agreement was reached to this \nChamber, the folks in this Chamber who supported that would agree they \nwould prevent the offering of any amendments.\n  So before the action started, they said: We will agree to wear a \nstraitjacket once you have told us what you have done.\n  It is the most unbelievably antidemocratic action, and also an \naction, I think, that undermines the very essence of what the Senate \nshould be about. Nonetheless, that is the method by which these have \nbeen negotiated.\n  Now, fortunately, we will not have additional agreements negotiated \nunder those circumstances because the fast-track authority ran out June \n30, and it will not be restored. But these agreements were negotiated \nunder fast track.\n  Now, let me describe to you, if I might--and I can do this with two \ndozen or 100 products, but I will do it this way because it \ndemonstrates the complete incompetence of our negotiators and the \ncomplete incompetence of our negotiated product. This chart represents \nautomobiles from Korea. And with respect to our trade with Korea in \nautomobiles, it is worth about $9 billion a year. So we have a lot \ngoing on with respect to Korean automobiles. If you drive down the \nstreets of this country, you will find automobiles that come from \nKorea. In fact, in 2005, 740,000 Korean-made cars were put on boats and \nshipped across the ocean to be sold in the United States--740,000 \nKorean-made cars were shipped to the United States to be sold.\n  Well, guess how many U.S. cars we were able to ship to Korea to sell \nin Korea. Not 740,000 but 4,500.\n  So here is the way our trade with Korea looks. All of this white \nrepresents Korean cars put on boats to be sold in America. And this \nlittle car down here? That is the number of cars we were able to sell \nin Korea. In fact, 99 percent of the cars driven on the streets of \nKorea are Korean-made cars, and that is the way they want it. They do \nnot want foreign-made cars in their country. But they want to ship \ntheir cars to America, even as they keep American cars out of their \nmarketplace.\n  We just negotiated a free-trade agreement. Do you think this \nadministration, negotiating in secret, behind closed doors, said to the \nKoreans: You can't do this. It is not fair trade. You are protecting \nyour jobs in Korea and injuring our jobs in the United States, and we \nwill not allow you to do it. Do you think this is corrected? Absolutely \nnot. Not a word. Just fine. Keep doing it. Doesn't matter. This is \nabout high finance. This is about the free-trade model. It works just \nfine.\n  I guess it does if you wear a blue suit and take a shower at the \nstart of the day. But if you are working in a plant someplace making a \ncar and taking a shower at the end of the day because you worked hard, \nit sure doesn't work well for you because you are the one who loses \nyour job down here.\n  Let me describe one other thing. We negotiated an agreement with \nChina that is even more incompetent than this. This is incompetent, and \nI don't know who negotiated it, but this is gross incompetence, in my \njudgment. In China, we have a bilateral agreement on automobiles. Let \nme tell you what it is. As I do, I was in a foreign country the other \nday, and I drove down the street and I saw Chinese cars advertised now \nto be sold in that country. Well, the Chinese cars are coming to this \ncountry. The Chinese are ramping up a very large, very significant \nautomobile export industry, and they are coming, and coming soon--small \ncars, cost very little, presumably efficient, but they are coming. Here \nis what our country said to the country of China, with whom we have a \nvery large trade deficit: We will make a deal. It is true we have a big \ndeficit with you, but we will allow you to ship Chinese cars into the \nAmerican marketplace, and we will charge a 2.5-percent tariff on each \nof your cars. And we agree with you, if we send American cars to be \nsold in China, you may charge a 25-percent tariff on our cars sold in \nyour marketplace. A country with whom we have a $230 billion trade \ndeficit, we said: It is OK if you charge a tariff that is ten times \nhigher than our tariff on mutual automobile trade.\n\n  Incompetent? Sure. Ignorant? You bet. Certainly ignorant of our \neconomic interests. I would like to find one person to stand on the \nfloor of the Senate and say they support that; that is absolutely fair. \nI want just one. I don't need two or three to stand up and say that; I \nwant just one who has the courage to say with respect to bilateral \nautomobile trade with China, bilateral automobile trade with South \nKorea, I think this is just dandy. I think it makes a lot of sense.\n  I use this only to say I could do this in a dozen instances, but I do \nit with respect to automobiles. We don't produce automobiles in North \nDakota, but I do it to say this is a big job-creating industry. \nAutomobile production is a job-creating industry. We traded a lot of \nthat to Mexico in NAFTA, so now the largest import from Mexico is \nautomobiles. But just look at what we are doing with South Korea, and \nwe have just negotiated a new agreement with them and have done nothing \nto solve the problem.\n  Look at what we are doing with China in bilateral trade, and we will \nsee the results of that, even as we now have the largest trade deficit \nin human history with China. Even as that exists, it is going to get \nworse because we are going to have a substantial avalanche of imports \nof Chinese automobiles into this country in circumstances of trade that \nare fundamentally unfair to this country and to this country's workers.\n  Now, let me come back to the point at which I started, and it is a \nWashington Post editorial of today. I don't\n\n[[Page S14684]]\n\nknow how the Washington Post editorial writers would view this. I \nassume they would ignore it because you certainly can't defend it. That \nwhich is not defensible, those who choose to try, do ignore it. But let \nme end as I started today by saying the editorial in today's newspaper \nwhich states a candidate saying ``NAFTA was a mistake'' is engaged in \ndemagoguery really is a thoughtless way to engage in a discussion about \ninternational trade.\n  I come from a State that needs to trade a lot, and we need to find a \nforeign home for a substantial amount of our agricultural production. I \nsupport trade. But I do not support what has happened in recent years, \nand for that I am considered, I suppose by some, as somebody who \ndoesn't get it.\n  If you are not part of a ``free trade'' crowd, you are someone who is \nsome sort of a xenophobic isolationist stooge who can't see over the \nhorizon.\n  The problem is, the American people now understand. Look at the Wall \nStreet Journal poll I referenced. The American people, and not just the \nAmerican people but the subgroup of Republicans, are opposing these \nfree trade models that have resulted in mass trade deficits. They are \nopposing them by a 2-to-1 margin. I think it would do well for people \nto pay heed to that, including people who are serving in public office. \nIt is not that the American people are behind the politicians. The \npolitical system is far behind the American people in being enlightened \nabout what this trade does to our standard of living.\n  I know my colleagues wish to speak, but I will make a couple of other \npoints. We fought for 100 years to raise standards in this country. We \nfought long and we fought hard. People lost their lives because of it. \nWe raised standards. We lifted people up. We said there must be a \nminimum wage, there must be child labor laws, there must be a safe \nworkplace, there must be the right to organize. We did all those things \nand we expanded and built a middle class that was nearly unbelievable. \nOur country became strong--a country in which you can get a job that \npaid well and you had job security; you likely had a retirement program \nand health care; you were proud of what you did and often you went to \nwork for a company and you expected to spend a career working for that \ncompany.\n  Things have changed. All too often these days workers are like \nwrenches, considered to be a tool: use them up, throw them away. Don't \nworry too much about them. That is not an ethic that works well in the \ntraditions of this country.\n  For 100 years, we fought to raise standards in this country and now \npeople say to us our standards somehow do not match standards around \nthe world and so, inevitably, we have to find a way to fit in. Fitting \nin means diminished standards, pushing them down, competing with \nsomeone in a toy factory in Chenghai, China, making 30 cents an hour, \n20 cents an hour. That is not ``fitting in'' in a way that works to \nthis country's best interests.\n  The Presiding Officer is from Chicago. In Chicago, there was a \nwonderful immigrant man who decided to build red wagons and he named \nthem ``Radio Flyer.'' Everyone has ridden in them. The reason he named \nthem Radio Flyers is he loved Marconi. This immigrant who came to this \ncountry and wanted to build something, he loved Marconi and he loved \nairplanes so decided to build his little red wagon in Chicago and he \nnamed it Radio Flyer, little red wagon. For 110 years, it was made in \nIllinois. But it is not anymore. All those little red wagons that are \npulling those little tykes around this country are made in China. It is \nnot just the little red wagon, I could go on forever. Etch-a-sketch, \nfrom Bryan, OH, Huffy bicycle, they are all gone. Everyone who worked \nfor all those companies, their jobs are gone.\n  Why? Because some have decided to say we should be able to compete \nwith 20-cents-an-hour, 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day. That is not \nwhat represents the best of the standards we created over the last \ncentury and should not be what we accept.\n  I am in favor of bringing to the floor of the Senate a debate about \ntrade and the conditions under which trade represents mutually \nbeneficial conditions for those with whom we trade and for us as well. \nBut I will not continue to vote on trade agreements and cast my vote in \nan affirmative way on trade agreements that do not have benchmarks and \naccountability, that represent what we believe to be the best interests \nof our country and our workers.\n  We shall and we will and we are participating in the global economy. \nBut we have a right as a nation to decide the conditions under which we \nwill participate in that. Those conditions ought to be to pull others \nup, not push us down. That is why I believe the American workers--\njudging by that Wall Street Journal poll and I think judging by the \nlast election--American workers and the American voters understand what \nis at stake. It is not about standing up and saying I support this \nmantra, this slogan of free trade. It is about saying America wants to \nbe a leader in trade and that leadership should lead in the direction \nof supporting workers, of supporting the standards we have built.\n  It is interesting now in recent months, and somewhat disconcerting, \nthat we are now seeing the product of globalization. It has many faces, \nsome wonderful and some not too good. One of those faces comes from a \ntoy shelf in which a wonderful looking toy that is to be sold for a \nyoung child's Christmas present this Christmas season turns out to be \npoison. It comes from a plant, I assume, produced by a contracting \ncompany in China. They all say--whoops, sorry, excuse me.\n  Would that have happened in Ohio or Michigan? Would they have been \nable to use those standards that produce unsafe toys? I don't think so. \nWhy? Because we have regulations and standards and we have enforcement. \nThat is the difference.\n  I believe when we talk about trade agreements--whether it is Peru, \nChina, NAFTA, CAFTA--I think we ought to be talking about benchmarks \nand standards and we ought to be talking about things that represent \nthe best interests of this country.\n  Let me finish, again, by saying I support trade and plenty of it, but \nI demand and insist it be fair trade and I demand and insist that this \nadministration and others begin fixing some of the problems they have \ncreated in past agreements that I think undermine this country's \neconomic interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, when the Senator from the \nDakotas was telling us about the little red wagon, the American Flyer \nfrom Chicago, of course what immediately hit my mind was that little \nRed Flyer produced there today may well be painted with lead paint.\n  As the Senator from Illinois, who is presiding, and I and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota have gotten into this issue of the tainted toys, here \nwe are, approaching the holiday season and people are out buying these \nChristmas presents; they want to make their children happy, but they \nare, indeed, now having to go an extra measure to beware of all the \ntoys because of what we have seen, that the Chinese industry simply \nwill not police itself. The Chinese Government will not insist on the \nindustry policing itself.\n  If we are going to protect the American consumer, we ought to be able \nto rely on our Consumer Product Safety Commission when, in fact, the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission is nonfunctional. It has a workbench \nabout the size of two of these desks with all of the products stacked \non it, and that is their research facility to determine if those \nproducts, in fact, are lethal to the children of this country.\n  The acting chairman of that commission will come in front of the \nSenate and say she does not want any more money for the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission to hire additional staff to change what is a \ndiscombobulated card table, with all the products on top of it, into an \nefficient laboratory that can actually check as to whether these \nproducts are safe.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has made a lot of points with regard to \nautomobiles. He has made a lot points with regard to products and how \nAmerica, in these trade negotiations, gets fleeced, taken advantage of. \nThis Senator does not believe that is the case with this particular \nagreement that we are going to vote on tomorrow. That is so for this \nreason: The United States\n\n[[Page S14685]]\n\nhas already opened its markets to most imports from Peru through trade \npreference legislation, meaning that 98 percent of all the imports from \nPeru already enter our country duty free. But do the flip side of this. \nWhat Senator Dorgan was talking about is equal trade, but the fact is \nnow, without this agreement, U.S. exporters do not have the same access \nto Peruvian markets that the Peruvian exporters have to the U.S. \nmarkets market. U.S. products entering Peru face tariffs that average \n10 percent. In order for there to be free trade, it has to be a two-way \nstreet. We both have to benefit from a duty-free environment. In fact, \nafter the implementation of this agreement, most of the tariffs on U.S. \nexports to Peru will be eliminated. That is my bottom line. That is why \nI am going to support this trade agreement. That is my American hat.\n  Let me put on my Florida hat. This is certainly going to be of \nbenefit to Florida. We have already seen the benefits of free trade--\nfor example, in a trade agreement that we have with Chile. Florida's \nexports after the trade agreement, exports to Chile, have grown by 70 \npercent. Take, for example, Jordan. After we enacted the Jordan Free \nTrade Agreement--that was about 5 or 6 years ago--Florida's exports to \nJordan have increased 1,100 percent.\n  Like those, I believe this Peru trade agreement will open new markets \nfor Florida businesses. It is going to lead to increased exports to \nPeru from Florida through Florida's ports.\n  Let me give some examples. Florida's exports of transportation and \nmanufacturing equipment will benefit from this trade agreement. In \n2006, Florida companies exported $42 million in transportation \nequipment and $180 million in machinery manufacturers to Peru. The \nelimination in this agreement of those Peruvian tariffs on those kind \nof high-value pieces of equipment is going to provide a competitive \nboost to Florida exporters who will no longer be facing tariffs that \nare as high as 12 percent. With the passage of this agreement, Florida \ncompanies will have a chance to take full advantage of Peru's growing \ndemand for their equipment.\n  Support for free trade doesn't mean we need to go out and compromise \non other things, some of which the Senator from North Dakota has \nmentioned, or that we would compromise on our support for human rights \nor the environment. That is why this particular Peruvian agreement \nincludes numerous environmental and labor protections.\n  For these reasons, I am going to support this free trade agreement.\n  Mr. President, while I am here, I wish to say a couple other things \nabout a couple other matters that have to do with Latin America. There \nwas a very significant vote in Venezuela yesterday. Basically, \nPresident Hugo Chavez wanted to amend their country's Constitution to \nallow him to become President for life. In a very narrow vote, the \npeople rose up and they said no. He is in office until 2012, under the \ncurrent Constitution, so Hugo Chavez will continue his brand of \nleadership. There are people in this Chamber who have reached out to \nPresident Chavez to take a more moderate, conciliatory roll, a roll \nwhere the two countries, the United States and Venezuela, could work \ntogether. In almost all cases, he has rejected those overtures.\n  This Senator is one of those who has reached out to him. He has \ncharted his course and he wanted to be President for life and the \nVenezuelan people, albeit by a very narrow margin, said no. If that is \na signal to the President of Venezuela that there ought to be a \ndifferent way that he ought to approach other countries, particularly \nthe United States, then hopefully that is a message President Chavez \nmight consider.\n  I want to say another thing about Latin America. Last Friday we saw \nthe first evidence in 4 years that three American hostages held by the \nFARC in Colombia are alive. These images give us hope. They also remind \nus that securing their safe release and the return to their families \nmust be a top priority. And it is. Without making speeches, this \nSenator from Florida is constantly speaking in private conversations to \nthe Government of the United States, and to Latin American leaders, \nabout helping in securing the release of these Americans and of a \nFrench citizen, a former Senator in the Colombian Government.\n  There are other hostages as well. It is my understanding they are \nColombian. But, of course, our responsibility is to our own Americans. \nSo there is hope. Because this was the first time, to the outside \nworld, that we have seen the visual images that they are alive. Let us \nhave that as a constant reminder to keep pressing the FARC that it is \nin their interest and in humanity's interest to release these \nAmericans.\n  I will conclude on a completely different topic. I must say with \nabsolute frankness that I was saddened when I heard that the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, Mr. Lott, was going to resign. I think he is one of \nthe most delightful of all the Members of this body, in a legislative \nbody of some exceptionally talented and engaging people. We have seen \nSenator Lot use his legislative prowess, often in a bipartisan way, to \nbring about the consensus in order to get things done and to move the \nlegislative process along, which is so necessary and, as the good book \nsays: For us to come and reason together.\n  He has been a legislative master who got along so well as the \nmajority leader with Senator Daschle, the minority leader, and then, \nbecause of the turn of events in 2001, for Senator Lott, the minority \nleader, to get along with Senator Daschle, the majority leader, so they \ncould move the business of the Senate along.\n  He is a personal friend. I have had the privilege of going to the \nUniversity of Mississippi to speak on a forum at the Trent Lott \nInstitute at that great university. And for this Senator, he will be \nvery much missed in the Senate. We wish him and Tricia and all his \nfamily God speed.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this day is long overdue. But the fact \nthat this day has arrived for the consideration of the Peru Trade \nPromotion Agreement Implementation Act is still a good day to have \nhappen, even though it should have happened several months ago. In \nfact, I would say it should have happened last year.\n  But the same problems that kept it from coming up this year were in \nplace last year. I strongly support this bill. I urge my colleagues to \ndo the same. Over the past 7 years, Congress has passed implementing \nbills for trade agreements with 12 countries. Of these 12, 7 are \nlocated in Latin America.\n  The implementation of those agreements demonstrated our commitment to \nstrengthening our relations with our neighbors in Latin America. We now \nhave an opportunity to build on that commitment by implementing our \ntrade agreement with the country of Peru.\n  At the same time, these agreements serve to advance our national \ninterest. Too often we talk in terms of the economic interests of the \nUnited States when it comes to trade. We ought to be looking at things \nbeyond the economics of trade. I say these agreements advance more than \nour economic interests; they advance a broader national interest \nbecause they foster transparency and increased respect for the rule of \nlaw in international business transactions.\n  I think it goes beyond the business transactions, because with every \nbusiness transaction, there are millions of people involved. And even \nthough we in the political world or our diplomats feel we are more \nimportant than anybody else in bringing about peaceful relations, our \nwork is kind of a spit in the ocean compared to what millions of \nbusiness people every day do for America and for other countries \ninteracting among each other, breaking down barriers that often lead to \nmisunderstandings and an enhanced understanding between people. They \nhave an awful lot to do with the promotion of international peace.\n  I think it goes even further, and I don't remember who I quote when I \nsay this because I have been quoting it for so many years, but it is \nsomething such as: Nations that trade together do not war, or something \nof that nature.\n\n[[Page S14686]]\n\nThat is a paraphrasing of that concept. But I believe that. That is why \nI believe in breaking down trade barriers, as this Peru bill does. It \nenhances international understanding and peace as well as enhancing our \neconomic interests.\n  This bill then creates more opportunities for increased economic \ngrowth and prosperity in neighboring economies which help to foster \npolitical stability which is important within those borders. But \npolitical stability within a country's borders also enhances \ninternational stability.\n  That is particularly important in the Western Hemisphere and the \nSouth American Continent, as well as the part of the Western Hemisphere \nwe call Central America. Because we need meaningful alternatives to \ncombat the production and trade of elicit narcotics, another factor \nthat maybe applies to these countries more than a lot of countries we \ntrade with.\n  Perhaps most importantly, these trade agreements level the playing \nfield for U.S. producers and exporters. I had a chance, before \nspeaking, to hear Senator Nelson of Florida speak. To hear this from \nthe Democratic side of the aisle is very important because it is a \nfact: This bill levels the playing field to give our exporters and \nproducers access to Peru the same way Peru has had access to our \nmarkets and our people for decades under trade preference.\n\n  During my time in the Senate, I have heard some of my colleagues \ncomplain that the global trade situation reflects an uneven playing \nfield. Now, to some extent, I agree. That is why I am a promoter of \nmore free trade agreements. The Doha round of the World Trade \nOrganization negotiations is leveling this playing field.\n  So right now it is uneven. It is not as level for American exporters \nas it ought to be. But if you looked at the last 50 years when this \nprocess started, soon after World War II, under the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade, you would find it was much more--or a lot less \nlevel than it is right now.\n  So we have made considerable progress and we need to build on what is \na success, very much a success. Because in too many cases, the duties \nthat our trading partners impose on U.S. exports are much higher than \nthe duties we impose on theirs. As I have said, that is certainly the \nsituation with Peru. Right now, some 97 percent of imports from Peru \nenter the United States duty free.\n  I do not know whether Senator Nelson used that specific percentage \nthat I gave, but he was speaking of the fact that Peru had preference \nto coming into the United States. This bill gives our producers and \nexporters the same preference there. Our exports to Peru face duties \nthat range from 12 to 25 percent. Specific examples: Peru's tariff on \nU.S. pork exports to that country, and this is a major product of my \nState of Iowa, is as high as 25 percent, while Peru's exports to the \nUnited States are duty free.\n  Now, that is what I call a one-way street. This unbalanced situation \nis largely the result of unilateral trade benefits that we extended to \nPeru under what I called the preference situation. But this is \nspecifically under what we call the Andean Trade Preferences Act.\n  This trade agreement before the Senate today will restore balance to \nour trade relationships with Peru. I do not want you to take my word \nfor it. The impartial U.S. International Trade Commission analyzed our \ntrade agreement with Peru. The Agency found, and I quote:\n\n       Given the substantially larger tariffs faced by U.S. \n     exporters to Peru, than Peruvian exporters to the United \n     States, the trade agreement is likely to result in a much \n     larger increase in U.S. Exports than U.S. imports.\n\n  The International Trade Commission of our U.S. Government goes on to \nstate that:\n\n       The agreement will likely increase U.S. exports to Peru by \n     25 percent, while Peruvian exports to the United States will \n     grow by 8 percent.\n\n  Now, that is a win-win situation for U.S. producers and exporters. \nAnd why anybody would vote against an agreement like that I could not \nunderstand, and I am not anticipating that people will vote against it, \nbut I do know, in the months of this year that we have discussed trade, \nI have heard a lot of negative attitude toward trade, how harmful it is \nto the U.S. economy. But if any Member who has said those things during \nthe course of this year would look at the bill that is before the \nSenate right now, that is going to increase U.S. exports to Peru by 25 \npercent while Peruvian exports to the United States will grow by 8 \npercent, then if they vote against this, they are not addressing the \nconcerns they are giving speeches about all this year. The benefits of \nthis trade agreement are going to spread across all major sectors of \nthe economy. I say that because I quoted agricultural benefits. But \nbesides U.S. agricultural producers, manufacturers and service \nproviders all stand to gain from this agreement. The ITC--the \nInternational Trade Commission--predicts the agreement will have a \n``substantial, positive'' effect on U.S. exports to Peru of the major \nU.S. commodities of pork, beef, corn, wheat, and rice. The American \nFarm Bureau Federation predicts that U.S. farm sales to Peru could \nincrease by more than $700 million with full implementation of the \ntrade agreement. U.S. rice exports to Peru will grow tenfold to \nfifteenfold as a result of this agreement, while U.S. exports of corn \nwill double.\n\n  The National Pork Producers Council says that the Peru trade \nagreement is a ``state-of-the-art agreement for pork producers to which \nall future trade agreements will be compared.'' Our manufacturers will \nenjoy significant benefits as well. For example, Whirlpool \nCorporation--this is a Michigan corporation which recently bought \nMaytag in Newton, IA, and closed that plant down, but they still have a \nmassive manufacturing plant in Amana, IA--appeared before the Finance \nCommittee to testify on behalf of this trade agreement. Whirlpool \nexports refrigerators, ranges, and clothes washers to Peru. It \nmanufactures those products in several States besides Iowa, including \nArkansas, Indiana, Ohio, and Tennessee. Whirlpool told the Finance \nCommittee that the Peru agreement will eliminate the 15- to 20-percent \ntariffs Peru imposes on Whirlpool products. In part because of this \nagreement, Whirlpool expects its U.S. exports to Peru to increase 400 \npercent within the next 2 years. In Whirlpool's view, the elimination \nof Peru's tariffs on its products will allow Whirlpool to maintain jobs \nin the United States rather than relocating or expanding operations \nabroad.\n  Here again, how many times have we heard on this floor the legitimate \nconcern--I am not finding fault--about outsourcing of manufacturing \njobs to other countries? You can imagine why that might happen if we \nhave a 10- to 12-percent tariff going into Peru. But people who say \nthose things in this body ought to vote for this bill if it is going to \nlevel the playing field for Whirlpool workers so we can maintain those \njobs in the States I cited.\n  U.S. service providers will also gain from this agreement because \nPeru has agreed to exceed the commitments it made on services, even in \nthe World Trade Organization. So we get something better than we have \nunder WTO rules right now when we have a free-trade agreement with \nPeru. Peru, thus, has agreed to accord substantial market access across \nthe entire service regime, with very few exceptions, using the so-\ncalled negative list approach.\n  So to those of my colleagues who complain that the current world \ntrade situation is unfair, here is a chance to improve that situation. \nBy implementing this agreement, Congress will level the playing field \nfor U.S. farmers, U.S. manufacturers, and U.S. service providers in \nthis important market. The agreement will boost U.S. exports, creating \njobs, keeping existing jobs in the United States. There have been \nstudies, various studies, but the one I always quote says that jobs in \nthe United States--that those products or services that are exported, \nthose jobs are jobs that pay 15 percent above the national average. So \nthey are not only jobs, they are good-paying jobs.\n  I understand there is a rising sense of protectionism in the \nCongress. I alluded to that in my remarks today. But I would like to \nhave Members look at the facts. Take, for example, the Central American \nFree Trade Agreement, otherwise known as CAFTA. CAFTA entered into \nforce for four of our trading partners last year. It is already \npossible to see the results of bringing their tariffs in line with \nours.\n\n[[Page S14687]]\n\nGuess what. As you might expect, leveling the playing field has brought \npositive results.\n  I wish to use the U.S. Department of Commerce as a source. They say \nour exports to the four countries increased 18 percent in 2006, while \nour imports were up 3 percent. I don't know how many Members voted \nagainst that last year, but I would imagine it was close to 40, give or \ntake a few. I would like to have those 40 Members who probably voted \nagainst this, saying that free-trade agreements are not good, look at \nthe facts. So far, our exports have increased 18 percent, while our \nimports from those countries of Central America were up 3 percent. \nLeveling the playing field helps American farmers, manufacturers, and \nservice providers. Then maybe you would think it was wrong to vote \nagainst CAFTA last year. As a result of this increase of our exports by \n18 percent, our trade balance swung from a $1.2 billion deficit in 2005 \nto a $1 billion surplus in 2006.\n  How many times on the Senate floor have we heard one of the examples \nof something that is bad about free-trade agreements is because of our \nterrible trade deficit? Our trade deficit is too high. If American \nconsumers would quit spending on imports and if they would save some of \ntheir money, we wouldn't have as much of a trade deficit as we have. \nBut the American consumer, including probably this consumer, lives too \nmuch for today and forgets about tomorrow. Chuck Grassley may be too \nmaterialistic for the good of our trade deficit. If we spend a little \nless money and save a little bit more, invest in Treasury bonds instead \nof letting foreign countries buy them up, we would be better off. But \nfor those Senators who have made speeches against how terrible our \ntrade deficit is and then use that as an excuse to vote against CAFTA, \ndon't they feel they were wrong by voting against a bill that finally \npassed that brought us from a $1.2 billion trade deficit with these \ncountries to a $1 billion surplus in just 1 year? That is what happens \nwhen you level the playing field.\n  We are not the only ones who stand to benefit from our agreement with \nPeru. Peruvians will benefit significantly as well. They have already \nbenefited from the goodness of the U.S. people by letting them have \ntrade preferences for all these decades. But even beyond what they have \nalready had, a bill that is significantly much more benefit to the \nUnited States than it is to Peru, Peru is still going to benefit. The \nagreement will increase opportunities for continued economic growth in \nPeru and help Peru further develop and modernize its economy. By \nentering into the agreement, Peru has demonstrated its intention to \nstrengthen its ties with the United States and lock in economic \nreform--economic reforms that they are going to benefit from, not us--\nand it is going to enhance their transparency and respect for the rule \nof law.\n\n  Agreements such as this are what the rule of law is all about. The \nrule of law in international trade is just as important as the rule of \nlaw for domestic America because within our own rule of law, everything \nis predictable. It has credibility and predictability. When you put the \nsame regime in international trade, you have predictability and \ncredibility. You enhance opportunities for people to work closer \nbecause they know what the other side is going to do, if you have equal \nrespect for the law. All of this will serve to increase investor \nconfidence in Peru and its economy.\n  These are critically important objectives. We live in a challenging \ntime. There is a growing division in Latin America today. Venezuela's \nPresident is using oil wealth to lure allies to his socialist vision. \nHe has announced plans to turn Venezuela into a socialist republic. He \nhas nationalized Venezuela's telecom and electricity companies and \nwrested the oil industry from private companies. He has demonstrated \nonce again that those who withdraw economic rights often seek to \nwithdraw political rights. Those who centralize economic power tend to \nalso centralize political power. For example, he pulled the \nbroadcasting license of one of Venezuela's oldest television \nbroadcasters, which also happens to be one of his major critics. He \nassumed new powers that allow him to rule by decree, and he pushed for \na new constitution that would abolish Presidential term limits, \nallowing him to stay in power indefinitely. His former Defense Minister \nhas called the plan ``fraudulent'' and akin to a coup. I don't know \nwhether the final results are in, but he may have lost that referendum \nyesterday. At lease for my part, I hope that is what the final results \nshow. But he is still going to be the dictator and the authoritarian \nthat he has been for the last 9 years.\n  Chavez has said that this rejection, if it happens by the voters, is \nnot a defeat, and he plans to proceed on whatever his goals are. His \nformer Defense Minister has cautioned that he may seek to impose these \nchanges through a different route than constitutional reform. So you \nlose an election, and you find some other way to accomplish the same \nthing.\n  I have talked about Venezuela and the environment of the Peru trade \nagreement because our relationships with Latin America will be enhanced \nthrough free-trade agreements. We ought to help countries like Peru \nthat are not going in the direction of Venezuela as much as we should, \nparticularly in light of the fact that two other countries in the \nregion--Bolivia and Ecuador--are also trending in a similar direction.\n  Bolivia's President Morales nationalized the hydrocarbon sector by \nexecutive decree. As a result, investors were forced to sign new \ncontracts that guarantee a greater percentage of revenue for the \nGovernment. He also seized a foreign-owned tin smelter without \ncompensation. Instead of a free-trade agreement with the United States, \nPresident Morales joined President Chavez's so-called Bolivarian \nalternative for the Americas. He strengthened ties, at the same time, \nwith Cuba and Iran.\n  President Correa of Ecuador has also reached out to Iran. He has \ncalled the United States ``the most protectionist country in history.'' \nHe also said that free trade is ``dangerous'' for countries like \nEcuador.\n  I hope Correa, the President of Ecuador, will remember these \nstatements he has made about the United States, saying the United \nStates is ``the most protectionist country in history.'' He also said \nthat free trade is ``dangerous'' for countries like his.\n  I hope he remembers those things when he comes around to the Congress \nin about 2 or 3 months wanting an extension of the Andean trade pact, \nwhere he wants preferences from our taxpayers so he can say these \ndastardly things about our country, which obviously are not true, but \nthey are good for the propaganda purposes that he makes them, because \nhe said these things even though we give imports from Ecuador duty-free \naccess to our markets under our unilateral preference programs.\n  Now, the difference between Peru and Ecuador is this: Ecuador and \nPeru have had the same trade preferences with our country to get their \nproducts in here duty free for the last several decades, but Ecuador \nstops negotiating with the United States on a free-trade agreement and \nPeru goes ahead and negotiates with us. Yet Ecuador is going to be \ncoming to us in a couple months saying to us we ought to continue the \ntrade preferences with them, when they say these things about us: They \nfeel more comfortable with Chavez and the Cuban and Iranian dictators \nthan they do with us Americans. I have questioned why we should \ncontinue providing such duty-free access to our markets, but that is an \nissue we will deal with in 2 or 3 months.\n  The point is, there is a growing divide in Latin America. On the \nother side of the divide you find countries such as Peru and Colombia, \nallies of the United States whose Governments have gone out on a limb \nto strengthen bilateral relations with us. It is imperative we respond \nin kind and not turn our backs on these important allies. I expect we \nwill soon approve our trade agreement with Peru. After that, we should \nmove as quickly as possible to implement our trade agreements with \nColombia and Panama, for the same reasons we ought to be approving this \nPeruvian agreement. That is what I envisioned when the bipartisan \ncompromise on trade was reached May 10. I will return to that point in \njust a moment.\n  I am not alone in calling for approval and implementation of the \nPeruvian agreement. Just last month, the New\n\n[[Page S14688]]\n\nYork Times called for passage of our trade agreement with Peru. They \neditorialized that ``it would be a folly for the United States to turn \nits back on trade.'' The paper also noted that all eight living former \nSecretaries of State have urged Congress to approve the Peru agreement.\n  In October, the Agriculture Coalition for Latin American Trade, which \nis comprised of 50 different agricultural organizations, called for \ncongressional approval of the Peru trade agreement. This agreement is \nalso supported by the National Association of Manufacturers and the \nCoalition of Service Industries, among other business groups.\n  In sum, there is widespread recognition of the benefits of this trade \nagreement for the United States.\n  Before concluding, I would like to address three other issues that \nhave arisen with respect to free-trade agreements even beyond the \nPeruvian agreement. The first is the claim by some that these \nagreements undermine our food safety laws. The second is the charge \nthat we are not enforcing our existing trade agreements. And the third \nis the May 10 bipartisan compromise on trade between the administration \nand the new congressional leadership that took over on the Hill in \nJanuary.\n  In recent days, some of my Senate colleagues have criticized the \npassage of the Peru agreement in the House. One Senator went so far as \nto say the agreement ``will result in more unsafe food in our kitchens \nand consumer products in our children's bedrooms.'' Now, let's just \nthink about that for a minute. That is quite an accusation. How could \nCongress possibly support such an agreement? The answer is simple: We \nare not supporting that position by voting for this agreement because \nthe accusation is false. If you do not believe me, then just look at \nthe text of the agreement. Chapter 6 of the agreement addresses the \ntypes of ``sanitary'' laws related to food safety. There is absolutely \nnothing in the chapter that would lead to a lowering of our food safety \nstandards. In fact, one of the explicit objectives of the chapter is to \n``protect human, animal, or plant life or health in the Parties' \nterritories.'' ``[T]he Parties' territories'' means the United States \nand Peru. In addition, this chapter is not even subject to dispute \nsettlement. So there is no way Peru could use the chapter to challenge \nour food safety laws, even if the chapter provided a basis to do so; \nand the agreement does not.\n  For over 20 years, opponents of our trade agreements have argued they \nwould undermine our food and product safety laws. Yet, in those 20 \nyears, there has not been a single challenge to any one of these laws--\nnot a single challenge. That is because these complaints have no \nfoundation. If people want to criticize our trade agreements, they are \ncertainly free to do that. That is their right. But they should base \ntheir criticisms on facts, not on scare tactics.\n  I have also heard colleagues say that we should not enter into any \ntrade agreements until the administration does a better job of \nenforcing existing agreements. In my view, the administration is doing \na pretty good job of enforcing our trade agreements. But I suppose that \neven Chuck Grassley will look at specific problems we have. Maybe we \nought to be doing more. But there are some examples that I think you \nought to give the administration credit for.\n  The administration is challenging Europe's subsidies to Airbus, and \nup until last week it was pursuing at least four different cases \nagainst China in the World Trade Organization. So you might say: What \nhas changed? Well, our U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Schwab, \nannounced we had concluded an agreement by which China agreed to \nterminate eight subsidies we were challenging under World Trade \nOrganization rules. This was just last Friday. The termination of those \nsubsidies will bring significant relief to our manufacturers and \nexporters who have been confronting unfairly subsidized competition \nfrom the Chinese. In this case, we achieved our objectives without \nhaving to resort to that lengthy WTO process of litigation. That is a \ncomplete success story, in my book. As for the other three pending \ncases, we will continue to pursue our rights in the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  If you ask me, the problem is not a shortage of enforcement. The \nbigger problem is that people are complaining about foreign government \nactions that are not yet subject to agreed-upon rules. In other words, \nthe problem is not the failure to enforce the rules; it is that there \nare no rules to enforce in certain areas. If you want to solve problems \nthat are not currently subject to rules, we should be negotiating more \ntrade agreements, not fewer. Get the rules in place, and then get those \nrules violated--if that is what is going to happen, and you hope that \ndoes not happen--and then enforce them. But you cannot enforce a rule \nthat is not there. For example, the administration recently announced \nit is negotiating a new anticounterfeiting trade agreement. That is a \nstep in the right direction. Such an agreement would help get at \nproblems such as the counterfeiting of the Underwriters Laboratories \nlogo. That is an important safety issue.\n\n  If we are serious about wanting to get at these types of problems, we \nshould give the President a new grant of trade promotion authority and \nsend our negotiators out to solve those problems. If we turn our back \non new agreements, our trading partners will continue negotiating among \nthemselves, leaving us behind. That is what happened the last time \nCongress denied President Clinton trade promotion authority, I think in \n1995. It was not reinstated until 2002. During that period of time, our \ntrading partners concluded over 130 preferential trade agreements. We \nhad only two.\n  So do you folks in this body who say we should not give the President \ntrade promotion authority want to go back to the regime of other \ncountries doing what they want to do? They will do it anyway, but we do \nnot have an opportunity to keep up if we do not give our President that \nauthority. Do you want to have the United States have an unlevel \nplaying field in the case of the history of those 130 preferential \ntrade agreements that were negotiated while our President did not have \nauthority to do it, while we did, too, or do you think maybe our \nPresident ought to be negotiating the same number, to level the same \nplaying field for the workers in America that other governments are \ngiving their workers for an opportunity to have a level playing field? \nThat cannot happen if the President does not have trade promotion \nauthority.\n  We have only managed to regain some lost ground in the last 5 years. \nThese agreements before the Senate--Peru and the 14 over the last few \nyears--are examples. So the President needs to have trade promotion \nauthority so he can continue to keep negotiating so we can create more \njobs in America and export more and have a level playing field where we \ndo not have that level playing field.\n  Finally, I want to mention the bipartisan May 10 agreement on trade \nthat made it possible for us to move forward with this Peru agreement \nand, hopefully, makes it possible to move forward in the case of Panama \nand Colombia.\n  This year, the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate demanded \nadditional provisions in our trade agreements before they would agree \nto implement them. That is the result of the last election. When people \ngive their will to a different majority in this Congress, we have to \nrespect that. I think the Democrats were fair and responsible in the \nagreements that were reached. I am willing to go along with them. Those \nare not necessarily things I would have agreed to if we had still been \nin a majority and probably would not have had to negotiate. But the \nDemocrats won the last election.\n  So after lengthy negotiations, the administration agreed to a \ncompromise that the House Democratic leadership announced with great \nfanfare on May 10, 2007. The Democratic leadership described the deal \nas a ``historic breakthrough'' and a ``fundamental shift in U.S. trade \npolicy'' that achieved results they have been seeking for years. As a \nresult of this compromise, the administration negotiated conforming \nchanges in the labor and environment chapters and the provisions on \nGovernment procurement, investment, and intellectual property. For \nexample, in the wake of the agreement, disputes arising under the labor \nand environment chapters are subject to the same\n\n[[Page S14689]]\n\ndispute settlement procedures as every other obligation of the \nagreement. Now, we can debate whether that change was actually a good \nidea, but it satisfied a longstanding demand of the Democrats who have \nopposed our trade agreements in the past. The same goes for the other \nchanges encompassed in the May 10 compromise.\n  The administration followed through by negotiating the necessary \nchanges to incorporate the May 10 compromise into each of our pending \ntrade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Now we \nare moving on Peru. But since the administration has carried out its \nresponsibilities under the May 10 compromise with the Democrats and it \nis good enough to get Peru passed, it ought to be good enough to get \nColombia and Panama passed real quickly and South Korea after some \nkinks are worked out in the South Korean negotiations.\n  Unfortunately, we have very little to show for those efforts other \nthan Peru right now. It has been almost 7 months. We still have not \nimplemented a single pending trade agreement. We will soon change that \nwith our vote on the Peru trade agreement. But there is no sign of \nmovement on the horizon for the next pending trade agreements, and our \ndruthers there are to go with the agreement with Colombia first. The \nfact there is not movement in these other areas troubles me greatly.\n  I hope to see most of my Democratic colleagues join me in voting to \nimplement this trade agreement with Peru. After we have done so, I very \nmuch hope they will join me again in supporting implementation of our \ntrade agreement with Colombia as soon as possible in this Congress. Our \nagriculture producers, manufacturers, and our service providers are \ncounting on us. Our allies are counting on us. It is in our economic \ninterest, and it is in our national interest. It is in the interest of \ngreater opportunities for international peace. We cannot let those \nopportunities embodied in these trade agreements slip by us.\n  One final, concluding remark, and it is repeating the same thing \nseveral times, and that is that Peru has had opportunities to come and \nbring their products to the United States without tariffs for decades. \nWe have had to pay duties to get our products into Peru. This gives our \nmanufacturers, our farmers, and our service providers the opportunity \nto finally get our products into Peru duty free.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I rise this evening in strong \nopposition to the Peru Free Trade Agreement. It seems to me that most \nAmericans understand that our current trade policies are failing. They \nsee this every day when they go shopping and they buy products that are \nmade in China--made all over the world--but that it is increasingly \ndifficult to find a product manufactured in the United States of \nAmerica. They understand our trade policies are failing when they note \nour trade deficit is huge and growing larger every single year. It \nseems to me that before we go forward again in pursuit of a failing \ntrade agenda, we might want to sit back, take a moratorium, understand \nwhy our trade policies are failing, and then put together trade \nagreements that work for the working people and the middle class of \nthis country, rather than just the CEOs of large multinational \ncorporations. That is what I think we should be doing; not rushing \nhelter skelter along the direction of failed trade policies.\n  One of the major reasons that the middle class in the United States \nis shrinking, poverty is increasing, and the gap between the rich and \nthe poor is growing wider is, in fact, due to our disastrous, \nunfettered free trade policies. In my opinion, the last thing we should \nbe doing now is passing another job-destroying, NAFTA-style free trade \nagreement.\n  Before we vote on this piece of legislation, I think it is terribly \nimportant that we as a Senate take a hard look at the current state of \nour economy. Now, if our economy is doing well for the middle class, if \nour trade policies are creating good-paying jobs, if our trade policies \nare moving toward eliminating poverty, if our trade policies are making \nus a more egalitarian society, let's go forward; but, in fact, if our \ntrade policies are moving in exactly the wrong direction for the middle \nclass, I think we should take a deep breath and not go forward in that \ndirection.\n  Let's take a look at in fact what is happening in our economy today \nsince President Bush has been in office.\n  Nearly 5 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and \ninto poverty. In fact, today, the United States has the highest rate of \npoverty of any major country on Earth. Madam President, 8.6 million \nAmericans have lost their health insurance, and some 47 million \nAmericans now have health insurance. Median household income for \nworking-age families has gone down by nearly $2,500 since President \nBush has been in office. Over 3 million good-paying manufacturing jobs \nhave been lost. Three million American workers have lost their \npensions. Wages and salaries are now at their lowest share of GDP since \n1929. The United States has the largest gap between the rich and the \npoor of any major developed country on Earth. Incredibly, in 2005, the \ntop 1 percent earned more income than the bottom 50 percent. According \nto Forbes Magazine, the collective net worth of the wealthiest 400 \nAmericans increased by $120 billion last year to $1.25 trillion.\n  Now, is our current trade policy responsible for all of these \neconomic trends? The answer, obviously, is no. Our current trade \npolicies are not the sole cause for the decline of the middle class and \nthe increase in poverty. But has unfettered free trade significantly \ncontributed to the shrinking of the middle class and the increase in \nincome inequality? The answer is absolutely, it has.\n  So the point I am making this evening is if you like the way the \neconomy is going, with a shrinking middle class and an increase in \npoverty and a growing gap between the very rich and everybody else, I \nguess we should go forward on these trade policies. But if you don't \nlike the direction of the economy of the United States--and the \noverwhelming majority of people in this country do not like where the \neconomy is going--I think we need a new direction in our trade \npolicies.\n  According to the Institute for International Economics, 39 percent of \nthe increase in income inequality in our country is due to our \nunfettered free trade policy. According to the Center for Economic and \nPolicy Research, unfettered free trade has caused the wages of American \nworkers without a college degree to be slashed by over 12 percent. When \nwe talk about economics, we often look at the problem from a general \nsense, but if we focus on what is happening, especially to those people \nwho are high school graduates, what we are seeing is a severe decline \nin wages for that subset of the American population. Those people are \nstruggling very hard to keep their heads above water economically.\n  We now have a record-breaking $765 billion trade deficit, including a \n$232 billion trade deficit with China, and a $64 billion trade deficit \nwith Mexico. Today, we now have the fewest manufacturing jobs than at \nany time since Dwight David Eisenhower was President of our country.\n  If the United States is to remain a major industrial power, producing \nreal products and creating good-paying jobs, we must develop a new set \nof trade policies which work for the middle class of this country and \nnot just for the CEOs of large corporations. As the Presiding Officer \nwell knows, coming from the great State of Michigan, it was not so many \nyears ago that General Motors was the largest employer in the United \nStates. By and large, those people who worked for General Motors had \ngood wages, good benefits, and a strong union to represent them. Today, \nthe largest employer in the United States is Wal-Mart--low wages, \nvehemently antiunion, and minimum benefits. That is the transformation \nof the American economy, and that is a metaphor for why the middle \nclass in America today is shrinking.\n  Unfortunately, the Peru Free Trade Agreement is another failed trade \npolicy among many other failed trade policies. In fact, in large part, \nthis Free Trade Agreement, the Peru agreement,\n\n[[Page S14690]]\n\nwas modeled after the North American Free Trade Agreement--NAFTA. So I \nguess the bottom line here is, if you like NAFTA, you will like the \nPeru Free Trade Agreement. Most people in this country do not like \nNAFTA.\n  Has NAFTA been a success? Well, we have some information. We have \nsome figures. Let's take a look. Supporters of unfettered free trade \ntold us over and over again that NAFTA would increase jobs in the \nUnited States. I was a Member of the House of Representatives during \nthat debate. I remember it like it was yesterday: NAFTA is going to \ncreate all kinds of new jobs. Unfortunately, according to the Economic \nPolicy Institute, NAFTA has led to the elimination of over 1 million \nAmerican jobs. Well, NAFTA cost us 1 million American jobs. Do we want \nto go down that road with other trade agreements that will also lead to \nthe loss of jobs and the lowering of wages? I think not.\n  Supporters of unfettered free trade told us during that debate that \nNAFTA would significantly reduce the flow of illegal immigration into \nthis country because the standard of living in Mexico would increase.\n  Well, that issue need not be discussed for too long because nobody \nbelieves that has happened. Sadly, as we all know, as a result of \nNAFTA, severe poverty in Mexico has increased; 1.3 million small \nfarmers in Mexico have lost their farms. They have been displaced and \nreal wages for the majority of Mexicans have gone down. All of this--\nthe loss of farms, the decline in wages, and the increase in extreme \npoverty in Mexico--is directly opposite of what they told us NAFTA \nwould do, and it has led to a 60-percent annual increase in illegal \nimmigration from Mexico during the first 6 years of NAFTA alone.\n  So they told us NAFTA would create more jobs in America. Wrong. We \nlost jobs. They told us NAFTA would increase the standard of living of \npeople in Mexico and stop illegal immigration. Wrong. Extreme poverty \nin Mexico has gone up; over a million people lost their farms, and \nillegal immigration to the U.S. has increased. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Yet \npeople say we were wrong, wrong, wrong, and I guess we should continue \nto go down that same path. That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\n  One of the interesting aspects of unfettered free trade in the United \nStates, and all over the world, is that it results in very large \nincreases in income inequality. That is true in the United States, and \nit is also true in Mexico, where the gap between the rich and poor in \nthat country has skyrocketed.\n  You would be interested to know that one man in Mexico--we all have \nto admit that at least one guy in Mexico has significantly benefited \nfrom NAFTA, and that is the telecommunications mogul, Carlos Slim. He \nhas done very well by NAFTA. He recently surpassed Bill Gates as the \nwealthiest person in the world, and he--from Mexico--is worth over $60 \nbillion. He is the richest guy in the world and is from a poor country. \nAmazingly, Mr. Slim is worth more than the bottom 45 percent of the \npeople of Mexico. One man has more wealth than the bottom 45 percent of \nthe people in Mexico. Frankly, that is obscene.\n  That is obscene, but that is one of the manifestations of unfettered \nfree trade. In that case, it is in a very extreme way. In fact, while \nNAFTA helped make Mr. Slim the wealthiest person in the world, about \nhalf of the Mexican population lives on less than $5 a day. How about \nthat. One guy is worth $60 billion, and half of the population there \nlives on $5 a day. That is a manifestation of unfettered free trade. \nThe Slim family fortune is equivalent to 8 percent of Mexico's gross \ndomestic product. So, in Mexico, you have one man who is worth $60 \nbillion, while extreme poverty in that country has increased and small \nfarmers have been driven off the land.\n  That has been the result of NAFTA in Mexico. I am afraid that, if we \ncontinue to move down that road, this will be the same in terms of the \nPeru Free Trade Agreement.\n  In addition, before we vote on this unfettered free trade agreement, \nI think we need to closely examine our unfettered free trade policy \nwith China because China is the 600-pound gorilla in the whole issue. \nSupporters of unfettered free trade told us that PNTR with China would \nlead to the creation of hundreds of thousands of American jobs. That is \nwhat they said. Well, unfortunately, they were wrong again. Instead, as \na result of PNTR with China, nearly 2 million decent-paying American \njobs have been displaced.\n  As we speak, there are millions of men, women, and kids in this \ncountry who are going out Christmas shopping. This is the time of year \npeople do that. When people go to stores--whether they are large \ndepartment stores or small stores--and they buy stuff, they find that \nalmost everything that they are buying--whether it is footwear, \ntelephones, clothing, computers, you name the product--is manufactured \nin China. They are not manufactured in the United States of America.\n  I recently held a series of town meetings, and I asked people in my \nState--and we are a small State. Unlike Michigan, we are not a major \nmanufacturing center. Yet in the last 6 years, in Vermont, we have lost \n25 percent of our manufacturing jobs. What kind of a country are we \ngoing to be if we are not producing the products people consume? Do you \nthink we can be a great economy simply by flipping hamburgers? I don't \nthink so.\n  I will tell you, there are people who worry about the military future \nof our country, our national security, when we are not even producing \nthe products that our military needs. Since PNTR with China, our trade \ndeficit with that country has nearly tripled to $232 billion, and that \nis a huge and growing trade deficit.\n  Today, over 80 percent of the toys sold in the United States are made \nin China. About 90 percent, for example, of the vitamin C--I take \nvitamin C--is made in China; 80 percent of all shoes we purchase in the \nUnited States are made in China; 90 percent of U.S. furniture \nproduction has moved to China; 85 percent of bicycles sold in the \nUnited States are made in China; half of all the apple juice imported \nto the United States comes from China; the United States imports more \nadvanced technologies from China than any other country. We are not \njust talking about stuffed teddy bears or sneakers, we are now talking \nabout highly advanced technology that is developing in China.\n  I have a simple question: Why is it that, in Vermont, Michigan, and \nall over this country corporations are shutting down and moving abroad? \nWouldn't it be a nice idea that if these guys wanted Americans to buy \ntheir products--which they do--how about manufacturing some of them in \nthe United States of America?\n  As I mentioned, I did a series of town meetings and I talked to the \npeople in my State. I said: When was the last major manufacturing plant \nbuilt in the State of Vermont? People can't quite remember, but it was \na very fine plant built by a company called Husky. They are good jobs \nand it is a good plant. That was a long time ago. Nobody can remember \nany new plants being built in Vermont. By the way, I think that is true \nfor most locations in America. Yet I was in China 5 years ago and I saw \na lot of American companies building new plants in China--not in the \nUnited States of America. I think this is an issue we have to get a \nhandle on.\n  The irony is that a few years ago when I was in the House, in honor \nof 9/11, we had a ceremony to commemorate and memorialize the people \nmurdered that day, and they distributed American flags to us. Those \nflags were made in China. Since September 11, 2001, over 100 million \nAmerican flags sold in this country were made in China. We are not even \nmaking American flags in the United States of America.\n  Before we pass yet another unfettered free trade agreement--this time \nwith Peru--we have to fundamentally fix the broken trade policies we \nhave with China and Mexico. That is not just Senator Bernie Sanders \ntalking; this is the view of the overwhelming majority of Republicans, \nDemocrats, and Independents.\n\n  Let me refer you to a recent Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll. In \nthat poll--maybe 2 months ago--it indicated that 59 percent of \nRepublicans and 54 percent of Democrats believed that unfettered free \ntrade has been bad for the U.S. economy. Probably the only room full of \npeople we could find in America who think that unfettered free trade is \na good idea is this room right here. I\n\n[[Page S14691]]\n\nthink Republicans understand it is not working, Democrats and \nIndependents understand it is not working, and maybe the Senate should \nstart listening to the American people who are experiencing the tragedy \nof unfettered free trade.\n  We have been told this particular trade agreement with Peru is \ndifferent than the other trade agreements. We have been told this \nagreement has strong labor and environmental standards. If that is \ntrue, then why is it that not one major group representing the \ninterests of labor, the environment, consumers, family farmers, \nreligious organizations or Latino civil rights organizations supports \nthis agreement? To the best of my knowledge, not one does.\n  In fact, the Peru Free Trade Agreement is being opposed by the \nTeamsters, the International Association of Machinists, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, UNITE-HERE, the League \nof United Latin American Citizens, Oxfam, Public Citizen, and numerous \nreligious organizations in our country.\n  In Peru, this unfettered free trade agreement is opposed by both of \nPeru's labor federations, and a prominent archbishop, among others. \nEven more troubling is the fact that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nwhich strongly supports this trade agreement and all trade agreements, \nhas said they have been ``encouraged by assurances that the labor \nprovisions cannot be read to require compliance with ILO conventions.''\n  In other words, the labor standards in this agreement may not be \nworth the paper they are written on--or at least that is the view of \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  According to a recent report by Columbia law professor Mark \nBarenberg, the so-called labor standards included in this legislation \nare ``even worse than existing law'' and ``in no respect do the \nagreement's labor provisions mark a significant improvement.''\n  Perhaps most important is this fact: The minimum wage in Peru is \nabout 91 cents an hour. So what we are saying to workers in this \ncountry is that there is your competition. You are going to be \ncompeting against people who make 91 cents an hour. I think that is \nwrong. I do not think that America should be forced to compete against \npeople in Peru, or any other country on Earth, where people earn such \nlittle money.\n  In industry after industry, corporate America is shipping our \nmanufacturing plants, our good-paying jobs, overseas, where desperate \npeople are forced to work for pennies an hour.\n  That bottom line is what unfettered free trade is about. The largest \ncorporations in this country have pushed unfettered free trade for \nyears. They have succeeded and they have gotten what they want. They \nwant to pay people in China 50 cents an hour; in Peru, a dollar an \nhour, rather than paying American workers a living wage here, \nrespecting the environment here and free independent trade unions here.\n  Our corporate friends have won this debate, and the result of that is \nthat the middle class is shrinking, poverty is increasing, and the \nwealthiest people in this country have never had it so good.\n  At a time when the poorest people in this country are seeing \nunprecedented desperation, when the gap between the people on top and \neverybody else is growing wider and wider and most of the new jobs \nprojected for the future are low-wage jobs with minimal benefits, that \nis the future.\n  The great economic struggle of our time is whether the middle class \nof our Nation can be saved. That is what it is about. What the American \ndream was about--and this was true in my household--is my parents \nstarted with very little and they worked hard, with the hope that their \nkids would do better than they did. That is the American dream, and it \nhas taken place here for such a long time.\n  Right now, if we don't begin to deal with our current economic \npolicies, including disastrous trade policies, there is a strong \nlikelihood that our children--the young generation of today--will, for \nthe first time in the modern history of this country, have the dubious \ndistinction of having a lower standard of living than their \nparents. That is a reality that we have to prevent. I don't want to see \nus participating in the race to the bottom. I don't want to see our \nkids being poorer than their parents. There are a number of factors for \nthat happening. Anyone who does not think that unfettered free trade is \none of the reasons for the decline of the middle class I think is dead \nwrong.\n\n  The word has got to go out loudly and clearly to companies such as \nWal-Mart, General Electric, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Boeing, and \nhundreds of other corporations that they cannot keep sending America's \nfuture to low-wage countries.\n  Trade is a good thing, and let me reiterate that point. I believe \ntrade is a good thing, but it must be based on principles that are fair \nto American workers. The U.S. Congress can no longer allow corporate \nAmerica to sell out the middle class of our country and move our \neconomy abroad.\n  A number of years ago, I think speaking for virtually all of \ncorporate America, Jeff Immelt, who is the CEO of General Electric, one \nof the largest corporations in America, said:\n\n       When I am talking to GE managers, I talk China, China, \n     China, China, China. You need to be there. I'm a nut on \n     China. Outsourcing to China is going to grow to 5 billion.\n\n  That is what corporate America is saying. That is what unfettered \nfree trade is all about, and it is time we told Mr. Immelt and the \nother CEOs of large corporations that if they want to sell their \nproducts in this country, they are going to have to start producing \ntheir products in this country.\n  It is not acceptable that Thomas Donohue, the CEO of the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, ``urges'' American companies to send jobs abroad. They \nactually think this is good.\n  It is not acceptable that Bill Gates, who has many wonderful \nqualities, tells us that Communist, authoritarian China has created a \n``brand new form of capitalism, and as a consumer it is the best thing \nthat ever happened.'' With all due respect to Mr. Gates, I disagree.\n  We must tell these corporate leaders to stop outsourcing our jobs \noverseas and stop outsourcing the future of our country. We must demand \nthey start investing in the United States of America and create good-\npaying jobs here. We must rebuild our manufacturing base. Then we can \ntalk about passing trade agreements that work for the middle class of \nthis country while at the same time lifting standards throughout the \nworld.\n  I want a race that takes all people up, not a race to the bottom. And \nthat, among many other reasons, is why we should reject the Peru free-\ntrade agreement.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy remarks, if Senator Domenici is on the Senate floor, he be the next \nto speak, and if he is not, Senator Salazar be the next to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first I thank you for your words \nregarding what we need to be doing on trade and what has happened \nregarding unfettered trade. Coming from the great State of Michigan, \nthe manufacturing hub of this country and of the world over decades and \ndecades, I could not agree more with what is happening in terms of jobs \ngoing overseas. I see it in the eyes of thousands, in fact, hundreds of \nthousands of people; 250,000 people in my State who have lost their \njobs just since this President has taken office, people working hard \nevery day who just want to make a living for their kids and know the \npension they paid into is going to be there and health care and that \nthey can send their kids to college and have all the things they wanted \nfor their children, have the great American dream. They have watched \nthat dream slip away for themselves and their families.\n  I thank you for your words.\n  I go another step in terms of what I think we need to be doing to \nsupport manufacturing here and a level playing field because, in \naddition to what has been said about Peru as one more trade agreement--\nand I agree with that\n\n[[Page S14692]]\n\nstatement, ``one more trade agreement''--that is on the books without \nother provisions in place, there are certainly things that we can and \nneed to be doing to support and encourage those manufacturing jobs in \nAmerica.\n  As I noted in the Finance Committee, as a member of the Finance \nCommittee, the Peru free-trade agreement is a tough one for me in a \nsense that I know colleagues have worked very hard to bring in new \nlanguage. My friend and colleague in the House, Congressman Rangel, and \nSenator Levin, certainly our chairman of the Finance Committee and the \nranking member, have been working to have this agreement reflect our \ncountry's values when it comes to labor and environmental standards.\n  The truth is, I wish we had had these kinds of standards in previous \nagreements. Getting the right words on paper is important, but \nunfortunately it is not enough to get them on paper. They are on paper \nin these agreements, but that is not enough when it comes to the \nfamilies of my State and the people of America who want to make sure \nthe American dream is available to them and their families.\n  I would like to believe these words will translate into action. It is \nhard to be convinced we are going to enforce our trade laws when we \njust start from the basis that we have the smallest trade enforcement \noffice of any industrialized country in the world. That gives an \nindication of the priority of enforcing trade laws compared to what is \nhappening in other countries.\n  We have more than 230 trade agreements on the books to enforce, and \nwe have the smallest trade enforcement agency of any country in the \nindustrialized world. It should be no surprise that there has been a \nhuge increase in dangerous products coming across our borders and that \nmore and more countries are testing the resolve of our trade laws and \nare, in fact, cheating on those trade laws.\n\n  The administration has simply lost credibility with the American \npeople. No one believes this administration will enforce current trade \nagreements. No one believes currency manipulation will stop and \ncertainly that the administration will take any action. This is \nsomething I have been focused on now since coming to the Senate, and \nevery year--every 6 months, in fact--we get a report from the Treasury \nSecretary: No action. Currency manipulation is not really happening or \nthey don't mean it or they will do better in China if we trust them, \nand more and more jobs are going overseas because of that trade policy.\n  No one believes unsafe imported products will be kept away from our \nchildren. No one believes at this time that this agreement will end up \nleveling the playing field on trade. No one believes that point \nbecause, unfortunately, based on past actions, it is not true. We have \ntoo many businesses that have faced patent violations and unfair \npricing. We have seen small businesses in my State, as well as large, \nthat make a product and have had a Chinese company come in and steal \neverything about that product, not only the patents, but the packaging, \nthe directions on the package, and make the product for a small \nfraction of what it cost to actually make it.\n  I have small businesses in my State that have stopped making products \nbecause they cannot afford the cost to fight the Chinese Government to \nstop the trade infringement.\n  Those unfortunate incidents have meant people in my State have lost \ntheir jobs. I have one small business owner who makes hand trucks used \nto carry boxes and products, to move them around, who created one type \nof hand truck. It was stolen and produced by a Chinese company. This \nperson could not afford to take action.\n  He said to me: Where is my Government stepping in to help me? But he \ncould not afford the $10,000 a month retainer of an attorney to try to \nfigure out how to stop them, so he stopped making the product and 50 \npeople in the northern Michigan town of Cadillac lost their jobs--50 \npeople. For that town, that is a lot of people. In fact, anywhere, if \nyou are 1 of those 50, that is a lot of people.\n  We have too many dangerous products that have put our families and \nchildren in harm's way because foreign countries are not following the \nrules and our own country does not hold them accountable.\n  We have too many American families sitting on waiting lists for \ntraining that they were promised by this Government, the Federal \nGovernment of America, that they would receive if they lost their job \nbecause of trade.\n  We have a whole range of things that are not happening that have been \npromised.\n  This is what the people of my State see, and I believe the American \npeople see. They see unsafe products. They see illegal trade practices. \nThey see lost jobs devastating communities, lowering the standard of \nliving, loss of the middle class that has resulted from previous trade \nagreements that were not enforced and that were not fair. That is what \nthey see.\n  I simply cannot support another trade agreement until we get this \nright. I cannot support a trade agreement ahead of enforcing our trade \nlaws, improving product safety, keeping our promises to working \nAmericans, and ensuring a level playing field for businesses and \nworkers, all of which are achievable if we make American businesses and \nAmerican workers our priority. If we make that our priority, we can \nmake the changes necessary so that trade works for us, rather than \nhaving it be a situation where instead of exporting our products, we \nare exporting our jobs. That is why the right words on paper just are \nnot enough. We have to have the right trade agenda--a trade agenda that \nhelps working families adjust and be able to thrive in a global economy \nbecause we are making more products and selling more products and \ncreating more jobs here, one that is based on a sense of credible trade \nenforcement so other countries know we are serious about jobs and \nbusinesses in our country, and one, frankly, that lets other countries \nknow we are serious about protecting our people as it relates to \nsafety, which is also very important.\n  In 2006, 1 year ago, 37,000 people in Michigan lost their jobs \nspecifically and directly because of trade--37,000--but only 4,100 \nreceived any kind of trade adjustment help--training, the ability to go \nback to school to be able to get some assistance to be able to start a \nnew career. That means 90 percent of the people who were affected, who \nlost their jobs, are not receiving funds that were promised under trade \nadjustment assistance because of various caps or the fact that we have \nnot authorized that critical program.\n  And just extending it is not enough. How do I tell 33,000 people who \nwere told that the Federal Government would help them through this \nadjustment period, through training and increased investments and new \njobs, how do I tell them that, in fact, 90 percent of the people in \ntheir same situation got no help whatsoever?\n  Communities also need assistance. In Michigan, many communities have \nbeen devastated by the loss of a large plant or industrial facility. I \nwill give one example, and this is very much about the race to the \nbottom, Mr. President. You spoke about it, and I speak about it all the \ntime. When Electrolux, which makes refrigerators in Greenville, MI--a \ncity of 8,000 people, with almost 3,000 of those people employed at \nthis one plant--when they decided to pick up and go to Mexico where \nthey could pay $1.57 an hour, with no health benefits, there was a huge \neffort that came about to be able to work with them to stay. The \nGovernor came in, the mayor came in, and others, saying: We will help \nyou refinance a plant. We will give you tax incentives. Tell us how we \ncan help you to be able to be competitive, to be able to stay in \nGreenville, MI. I met with them on many occasions, asking: What can we \ndo to partner with you to support you. The end analysis was that the \nState essentially said no taxes at all. We offered to help them build \nnew plants, and none of it was enough because they said: You can't \ncompete with $1.57 an hour and no health benefits.\n  So this really is about whether we are going to compete down to a \nlower standard of living and lose the middle class and lose the \nAmerican dream, or whether we are going to compete up. I believe if we \ncompete up with a different trade agenda, a different broadly held \nagenda that will strengthen America, that we, in fact, can keep our \njobs. But one piece of that is to make sure\n\n[[Page S14693]]\n\nthat when 2,700-plus people in Greenville, MI, or when a whole \ncommunity is devastated by their largest employer leaving, that there \nis some assistance not only for the workers but the small businesses \nand for others there to help during the transition.\n  In fact, we need to make sure we have a broader agenda that not only \nlevels the playing field on trade, enforcing trade laws, having the \nright kind of trade policy, but that we are also addressing health care \ncosts in this country, the largest cost for our businesses, and \nchanging the way we fund health care, getting it off the back of \nbusiness, and addressing other costs that are noncompetitive that we \ncan address. Then we need to race like crazy on education and \ninnovation. That is the race up, which we, the new majority, \nunderstand, as evidenced by our passing the largest financial aid \npackage for college since the GI bill, by focusing and refocusing our \nefforts on math and science and technology investments.\n  So there is a way to make this a race up. But it is not just passing \none more trade bill, one more trade law, one more agreement, without \naddressing all of these other issues. One of the other big issues for \nus is currency manipulation. This is something I am pleased to say the \nFinance Committee has begun to address with a bill that has come out of \ncommittee. We have not had the opportunity to have that on the floor \nyet, to bring that up, but right now we are in a situation where, \nagain, because of governmental policies, because of China specifically, \nwhere they can peg the value of their money, their currency, in a way \nso that when their products come into us, on top of paying 60 cents or \na dollar an hour and not having health care costs and all the other \nthings, they can undercut us and get up to a 40-percent discount on \nthat product coming in.\n  So when the President talked about Wal-Mart, when you look at the \nnumber of Chinese products and why they are lower, they also get a 40-\npercent discount on their price just from currency manipulation, which \nis illegal. So before we pass another trade agreement, why don't we fix \nthat? Why don't we make sure we have the toughest possible policies \nthat will stop the loss of jobs because of currency manipulation?\n  We have also, among trade enforcement, the need to beef up our trade \noffice. And I am very pleased Senator Lindsey Graham and I have been \nworking on this now for some time to create a trade enforcement \ndivision, headed by a trade enforcement officer, an independent trade \nenforcement officer--we have called it a U.S. trade prosecutor--to be \nable to truly beef up our enforcement.\n  I am pleased Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley, our leaders on \nfinance, have put together a broader enforcement bill, which I support, \nand include many of our provisions and aspects of our bill in their \nbill. That needs to get done. And I know the chairman is committed to \nhaving that happen, and I am anxious to join him in moving that through \nso that we can truly have credibility in the world, with other \ncountries; that we mean it when we say there is a trade agreement and \nwe expect other people to follow the rules.\n  But what do we see from the administration? There have been a couple \nof efforts, and I appreciate the few times they have moved forward to \ntry to do something. There is an effort going on in auto parts now, but \nit is very little and it is very late, as we watch more and more jobs \nleaving this country. And I am very concerned, very disappointed when I \nsee that this administration has not moved forward at all on any real \naction on currency manipulation or any number of trade enforcement \nissues. In fact, last week, the administration claimed victory for \ndeveloping a voluntary agreement with China on illegal subsidies, an \nagreement that requires a great deal of trust with China. It is hard to \nunderstand they would continue to trust on a voluntary basis a country \nthat has broken agreements and international policies over and over and \nover.\n  Furthermore, haven't we learned our lesson with voluntary agreements? \nLike the one completed with South Korea that was intended to, in fact, \nallow us to open up more opportunities to make automobiles here and be \nable to sell them to South Korea. Two agreements, not one, two \nvoluntary agreements, and the exact opposite happened with 700,000 \nvehicles now coming in from South Korea, and we are barely able to get \n5,000 back in to them. So voluntary agreements in the past have not \nworked. And given how many jobs we are losing, today is not the time \nfor another voluntary agreement. We need, in fact, to put our muscle \nbehind tough enforcement processes. We are quickly losing our standard \nof living and our middle class in this country. There is a need for \nurgency that has not been there and is not there today with the \nadministration.\n\n  As a result of the trade policies we have in place now, we have an \nexploding trade deficit, which has increased from $380 billion in 2000 \nto $758 billion just last year. Since this administration has been in \noffice, the trade deficit has more than doubled, and with it the number \nof dangerous products coming in, the number of layoffs, the number of \nwaiting lists for people who need retraining, the number of businesses \nlosing their patents, losing their products, and their ability to sell \ntheir products because of currency manipulation. That is the legacy of \nthis administration.\n  I don't believe it is a time to reward them with another trade \nagreement. Before we go any further in passing trade agreements, Mr. \nPresident, we have to get our trade policy right. Regardless of the \nspecifics of the trade agreement, regardless of the words on paper, we \nbetter be able to back them up, and today we cannot. We haven't backed \nup words on paper. We can no longer say pass a trade agreement, we will \nfix it later, we will enforce it later, we will change it later, or we \nwill help people later. We have to do these things now so we have \ncredibility with the American people who are counting on us to fight \nfor them and to understand that in the greatest country in the world, \nit is time to stand up for the middle class in this country, get our \ntrade policy right, and stand up for the people who have worked hard to \nmake this country great.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nUnited States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, which I intend to support \ntomorrow morning with my vote.\n  First, I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for their efforts \nin shepherding the Peru Free Trade Agreement through the Finance \nCommittee, where it passed with very strong bipartisan support. I \ncongratulate them for bringing the agreement to the Senate floor today, \nand I thank our majority leader, Senator Reid, for giving us the \nopportunity to have the free-trade agreement debated on the Senate \nfloor today.\n  At the outset, Madam President, I put this in historical context for \nme. It was almost 409 years ago that my family founded the city of \nSanta Fe, NM. And in the four centuries since, you see a very unique \nand positive relationship between the United States and the nations to \nthe south of the United States. It is a relationship which is bound \ntogether in history and in culture and in the landscape of the Western \nHemisphere. It is a future which I hope we can work on together in the \nUnited States with our colleague nations to the south in order to \ndevelop an even stronger hemisphere.\n  It was in that vein of thinking that Senator John Kennedy, at the \noutset of his administration, spoke fervently about the future of the \nAlliance For Progress with the Western Hemisphere. It is in that same \nvein that I was honored to be a part of a codel that was led by our own \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, before he was sworn in to be majority \nleader, when he took six Senators to Bolivia and to Peru and to \nEcuador, trying to make a statement to South America that they were not \nto be a forgotten continent.\n  It was in that same vein that in my very first meeting with President \nGeorge W. Bush, I spoke to him about the importance of not having every \nounce of his foreign policy agenda consumed by what was happening in \nIraq, but to make sure that he was looking at events and relationships \nthroughout the world, and that one of those most\n\n[[Page S14694]]\n\nimportant of relationships is the relationship we have with the nations \nin Latin America, with both Central and South America.\n  It is in that vein that this legislation, the Peru Free Trade \nAgreement, is important for us as we move forward in trying to \nestablish the right kind of relationships between the United States and \nthe rest of the Western Hemisphere. I believe in the benefits of free \nand fair trade. I believe that by working to lower trade barriers and \nto expand access to foreign markets we can strengthen the U.S. economy \nin a way that benefits both businesses and workers and enhances our \nrelationship with friends and allies in important parts of the world.\n  The Peru Free Trade Agreement is the first of four FTAs that are \ncurrently pending in Congress, three of which are with countries in \nSouth America and Central America. As such, the Peru FTA represents an \nimportant step forward in an effort to strengthen our ties, both \neconomic and diplomatic, with our neighbors in this hemisphere.\n  Earlier this year, as I said, I traveled with Senators Harry Reid, \nDick Durbin, Bob Bennett, Judd Gregg, and Kent Conrad to South America. \nThe last stop on our trip was the nation of Peru. I came away from that \nvisit with a strong sense of how important it is for us to bolster our \neconomic and diplomatic ties with Peru and countries such as \nPeru. Doing so will be critical to our economic and our national \nsecurity and to the effort to restore America's standing in the world \ncommunity.\n\n  The trade agreement we are discussing today is largely possible \nbecause of changes that have taken place in Peru in the last decade. \nAnnual exports over the last 15 years have increased from $3.4 billion \nto $23 billion; annual per capita income for the people of Peru has \ndoubled, from $1,500 to $3,200. That is a significant economic set of \nchanges within Peru and within our trade relationship with the country \nof Peru.\n  In the meantime, coca production, a major concern of ours with \nrespect to Peru, has decreased dramatically, thanks in large part to \nthe eradication, interdiction, and other efforts to develop economic \nopportunities for the Peruvian people.\n  Perhaps most important, incidents of terrorism have decreased from \nnearly 3,000 in 1991 to less than 100 in 2006. Let me say that again. \nIncidents of terrorism, violent militancy in Peru, have decreased from \nnearly 3,000 in 1991--that wasn't so long ago--to now less than 100 in \nthe year 2006.\n  The United States has been a strong partner in helping to keep Peru \non this promising path. As a result, along with countries such as \nColombia and Brazil, Peru helps to form an oasis of favorable \nsentiments toward the United States in a region where our standing has \ntaken major negative hits in recent years.\n  When our delegation, led by Senator Reid, met with President Alan \nGarcia in Peru, we had an opportunity to discuss how the relationship \nbetween our two nations has developed over the course of the past \nseveral decades, beginning with the key role Peru played in World War \nII when it provided the United States with the military bases we so \nmuch needed from which we monitored the activities of our military and \nour Navy in the Pacific.\n  At that meeting with President Garcia, we also discussed President \nKennedy's Alliance for Progress, President Kennedy's initiative to \nstrengthen ties between North and South America at the beginning of the \nCold War. When President Kennedy outlined the goals of the alliance in \n1961, he proposed--and I quote from his historic statement:\n\n        . . . to build a hemisphere where all men can hope for a \n     suitable standard of living and all can live out their lives \n     in dignity and in freedom. . . . Let us once again transform \n     the American Continent into a vast crucible of revolutionary \n     ideas and efforts, a tribute to the power of the creative \n     energies of free men and women, an example to all the world \n     that liberty and progress walk hand in hand.\n\n  That was President Kennedy's effort to try to shine the spotlight of \na new relationship between the United States and the countries to the \nsouth in Latin America.\n  The Alliance for Progress is not a perfect alliance, but it certainly \ngave a message which has been missing throughout much of the history of \nthe United States and certainly missing the last 6 years, that the \nrelationship between the United States and South America is important \nfrom a strategic point of view for national security because these are \nthe countries located in this hemisphere, that border us to the south, \nand also because of the economic relationship between the United States \nand Latin America.\n  Passing this free-trade agreement will help us build on the trade \nrelationship that already exists between the United States and Peru \nand, in my view, will help us move in the right direction.\n  I wish to speak briefly about why the Peru Free Trade Agreement is \nimportant.\n  First, from my point of view, the Peru Free Trade Agreement is \nimportant for America's economic security. It will benefit both \nbusinesses and workers in the long run. In an increasingly global \neconomy, America is facing growing competition on a number of different \nfronts. In order to preserve our standing as the world economic leader \nand to ensure that American businesses continue to set the standard for \nthe world community, we must expand economic opportunities in foreign \nmarkets. If foreign countries face obstacles to trade with the United \nStates, they will take their business elsewhere.\n  It is worth pointing out that many Peruvian businesses already have \nunfettered access to the U.S. market as a result of Andean Trade \nPreference Agreement, which we have supported here on the floor of this \nChamber. U.S. businesses, including the farmers and ranchers of my \nState, deserve to have that same access to the Peruvian market.\n  Second, the Peru FTA and others like it are important for America's \nnational security interests around the world. In a part of the world \nwhere negative feelings toward the United States have grown and grown \nin recent years and as we strive to restore America's standing around \nthe world, it is vitally important to recognize those friendships we do \nhave and to do whatever we can to strengthen those friendships. Peru is \na prominent example of an ally that has stood by us year after year. It \nwould be a mistake not to return the favor here today and tomorrow by \nhelping Peru continue its impressive progress of the past 15 years.\n  Additionally, a growing Peruvian economy with increased ties to the \nUnited States will help Peru continue to make progress on human rights \nand serve as an effective buffer against terrorist groups that have \nclaimed more than 35,000 lives in Peru over the last 30 years.\n  Finally, I am proud of the historic relationship between the United \nStates and Latin America, but it is a relationship that we, candidly, \nmust work on to strengthen into the 21st century and beyond. Of course, \nfree-trade policies, as the Presiding Officer has pointed out often on \nthe floor of the Senate, have consequences that we cannot overlook and \nthat must be addressed.\n  As the U.S. economy evolves to meet the demands of the 21st century \nand adjusts to handle increased competition from foreign businesses \nhere in America, we all know there are winners and there are losers. \nThat is why we need to ensure that the playing field is a fair playing \nfield by doing our best to hold our trading partners to the same \nenvironmental and labor standards American businesses must meet. The \nbipartisan May 10 agreement of this year, which has been incorporated \ninto the Peru FTA, is an important part of that effort. All of us--\nDemocrats and Republicans, businesses, workers, and the environmental \ncommunity--need to work to build on that progress to ensure our trade \npolicies can strengthen our economic security and our national security \nin a way that is fair and that does not hurt workers and does not hurt \nthe environment.\n  We also need to act as soon as possible to reauthorize and strengthen \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance Program so that American workers, \nbusinesses, and farmers who are adversely affected by our trade \npolicies can receive the assistance they need as they strive to be part \nof the 21st century global economy.\n  I believe we can move forward on trade in a way that addresses these \nlegitimate concerns without preventing us from expanding opportunities \nfor American businesses in foreign markets. I believe the Peru Free \nTrade\n\n[[Page S14695]]\n\nAgreement does an excellent job of meeting both objectives. For all the \nreasons I have outlined today, I supported the free-trade agreement \nwhen it was in the Finance Committee, and I will support it on the \nfloor of the Senate. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14695-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Mr. President, as the Senate begins its final work period \nof the year, I want to thank those members of the Judiciary Committee \nwho have been working so hard throughout this year in helping us \nfulfill our duties with respect to nominations.\n  Given the work of the Senators serving on the Judiciary Committee, \nthe Senate is in position to confirm 40 judicial nominees for lifetime \nappointments to the Federal bench this year, including 6 more of this \nPresident's circuit court nominees.\n  The Senate has already acted to confirm 36 lifetime judicial \nappointments. Remaining on the Senate Executive calendar are the \nnominations of John Daniel Tinder to the Court of Appeals for the \nSeventh Circuit, Amul R. Thapar to the Eastern District of Kentucky, \nJoseph Normand Laplante to the District of New Hampshire, and Thomas D. \nSchroeder to the Middle District of North Carolina. When they are \nconfirmed, and with the cooperation of Senators they can be confirmed \nthis month, we will have exceeded the yearly total in each of the last \n3 years when a Republican majority managed the Senate and the \nconsideration of this Republican President's nominations. Indeed, we \nare proceeding on vacancies before they arise in some cases.\n  When we conclude our work on judicial nominations this year, we will \nhave exceeded the totals in 2004, 2005, or 2006 when a Republican-led \nSenate was considering this President's nominees. We are exceeding the \ntotals confirmed in 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2000, when a Republican-led \nSenate was considering President Clinton's nominees. We are even \nexceeding the totals in 1989 and 1993 when a Democratic-led Senate was \nconsidering President Clinton's nominees. This year's total will be \nalmost two dozen more confirmations than were achieved during the 1996 \nsession when Republicans refused to proceed to confirm any of President \nClinton's circuit court nominations.\n  We continue to make progress on circuit court nominations. The six \ncircuit court nominees confirmed this year matches the total circuit \ncourt confirmations for 2001. We will have exceeded the circuit court \ntotals achieved in 2004 when a Republican-led Senate was considering \nthis President's circuit nominees; in 1983, when a Republican-led \nSenate was considering President Reagan's nominees; in 1993, when a \nDemocratic-led Senate was considering President Clinton's nominees; \nand, of course, the 1996 session during which a Republican-led Senate \ndid not confirm a single one of President Clinton's circuit nominees \nthe entire session.\n  It is a little known fact that during the Bush Presidency, more \ncircuit judges, more district judges--more total judges--were confirmed \nin the first 24 months that I served as Judiciary chairman than during \nthe 2-year tenures of either of the two Republican chairmen working \nwith Republican Senate majorities.\n  I continue to try to find ways to make progress. Last month, I sent \nthe President a letter urging him to work with me, Senator Specter, and \nhome State Senators to send us more well-qualified, consensus \nnominations. To reward me for reaching out again and extending the \nolive branch to him, this President responded not by replying to my \nletter but by a much ballyhooed partisan speech before the Federal \nSociety annual dinner.\n  I have been concerned that several recent nominations seem to be part \nof an effort to pick political fights rather than judges to fill \nvacancies. For example, President Bush nominated Duncan Getchell to one \nof Virginia's Fourth Circuit vacancies over the objections of both \nrespected Virginia Senators, one a Republican and one a Democrat. They \nhad submitted a list of five recommended nominations, and specifically \nwarned the White House not to nominate Mr. Getchell.\n  In addition, we have succeeded in dramatically lowering vacancies \nand, in particular, circuit vacancies. We have helped cut the circuit \nvacancies from a high water mark of 32 in the early days of this \nadministration to as low as 13 this year. Contrast that with the \nRepublican-led Senate's lack of action on President Clinton's moderate \nand qualified nominees that resulted in increasing circuit vacancies \nduring the Clinton years from 17 when he was inaugurated to 26 at the \nend of his term. During those years, the Republican-led Senate engaged \nin strenuous and successful efforts under the radar to keep circuit \njudgeships vacant in anticipation of a Republican President. More than \n60 percent of current circuit court judges were appointed by Republican \nPresidents, with the current President having appointed more than 30 \npercent of the active circuit judges already.\n  Of the remaining vacancies, 20--more than one-third--have no nominee. \nOf the 17 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be judicial \nemergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for 8, nearly \nhalf of them. Of the 14 circuit court vacancies, 4--about one-third--\nare without a nominee. If the President would work with the Senators \nfrom Michigan, Rhode Island, Maryland, California, New Jersey, and \nVirginia, we could be in position to make even more progress.\n  Of the vacancies without any nominee, the President has violated the \ntimeline he set for himself at least 12 times--12 have been vacant \nwithout so much as a nominee for more than 180 days. The number of \nviolations may in fact be much higher since the President said he would \nnominate within 180 days of receiving notice that there would be a \nvacancy or intended retirement rather than from the vacancy itself. We \nconservatively estimate that he also violated his own rule 13 times in \nconnection with the nominations he has made. That would mean that with \nrespect to approximately 46 vacancies, the President is out of \ncompliance with his own rule more than half of the time.\n  So I thank the members of the Judiciary Committee for their hard work \nconsidering these important nominations. I thank especially those \nSenators who have given generously of their time to chair confirmation \nhearings throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14695-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14695-S14696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ROADRUNNER COMPUTER\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today's Washington Post Science section \ncontains an excellent summary on the work America is doing to develop \nthe fastest computers in the world and the benefits to all of us from \nsuch computers.\n  The headline on the story, ``Faster Computers Accelerate Pace of \nDiscovery,'' captures today and hints at tomorrow for science, using \ncomputers that have processing speeds of more than a thousand trillion \ncalculations per second. That speed is known as a petaflop, in computer \nscience speak.\n  I am proud that the first petaflop computer in the world is likely to \nbe at Los Alamos National Laboratory in my home State of New Mexico. \nWorking in conjunction with IBM, LANL's ``Roadrunner'' computer holds \nout the promise of immense advances in almost every aspect of \nscientific inquiry.\n  In the area of nuclear weapons, for example, computing power \nincreases are critical. Two decades ago, this Nation decided to stop \nunderground testing of nuclear weapons. Yet the necessity of certifying \nthe reliability and performance of our nuclear stockpile remains. How \ncould we do away with underground testing and still have the three \nweapons lab directors certify to the President that our weapons were \nsafe and reliable. We decided to adopt a program called Science-Based \nStockpile Stewardship. Essentially, we decided to simulate a nuclear \nweapons explosion using computer power. Clearly, America needed more \ncomputing power when we made this decision. ``Roadrunner'' is an \nimportant step toward making sure that our nuclear stockpile will work \nif ever needed.\n\n[[Page S14696]]\n\n  One of the most interesting uses of this enormous computer power is \nmodeling climate change. It is ironic that many of those who oppose \nadditional funding for the national laboratories want a more aggressive \nstance on the question of climate change and ways to ameliorate it, are \nthe same people who support a House-passed Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill that would reject more funding for ``Roadrunner.''\n  Mr. President, we are in the middle of negotiations on the Energy and \nWater appropriations bill right now. Adoption of the House-passed bill \nwill not only set back our work on computing power and climate change \nbut will be a disaster for certification of the reliability of our \nnuclear weapons. I hope that all Members of Congress will read today's \narticle in the Washington Post to get an idea of what is at stake as we \nset policy in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 3, 2007]\n\n             Faster Computers Accelerate Pace of Discovery\n\n                          (by Christopher Lee)\n\n       Sometime next year, developers will boot up the next \n     generation of supercomputers, machines whose vast increases \n     in processing power will accelerate the transformation of the \n     scientific method, experts say.\n       The first ``petascale'' supercomputer will be capable of \n     1,000 trillion calculations per second. That's about twice as \n     powerful as today's dominant model, a basketball-court-size \n     beast known as BlueGene/L, at the Energy Department's \n     Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that \n     performs a peak of 596 trillion calculations per second.\n       The computing muscle of the new petascale machines will be \n     akin to that of more than 100,000 desktop computers combined, \n     experts say. A computation that would take a lifetime for a \n     home PC and that can be completed in about five hours on \n     today's supercomputers will be doable in as little as two \n     hours.\n       ``The difficulty in building the machines is tremendous, \n     and the amount of power these machines require is pretty \n     mind-boggling,'' said Mark Seager, assistant department head \n     for advanced computing technology at Lawrence Livermore. \n     ``But the scientific results that we can get out of them are \n     also mind-boggling and worth every penny and every megawatt \n     it takes to build them.''\n       A leading candidate to become the first petascale machine, \n     the ``Roadrunner'' supercomputer being developed by IBM in \n     partnership with the Energy Department's Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory, will require about 4 megawatts of power--enough \n     to illuminate 10,000 light bulbs, said John Hopson, program \n     director for advanced simulation and computing at Los Alamos \n     in New Mexico.\n       But scientists say Roadrunner and its cousins will make \n     possible dramatically improved computer simulations. That \n     will help shed new light on subjects such as climate change, \n     geology, new drug development, dark matter and other secrets \n     of the universe, as well as other fields in which direct \n     experimental observation is time-consuming, costly, dangerous \n     or impossible.\n       In fact, supercomputers and their simulations are becoming \n     so powerful that they essentially have introduced a new step \n     in the time-honored scientific method that moves from theory \n     to hypothesis to experimental confirmation, some experts \n     contend.\n       ``They are a tool that really helps stimulate the \n     imagination of scientists and engineers in ways that \n     previously weren't possible,'' said David Turek, vice \n     president of supercomputing at IBM. ``You had theory and \n     hypothesis and experimentation. Well, now scientists are \n     admitting that computation is an important part of this, as \n     well.''\n       ``Nature is the final arbiter of truth,'' said Seager, the \n     Lawrence Livermore computer scientist, but ``rather than \n     doing experiments, a lot of times now we're actually \n     simulating those experiments and getting the data that way.\n       ``We can now do as much scientific discovery with \n     computational science as we could do before with \n     observational science or theoretical science.''\n       A particularly fruitful area of computer modeling has been \n     the study of global climate change. Ten years ago, experts \n     agreed that humans probably were contributing to global \n     warming. Now, in part because of a 10,000-fold increase \n     computing power and better accuracy in climate simulations, \n     scientists are sure of it.\n       One result is that computer climate models can now simulate \n     atmospheric and oceanic conditions and, crucially, how \n     changes in each affect the other, experts said. Now the worry \n     is not that computing power is inadequate but that the aging \n     of NASA's weather satellites will lead to a shortage of input \n     data before long, Seager and others said.\n       Petascale computers also will make it possible to predict, \n     say, the effect of an earthquake on every building in \n     downtown Los Angeles, experts said. Current models cannot \n     yield predictions for areas smaller than a square mile or \n     two. The increased detail could help shape building codes and \n     be a valuable tool in evacuation planning and disaster \n     preparedness.\n       Computer simulations also help assess the reliability, \n     safety, security and performance of weapons in the U.S. \n     nuclear stockpile, years removed from any real-life nuclear \n     tests. ``Nuclear weapons are the quintessential example of \n     something you can't really test anymore, so a lot of it has \n     to be done computationally,'' said Hopson, the Los Alamos \n     scientist.\n       Other potential uses of petascale computers include better \n     simulations of what happens when stars explode into \n     supernovas and die, and new and more refined analyses of \n     experimental drugs and their effects on disease and \n     interactions with other medications, experts said.\n       Still another is the modeling of the bird flu virus and how \n     it might evolve to become more communicable and lethal--\n     knowledge that could help scientists develop a vaccine in \n     time to use it and to inform public health planning. \n     Petascale computers are also expected to lead to more potent \n     models for Wall Street to calculate risk and predict the fate \n     of financial instruments, as well as more advanced digital \n     prototypes of automobiles and jet aircraft, further reducing \n     the need for physical mock-ups.\n       The remarkable advances in computing power of recent \n     decades are frequently attributed to the tenet known as \n     Moore's Law, named for Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore, \n     which says that progress in building chips doubles the power \n     of microprocessors about every 18 months. But that alone does \n     not explain the leaps in supercomputing, scientists said.\n       Today's supercomputers rely not only on better ``compute \n     nodes'' (made up of faster chips and more memory), but also \n     on scientists' ability to ``gang'' hundreds of thousands of \n     those nodes together in a single machine and to devise better \n     ways of having them communicate with one another and divide \n     up the work of complex problem solving.\n       ``If you ran today's code on yesterday's computers, they \n     would be much faster,'' said Raymond Bair, director of the \n     Argonne Leadership Computing Facility at the Energy \n     Department's Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago. \n     ``People have figured out how to solve the problems faster.''\n       Even before a petascale computer is a reality, scientists \n     are anticipating the next big milestone, the exascale \n     machine--a thousand times more powerful still, and capable of \n     1 million trillion calculations per second. But they'll have \n     to wait. That one isn't expected until about 2018.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14696-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14696-S14697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                            nathan good iron\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to offer a brief statement in \ntribute to Nathan Good Iron.\n  Nathan J. Good Iron was a high school basketball star, a college \nstudent, a new father. This young man of promise died in an enemy \nattack in Afghanistan a year ago while serving with a unit of the North \nDakota National Guard, the 188th Air Defense Artillery. His family \nlearned the terrible news on Thanksgiving Day of 2006.\n  Nathan was a Hidatsa Indian, a member of the Three Affiliated Tribes \nof Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara of the Fort Berthold Reservation. For \nmore than a thousand years, the Hidatsa people have lived in just a \nsingle place, along the banks of the Missouri River in North Dakota. \nAlways a pastoral people, they resided in sizeable cities, cultivating \nextensive, lush gardens along the river, hunting buffalo and other game \nin the prairies around them. When white adventurers and traders began \nshowing up, the Hidatsa were welcoming and friendly. Their villages, \nand those of their nearby allies--the Mandan and Arikara--were centers \nof trade and exploration.\n  But when it was necessary, when enemies invaded their homeland, the \nHidatsa proved themselves strong and valiant warriors, establishing a \nlong, epic history of courage and valor on the battlefield.\n  Such traits are not easily lost by a civilization. They persist \nthrough the generations. And the Hidatsa now have a new symbol of \nbravery, Nathan Good Iron.\n  Nathan was recently honored by a 3-day powwow in his memory. Powwows, \nwhich have long and rich traditions, are always events of high \npageantry and symbolism. Soldiers and veterans receive special \nrecognition at these powerful exhibitions and so it is appropriate that \nNathan was honored with this noteworthy memorial powwow.\n  That powwow was an occasion for remembrance and joy for Nathan's 25 \nyears of life, a proud memorial for his youthful sacrifice, and \nrecognition of his patriotism, his championship of democracy, and his \ncourageous willingness to put himself in harm's way when America \ncalled.\n\n[[Page S14697]]\n\n  Please allow me, on behalf of the American people, to send my most \nrespectful and admiring salute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14697-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF SANDRA COOK\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto Sandra Cook who retired last week from the Department of Education. \nFor almost 20 years, Sandra has worked in the Office of Legislative and \nCongressional Affairs at the Department, providing invaluable and \ndedicated service. She will be missed by all who worked with her, both \nat the Department and in Congress.\n  Improving education for each and every child in this country is one \nof the most important priorities for our Nation, and Sandra has been \ncommitted to that priority throughout her dedicated service. Her \ncommitment to education began in the classroom in Indiana as a teacher \nof history and language arts. She came to Washington to work in \nCongress and then moved to the Department of Education. From there she \nhas provided constant guidance and support to us as we work to improve \nFederal education policy. She has been an indispensable part of the \npast two reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct--the Improving America's Schools Act and the No Child Left Behind \nAct, as well as many other Federal education bills.\n  We all owe Sandra an immense debt of gratitude for her outstanding \nwork. She knows the education laws inside and out, and she always goes \nthe extra mile. She has always been able to work in a truly bipartisan \nway with Members of both parties. She doesn't just get the job done--\nshe gets it done well, and with grace. We have been fortunate to have \nher.\n  As Sandra retires to Illinois, I know her colleagues at the \nDepartment of Education will miss her. Her knowledge and skills will be \ndifficult to replace. Certainly, all of us in Congress and our staffs \nwho have had the privilege of working with her will miss her assistance \nand support. I wish her a long and happy and healthy retirement. She \nhas certainly earned it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14697-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORIAM: AUGUSTUS HAWKINS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to remember former Member of \nthe House of Representatives Augustus Hawkins, who passed away on \nNovember 10, 2007, at the age of 100.\n  Augustus Freeman Hawkins was the first African American from \nCalifornia to be elected to Congress. He was a champion of workers, \nfair housing, and civil rights, and Hawkins represented south Los \nAngeles, first in the State legislature and then in Congress, for more \nthan half a century.\n  Augustus was born in Shreveport, LA, on Aug. 31, 1907, the youngest \nof five children of Nyanza and Hattie Helena Hawkins. His family \narrived in Los Angeles soon after World War I when Hawkins was 11. He \nattended Jefferson High School and earned a degree from UCLA in 1931.\n  He began his public service career in an era that was far less \ncongenial to minority politicians, serving as a State assemblyman from \n1935 until 1962, when he won election to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, as the civil rights movement was taking center stage. \nHe served in the House from 1963 to 1991, and I was proud to serve with \nhim.\n  While soft-spoken, Hawkins was fiery in defense of his constituents. \nAt the time of the 1965 Watts riots in his district, he declared that \npolice had been ``abusive and arrogant and have attempted to control \nthings by force, not by more modern methods of control.''\n  When Hawkins retired at 83, he was widely praised for his unflagging \nlegislative efforts to help bring those who had been left out of the \nsystem into the mainstream.\n  His legislative legacy includes a key role in shaping Federal \nstatutes, most importantly as sponsor of the section of the landmark \n1964 Civil Rights Act that created the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission. Hawkins fought with President after President for minimum-\nwage increases and, with Senator Hubert Humphrey, wrote the Humphrey-\nHawkins Act of 1978 that was designed to reduce unemployment and \ninflation.\n  He is survived by two stepdaughters, Barbara A. Hammond and Brenda L. \nStevenson; a stepson, Michael A. Taylor; two grandchildren; and one \ngreat-grandchild.\n  Our Nation lost an amazing public servant and mentor with the passing \nof Augustus Freeman Hawkins, but his legacy to the people of south Los \nAngeles, the State of California, and all of America should be \nremembered.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14697-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RUSSIAN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I commend Russian citizens for \nturning out in large numbers to vote in yesterday's parliamentary \nelections. For 16 years, Russia's citizens have exercised their right \nto vote, which is so essential to democracy.\n  Unfortunately, Russia's leaders have been working to make that vote \nmore and more meaningless by creating an imitation democracy instead of \na real one.\n  Well before the campaign even began, several Russian political \nparties and politicians were banned from participating in the election. \nDuring the campaign, President Putin and his party, United Russia, \nenjoyed virtually unlimited positive television air-time on Kremlin-\ncontrolled networks, while opposition parties had their ads removed and \ntheir campaign materials confiscated. The Russian authorities have \nprevented opposition parties from campaigning fairly, imprisoning \nopposition leaders, intimidating activists, and preventing them from \nmaking their case to Russia's voters. Russian voters have reported that \nthey have been pressured to vote for the Kremlin's party, United \nRussia, by employers and local officials. In Chechnya, 99.2 percent of \nvoters allegedly turned out to vote and 99.3 percent of these voters \nallegedly cast their ballot for United Russia. Several other regions \nhave reported similar results for Putin's party, making a mockery of \nthis vote as a free and fair election. Yesterday's elections were the \nleast free and fair in the 16 years of Russia's modern history as an \nindependent country.\n  We have to work with the Russian leadership in the coming years to \ndeal with vital foreign policy issues, including securing nuclear \nmaterials and preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Nuclear \nweapons security is a high priority, and the United States and Russia \nneed to work together to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons or \nmaterials.\n  But in doing so, we do not have to turn a blind eye to the erosion of \nRussian democracy. We must be clear-eyed on Russia's political \ndirection, which in the long run is not favorable for Russia's own \npolitical stability or economic prosperity. By engaging Russia \nhonestly, we will remain friends of the Russian people as they continue \nto try to build for themselves a better country and future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14697-4", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14697-S14698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                HONORING PATROL OFFICER JOHN PAUL MILLER\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

On the evening of November 16, \n2007, while searching for a reported reckless drunk driver, Officer \nMiller's life was tragically cut short in the line of duty when his \npatrol vehicle struck a tree on a rural road near Livermore.\n  Officer Miller graduated from the California Highway Patrol Academy \nin March 2007 and joined the Dublin CHP office soon afterward. Officer \nMiller dutifully served the citizens and communities of Contra Costa \nCounty. Although his time in the uniform was all too short, Officer \nMiller demonstrated a passion for law enforcement and commitment to \nhelping others, qualities that enabled him to become a respected member \nof the California Highway Patrol.

Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the Roseville Fire Department in Roseville, CA.\n  In November 1907, a group of downtown merchants in the railroad \ncommunity of Roseville came together and formed the Citizens Volunteer \nFire Department after devastating fires destroyed and threatened many \nof their businesses. The department opened under the leadership of fire \nchief W.B. Musson, who was joined by assistant fire chief W.T. Butler \nand 16 volunteer firefighters to protect the town of approximately \n6,000 residents.\n  When the city of Roseville was incorporated in 1909, the department \nwas officially named the ``Roseville Fire Department'' and for over 50 \nyears worked out of two fire stations and added a third in 1961. In \n1947, after 40 years as a volunteer fire department, the Roseville Fire \nDepartment hired a full-time firefighting team to protect the rapidly \ngrowing city.\n  Today, the Roseville Fire Department has 130 employees serving over \n100,000 residents with 8 fire stations, a 3-acre training facility, a \ntechnical rescue team, a hazardous materials team and emergency medical \ntechnicians at every fire station.\n  As the firefighters and community celebrate the Roseville Fire \nDepartment's centennial anniversary, I would like to congratulate and \nthank all of the brave men and women of the Roseville Fire Department \nwho have proudly served their community over the past 100 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14698-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING KENNETH THOMAS NOVEL\n\n Mr. HAGEL.

He \nwas 60 years of age.\n  Kenneth was born in New York City, NY, on January 30, 1947. He was a \nVietnam veteran who served with the ``Screaming Eagles'' of the U.S. \nArmy's 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam in 1968. On November 20, \nKenneth Novel was buried with full military honors at the Columbarium \nin Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Kenneth was an owner of O Salon in Georgetown along with his brother, \nRobert.

HIRAM WARD\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, this Friday, on December 7 in \nMurfreesboro, AR, the citizens of Pike County will gather together to \nhonor Dr. Hiram Ward as the ``2007 Country Doctor of the Year.'' He is \nreceiving the award for coming out of retirement and saving the Pike \nCounty Memorial Hospital from closure. The award is sponsored by Staff \nCare, a medical staffing firm in Irving, TX, and is presented annually \n``to physicians who best exemplify the spirit, skill, and dedication of \nAmerica's medical practitioners.''\n  Since 1953, Dr. Ward has served the citizens of Murfreesboro and Pike \nCounty as a devoted physician and caregiver. Nearly 9 years ago, Dr. \nWard, who just recently turned 82, went into ``semi-retirement,'' only \nseeing patients occasionally.\n  However, when Pike County Memorial Hospital faced closure due to the \nloss of its staff physicians, Dr. Ward came out of retirement and \nresumed work full time to keep the hospital open. For the last 11 \nmonths, Dr. Ward has served as the chief of staff for Pike County \nMemorial and has been on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. His work \nhas kept the hospital, which is the second largest employer in town \nemploying 55 people, from permanent closure.\n  For the people of southwest Arkansas, Dr. Ward has been a constant \nboth at birth and death. He has delivered babies for most of the \nfamilies in the area and also sat at the bedsides of many people's \nparents and grandparents at the hour of their passing. His handiwork as \na physician is visible on the countless individuals that he ``stitched \nup'' over the course of his career. He has set limbs, removed gall \nstones, and simply improved the condition of his patients by just \ntalking to them. He has also saved many lives in Pike County.\n  He has been the family doctor for my State director, Donna Kay \nYeargan, nearly all of her life. She told me that Dr. Ward saved the \nlife of her father, Jetty Steel, many times over beginning in 1963 when \nMr. Steel suffered injuries from a serious car accident. Dr. Ward \ntreated him in the emergency room before he was transported to another \narea hospital in Texarkana, AR. Years later, he discovered a heart \nproblem in Mr. Steel and insisted that he receive a new heart valve.\n  In the years after Donna Kay's mother died, Dr. Ward would travel 20 \nmiles down an old country road to Nashville, AR, every Saturday night \nto visit with Jetty and give him a quick medical check. But it was at \nthe end of Mr. Steel's life that Dr. Ward showed how much he cared \nabout his patients. During the 3 weeks Mr. Steel was in the hospital \nbefore his death in March 2006, Dr. Ward came to the hospital at least \ntwice a day to just sit and visit with him.\n  He is a quiet and thoughtful man of few words, but he maintains a \ncommonsense approach to health and medicine that has made him among the \nmost trusted men in the region. His patients are not just patients, \nthey are his neighbors, his friends, his extended family. It is obvious \nthat he does more than attend to their medical needs; he cares for them \nand loves them like family.\n  Dr. Ward's life is medicine and keeping people healthy and active. He \nhas always understood the value of treating the whole person. He gives \neach patient his undivided attention no matter how busy he is. There is \na big difference between ``medical attention'' and ``medical care.'' \nPerhaps the key to Dr. Ward's long and valuable service is that he \nunderstands that difference and that he really does care.\n  Most people would say that Dr. Ward has gone above and beyond the \ncall of duty, but his friends doubt that he believes that.\n  Already this year, he has been featured in the July 2007 edition of \n``Reader's Digest'' in the Grassroots column for his dedication to the \npeople of Pike County and for coming out of retirement to keep the \nhospital open.\n  So, Mr. President, I congratulate Dr. Ward. The State of Arkansas is \nvery proud of his achievements and happy that Dr. Ward is receiving \nthis well-deserved recognition. Although Dr. Ward will take this in \nstride and quietly accept the accolades, his true reward comes from the \nwork he has done and continues to do for his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14698-4", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14698-5", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14698-S14699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, a withdrawal, and a treaty which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S14699]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14698-5", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14698-S14699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, a withdrawal, and a treaty which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S14699]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14699-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING RECESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2007, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on November 20, 2007, during the recess of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 50.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to offer a bipartisan \nbill to fix a serious loophole in the law that has prevented some of \nour wounded warriors from Iraq and Afghanistan from receiving their \nfull enlistment bonuses when they are discharged as the result of \nwounds they receive in combat. The Wounded Warrior Bonus Equity Act \nreflects the hard work of several Members of Congress, who put \npartisanship aside to address this serious matter. The men and women of \nour magnificent armed forces serve with incredible courage and bravery. \nIn return, the U.S. makes a commitment to them, and the Government must \nfulfill its end of the bargain.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2402. A bill to provide for the substitution of the United States \nin certain civil actions; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce The \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Substitution Act of 2007, to \nsubstitute the Federal Government for the telephone companies in \nlitigation challenging the so-called Terrorist Surveillance Program. \nThis is a very complex issue, and I have been discussing it at length \nwith my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. It does raise some very \nimportant questions, and I begin my analysis by acknowledging the good \ncitizenship of the telephone companies for whatever it is that they \nhave done. We still don't know all of what that is. But I do not \nbelieve that it is appropriate to grant what is called ``retroactive \nimmunity'' because of what has occurred here.\n  The legislation substitutes the U.S. in place of any electronic \ncommunication service company which provided communications in \nconnection with an intelligence activity that was authorized by the \nPresident between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007, and \ndesigned to detect or prevent a terrorist attack against the U.S.\n  In order for substitution to apply, the electronic communications \nservice provider must have received a written request from the Attorney \nGeneral or the head of an element of the intelligence community \nindicating that the activity was authorized by the President and \ndetermined to be lawful. If the provider assisted the Government beyond \nwhat was requested in writing, this legislation will leave the provider \non the hook for any surplus assistance. On the other hand, the \nGovernment will be substituted if the Attorney General certifies that \nthe electronic communications service provider did only what the \nGovernment asked. Once substitution occurs, Federal and State courts \nare directed to dismiss the providers from the action.\n  This legislation provides that plaintiffs in these cases may continue \nto send third-party discovery requests such as Rule 45 subpoenas to the \nelectronic communications service providers after they have been \ndismissed. Moreover, the bill provides that plaintiffs may also deem \nprovider admissions as Government admissions in their case against the \nGovernment. My legislation provides that the Government will not have \nsovereign immunity in the 40 or so cases currently pending in the \nCalifornia Multi-District Litigation.\n  This bill provides authority for the U.S. to remove actions from \nState court to Federal court. Notably, the legislation is intended to \nensure that the Government can only assert those defenses the \nelectronic communications companies may assert under current law. On \nthe other hand, nothing in the bill is designed to increase or diminish \nthe ability of the Government to assert the States Secret privilege. \nThe legislation is carefully crafted so as not to disturb plaintiffs' \nstanding to bring their claims against the Government.\n  Now, recognizing the telephone companies are good citizens, I am \nprepared to see their involvement held to the minimum. We hear concerns \nabout them being involved in litigation. Well, I don't know if there's \nmuch litigation\n\n[[Page S14704]]\n\nfor them to be involved in once the Federal Government is substituted. \nSome express dismay over the continued burden of discovery. I am not \nconvinced there will be much further discovery here. Some have \nexpressed a reticence to having their service technicians, in-house \ncounsel, and other employees called as witnesses. Yet, I don't know \nthat they are necessarily going to be witnesses. We can't judge that \nnow.\n  I believe there are very important--perhaps even constitutional--\nprivacy issues here that ought to be subjected to judicial review. We \nknow that important litigation in the Federal court in San Francisco, \nJudge Walker has declined to dismiss a challenge to the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program on State secrets grounds.\n  I don't think Congress can stand by, and in the face of what has \nhappened, give carte blanche, a free ticket, grant retroactive immunity \nto suggest to future administrations that they can ignore separation of \npowers and they can ignore Congressional oversight and just run \nroughshod over the entire process without being held accountable. The \nbetter practice is to allow judicial proceedings to take their course \nand let the courts make their own determinations.\n  I strongly encourage all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats \nalike, to carefully consider this bill as we begin to debate the \nrelated FISA Amendments Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Webb):\n  S. 2403. A bill to designate the new Federal Courthouse, located in \nthe 700 block of East Broad Street, Richmond, Virginia, as the \n``Spottswood W. Robinson III and Robert R. Merhige, Jr. Federal \nCourthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to name the \nnew Richmond courthouse for two distinguished Virginia jurists, Judge \nSpottswood W. Robinson III and Judge Robert Merhige, Jr.\n  Since the selection of the College of William and Mary as the site \nfor the Nation's first law school, Virginia's contribution to the field \nof law is arguably without equal. Virginia practitioners such as George \nWythe, Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, James Monroe and Henry Clay \nhave all profoundly shaped and molded our country's legal traditions.\n  Continuing in that rich tradition, Judge Spottswood W. Robinson, III, \nand Judge Robert Merhige, Jr. were lawyers who throughout their careers \nadhered to the principles of ``equal justice under law.''\n  Spottswood William Robinson, III was born in Richmond, Virginia on \nJuly 26, 1916. He attended Virginia Union University and then Howard \nUniversity School of Law, graduating first in his class in 1939 and \nserving as member of the faculty until 1947.\n  Judge Robinson was one of the core attorneys of the NAACP Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund from 1948 to 1960, achieving national \nprominence in the legal community with his representation of the \nVirginia plaintiffs in the 1954 landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Brown \nv. Board of Education that declared ``separate but equal'' schools \nunconstitutional.\n  In 1964, Judge Robinson became the first African-American to be \nappointed to the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia. In 1966, President Johnson appointed Judge Robinson the first \nAfrican-American to the United States Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit. On May 7, 1981, Judge Robinson became the first \nAfrican-American to serve as Chief Judge of the District of Columbia \nCircuit.\n  Judge Merhige was born in New York in 1919 and attended High Point \nCollege in North Carolina. Later, he earned his law degree from T.C. \nWilliams School of Law at the University of Richmond, from which he \ngraduated at the top of his class in 1942.\n  From 1942 to 1945, Judge Merhige served in the United States Air \nForce and then practiced law in Richmond from 1945 until 1967. While \npracticing in Richmond, Judge Merhige established himself as a \nformidable trial lawyer representing a wide variety of clients. In \nAugust of 1967, Judge Merhige was appointed U.S. District Court Judge \nfor the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division by President \nLyndon B. Johnson, where he served for over 30 years.\n  While on the Federal bench, Judge Merhige presided over some of the \nmost important and complicated litigation in U.S. history. In 1970, he \nordered the University of Virginia to admit women, and 2 years later he \nordered the desegregation of dozens of Virginia school districts. As \nevidence of Judge Merhige's groundbreaking decisions, he was given 24-\nhour protection by Federal marshals, due to repeated threats of \nviolence against him and his family. His courage in the face of the \nsignificant opposition of the times is a testimony to his dedication to \nthe rule of law.\n  I have been down to Richmond to see the new courthouse, and I can \ntell you it is a magnificent structure, and as such, I carefully took \nthis responsibility in naming the U.S. Federal courthouse in Richmond. \nNo name is more fitting for this important structure than naming it \nafter two legal giants--both jurists--the Robinson-Merhige Federal \nCourthouse.\n  I thank the Senate for the consideration of this bill and look \nforward to working with my colleagues seeking its passage.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I am honored to speak on behalf of a bill I \nhave cosponsored with my distinguished colleague, the senior senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  It is altogether appropriate that the new Federal courthouse in \nRichmond, our Commonwealth's capital and a city that played a pivotal \nrole in our Nation's civil rights debate, be named in honor of two of \nVirginia's most distinguished citizens, Judge Spottswood Robinson, III, \nand Judge Robert Merhige, Jr. Both of these men are considered \nconsummate Federal jurists, and both will be remembered as fierce \ndefenders of the Constitution and the rule of law.\n  Judge Robinson was born in Richmond on July 26, 1916 and passed away \nat his home in Virginia on October 11, 1998. Judge Robinson attended \nVirginia Union University and achieved a number of ``firsts.'' He \ngraduated first in his class from Howard University's School of Law. He \nwas the first African-American to be appointed to the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia. Also, he was the first African-\nAmerican to be appointed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia and the first African-American to serve as chief \njustice of that court. Judge Robinson served on the U.S. Commission on \nCivil Rights and as dean of Howard University Law School. Of his long \nand distinguished career, one of his most notable accomplishments was \nserving as counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, \nand acting as one of the principal attorneys in Brown v. The Board of \nEducation, arguably the most important civil rights case of the \ntwentieth century.\n  Professor Jack Greenberg of Columbia University Law School, an \nauthority on civil rights law stated, ``[Judge Robinson] was an \nexceptionally capable lawyer. He was good with judges and juries. He \nknew the law. He knew some of the esoteric, technical, sort of obscure \nparts of legal history.'' Considering Judge Robinson's arguments before \nthe Supreme Court, Professor Greenberg said, ``He was very calm and \njust absolutely brimming with facts and information and legal \ndoctrine.''\n  Judge Merhige was born February 5, 1919, in New York, and after 31 \nyears on the bench, passed away in Richmond on February 18, 2005. Judge \nMerhige presided over the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Virginia from 1967 until 1998. Judge Merhige received his law degree \nfrom the University of Richmond's T.C. Williams School of Law. In 1972, \nJudge Merhige courageously ordered the desegregation of dozens of \nVirginia school districts. Despite numerous threats and receiving 24-\nhour protection by Federal authorities, Judge Merhige remained faithful \nto the Constitution and the rule of law. Judge Merhige ordered the \nUniversity of Virginia to admit women in 1970 and rejected appeals by \ndefendants in the Watergate case.\n  A friend of many years, Governor Gerald Baliles, once stated Judge \nMerhige was, ``a man of civility and courage, a gentle but vibrant \nforce of the legal realm. . . . [Judge Merhige] was a master of wit and \ncould puncture the pomposity of lawyers as well as engage in acts of \nself-deprecation.''\n\n[[Page S14705]]\n\n  These two men were bold enough to recognize and fight to ensure that \nthe rights guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution are enjoyed by \neveryone, and not just the privileged or members of a certain race, \nreligion, or socio-economic group.\n  The names of Judge Robinson and Judge Merhige will be etched on the \nwalls of this courthouse. I am committed to ensuring that their legacy \nof equality and fundamental fairness persists in the hearts of all \nVirginians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/03/senate-section/article/S14705-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 57--HONORING PROFESSIONAL SURVEYORS AND \n               RECOGNIZING THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOCIETY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.
