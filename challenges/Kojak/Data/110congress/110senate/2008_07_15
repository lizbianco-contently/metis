Mr. President, as we stand here, Americans are \nsuffering from the most dramatic oil shock in memory. A single barrel \nof crude oil costs almost three times today what it did a year and a \nhalf ago. This is a crisis that demands our full attention. Yet, until \nnow, Democrats on Capitol Hill have responded as if high gas prices \nwere a mere distraction. Their proposals have been the legislative \nequivalent of a fly swatter, when the American people are clamoring for \nthe heavy artillery.\n  Part of the reason for this timid approach by our friends on the \nother side, as anyone can see, is the upcoming election. They have made \nno secret of the fact that they do not want to consider real \nlegislation until Inauguration Day, when they hope their candidate will \ntake the White House.\n  We need to realize Americans are more concerned, at the moment, about \npaying for groceries and filling their tanks with gas than they are \nabout the political calendar. Americans are not thinking about next \nJanuary, they are thinking about today. They expect their elected \nrepresentatives in Washington to take serious steps now to lower the \nprice of gas.\n  The proposal the Democratic leader outlined on gas prices last week \nfalls laughably short. It has all the marks of a political exercise \nnervously cobbled\n\n[[Page S6678]]\n\ntogether in the face of constituent pressure and none of the elements \nof a serious plan that would actually lower the price of gas or reduce \nour dependance on the Middle East. The Democrats will have to do better \nthan this if Americans want to see their gas prices go down.\n  Here is their plan. First, they propose curbing speculation. \nDemocrats want us to forget that no reputable economist thinks \nspeculators alone are the reason for the spike in gas prices or that a \nrecent report by the 27-nation International Energy Agency chided \npoliticians who blame speculators alone as searching for a scapegoat \ninstead of looking for real answers.\n  Naming speculators alone is not a serious proposal for lowering the \nprice of gas. We do need more cops on the beat at the CFTC, but if \nDemocrats think the answer to $4-plus-a-gallon gasoline is curbing \nspeculation alone, then they are obviously asking the wrong question.\n  Second, their plans call on the President to release 10 percent of \nthe oil contained in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is encouraging \nto see our friends on the other side acknowledging that increasing \nsupply has an effect on price. But at best, this is a polite nod in the \ndirection of supply; it is nibbling around the edges. Again, it is very \ntimid.\n  Even if we were to tap 10 percent of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \nas they suggest, that would only allow for the release of 70 million \nbarrels at a time, when Americans are using more than 20 million \nbarrels of oil a day.\n  Let me say that again. Even if we were to tap 10 percent of the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, as is suggested by our friends on the \nother side of the aisle, that would only allow the release of 70 \nmillion barrels, and we use 20 million barrels a day now. In other \nwords, this is a 3-day solution. It should go without saying that a 3-\nday supply of oil is not a serious proposal for lowering the price of \ngas.\n\n  Next, the Democratic plans for high gas prices call for increasing \nproduction on 68 million acres already leased to oil companies. This is \nthe so-called ``use it or lose it'' provision that says scolding energy \ncompanies for not producing fast enough will magically cause gas prices \nto go down.\n  Let me remind my friends that this is why we call it ``exploration.'' \nThose who do it should be encouraged, not threatened. The fact is, the \nSecretary of the Interior already has this authority to revoke a lease \nif it is not being used according to the original terms of that lease.\n  Democrats do not mention this at their press conferences, nor do they \nmention that many of these leases are simply unproductive, nor do they \nmention that the Federal Government has declared 85 percent of offshore \nland and 62 percent of known offshore oil reserves completely off \nlimits to new exploration. Nor do the Democrats mention that, because \nof them, 100 percent of Western oil shale is off limits, despite the \nfact that experts estimate the Western States that have oil shale \ndeposits are literally floating on a sea of oil roughly three times the \nsize of Saudi Arabian oil reserves. In other words, ``use it or lose \nit'' is already the law of our land. ``Use it or lose it'' is not a \nserious proposal for lowering the price of gas.\n  Finally, the Democratic plan says we should stop exporting oil that \nis produced domestically. Well, that is an interesting idea. Last year, \nAmerica exported only 10 million barrels of crude oil overseas--that is \nhalf of what we use in a day--including sales to Puerto Rico. Today \nalone, America will use more than 20 million barrels of oil. This is a \nhalf-day solution to a yearlong problem. It is, in other words, a joke.\n  The crisis is real. Americans are suffering from high gas prices. \nThey deserve better from their elected leaders in Washington than half-\nday or 3-day solutions and bad jokes. They deserve a year-round \nsolution.\n  Americans deserve a solution that says if prices are going to go \ndown, supply needs to go up. They deserve a plan that lifts the ban on \noffshore exploration and oil shale development, even as we continue to \npromote conservation.\n  Americans know this crisis is not only a demand problem; it is a \nsupply and demand problem. Until more of our friends on the other side \nacknowledge this, record-high prices will persist.\n  Now, some of our friends are beginning to acknowledge the undeniable. \nAs of today, ten Democrats have expressed at least some level of \nwillingness to explore offshore. They are acknowledging a groundswell \nof public opinion, even among self-described liberals, in favor of more \ndomestic supply.\n  Republicans have a proposal that was designed specifically to attract \ntheir support and the support of any other Member of the Senate who \nactually is interested in achieving a result. It promotes energy-\nefficient vehicles such as plug-in electric cars and trucks. It \naddresses supply and demand by lifting the ban on Western oil shale \ndevelopment and opening exploration far from the shore of States that \nwant it.\n  Ours is a serious proposal that directly addresses the price of gas \nat the pump. It is not a gimmick. It is not a half-day Band-Aid on a \nyear-round problem. It is a solution. It is what the American people \nare demanding of us.\n  High gas prices are a serious problem and demand to be taken \nseriously. It is time our friends on the other side put partisan \ndifferences and timid, peripheral half-measures aside and get serious \nabout this urgent situation. The American people expect and deserve it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6678-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I wish to commend the Republican leader on his remarks. \nI wish to follow up on those remarks on what is the crisis of the day \nin the United States of America, which is that the Congress of the \nUnited States has chosen, all of us--I am not pointing fingers at \nanyone--to argue about partisan politics over energy while the American \npeople are paying numbers they have never had before in their lives. \nThe future of oil is only looking higher and higher and higher.\n  Quite frankly, in the United States of America, the Congress of the \nUnited States is sitting on a ham sandwich starving to death.\n  This is a problem we have solutions for, if we will put our partisan \ndifferences aside and develop a comprehensive mandatory plan to address \nthe supply and demand on petroleum. Yesterday the President removed the \nexecutive order prohibiting offshore drilling. That is absolutely \nsomething we ought to do. We need to be exploring our domestic \nresources to reduce our dependence on foreign imports. It is good for \nAmerica not only because it is our energy, it is good because it is in \nthe geopolitical interests of the United States. Every barrel of oil we \nare dependent on from the Middle East is a geopolitical problem, not \njust an arithmetic problem or a cost-of-oil problem. We should be \nexploring every resource we have. Some Members of the Senate have come \ntogether to realize there are things we can do and things we can't. We \nshould be focusing on the things we can do. For the purposes of my \nremarks, I want to outline all of those things that are doable today.\n  No. 1 is offshore exploration with the States and their general \nassemblies and Governors having the authority to authorize it. We know \nwe have significant offshore resources in terms of both natural gas and \npetroleum.\n  Second, we ought to reenergize the nuclear energy business. It is \nabsolutely ridiculous that the most industrialized country in the \nworld, the country that brought nuclear power and nuclear electric \ngeneration to reality, now sits on the sidelines while the rest of the \nworld generates safe, carbon-free, inexpensive energy on a daily basis. \nIn the Nation of France, 87 percent of their energy is generated for \nelectricity by nuclear energy. It emits\n\n[[Page S6679]]\n\nzero carbon. The French use the MOX system to recycle their spent fuel \nrods and use them a second time, reducing nuclear waste by 90 percent \nand getting the maximum use out of the uranium to generate energy.\n  Synthetic fuels. It is absolutely important that we work as hard as \nwe can to have the tax credit, tax incentive, and depreciation \nnecessary to incentivize companies to rapidly develop synthetic fuels \nthat do not depend on petroleum. Our military has proven this can be \ndone. It is a matter of Congress directing tax policy and research and \ndevelopment to see to it that we do it.\n  Wind and solar. There are those who say that won't solve our problem. \nWell, they won't, but they will help. In those States, 40 of them where \nwind energy actually will produce a significant amount of energy for \nthe grid, we ought to be incentivizing it through tax credits, rapid \ndepreciation, and other procedures that the Congress has the power to \ndo today. Renewable sources of energy, ethanol, both cellulose and corn \nbased, are essential. It has its place. It won't solve the problem, but \nit will help.\n  It is very important for us to understand that if this Congress \ndecided to adopt a comprehensive policy to increase the supply of \nresources for energy, the cost of petroleum would begin coming down \nimmediately, because those who speculate on the future would understand \nthe United States has finally had enough. We are going to develop our \nresources. We are going to incentivize the private sector, and we will \nget the job done. This country has accomplished amazing things in \ndifficult times. These are difficult times, but we know what the \nsolutions are, and we know where they lie. They lie domestically with \nour own production of petroleum. They lie in research and development \nand ingenuity, and they lie in a Tax Code that needs to incentivize the \ndevelopment of energy.\n  I wish to share a story that opened my eyes to the importance of \nexploring our own resources. I am ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nAfrica. Earlier this year I traveled to Djibouti and to Equatorial \nGuinea. I saw a good example that the people of the United States ought \nto know about. Equatorial Guinea 10 years ago was the poorest nation in \nAfrica and the poorest nation in the world. Today, it is the seventh \nfastest growing economy in the world. They came to America and asked \nAmerican oil companies to come and explore in the Gulf of Guinea to see \nif they had any gas or any oil. Marathon Oil went over there, along \nwith other smaller companies from Texas, and found gas in the Gulf of \nGuinea. Ten years later, when you go to Equatorial Guinea and the \nisland of Malbo, and you go to the Marathon plant that liquefies \nnatural gas for shipment around the world to places such as the United \nStates, Russia, wherever it might be needed, you see tanker after \ntanker after tanker anchored in the Gulf of Guinea, loading up $25 \nmillion, the value of a tanker full of liquefied natural gas, to go \naround the world.\n  Equatorial Guinea has gone from a country that could not feed itself \nor take care of its people to a country building hospitals, \nuniversities, schools, highways, building the prosperity of their \npeople, all because they had the willingness to explore. From an \nenvironmental standpoint, there has been no environmental impact. We \nknow and have learned that we can drill offshore safely and securely \nand proved we can withstand even the most dangerous of hurricanes as \nhappened in Katrina. There is no excuse for the United States not to be \nexploring offshore and be exploring today, no reason whatsoever we \nshould not be reenergizing nuclear energy, no reason we should not be \nworking on renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar, no \nreason we shouldn't expedite the development of synthetic fuels, coal \nliquefaction, and clean coal technology. America has every resource we \nneed to be energy free, from coal to petroleum. All we to have do is \nhave the political will and common sense to make it happen.\n  I call on my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to put their \nelephants and donkeys in the barn and look at the needs of the American \npeople, understand if we leave this year without a comprehensive \ndeclaration for energy policy and energy independence, we have done a \ndisservice to the people of the United States, and we will not have \nfulfilled our constitutional responsibility. It is time to get out of \nthe chair, get off the ham sandwich, and understand that we have \neverything we need here to begin an end to high gas prices, high oil \nprices, and dependence on the Middle East for foreign oil.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia. That \nwas such a good summary of where we are, and we do need to put aside \npartisanship. We do need to acknowledge that a lot of things have \nchanged and those changes require this Government to make some \ndecisions that can help us deal with the crisis we are facing. I am not \na negative person. I believe we will work our way through this. But I \nam going to say some things that are honest and discouraging and \nworrisome about where we are today as a nation. The surging price for \nenergy is a crisis that is moving our economy into a recession, and it \nis absolutely savaging the family budget. Record prices that we are \nfacing today have a real impact on small businesses and family budgets \nacross my State. My home county was rated the No. 1 county in America \nfor the percentage of money spent on oil and gas, because it is a rural \narea, a poorer area, and people drive a long way to work. A larger \npercentage of their wealth is spent on buying fuel than any other \ncounty in America. So it is personal to me.\n  The average price of regular unleaded gasoline climbed to $4.10 a \ngallon as of yesterday. One year ago it was $2.84, and 2 years ago, it \nwas $2.62. As a result, the typical American family with two \nautomobiles driving an average of 24,000 miles a year is paying \napproximately $1,260 more per year for the same amount of fuel, \naccording to the Energy Information Agency. That amounts to $105 a \nmonth of disposable after tax, after house payment, after retirement, \nafter Social Security, after insurance, the little after tax money that \npeople take care of their families on, $105 more a month coming out of \nthat to pay for the increase in gasoline over the past year.\n  I hear we are now going to soon be having a LIHEAP bill which would \nbe a bill, I suppose, as it usually is, to increase funding for people \nwho have to buy heating oil and heating in the winter. The Government \nwill subsidize that energy for those people, give them more money so \nthey can buy more of the product. That is the policy we are having from \nour Democratic leadership. Has anybody thought maybe we should \nencourage people to use solar energy or geothermal or wind to heat \ntheir homes? We know the reason why that is not being suggested. That \nis, it is not ready yet in mass production. In many areas of the \ncountry, it is not feasible. Solar energy is four times as expensive as \nnonsolar energy. That is why people can't afford the current rates. \nThey certainly can't pay four times as much. I say that to ask, what \nare we going to do now? That is the question. What is ready to help us \ndeal with this crisis now?\n  Last week the Energy Information Administration and the Cambridge \nResearch Associates reported that the price of natural gas surged to \nmore than $12 per million Btus. That is up from $8.94 in February. That \nis a one-third increase in a few months in natural gas prices. Of \ncourse, this represents an enormous economic hit to the American \nfamily, businesses that have to be competitive in the world \nmarketplace, and the economy. Congress cannot go home until we take \nsome action that addresses these issues. According to T. Boone \nPickens--you may have seen his ads, an old oil man now into the wind \nbusiness and favors utilization of natural gas for automobiles, which I \nthink has real possibilities; it is much cleaner than gasoline--we are \non track to spend this year $700 billion in American wealth overseas to \npurchase 60 percent of the oil we utilize in this country. This \nrepresents one of the greatest threats to our economy we have ever \nfaced. When the price of oil goes up, the stock market goes down. That \nis almost a daily occurrence. This is because virtually every industry \nis affected by high oil prices.\n  In addition, this export of our national wealth decreases the value \nof\n\n[[Page S6680]]\n\nthe dollar. When the dollar falls, the balance of trade deficit \nincreases, which is increasing steadily, which further erodes the \neconomy. Companies forced to spend more to purchase the same amount of \nenergy a year or so ago are not able now to expand their businesses and \ncreate new jobs. In addition, electricity is going up; 20 percent of \nour electricity is generated by natural gas. Those prices have been \nsurging. According to the Cato Institute, the price of residential \nelectricity has doubled over the past 5 years, from an average of $5.43 \nper kilowatt hour in 2003 to $10.31 per kilowatt hour this year. A key \nfactor is the cost of natural gas and other sources of energy.\n  High energy costs also drive energy-intensive businesses overseas \nwhere prices are lower. If we had passed this cap-and-trade bill that, \nfortunately, was blocked and pulled down after it failed to gain the \nnecessary support, it would have driven up electric bills by as much as \n$100 a month for families and driven up the price of gasoline by \nanother $1.50 per gallon according to the EPA.\n  Let me give an example. According to Dow Chemical Company, for every \n$1 increase in natural gas prices, that adds $3.7 billion in cost to \nthe chemical industry. This will lead chemical companies to outsource \ntheir operations overseas where their feedstocks, their energy, their \nnatural gas is cheaper. From 2003 to 2005 alone, rising natural gas \nprices have forced Dow to shift its production overseas, leaving the \ncompany to close 27 facilities and eliminate approximately 15 percent \nof its workforce.\n  Let me read you the latest from a Forbes magazine article on Dow and \nwhat they have done to adjust to this surge in energy prices that are \nsome of the highest in the world, and there are a lot of lower priced \nareas for natural gas around the world. They are shifting their \ncommodity lower margin business ``into joint ventures with partners in \nemerging markets like the Middle East, China, Russia, and Brazil. Dow \ncontributes the technical know-how for producing plastics and \nchemicals, while its partners provide low-cost feedstocks''--basically \nnatural gas--``and access to new markets. Dow ends up with lower \ncapital expenditures and less risk.''\n  Well, that is jobs. That is American jobs that are going abroad, \ndirectly as a result of an increase in natural gas prices.\n  So I was very pleased that yesterday President Bush took an important \nstep to address this initiative by lifting the moratorium on oil and \ngas exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf. With this action, the \nPresident has removed an important obstacle to reducing our dependence \non foreign sources of oil, and particularly natural gas, because there \nis a great deal of natural gas offshore.\n  While the eastern Gulf of Mexico would remain off limits to \nexploration until 2022, this decision could potentially allow access to \nsignificant oil and natural gas reserves right here at home at a time \nwhen global supply is struggling to keep up with demand.\n  In 2005, this Congress directed the Department of the Interior to \nstudy the oil and gas reserves in the OCS. The study found that 8.5 \nbillion barrels of oil and 29.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas are \ncurrently known to exist off our Nation's shores. In addition, the \nstudy estimated that approximately 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas also exists in these waters.\n  Now, we utilize 7 billion barrels of oil a year, and approximately 4 \nbillion of that is imported. Eighty-six billion barrels of oil lie \noffshore, and we have a lot of reserves onshore. If we produce that, \nhow many years is that? Four into eighty-six? Mr. President, 25 years, \n20 years of zero imports if we were to do this.\n  So the American Petroleum Institute reports that producing all our \ndomestic reserves we have will provide enough oil to power 60 million \ncars for 60 years and enough natural gas to heat 60 million homes for \n160 years. Yet these estimates are based on old data. Exploration for \noil and gas reserves in the Outer Continental Shelf has not occurred \nsince the early 1980s. Technological advances have made it possible to \nexplore for reserves in areas previously ignored due to scientific \nlimitations. The scientific advancement also reduces the number of dry \nholes. They can tell better what the prospects are when you drill a \nwell and not drill as many dry holes. When deepwater wells cost over $1 \nbillion, better technology is important.\n  By acting now to increase supply, we can be sure to reduce the price \nof crude oil and natural gas. This is the most reliable way to end the \nlargest wealth transfer in history, keeping our money here at home in \nour economy, creating jobs here, creating taxpayers here, and improving \nour economy.\n  Let me add, parenthetically, I am not for a carbon economy. I want us \nto move beyond a carbon economy. But I would wish to say that 10, 15, \n30 years from now we are still going to be dependent on fossil fuels. \nWe do not have the option right now.\n  So I see the production of more fossil fuels at home not only as \nkeeping American wealth at home but as a bridge to a new energy world \nin which we have wind and solar and biofuels, especially cellulosic \nethanol that I am seeing in my home State of Alabama from wood \nproducts--I believe that has real potential--geothermal, clean coal, \nand nuclear power with plug-in hybrid automobiles where you plug in \nyour car at night using clean nuclear power, with no CO2 \nemitted, and run your car back and forth to work, never using a drop of \noil. All those things are in the works and will happen, but it does not \nmean we should not be productive at home.\n  So even with the President's decision yesterday, Congress must still \ntake action to remove the congressional moratorium on oil and gas \nexploration in 85 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf. Every day \nCongress refuses to act is another day Americans are forced to pay \nhigher prices at the pump.\n  I urge the majority leader to bring legislation to the floor that we \ncan work on, in a bipartisan way, to lift this ban so the Senate can \npass good legislation before the August recess and bring relief to the \ntaxpayer. I cannot imagine we would fail to do that. There are a lot of \nthings we can do right now that will not impact the environment in any \nnegative way but will produce more energy at home and help our economy \ncreate jobs and wealth at home. I believe we can do this, and I am \nhopeful that will occur.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, in the \nChamber.\n  I am pleased to yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, might I ask how much time remains in \nmorning business on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 8 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Acting President pro tempore.\n  Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from Alabama, my friend, \nSenator Sessions, in talking about the item that is at the top of \neveryone's agenda in America; that is, high gas prices.\n  But, first, I wish to say that in 2006, much to my chagrin, the \nDemocratic Party won control of both Houses of Congress. I say that \nbecause it is more fun being in the majority than it is being in the \nminority. But with becoming the majority and Senator Reid having become \nthe majority leader, he has the complete power to schedule legislative \naction on the floor of the Senate. With that power comes \nresponsibility. I wish to point out a few areas where I do not think we \nare living up to the responsibility that the American people would have \nus live up to.\n  There is good news. The good news is, it took only 145 days for us to \npass the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \nThe problem was, in those 145 days, our intelligence officials were \nhampered in their ability to listen in on conversations between \nterrorists. Thank goodness, at least so far as we know in the public \ndomain, that has not resulted in other attacks against Americans. But \nthe fact remains, it took 145 days to get that done, and it should not \nhave.\n\n  It has been 602 days since the Colombia Free Trade Agreement has been \npending. Now, why is that important? Well, in my State, we sell about \n$2.3 billion worth of agricultural products and manufactured items to \nColombia. Because we have not acted on the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement, they bear a tariff which makes those more\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\nexpensive than they should be. Correspondingly, when Colombian items \nare sold to American markets because of another agreement, they do not \nhave any tariff at all. So this is a burden, a millstone around the \nneck of American manufacturers and farmers that is unnecessary and \nunfair. It has been 602 days since that matter has been pending without \nany action by the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate.\n  Then, yesterday, we had a forum on judicial nominees. There have been \n747 days during which some nominees, who have been nominated to the \nFederal bench by President Bush, have waited for a simple up-or-down \nvote on the Senate floor.\n  To the point of my main remarks: It has been 813 days since Speaker \nPelosi, when she was running, hoping she would become speaker, in the \n2006 election--that her party would have the majority in the House and \nshe would be elected Speaker--it has been 813 days since she said \nDemocrats, if elected, would have a commonsense plan to bring down the \nprice of gasoline at the pump.\n  Well, what has happened since that time, in 813 days?\n  As to gasoline, which I am sure seemed too high then--on January 4, \n2007, it was $2.33 a gallon. And there are some people today who are \npining for the good old days when gasoline was $2.33 a gallon because \nthe average price of a gallon of gas today is $4.11 a gallon. There is \nno indication at all it is going to go down. Every indication is it is \ngoing to go up.\n  I wonder how long it is going to take the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Reid, to recognize the American people are hurting and \nthe impact these high energy prices are having on not only the \nlifestyle, not only the daily routine but the ability of the American \npeople to do the bare essentials they need to do in order to provide \nfor their family and in order to get their children to school and in \norder for them to get to work. How long will this go on? Will it take \n$5-a-gallon gas? Will it take $10-a-gallon gas? How long will it take \nbefore the majority leader will allow us to vote on a balanced plan \nthat will allow us to deal with this crisis?\n  Already, if you compound the price of energy, including gasoline, \nalong with the other burdens Congress has imposed on the American \nworking family, things such as Federal taxes--it takes 74 days of every \nyear for people to pay their Federal taxes; another 39 days for them to \npay their State and local taxes; another 60 days to pay for housing; \nhealth care, about 50 days; food, 35 days; and transportation, 29 days.\n  So even in things such as food, we have seen because of the price of \nenergy--of course, there is the diesel and the gasoline our farmers use \nin order to bring their crops in and actually produce them--the price \nof food continues to go up. A large part of that is because of the \nprice of energy, the price of diesel, the price of gasoline.\n  The squeeze continues on the American people.\n  So what is the solution? Well, I have seen the majority leader wants \nto bring a bill to the floor that deals with speculation. Of course, \nthat deals with the way oil is bought on the futures trading platform, \nthe commodity futures trading system, which allows people to guess \nbasically what the price of oil will be in the future and to bid at \nthat price. Of course, for every willing buyer, there is a willing \nseller willing to buy it.\n  Of course, we do need to police the commodity futures trading system \nto make sure there is not abuse, that there is complete transparency. \nWe need to make sure we have more people, more analysts--more cops on \nthe beat, so to speak--to make sure they have the personnel to be able \nto do their job. But it is shortsighted and, frankly, naive to think \nCongress can continue to suspend the laws of supply and demand. So just \ndealing with that narrow component of the problem is not enough. Is \nthat part of an overall balanced energy package? Yes, it is. But it is \nnot enough by itself.\n  We have to deal with this by finding more and using less. What do I \nmean by that? Well, using less means we need to be more efficient. We \nneed to be less wasteful. We need to conserve energy. America consumes \nabout 20 percent of the oil produced worldwide every day. We need to \nfind ways to be more efficient. That is why I think our manufacturing \nsector, whether it is producing plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2010, which \neventually, hopefully, will provide an alternative, or the CAFE \nstandards, the corporate fuel efficiency standards Congress has \npassed--those help. But it is not enough because you cannot conserve \nyour way into energy independence or energy self-sufficiency.\n  So how about ``the find more'' part? Well, the fact is, there is \nabout 85 million barrels of oil consumed globally every day--85 million \nbarrels globally every day. So even if America were to use less, that \ndoes not mean China and India are going to use less. In fact, they are \nnot going to use less. They are going to use more because their \neconomies are getting bigger, their people are becoming more \nprosperous. They want to buy cars. They want the same sort of things \nAmericans have come to expect as commonplace. They want more, and they \nare going to consume more, because they know energy drives their \neconomy. In particular, in countries such as China, you are going to \nsee they are growing at 10 percent gross domestic product a year, and \nit is because they are building two coal-powered plants every week and \nthey are consuming more energy. So we are going to have to produce more \nenergy while we use less in order to just allow us to transition to \nusing renewable fuels and the research we need to do on things such as \nclean coal technology. We are going to need some time to transition \ninto more energy independence and a clean energy future. That is only \ngoing to come by producing more oil here at home.\n\n  Of course, this is a national security issue because we buy a lot of \nour oil from dangerous regions of the world, such as the Middle East, \nor from our enemies, such as Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. So why does it \nnot make sense for us to rely less on them--people who don't \nnecessarily wish us well--and rely more on ourselves while at the same \ntime create more jobs right here at home, here in America?\n  I know attitudes are changing. We look at things such as the \nRasmussen poll, which shows now that 67 percent of all of the \nrespondents say we ought to produce more American natural resources \nright here at home. I know there are folks on the other side of the \naisle, such as our distinguished Presiding Officer, who are trying to \nwork to find a bipartisan solution, and we need to do that. Frankly, we \nshould not leave here in August without addressing this issue and doing \nit in a meaningful way. By that, I don't mean just trying to go after \nthe speculation part. We need to deal with all of this in a balanced \nsort of way that will allow us to give the American people some relief \nat a time when they need some relief because of the squeeze that \ncontinues to be put upon the average working family when it comes to \nhigh energy costs, which, in turn, ripples into high food costs.\n  Hopefully, we will be successful in weathering this financial crisis \nwe have seen because of the subprime mortgage market and the housing \ncrisis, but unless we do something about high energy prices, we are \ngoing to end up in a technical recession. I have no doubt about that. \nSo we can weather those--and I hope we do--and still find ourselves in \nthe ditch from an economic standpoint if we don't do something about \nhigh energy costs. Frankly, now that the President has lifted his \nExecutive order banning offshore exploration and development, the only \nthing that remains to be done now is for Congress to get out of the way \nand to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem.\n  I wish our side of the aisle could do it. We can't because we are not \nin the majority. Only the majority leader has the power to call this up \nand allow debate and a vote on a commonsense energy plan that will \nallow us to find more and use less. I am asking them again today, as a \nnumber of us have, to please, please listen to what the American people \nare telling us. They are telling us that they are hurting, that their \ncosts are going through the roof, whether it is food prices or just the \nprice of filling up their cars at the gas station. Really, it is the \nU.S. Congress that is part of the problem. We need to be part of the \nsolution. We need to listen to them and do what we can to help make \ntheir lives just a little bit better.\n\n[[Page S6682]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak on \nthe rather large foreign aid bill we are addressing this week in the \nSenate. I have already expressed my concern, and I will do it again.\n  As the Senator from Texas was just talking about, we have a serious \nenergy problem in our country today. Americans are hurting, and it is \nprobably not a very good time to be talking about sending billions of \nAmerican dollars around the world, despite how good the cause may be. \nNevertheless, we are going to be voting on various amendments related \nto what we call PEPFAR, which began as an aid to Africa bill, and that \nis one of the issues I wish to address this morning.\n  The PEPFAR Program that the President started in 2003, which I \nsupported, took $15 billion over 5 years and focused it on the AIDS \nepidemic in Africa. Other countries were allowed to participate. The \nprimary focus was on AIDS and malaria. There has been some success, so \nthe President would like to reauthorize that program.\n  Unfortunately, as it has worked its way through Congress, it has gone \nfrom a $15 billion expenditure to a $50 billion expenditure, sending \nmore money overseas than we spend ourselves on research for AIDS in \nAmerica or breast cancer or juvenile diabetes and the problems we have \nhere. We are sending the money overseas.\n  This bill does not go according to its label anymore. This is no \nlonger an aid to Africa bill. It expands across three more continents, \nincluding China and other countries that might be better off \nfinancially than we are at this point.\n  I proposed an amendment to limit the scope of the PEPFAR bill to its \noriginal intent, which included Africa and other authorized countries \nin the original bill, so that we can focus these dollars in a way that \nwould allow them to work rather than allow them to create a global fund \nthat spreads the money so thin that we are no longer effective in any \narea.\n  The vote at 11 also includes a very important amendment that is \nattached to the amendment to keep the focus on the countries in the \noriginal bill. This amendment would prohibit PEPFAR funds from going to \norganizations that are involved with forced abortions and forced \nsterilization in countries such as China. Again, countries such as \nChina don't need our money, particularly at a time when they are \nactually much better off financially than we are. American taxpayers \nshould not be forced to send their money to organizations in China that \nforce abortions.\n  We may have people who stand up and say this is not going to happen, \nbut $2 billion in the first year of this program is designated to the \nU.N. Global Fund. It is indicated that such sums that would be spent \nover the next 4 years would be allocated to it, which means it is \nlikely that there is going to be $10 billion over 5 years that goes to \nthe U.N. Global Fund. All one has to do is go to the Global Fund Web \nsite, go to China, and see that there is over $70 million in grants \nthat has gone to the organization in China that actually enforces the \none-child policy, enforces the forced abortion policy in China. The law \nof the land here in this country is that we don't use taxpayer dollars \nfor forced abortions anywhere in the world. Actually, the PEPFAR bill \nitself prohibits those funds. Yet there is a loophole in that as funds \nfrom PEPFAR go to the U.N. Global Fund, they will go to organizations \nsuch as we have in China that are involved in forced abortions.\n  Some of my colleagues will say this is unnecessary; it is already the \nlaw. If it is, I hope they will go along with this amendment and \nsupport it and not vote to table it this morning. This is a very real \nand serious problem. The U.N. Global Fund is very well known for \nsupporting organizations in China and elsewhere that promote forced \nabortions and forced sterilization on women. This is not only an \nabortion issue; it is a human rights issue that we all need to stand up \nand support.\n  So as we head to 11 o'clock, I wish to remind my colleagues again, \nbecause sometimes we confuse so many things together here that people \ndon't know what we are voting on. The majority leader has moved to \ntable my amendment--the amendment that says we can't add three new \ncontinents to this bill--because he knows that attached to it is this \namendment that would prohibit funds from being used for forced \nabortions. The whole reason for the big debacle we had here in the \nSenate last Friday where people were brought back late is because the \nmajority leader would not allow me to offer this amendment that would \nprohibit taxpayer dollars from being used for forced abortions in China \nand other places in the world.\n  So this is a very important vote at 11 o'clock. My colleagues need to \nknow that if they vote to table my amendment, they are voting to do two \nthings. First, they are voting to divert funds from this Africa fund \nand other countries that were authorized in the first bill--the \ncountries that are suffering from widespread epidemics--they will be \nvoting to divert these funds to countries where there are very isolated \nproblems. The money will ultimately be spread around the world to \norganizations that waste this money instead of focusing it where we can \nreally make a difference. Also, voting to table this amendment means \nyou are supporting using PEPFAR funds, which are supposed to be for \nAIDS in Africa, you are supporting using those funds to promote forced \nabortions and forced sterilization in China and in other countries.\n\n  So I want my colleagues to be clear. I am not sure how the majority \nleader and others will present this motion to table, but the reason \nthey are attempting to table it is because they want to stop the \namendment that would not allow these funds to be used through the U.N. \nGlobal Fund to organizations in China that promote forced abortion. So \nI urge my colleagues to vote no--to vote no to table this amendment on \nthese amendments so they can receive a fair vote in the Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have come to the floor this morning \nto raise a very important concern. As all of my colleagues are aware, \nour Nation's aerial refueling tanker fleet is aging and badly in need \nof repair and replacement. We are in the process of selecting a new \nplane right now that can serve our military for 40 years or even more. \nThose tankers are the backbone of our global military. They are \nstationed today throughout the world, and they refuel aircraft from \nevery branch of the Armed Forces. I think everyone would agree, \nespecially in a time of war, that as we work to replace that fleet, \nthere is nothing more important than buying the best planes for our men \nand women and for our taxpayers.\n  Last month, in its decision sustaining Boeing's protest of the \ncompetition, the Government Accountability Office found that the Air \nForce made significant errors when it evaluated the bids by Boeing and \nthe European company Airbus. The GAO found that the competition was \nskewed toward Airbus even though Airbus failed to meet even basic \nrequirements of that contract.\n  I was pleased last week when the Pentagon announced that it would \nrebid the contest and take over the selection process. I had hoped it \nwould ensure that we finally hold a fair and transparent competition \nand get this contract right. But instead of a fair do-over, I am \nconcerned that it appears\n\n[[Page S6683]]\n\nthat the Pentagon may be planning to change the rules to benefit the \nalready chosen winner--Airbus--by awarding greater benefits to a bigger \nplane. That would be shocking, given the significant number of flaws \nfound by the GAO and how important this competition is to our \nservicemembers. Changing the rules of the game in overtime to benefit \nAirbus is not the kind of transparency the American taxpayer is looking \nfor now in this process. So I wish to spend a few moments this morning \nexplaining why this is the wrong decision for our servicemembers and \nfor our taxpayers, and I wish to begin by reminding my colleagues of \nthe GAO findings.\n  The GAO's decision was damning. It left no doubt that the Pentagon \nshould start over and rebid the competition. The GAO found eight \nseparate errors, and it described the competition as ``unreasonable, \nimproper, and misleading.''\n  Among its findings was that the Air Force changed direction about \nwhich criteria were more important. It did not give Boeing credit for \nproviding a more capable plane, according to the Air Force's \ndescription of what it wanted. Yet it gave Airbus extra credit for \noffering amenities it did not even ask for. And the Air Force accepted \nAirbus's proposal even though it could not meet two of the key contract \nrequirements.\n  Airbus, first of all, refused to commit to providing long-term \nmaintenance as specified in the RFP, even after the Air Force \nrepeatedly asked for it. Secondly, the Air Force could not prove that \nAirbus could even refuel all of the military's aircraft, according to \nprocedure.\n  Some of my colleagues have tried to downplay the GAO's ruling. They \nsay the GAO upheld 8 points of protest, not 25, not 100, so the results \nwere somehow less significant. I think they ought to go back and read \nthe GAO's report one more time because the list speaks for itself. The \nGAO found fundamental problems, including that the Air Force could not \neven prove the Airbus plane could actually refuel all of our aircraft \nby the books, and it determined that but for those errors, Boeing could \nhave won.\n  As Daniel Gordon, the Deputy General Counsel for the GAO said last \nweek when he was asked about this issue before the House Armed Services \nCommittee, he said:\n\n       We don't focus on this being seven out of 100. We focus on \n     the seven that we found that caused us to sustain the \n     protest.\n\n  I remind my colleagues about the GAO findings because after reading \nthe decision, the next step should be obvious. The Pentagon should \nreturn to the original request for proposals and start this competition \nover. But instead, officials say they plan to change the criteria in \norder to benefit a larger airplane, and that is my first concern. When \nthe right course for the Pentagon to take is so clear, I have to ask \nwhy in the world would it change the rules now, unless the Defense \nDepartment is hoping to skew the competition in favor of Airbus yet \nagain.\n  My colleagues will remember that compared to Boeing 767, Airbus's \nA330 plane is massive. Clearly giving greater benefit to a larger plane \nin the middle of the game would only help Airbus at Boeing's expense, \nand that would be blatantly unfair. Why should the Pentagon give extra \ncredit only to Airbus? The Air Force itself found that the Boeing \ntanker was more survivable or better able to keep the warfighters safe. \nThat is a clear advantage, and I think most Americans would agree that \ngiving our air men and women the safest plane should count for more.\n  I don't just object because the Pentagon's new criteria could \nunfairly skew this new competition. I am also very concerned that the \nPentagon has lost sight of why it needs these tankers. It appears to me \nthat by changing the rules in favor of a larger tanker, the Defense \nDepartment is pushing the military further and further away from the \ngoals it had when it started this whole replacement process.\n  I am not the only one who is raising this issue. Retired Air Force \nGEN John Handy, who is a former leader of the Transportation and Air \nMobility Commands, pointed out in a recent article that the Air Force \noriginally asked for a midsized tanker in its RFP because that is what \nthe military needs to carry out its mission. The Air Force, by the way, \nalready has a larger tanker, the KC-10, which has its own role in the \nAir Force.\n  Midsized tankers are the Air Force's multitaskers. They are designed \nto respond to needs all over the world at a moment's notice. They have \nto be able to use our current hangars, our ramps, and our runways, and \nthey must be flexible enough to allow our warfighters to refuel \naircraft during combat or to haul freight and passengers and return \nhome safely.\n  General Handy is one of the many experts and observers who has \nquestioned what the Air Force was thinking when it selected the larger \nAirbus tanker in the first competition because compared to the 767, the \nA330 simply could not do the job as well.\n  I, too, have asked repeatedly for the Defense Department to justify \nthat decision, and I have yet to receive any clear-cut answers--not \nfrom the White House, not from the Pentagon, and not from the Air \nForce. But I think General Handy has identified one possible reason. As \nhe put it:\n\n       Somewhere along this acquisition process, it is obvious to \n     me that someone lost sight of the requirement.\n\n  Unfortunately, it is our servicemembers and our taxpayers who are \ngoing to end up paying the price.\n  The Defense Department's decision is not yet set in stone. It has not \nyet officially reopened this competition. The Pentagon still can make \nthe decision to go back to the original RFP and run a fair contest, and \nit can ensure that our servicemembers get the best tanker possible, one \nthat will allow them to do their jobs and get home safely.\n  I come to the floor today to urge the Pentagon to rethink the \ndecision to change the selection criteria. For the sake of our \nservicemembers, for the sake of our taxpayers, I hope they do the right \nthing--start this competition over using the original RFP, and get \nthese planes into the field where they are desperately needed.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, how much time remains on our side in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6683-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6683-S6685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              OIL DRILLING\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I have come to the floor this morning \nto comment on the press conference that President Bush had just moments \nago where he renewed his call for more oil drilling, saying that more \ndrilling is the answer to spiraling prices.\n  I have to tell you, unfortunately for all of us who are suffering \nfrom these out-of-control prices at the pump, what I hear is the \nPresident coming out and talking real tough but offering no solutions \nto the real crisis in front of us.\n  Americans are hurting today. In my home State of Washington, we are \npaying $4.45 a gallon. But I cannot go home and tell my constituents \nthat we are going to go drill off the coast of Washington State and \nlower their prices at the gas pump. That is not true. In fact, the \nPresident's own Department of Energy says to us that lifting the \nmoratorium is not going to have an impact until 2030. Even then, in \n2030, there is no guarantee that drilling more oil off the coast of my \nState or any other will solve this gas price problem in 2030.\n  The President says he wants to open more land for drilling to \nincrease production. What he doesn't say is that the oil companies \nright now today hold 68 million acres of land, both onshore and \noffshore, that they could, if they wanted to, drill today.\n  Let me say that again. While the President wants to hand out more \nleases, he wants all of us to come out here and hand more leases to the \noil companies, they are already sitting on 68 million acres of Federal \nland doing nothing to explore and produce oil on those leases. Why? \nBecause if they put more oil out there today, prices will drop, and \nthey are doing pretty darn good today.\n\n[[Page S6684]]\n\n  I don't think we should be surprised. I don't think we should be \nsurprised at this at all. These are the same oil companies that are \nmaking record profits, billions and billions each year, as a direct \nresult of increasing oil and gas prices. It is no surprise they are \ntelling us: More drilling, give us more to drill, give us more to \ndrill, and making empty promises of lowering gas prices when that \nsimply is not true.\n  Given that there are two oil men in the White House today, I don't \nthink any of us should be surprised. I don't think any of us should be \nsurprised that millions of barrels of oil the oil companies pull from \nAmerican soil today never enter the market. It is sold, by the way, not \nto the United States but to markets in China and overseas. So telling \nus this will lower our gas prices, to me, seems pretty out of touch \nwhen we know that if we were to come out here and allow them to drill \nmore in the areas off our coast, having a huge impact on our fishing \nindustries and our tourism industries and other important industries in \nthe State today, that we would never see that oil even if we allowed \nthem to drill it because it would be sold to markets overseas. There is \nno requirement that it would come here to the United States anyway.\n\n  Families in my home State of Washington and across this country are \npretty sick and tired of paying higher and higher prices at the pump. \nIt is certainly impacting the economy of every small business, every \nfamily, every community. Those people deserve real solutions. They \ndeserve solutions that are going to offer stability and controlled \nprices. What we are hearing from the President today is just going to \ngive them more of the same: empty promises and failed policies.\n  Over the past week or so, I have heard the Republicans saying: Find \nmore, use less. That sounds pretty good to me, but I have a good \nsolution to that. Have the companies find that ``more oil'' in the 68 \nmillion acres they currently hold by drilling today. Then let's invest \nin ``using less'' by passing the energy tax credits that Republicans \nhave filibustered, by the way, time and time again on this floor. I \nthink it is long past time that those new investments are made in \nrenewable energy and fast-tracking alternative energy technology so we \ndon't continually come out here and fall into this drill, drill, drill \ndebate that sends empty promises to people who really are hurting \ntoday.\n  I think we should have a policy that really works. I think we ought \nto look for solutions on this floor in ways that provide real \nsolutions. But just getting into a debate that sends empty promises and \nlistening to a President in the White House say give the oil companies \nlots more to drill and sending an empty promise to my home State of \nWashington and across this Nation, to me, is pandering at its worst.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. First of all, I agree with everything the Senator just \nsaid. But if, in fact, if I am not mistaken, all of the reserves that \nare estimated to exist off of your shore and ours--in Delaware they \nwant to drill as well--if all the reserves in the entire continental \nUnited States, the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic \nOcean--if they all exist, and they all meet the expectation of the \nbest, most probable high return, we still only represent 3 percent of \nthe total world oil reserves.\n  My problem is my Republican colleagues who tout themselves as being \nbig businessmen who understand how the business world works in the \nmarket economy, it always amazes me how they fail to remember how \ncartels work. The cartel called OPEC controls the vast majority of the \noil resources. Not one of these wells would come on before 10 years--\nnot one. That is according to our Department of Energy. Not one for 10 \nyears.\n  When they come on, what makes anybody think that the outfit that \ncontrols 60 or 70 percent of the world's oil reserves isn't going to \njust pump 3 percent less? Does anybody think that OPEC, knowing that we \nhad 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, is going to continue to pump \nat the rate they are pumping? I promise you they will reduce the amount \nof oil they pump just like they always did to 3, 4, 5, 7 percent less, \nguaranteeing that whatever the price was will be sustained.\n  What I do not understand is, I do not understand our friends, \nincluding the President, who was a businessman of sorts--I don't mean \nthat; I am not being a wise guy--who was in the business world prior to \nthis, doesn't understand how cartels work. Is there anywhere in the \nPresident's offshore drilling where he has gotten a commitment from \nOPEC that they will continue to pump at the rate they are pumping now? \nAre you aware of any such?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Delaware raises a good point. Of course \nhe hasn't gotten that kind of commitment from the OPEC countries. Of \ncourse he has not. They are focused on a profit, as they are doing \nquite well today.\n  The Senator is right. If we were to go ahead and use this moment in \nour history when we have some big decisions to make to just say: Oh, we \nwill drill more, there is absolutely no guarantee that OPEC will not \ncontrol that supply.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will continue to yield for a moment, the \nthing I want everybody to understand is, as a guy named Yergin, who \nchairs the Cambridge Research Group, who advises not all but most of \nthe major world oil companies, explained to me once, he said: You know, \noil is like filling your swimming pool. If you put a hose in your \nswimming pool and you keep filling it and filling it, it takes a long \ntime to raise an inch or two. It has virtually no impact on the total \nsize cubic feet of your swimming pool or the amount of water in it. The \nsecond thing is, all the oil that goes into that swimming pool all goes \ninto one big pool. It is all the same price.\n  If you notice, people pumping oil in Texas are not charging less than \npeople pumping oil in Saudi Arabia. If you notice, people pumping oil \nin California are not charging less than people pumping oil in \nVenezuela. If you notice, when the OPEC price goes up ``American'' \noilfields benefit.\n  I am not suggesting the American oilfields are in collusion with \nOPEC, but guess what. Americans think, if we pump our own oil, we will \nbe independent. It ``ain't'' our own oil.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I remind the Senator, if we were to do that, that oil \nwould not come to America where our constituents would be able to use \nit.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The oil on the Senator's side of the country would not. \nOne reason I voted against the Alaska pipeline is instead of going \nthrough Canada to the United States, it would go to Japan, figuratively \nspeaking.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. So it goes there today.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I hope we start talking about basic facts. If everything \nwe think we have under the ground that we control as the United \nStates--on the Continental Shelf, off the Pacific Ocean, in ANWR--\neverything out there, we have 3 percent of the world's proven oil \nreserves. It doesn't give you much of a bargaining chip. It would be \none thing if you say: You know, every bit of the oil we pump that we \ncontrol goes to the United States, and we are only going to charge $2 a \nbarrel. Wouldn't that be great? Or $10 or $20 or $30 or $50. But I kind \nof notice, those guys down in Texas charge us exactly the same price as \nthose guys wearing robes in Saudi Arabia charge us. Isn't that kind of \nfunny? And if you only control 3 percent of the oil reserves and pump \nit all, all the folks we don't like so much who control 60 or 70 \npercent of the reserves, they just pump 3 percent less, and the price \nis the same. We cannot drill our way out of this.\n  I thank my friend from Washington for pointing this out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my friend from Delaware for joining me. We have \nbeen listening to this debate now. The President weighed in from his \npodium this morning. Much as we would like to hand our constituents \ntomorrow morning a lower gas price, we in this Senate have to be \nrealistic about today, tomorrow, and far into the future. Even the \nEnergy Administration Agency has said the impact on wellhead prices \nfrom opening the Pacific, Atlantic, and gulf waters to drilling ``is \nexpected to be insignificant.''\n  Let's not, here on the Senate floor, talk about empty promises to our \nconstituents at a time when they are really hurting. Let's take this \nopportunity\n\n[[Page S6685]]\n\nand time to make long-term investments that put our country on a path \nto being less dependent on oil. Those are the right investments that we \nought to be making. Yes, they are hard. Yes, they are difficult. Yes, \nthey are challenging. It is not easy to come up with compromises on \nthem when we are all from very different parts of the Nation. But let's \nnot just sell a bill of goods to the Nation when we are hurting.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST \n    HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2731, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2731) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     years 2009 through 2013 to provide assistance to foreign \n     countries to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       DeMint amendment No. 5077, to reduce to $35,000,000,000 the \n     amount authorized to be appropriated to combat HIV/AIDS, \n     tuberculosis, and malaria in developing countries during the \n     next 5 years.\n       DeMint amendment No. 5078, to limit the countries to which \n     Federal financial assistance may be targeted under this Act.\n       DeMint amendment No. 5079 (to amendment No. 5078), to \n     prevent certain uses of the Global Fund.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I see my friend from South Carolina is \nhere. I ask unanimous consent there be no second-degree amendments in \norder to the DeMint amendment, No. 5077.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5078\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am shortly going to move to table the \nDeMint amendment, No. 5078, relating to abortion. Senator DeMint and I \nhad a very brief conversation prior to this.\n  I ask unanimous consent there be 2 minutes equally divided for the \nSenator to make his position known.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield to my colleague from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, the motion to table involves two \namendments. It is important my colleagues understand what is involved. \nThe current PEPFAR Program focuses on 15 countries with epidemics of \nAIDS and malaria. The current authorization allows them to work in 110 \ncountries in which they are working now, but the focus has been part of \nmaking this program successful.\n  My amendment would limit the focus of the current PEPFAR bill on the \nSenate floor to the authorized countries in the first bill so the money \nis not spread all over the world to countries that do not need it as \nmuch as Africa and the others.\n  But the other amendment, and the reason this is being tabled, is it \nproposes that we do not allow PEPFAR funds to be used through the U.N. \nGlobal Fund for forced abortions and forced sterilization in China and \nother countries. The law of the land in this country is that our \ntaxpayer dollars are not used for forced abortion. All this does is \nmake sure the money in PEPFAR does not end up with programs like they \nhave in China that force abortions.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote no against tabling these amendments \nso we would be sure that PEPFAR funds are being used where and the way \nthat they are intended to be used.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The underlying amendment, first-degree amendment, which I \nam moving to table would limit U.S. assistance to certain countries. \nRight now PEPFAR is working in 120 countries, and to limit it to 15 I \nthink is very counterproductive.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy), the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), and the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nCorker), and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  21st Century Manufacturing Strategy\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise, in light of the news today by \nGeneral Motors and certainly the ongoing news from American automakers \nand manufacturers, to express, again, concern about the fact that we \nhave had no 21st century manufacturing policy for the last 8 years. As \nother countries are rushing to invest in new innovative technology, \nadvanced battery technology, the next generation of vehicles, as \nGermany has announced the great battery alliance which will invest over \n$650 million in advanced lithium ion batteries; South Korea, by 2010, \nwill have spent $700 million on advanced batteries and developing \nhybrid vehicles; China has invested over $100 million in advanced \nbattery research and development; over the next 5 years Japan will \nspend about $230 million on advanced battery research and $278 million \na year on hydrogen research for zero-emission fuel cell vehicles; in \nthis country, our President's budget last year called for $22 million. \nWe have\n\n[[Page S6686]]\n\nseen no willingness to aggressively invest in a 21st century \nmanufacturing strategy to keep jobs in America. As a result, we have \nseen 3.5 million manufacturing jobs lost since this administration took \noffice in 2001.\n  My home State of Michigan is proud that we make things and grow \nthings and do it well and have, in fact, created the middle class of \nthis country. We have lost over 250,000 manufacturing jobs--in fact, \ngoing on 300,000--since this administration took office. In fact, we \nnow have the same number of manufacturing jobs that we had in September \nof 1952. I won't tell how old I was then, but I wasn't very old in \n1952. Now we are back to the same number of manufacturing jobs, while \nevery other country is rushing to invest in the future.\n  The Senate budget resolution included, I am proud to say, a green-\ncollar jobs initiative which I authored to invest in battery \ntechnology. I appreciate the fact that the leader has supported that \neffort and the chairman of the Energy and Water Committee, Senator \nDorgan, has supported the effort to increase dollars for advanced \nbattery technology research. We also included in the Energy bill last \nyear a retooling effort of our plans to advanced manufacturing and \nalternative fueled vehicles. That needs to be activated and has not yet \nbeen activated.\n  When I look around at what is happening in Michigan now and across \nthe country, what is happening to the middle class, being squeezed on \nall sides with incomes going down and every cost conceivable going up, \nparticularly outrageously high gas prices, then I look at our \nmanufacturers which are impacted by those gas prices as well, impacted \nby unfair trade practices, where other economies, other countries close \ntheir doors to American automakers to make it more difficult to sell \nthere while they are able to sell here, where Japan manipulates their \ncurrency, as well as China, and yet we don't see an aggressive effort \nto create a level playing field on trade so we can export our products, \nnot our jobs; when I see the fact that other countries are investing in \nnew technologies and yet our industries are expected to be doing it \nthemselves without a partnership from their Federal Government--what we \nhave done is placed our companies in the position of competing with \nother countries. My colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, has said \nthat over and over again, the fact that our companies are competing \nwith other countries today. We need to take action now to provide a \n21st century manufacturing strategy that keeps jobs here.\n  Part of that is also health care. When we are looking at competition \ncoming from companies in Japan, where I am told that the cost per \nvehicle for health care is about $95 and here it is $1,500, we can do \nsomething about that, to be able to support our jobs and our industries \nhere in America and keep jobs at home.\n  Right now we have an opportunity I hope we will take. I hope as we \nmove forward with an additional discussion of an emergency \nsupplemental, as we move forward and look at other emergency actions \nthat need to take place, we will understand we need to be activating \nour retooling efforts to keep advanced manufacturing, the new vehicles, \nhere, and we need to invest in the key component, which is advanced \nbattery technology research, to make sure when our automakers are \nmaking hybrids and plug-ins they are not buying the battery from \nanother country.\n  That is what is happening today. We had, a couple years ago, an \nannouncement from Ford Motor Company about the Ford Escape hybrid, and \nwe were very proud of the fact they created the first hybrid SUV. That \nis the good news. The bad news is, they could not find a battery in the \nUnited States. The battery had to be bought in Japan. We do not want to \nexchange foreign dependence on oil for foreign dependence on \ntechnology. We have to act now.\n  I call on the administration that has now put dollars into advanced \nbattery efforts to do more. There is more that can be done under the \nDepartment of Energy. It needs to be done as quickly as possible. We \nare in a race, we are in an economic race, for the next generation of \ntechnology. Whoever gets there first will be creating the jobs as well \nas the marketplace for the future and, I believe, creating the middle \nclass of the future as well.\n  We need to make sure the plants in America are retooled so the new \ngeneration of vehicles being made are not being made overseas for \nAmericans, but they are being made here. We need to be retooling. It is \ncritically important. We have lost 3.5 million manufacturing jobs since \nthis administration took office--no 21st-century manufacturing \nstrategy, no focusing on unfair trade practices, high health care \ncosts, innovation, investment, retooling. Now, adding insult to injury \nwith the price of gas on top of everything else, we find our \nmanufacturers caught on all sides right now trying to make the \ninvestments for the next generation, for the future, to be competitive, \nbut also to deal with the costs they have as a result of lack of action \nin this country, in order to be able to make sure we are competitive \ninternationally.\n  Again, Germany, the Great Battery Alliance; South Korea; China; \nJapan--all focused on the future, all partnering with their industries \nbecause they understand what it means to their economy to be able to \nhave that technology, to be able to be the first, to be able to partner \nwith their industries to create new jobs.\n  That is what we need to be doing here and now. It makes me heartsick \nto see the daily headlines in the newspapers in Michigan as well as in \nmany places across the country when it should not have to happen. If we \nhad seen the administration being willing to work with us, to partner \nwith us on the future, on jobs in America, we would not be where we are \ntoday.\n  I am very hopeful and confident our Democratic majority understands \nthat, and that we are going to continue to do everything we can to be \nable to create the kind of economic climate in this country that will \nallow us to create good paying jobs, great advanced alternative fuel \nvehicles and products we will continue to be proud of, and will allow \nus to keep the middle class in this country.\n  I think that is the biggest task we have right now in a global \neconomy: to fight for jobs and the middle class in this country. We \nneed a change in partnership to help us get that done.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 p.m., \nSenator Menendez be recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes, to be \nfollowed by Senator Domenici for 15 minutes, and that following Senator \nDomenici's remarks, Senator Kyl be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Darfur\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, most of us are aware of the genocide in \nDarfur. We have read about it for years. The best estimates are that \n400,000 people have died as a result of the terrible tragedy in the \nSudan. Another 2 million or more have been displaced.\n  Just this week, the International Criminal Court has named the \nPresident of Sudan as a person to be indicted for war crimes, crimes \nagainst humanity, and genocide. It is an indication of the severity of \nthis crisis and the fact that the world is taking note.\n  What we also know is that other things are happening in this world \nthat are just as devastating, and some of them are within our grasp to \nchange.\n  A few years ago, I made my first trip to Africa in an effort to see \nthe feeding programs available for people in some of the poorest places \non Earth. I also wanted to take a look at the microcredit programs that \nelevate women and give them a chance to finally raise their families \nproperly and to have a future.\n  But I found that no matter where I went in Africa, the same issue \ncommanded my attention. That was the global AIDS crisis. It was a \ncrisis which was just starting at that point, but the numbers were so \nalarming that you could see trends developing that would be devastating \nto communities and families and even countries.\n  At the time, it seemed there was nothing we could do. The drugs that \nwere being developed in the United States were few and very expensive, \nand the notion of bringing those antiretroviral drugs into Africa \nseemed beyond our grasp. So they encouraged people in Africa, in those \ndays, to get tested. But many of them ignored it because they knew if \nthey were tested\n\n[[Page S6687]]\n\npositive it was a simple death sentence, and they would have to resign \nthemselves to the obvious fate.\n  But things have changed, thank goodness, and they have changed for \nthe better. Under President Bush, he described and started an \ninitiative to deal with the global AIDS crisis. As I have said on the \nfloor many times, I have disagreed with the President on so many \nthings, but I certainly believe this was an inspired position which he \ntook, that the United States would lead the world in dealing with the \nglobal AIDS crisis.\n  We were not only going to address HIV and AIDS, but also tuberculosis \nand malaria. In many countries, more people are dying from the latter \ntwo than even HIV/AIDS. The President chose 15 countries that the \nUnited States would deal with directly in the President's program. Then \nfor the rest of the world in need, we would work with other countries \nin what is known as the Global Fund.\n  Before us today on the floor of the Senate is the President's program \nfor dealing with global AIDS. I think it is one of the most important \nvotes we are going to cast this year. The success of this program has \nbrought us a long way in the last 5 or 6 years.\n  Mr. President, 5 or 6 years ago, only 50,000 people in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica were receiving treatment--50,000. Today, PEPFAR and the Global \nFund reach nearly 2 million people, primarily in Africa.\n  In the 15 PEPFAR focus countries, the program has helped prevent \nmother-to-child HIV transmission during nearly 12.7 million \npregnancies. An HIV-positive mother nursing a child, if she is not \ntreated properly, could transmit the disease. The treatment is very \ninexpensive, and a mother taking this drug before she delivers the baby \ncan protect her child through childbirth and perhaps afterwards. We \nhave done that now for 12.7 million pregnancies.\n  We have provided antiretroviral prophylaxis for well over 800,000 \nwomen who were determined to be HIV positive and prevented over 150,000 \nnew infections of newborn children just through this program.\n  We have cared for more than 6.6 million people, including more than \n2.7 million orphans and children.\n  We have provided over 33 million HIV counseling and testing sessions \nfor men, women, and children.\n  From fiscal year 2004 through 2007, PEPFAR, the President's program \non AIDS, supported nearly 2.6 million training and continuing education \nencounters for health care workers.\n  That is a remarkable record of progress in just 5 years. This \nsituation on the ground in Africa has been literally transformed \nbecause of the efforts of the United States--and other countries--but \nthe efforts of the United States through PEPFAR and the Global Fund.\n  The bill before us authorizes $50 billion over 5 years, including $9 \nbillion for tuberculosis and malaria. It is a large sum of money, but \nput it in context. Each month, we spend $12 to $15 billion on the war \nin Iraq. We are talking about spending $10 billion over the course of a \nyear to deal with the global AIDS crisis, tuberculosis, and malaria.\n  The bill requires the President to develop a strategy for spending \nthat will prevent 12 million new infections, that will treat and care \nfor at least 14 million people, including 5 million children, make sure \nwomen have universal access to prevention of mother-to-child \ntransmission, and will build the health care capacity of the countries \nthat are most affected.\n  I went to the Congo--the Democratic Republic of the Congo--with \nSenator Brownback of Kansas a few years ago, and we visited the city of \nGoma. Goma is in the northeastern section of the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo. It is a very poor city, and it has so many--so many--\nchallenges: hunger, disease, war, and, on top of that, a volcano.\n  We visited a hospital there that was packed with people, in this case \nwith women who were seeking a surgery for obstetric fistula. They were \nwomen, because of sexual assault or a birth at a very early age, ended \nup with serious internal problems that required surgery, and there was \nnowhere to turn. They were shunned in their villages and by their \nfamilies because of the problems associated with this condition.\n  Many of them marched and trekked hundreds of miles to get to this \nhospital. It is called DOCS Hospital. It is supported by the Protestant \nChurches of America. We saw the women waiting outside, huddled around \nlittle fires making their food, waiting for the chance for their \nsurgery. Sometimes they waited for months, and oftentimes they needed a \nrepeat surgery.\n  After the surgery, they would go into these wards with beds, and the \npatients were two to a single bed. There just was no place to turn. \nThis was their only hope. Thanks to the United Nations, they had a \nmodern surgical suite, but clearly they did not have the health \ncapacity to deal with this obvious problem.\n  I asked them: How many surgeons do you have in this area of the \nCongo?\n  They said: We have one surgeon for every 1 million people.\n  I am proud to represent the city of Chicago. I cannot imagine the \ncity of Chicago with three surgeons. But that is what they face in \nparts of Africa. The same thing is true when it comes to other \nprofessionals: doctors and nurses. Part of the problem is just not \ntheir failure to train these medical professionals, but the fact that \nwe in the West, with our voracious appetite for medical care, are \npoaching the best and brightest of the medical professionals in the \ndeveloping world.\n  Take a look around your city, go to your local hospital. I just \nvisited a Chicago hospital over the weekend and was introduced to a \nnumber of the members of the staff. I asked two of the women where they \nwere from, and they said Ghana. Ghana is in Africa, obviously. My guess \nis that the community they left needed their medical care as much if \nnot more than the United States. But they were drawn to the United \nStates for obvious reasons.\n  The surgeons I mentioned in the Congo are paid by the Government. If \nthey are fortunate enough to be paid--and they are not always paid--\nthey are paid $600 a month. Well, a surgeon in the United States is \ngoing to do much better than that. So the United States, England, \nFrance, and Germany recruit these medical professionals from the \npoorest places on Earth, and those countries, then faced with HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis, malaria, and other obvious surgical needs, don't have the \nprofessionals.\n\n  What difference does it make to us? We feel content that we have that \nnurse at our beck and call when we are in a hospital. We want all of \nour family to have the very best medical care. However, we have to \naccept the reality that a medical crisis halfway around the world can \nbe visited on the United States of America within a matter of days. \nWhat used to result in a trip across the ocean in a ship where the \nsickly would die on the way no longer occurs. People take airplanes and \nin a matter of hours they are here, and they bring with them not only \ntheir foreign culture but many times their foreign diseases. So a \npublic health crisis in some other part of the world has to be a \ngenuine concern of ours as well.\n  This bill we have before us recognizes that. It takes into account \nthe need to expand the health care capacity of some of the poorest \nplaces on Earth, including training community health workers to deliver \nprimary health care and preventive services. It includes some \nprovisions I have worked on earlier, and I salute the committee for \nadding them relative to expanding the health care capacity in Africa. I \nhad introduced a bill with five of my colleagues--S. 805--the African \nHealth Capacity Act, and some of the provisions are included.\n  I might say parenthetically that we need to find a solution to our \nproblem in the United States, because we need nurses and doctors here \nas well, and the answer is pretty obvious. We need homegrown talent. \nThis year, in my State of Illinois, we turned away 2,000 qualified \nnursing students. We didn't have enough classrooms or teachers or \nclinical opportunities. Two thousand would-be nurses were told: No, you \nwon't be given admission to an Illinois school this year. When we \nconsider the shortage in health care professionals, we can't afford to \ndo that. Whether it is doctors or nurses or other health professionals, \nwe need to be actively recruiting more in the United States so we \naren't reaching out to the poorest places on Earth, poaching their \ntalent, when they desperately need it as well.\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\n  This bill goes on to expand current programs. It funds the testing, \ncounseling, treatment and new protocols to address drug resistance in \ntreating tuberculosis. Our colleague, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, \nhas been a leader in the House, and now in the Senate, on the issue of \ntuberculosis. Most of us pay little attention to this because it is an \nillness and disease that affects the poor. However, we probably noted \nin the news not long ago when there was a person who wasn't poor who \nwas banned from travel because he was carrying this disease--this drug-\nresistant, rather, form of tuberculosis. So we understand this can \naffect others outside of those who are impoverished. The goal is to do \nmore work worldwide to deal with this with testing, counseling, and \ntreatment.\n  Incidentally, the treatment of tuberculosis in its most common form \nis inexpensive. It requires a dutiful process to make sure the person \ntakes their medicine on a regular basis. Some countries such as India \nhave found out how to do this and are leading the way and we should \nfollow their example.\n  This bill also strengthens the role of the U.S. malaria coordinator. \nIt increases the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund with additional \nsafeguards and oversight, and it funds research on microbicides to help \nprevent the spread of HIV. It is a good bill and it covers a lot of \ndifferent things.\n  We are at a point now where we are in a battle with many forces in \nthis world who are trying to define the United States and tell people \naround the world who we are. Many of those representations are false \nand misleading. Unfortunately, they create enemies of the United \nStates--people who should be our friends. I think when the United \nStates embarks on this kind of effort--a global health effort--with \ntangible results in countries around the world, we demonstrate our \nvalues and our caring. That is why I think this bill is so important. I \nam sorry it has been held up for a number of months, but the good news \nis it is on the floor now and we have a chance to pass it.\n  This bill would require that more than half of the money appropriated \nfor addressing local HIV/AIDS be spent on antiretroviral drug treatment \nand care, controlling other infections that can occur. It provides \nnutrition and food support and other medical care essential to HIV/AIDS \ntreatment.\n  The critics of this bill say it goes too far--not just in the money \nspent, which I disagree with--but in what they call mission creep. They \nargue that nutrition and safe drinking water and empowerment of women \nand girls bears little relation to the fight against global AIDS. They \nbelieve you should give individuals a pill and send them on their way. \nWell, common sense suggests otherwise. If you visit the poorest places \non Earth and have time to ask only one question, I have found that the \nquestion you should ask, if you want to know whether this country has a \nchance to overcome its problems, is this: How do you treat your women? \nIf women are treated like property, slaves, or chattel, if they have no \nvoices in decisions of the family or community, it is likely that some \nof the worst medical conditions and economic conditions will continue \nand will worsen; but if women have a role--if they are educated; if \nthey have a voice in their communities and in their government--it \nmakes all the difference in the world.\n  So in this bill, when we talk about empowering women and girls \nthrough education, training, and self-awareness, it is money well \nspent. These are the women who will guide that country in the future \nand who will be a strong voice in a family where otherwise they might \nbe mistreated or infected without even being able to speak a word.\n  I also think it is obvious that handing medicine to someone who is \ninfected isn't enough. I have been to Nairobi and Kenya. I have seen \nthe clinic where women who are receiving these expensive antiretroviral \ndrugs were dying before my eyes--not of HIV/AIDS, but of malnutrition. \nThey were, with limited funds, providing for their children and not \ngiving themselves enough to eat, so even the antiretroviral drugs \nweren't working.\n  So when this bill talks about providing basic nutrition for people \naround the world, particularly women, so that the drugs will work, it \nis common sense. The same thing for safe drinking water. If there is \none thing that causes more medical problems on this Earth, it is filthy \ndrinking water which causes people, and children especially, to get \nsick and die. When we talk about safe drinking water as part of this \nwhole program in dealing with global health, it is imminently sensible; \nand those who argue that it goes too far, we shouldn't include it in \nthis bill, haven't taken the time to meet the people who live under \nthese terrible circumstances.\n  I hope this bill will pass and I hope it passes soon. We have been \nwaiting for some time. Condoleezza Rice, our Secretary of State, and \nPresident Bush have asked us to move this bill forward to provide the \ntechnical and financial assistance to help countries develop their \nnational health workforce, expand worker training and retention, build \nclinics and health networks.\n  This bill sets a target of training and retaining 140,000 \nprofessionals and paraprofessionals. If we can build that work force in \nthe focus countries, we will have the minimum staffing levels of \ndoctors and nurses and midwives recommended by the World Health \nOrganization. We have to change the situation on the ground. Villages \nwill continue to depend on donors for medicine and clinics until they \ndevelop their own health care capacity. We can start to change the \nsituation with the technical assistance and financial aid authorized in \nthis bill.\n  The best response to the global AIDS crisis is to help these \ncountries build a more sustainable, locally driven public health \nsystem. The bill is named after two former Members of the House of \nRepresentatives: Tom Lantos of California, who recently passed away, \nand Henry Hyde of Illinois, both of whom supported this legislation. In \ntheir name and in their honor, we should pass it and pass it as quickly \nas we can.\n\n  I recall my first trip to Africa. I went to Uganda. There was a \nclinic there before any of the drugs had arrived where people had been \ndiagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Some of the women at that clinic who had small \nchildren were involved in a project called the Memory Book. They would \nsit on the porch of this clinic while their children played on the \nplayground. They were assembling their life story with photographs, \ntelling about memories of their family and memories of their children \nwhen they were born and as they grew up. This memory book was going to \nbe handed off to the child, still very young, to hold on to so that \nwhen mother was gone, having died of HIV/AIDS, there would at least be \nsome evidence that she lived, some evidence of her love for that child.\n  At this same clinic in the days before antiretroviral drugs, they had \na choir. It is not unusual. Almost every place you go in Africa, they \nsing. They sing when they greet you, they sing when you leave, they \nwill sing in the middle of a meeting. It is beautiful. This choir at \nthis clinic was a choir made up of men and women who had been diagnosed \nwith HIV/AIDS and had nowhere to turn. They knew they were all doomed. \nThey came together to sing songs they had written about their plight, \nand one of them--they gave me a small tape recording--is entitled ``Why \nMe?'' It was a song that broke your heart as you heard them sing it: \nWhy her, why him, why you, why me--trying to figure out why this had \nhappened to them, that they came down with this deadly disease and knew \nthey would die.\n  It wasn't that long ago when I made that trip. Today, things have \nchanged. It has changed because the United States and the caring people \nof this country are stepping forward. Millions of people are now alive \ntoday. Millions of children who would have been orphaned now have a \nchance. Is this an important thing for us to do? I think it is. I think \nit is important in moral terms, but it is important in political terms \ntoo, to make sure that all around the world, people understand who we \nare, what our values are, and that we are a caring and compassionate \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are all aware of the seriousness of \nthe oil crisis. Gas prices are more than three times what they were \nwhen President Bush took office. High prices are forcing some \nbusinesses to cut back or close and forcing some families to choose \nbetween putting a gallon of gas in the tank and putting a gallon of \nmilk on their kitchen table.\n  People are demanding honest solutions to our oil crisis. But \nPresident Bush, John McCain, and their allies on the other side of the \naisle have only decided to perpetuate myths, which is what brings me to \nthe floor.\n  They have told us offshore drilling will lower gas prices tomorrow. \nThey have told us oil companies could produce more if we hand over even \nmore Federal land and water to them. When people spoke about the \ndangers of drilling, they claimed no oil was spilled after Hurricane \nKatrina and that drilling off the shore of one State would not affect \nall the other States around it.\n  I am here to clear up these myths before it is too late and they take \na life of their own.\n  Myth No. 1: Drilling immediately brings down gas prices. The biggest \nmyth, a myth that has been repeated over and over on the floor of this \nChamber, is that opening our shores to drilling will somehow lower the \nprice of gasoline. Let's get one thing straight; drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf will do nothing to bring down gas prices--not now, \nnot ever.\n  While President Bush is suggesting that drilling will bring down \nprices at the pump, his own Energy Information Administration admits \ndrilling will have no effect. The reason is the amount of oil involved \nis a drop in the bucket compared to what we use every day.\n  Let me put offshore production in perspective. Since April of this \nyear, Americans have responded to extraordinarily high gas prices by \nusing over 800,000 barrels of oil less than we did 1 year ago. That is \nthe most significant and sudden drop in oil demand since the 1970s. Yet \nwhat have we seen since April? We have continued to see record gas \nprices.\n  In recent weeks, in response to record oil prices, Saudi Arabia has \nincreased its production of oil by 500,000 barrels each and every day. \nWhat has been the effect on gas prices? They continue to go up.\n  So how does the Bush/McCain drilling plan compare to these recent \nevents? If we open all our shores to oil production, the first drop of \noil would not be seen for over a decade. Offshore oil production would \npeak in the year 2030 and only at 200,000 barrels a day. To put that \nnumber another way, the amount of gas we could get from offshore \ndrilling is equivalent to a few tablespoons per car per day.\n  So let's look at the totality of this. If 800,000 barrels per day in \nreduced demand by Americans combined with an increase of 500,000 \nbarrels per day of Saudi production--a total shift of 1.3 million \nbarrels a day--doesn't lower gas prices, how does 200,000 in the year \n2030 lower gas prices? If we have seen a shift of both a reduction in \ndemand and an increase in that supply by 1.3 million barrels a day, and \nthe price still goes up, how is it that 200,000 barrels in 2030 is \ngoing to do anything? It is a myth.\n  The second myth we hear is that if oil companies could only lease \nmore Federal land and water, they would produce more oil. The fact of \nthe matter is the oil industry has already leased 68 million acres of \nland, where they have not produced--for the most part--a single drop of \noil. The oil companies clearly think there is oil there or else why \nwould they be leasing the land? But they are not using it.\n  This chart is an example of where all that oil is located. I know our \nRepublican colleagues have these little sayings, and they are going \naround with patches on their lapels saying ``find more, use less.'' \nThis is what they should be telling the oil companies: Find more and \nuse less. In fact, they are not even pursuing that which they already \nhave access to.\n  To get an idea of the scale involved, here is a map showing how much \nterritory the oil companies control in the Gulf of Mexico. The red part \nof the map represents unused acres. It is a huge portion of the gulf \nregion, going completely undeveloped, which they already have leases \nand access to.\n  Here is an even more impressive map--a map of how much of the Western \nUnited States oil companies control. The black portion shows where \ncompanies are exploring and, again, the red is where they are. As you \ncan see, the red far exceeds the black portion of the map. These oil \ncompanies control an enormous amount of land. When you add it all up, \nit is an area more than 12 times the size of my home State of New \nJersey.\n  So why are oil companies asking us to hand over more land, when they \nhave so much land that is already unused? It seems to me there is only \none explanation: Oil companies aren't actually in a rush to drill in \nthose areas, but they are in a rush to control as much Federal land as \npossible before their friends in the White House leave.\n  Let's talk about myth No. 3. In order to convince us to let this plan \ngo through, big oil and their supporters want us to believe a third \nmyth, which is that offshore drilling presents no threat to our \nenvironment and to the economies of States, such as New Jersey, where \ntourism is the second multibillion dollar part of our economy.\n  Many of my colleagues from the Republican side of the aisle, \nincluding Senator McConnell and Senator McCain, have repeatedly denied \nthat oil spills could happen. They have denied repeatedly that \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita caused any oil to spill.\n  The picture I have here was taken not by me but by the U.S. Coast \nGuard. It shows what happened after the hurricanes: a massive oil spill \nthat was set on fire to assist in the cleanup effort, as indicated in \nthis photo.\n  I don't know what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \nconsider ``significant spillage,'' but I know if I saw this scene on \nthe New Jersey shore, I would consider it a disaster.\n  In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused devastation on a massive \nscale. The EPA, the U.S. Minerals Management Service, the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Coast Guard all agree \nthat the storms caused 700,000 gallons of oil to spill into the Gulf of \nMexico and over 7 million gallons of oil to leak onshore from the \ninfrastructure that supports offshore drilling.\n  When oil spills in those quantities take place, it is not isolated to \na small area. Some suggest certain States may want to drill and other \nStates may not want to drill off their coast, but the devastation \nspreads far and wide. When the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska, the \nspill was 600 miles wide. The IXTOC I spill in the Gulf of Mexico \ntraveled 600 miles. That is why the decision to drill cannot be left to \na single State, because the State's actions affect all the other States \nin proximity to it.\n  An oil spill off the coast of Virginia could wash up as far away as \nMaine. It could devastate the coastline from South Carolina to New \nYork.\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\n  In my home State of New Jersey, the shore generates tens of billions \nof dollars in revenue each year and supports about half a million jobs.\n  New Jersey families and businesses cannot afford the risk of a \ndisaster on the scale of the Exxon Valdez crash or the spills after \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, with sticky crude washing up on our \nbeaches, killing our wildlife, collapsing property values, and \ndestroying our economy in the process.\n  Let's be honest. If there is drilling off our shore, it is not \nguaranteed that there would not be a major spill. These facts show that \nto be quite to the contrary. Disasters have happened before and they \nwill happen again. The question is, Is the risk of a significant \ndisaster worth the insignificant amount of oil that might come with the \ndrilling? That answer is, clearly, no.\n\n  Now, to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who say, drill \nmore and ultimately conserve some, I say our need is to act more and \ntalk less. Let's do something that really does something about gas \nprices.\n  If we are going to bring down gas prices, we need a better plan. \nFirst, we cannot wait until the year 2030 to get the type of relief we \nneed in terms of offshore drilling. We need to lower gas prices now. \nThe last time we opened lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico, with huge \namounts, ultimately, what happened? That was a year and a half, 2 years \nago. Did prices go down after we opened that section of the gulf? No. \nThey went up. We cannot wait.\n  The supply-and-demand equation for oil is basically the same as it \nwas a year ago--that is what testimony before the Congress tells us by \neven the oil executives--and prices have skyrocketed.\n  We need to check the unchecked speculation on the oil trading \nmarkets, which has driven oil prices higher. We need to see to it that \nour commodities markets are functioning fairly, so prices come down \nfrom their artificial highs. Yes, we offer drilling. But let us drill \non the 68 million acres the oil companies have already leased to bring \ndown the price of oil, not just use it to pad their books and inflate \nthe price of their stock.\n  Together with Senators Feingold and Dodd, I have introduced \nlegislation that sends a simple message to oil companies about the \nFederal land they lease: Use it or lose it.\n  The bill mandates that oil companies either produce on or seek to \ndevelop their existing Federal leases or make way for someone who will. \nMost importantly, we need to break our dependence upon oil. Here is the \nbigger picture: We can only ever produce a fraction of the oil we use \nas a country.\n  The only way for us to protect ourselves from rising gas prices is to \nend our dependence on oil, and that means making immediate, substantial \ninvestments in renewable fuels and conservation.\n  We should all get behind legislation, which our colleagues are \nopposed to, to expand tax credits for renewable energy producers. In \norder to boost vehicle efficiency, we should create stronger incentives \nfor plug-in hybrids, support advanced battery research and research \ninto cellulosic fuels.\n  It is time we fully funded mass transit at the level it deserves. We \ncan do all this in the time President Bush would have us wait for \nminimal oil production along our coastlines.\n  Let's be clear. This coastline drilling plan is not a serious \nproposal to help American families today. It is exploitation of pain at \nthe pump to give yet another handout to the oil companies.\n  It is long past time to stop repeating the myths that lie at the \nbottom of it. Instead of buying into this overhyped, oversold plan, if \nwe work together, we have the ability and ingenuity as a country to \nsecure our energy future once and for all.\n  It is that aspiration that we should, in fact, pursue. It is time we \ndecide on a plan that looks out not just for the future of the oil \ncompanies but for our future as a nation. That is why our colleagues \nshould join us in pushing the big oil companies to pursue drilling on \nthe 68 million acres they have, ensure that they use billions in \nsubsidies and tax breaks they have been given to invest in renewable \nenergy and refineries, not stock buybacks to boost their pockets, \ntapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to immediately increase \noil supplies, and hopefully by doing so lower prices and stop the \nmarket manipulation that is taking place in the marketplace. Let's get \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission to pursue this vigorously.\n  Finally, let's aspire to be something more than just today's crisis. \nLet's use the ingenuity of America to break our dependence not only on \nforeign oil but on domestic oil as well.\n  We can do all of these things. We are the people on the face of the \nEarth who are can-do. It is time for us to begin to deal with that \nrather than try to pursue a course of action that will do absolutely \nnothing about reducing gas prices, do absolutely nothing about breaking \nour dependency on foreign oil, absolutely nothing in terms of our \ndomestic economy and security.\n  Those are the choices before the Senate, and I trust we will make the \nright ones.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just caught some of the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey. I don't know whether I will be \nable to answer them today, but obviously, in the course of the next few \ndays or weeks, I will answer every single one. Most are covered in what \nI will talk about today.\n  In the course of the United States of America and the use of crude \noil and natural gas as part of the transportation base of our country \nfor automobiles, trucks, and the like, and at the same time the natural \ngas that has been produced that is being used by our chemical industry, \nthe heating and cooling of our houses, and all kinds of things, and now \nsome for automobiles also, in the course of that, yesterday was a \nremarkable day. After 27 years of moratorium on offshore exploration \nimposed on a year-to-year basis by the Congress and 18 years placed by \nthe President, the executive branch of Government, which is not year to \nyear but as long as the President wants it, we had the President of the \nUnited States taking off that Executive order putting a moratorium on \n85 percent of the offshore properties in the continental U.S. owned by \nevery single American. We had the President take off the moratorium and \nchallenge the Congress to do likewise because without lifting the \nmoratorium, whether it is the executive branch or the legislative \nbranch, we cannot explore for oil and gas that we own.\n  I regret to say that we have been so far off base in terms of \ndeciding where we would spend our money to help determine our course, \nwhere we are going, that we have not spent the money to go out and find \nthe inventory, to do an inventory of this huge offshore resource, \nincluding off the California shores, all the way around the Atlantic \nand Pacific where there must be billions of barrels of oil that are \ngoing to be developed over the years and literally trillions upon \ntrillions of natural gas Btu's that are going to be discovered. We \ndecided there was plenty of oil and gas in the world, so we could put a \nmoratorium on because we were frightened of what would happen if there \nwould be spills. We were scared of what would happen if oil might spill \nout of one of the pipelines.\n  I say to everyone, during this 27 years, more or less, of moratoria, \nthere has been a part of the offshore that has been open. The part that \nhas been opened is singularly marked by a huge production of crude oil \nand natural gas for the people of America, principally off the coast of \nTexas, Louisiana, and a little bit of Alabama and Mississippi. But it \nhas yielded literally millions upon millions of barrels of crude oil \nfor America and literally scores of natural gas, that little bit that \nis open.\n  How much is open, so we will have it straight? Mr. President, 15 \npercent, 1-5; 85 percent has a moratorium on it. We have not \ninventoried it because we didn't want to spend the money. It cost a \nlittle bit of money to inventory it. So we have a sloppily done \nestimate that says we have an awful lot of oil and natural gas on that \n85 percent. It is estimated that there are somewhere between 17 billion \nand 18 billion barrels. This Senator thinks that is so low that if we \nwere to do an inventory, I think it would be twice as much or more that \nthe American people own and we are not doing anything with.\n  So, yes, indeed, it was a remarkable day when President Bush lifted \nthat\n\n[[Page S6691]]\n\nmoratorium and said to us: You do likewise. Specifically, the President \nwas saying to us: Do something that will tell the world we are going to \nstart producing and get that done in a way that will cause those who \nare in the fields of buying and selling oil and gas and producing it to \nunderstand that there is another new, huge reserve coming onboard in \ndue course, some of it in a few years, some of it over the long haul, \nbut that it is there and America is going to use it.\n  In response to the President, the majority leader of the Senate, who \nhas been my friend for a long time, announced that he will introduce \nhis own bill. I heard the Senator from New Jersey alluding to parts of \nit. Probably tomorrow, he said. His bill will focus principally on the \nidea that speculators are driving up the price of oil, even though \nspeculators are only responding to the same supply-demand concerns that \neveryone else is. In fact, recently Warren Buffett, the great \nbusinessman, explained the spike in gas prices by saying:\n\n       It's not speculation, it's supply and demand. We don't have \n     excess capacity in the world anymore and that's what you are \n     seeing in oil and gas prices.\n\n  Guy Caruso, the Administrator of the Energy Information Agency, said \nspeculation was not driving the increase in prices.\n  Just today, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said:\n\n       If financial speculation were pushing all prices above the \n     level consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand, \n     we would expect inventories of crude oil and petroleum \n     products to increase as supply rose and demand fell. But, in \n     fact, available data on oil inventories shows notable \n     declines over the past year.\n\n  These experts say that speculation is not the main reason for this \nsurge.\n  What really struck me was the majority leader announced he would not \nallow amendments at all to his bill. Let me make sure we say this on \nthe first day after the President raises the moratorium, and so the \nmoratoria that are left are all dependent on Congress. Whenever \nCongress is ready, Congress can change them. And if Congress doesn't do \nsomething, those moratoria will all expire at the end of this fiscal \nyear. That is the first day of October. They will expire. We will have \nto act to keep them on.\n  But here we have the majority leader announcing that he would not \nallow any amendments to his bill that we haven't seen yet--not a single \none, said he. I can't believe the people of this country are going to \nbuy that, that one man, instead of the Senate, one man in his capacity \nas majority leader can say to the Senate: Take it or leave it. Here is \nmy bill. It hasn't been produced by any committee. It is the bill of \nthe leader of the Senate, and it principally says: We are going after \nspeculators, so it is not going to produce any oil, from what we can \nsee, and he says there will be no amendments.\n  I really don't believe, I repeat myself, that when the American \npeople understand that out there for use, for development in the world \nmarket of oil and gas supply sits all this offshore development \npotential, and here stands the majority leader of the Senate and he \nsays: So long as you do it my way, there will be some impact, some \nchange, but it will only be what I say and not what anybody else \nthinks--we have already said on our side--and we are not just a few \npeople; we are 49 out of 100. We have already said we want to produce \nmore oil and gas offshore and we want to share the royalties with the \nStates so that as we go about asking California if they would like to \nlift the moratorium and put a 50-mile limit, they could assess with \nexperts how many hundreds of millions of dollars that State is going to \nget from royalties, in exchange for which the American people are going \nto have oil and gas drilling off that shore. All across the country, \ndown in the South where we have a moratorium, the same thing can \nhappen. There can be an honest, bona fide look by the States under our \nproposal. But that won't happen.\n  The occupant of the chair is one of the most reputable and fair \nSenators around. He wouldn't like to see that happen. He is listening \nattentively: Is that what I am for as a Democrat? Is that what I am \ngoing to do, say we are running this like the U.S. House, except we \ndon't have a committee to police the bills because it was never in our \npower to do it, but our majority leader is going to be the one who \ndecides what we take up. You can't amend a bill he puts on the floor on \nthis energy crisis, this offshore oil which is in a huge new abundance \nthat we own that sooner or later is going to add substantially to the \nsupply and thus have an impact on the price of oil and gas for the \nAmerican people.\n  I don't really think the majority leader is going to be able to \nprevail on this issue. Understand, he is going to have to have a vote \non a continuing resolution because we are not doing any appropriations \nbills. Come time for that continuing resolution, they have to extend \nall of these moratoria because those appropriations bills they are \nhaving votes on are not going to get to the floor of the Senate. So we \nare going to have a continuing resolution around here and have to get \nthe votes on it, excepting that I understand right now that the \nmajority leader wants to bring his own bill to the floor, lay it up, \nand not let anybody amend it.\n  Yesterday he talked about this: You do it my way. Why? You won't get \na chance to vote. Why? Because you lose because you cannot get 51 \nSenators to vote with you and do nothing to liberate for use these \nhuge, huge billions and billions of barrels of oil and natural gas in \nabundance.\n  As all of my colleagues know, I have been around here about 36 years. \nSome people say that can't be right, but it is, and I am about to make \nit the last, soon. I have had a hand in passing a lot of bills. For \nmany years, I passed a Budget Act every year. I don't think I missed \nbut once. I was there doing that for about 18, 20, 26 years. You all--\neven new Senators have seen what an ordeal that is. If I look stooped \nand worn out, it is because I did that for so long before I got this \nwonderful job trying to do something about the energy crisis. And we \nhave done a lot. It is just that the energy crisis is pervasive. You \ncan do a lot, and nobody knows you have done anything.\n  I have had a hand in passing a lot of bills, and I have seen what \nhappens when one party decides it can dictate to the \nother. Unfortunately, that is what is happening now. On the most \nimportant economic issue of our time, the majority leader has decided \nthat he alone--he and he alone--is the only person here who can make \nenergy policy. The rest of us might as well go home. We can't offer any \namendments and we would be lucky if he even let us have a good debate.\n\n  Why? The majority leader knows that one of our ideas is to allow each \nindividual State to decide if it wants to explore for oil and gas. \nEighty-five percent of the land in the continental United States is \ncurrently off limits for oil. The President lifted his 85 percent; the \nsame number remains under moratoria from the legislature.\n  Republicans want to change that. I am pleased that I think some \nDemocrats want to change that. This area is laden with billions of \nbarrels of American oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas, so \nthe majority leader knows if you were to have a vote on this subject on \nthe floor, he may not win. He may not win. And I believe the American \npeople will have a lot to say about who wins when they understand this \nissue plain and simple. The offshore has always been open to \ndevelopment under certain rules until you put on a moratorium and we \nnow have one on, put on by the legislature, and it ought to be taken \noff. Republicans want to change it and I am pleased to say that, \ntalking to Democrats, I also believe there are some of them who want to \njoin us.\n  The majority leader knows if we were to have a vote on this subject, \nhe may not win. I put it the other way, he may lose. And even if he \ndoes win, the American people will not like it, since the vast majority \nof them agree with us that America ought to be producing more oil \nthrough deep-water exploration. The American people are clamoring for \nit. They do it in Norway, Brazil, Great Britain, and many other \nnations. So Americans are asking, why not here?\n  I have heard all kinds of excuses as to why we should not open up the \nnew areas. The latest one, according to the majority leader, is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for 3 additional minutes.\n\n[[Page S6692]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have heard all the excuses I have ever heard of. I \nwant to close with one. The other side says they are going to put in \nsome language that says to those companies that own leases: Use it or \nlose it. They don't have to put that in their new law because there is \nalready a ``use it or lose it'' provision. I say to my friend, Senator \nKyl, all of those companies that have leases have either a 5- or 8- or \n10-year lease. In each of those leases it says: When the lease expires, \nif you are not producing, you lose the lease. That is: Use it or lose \nit. So already all the leases say by the time the lease expires--and \nthey are not long leases. They are 5s and 8s and 10s.\n  If you talk about a lot of property not being used, it is because \nthey are going through different phases of evaluating the property to \nget it ready for the final decision whether to drill the hole. So we \nare not worried about that. We contend that there is no ``use it or \nlose it'' necessary because it is already the law under which they \nserve today.\n  There is nobody sitting on it. It is $140-a-barrel oil. If you were \nto sit on that, as an oil company, you would be held responsible to \nyour board and your stockholders for wrongdoing because you ought to \nget on with producing it so you don't lose it because it already is a \n``use it or lose it,'' and we do not need any new rules.\n  The President's action yesterday places the ball firmly in our court. \nIt is a decision we have to make soon because the existing moratoria on \noffshore exploration expire at the end of September. But in order to \naddress any of these problems, the Senate must be able to function as a \ndeliberative body. As long as we are blocked by the majority from \noffering amendments to virtually every bill that comes before us, we \nsimply can't do that. It is not the right way to govern.\n  The American people are paying a very high price. We know it. We have \nto make sure the American people find out--and first, that those who \ndisseminate the news find out that in fact this should be open for \ndebate. Republicans will be reasonable, but we want some amendments and \nwe want to vote on the disposition of this property which belongs to \neverybody. Some of it may have great quantities of natural gas and \ncrude oil. We have to make some decisions other than: Do it my way. I, \nthe leader, have a bill. It will be that bill or no bill.\n  I am sorry to say to my good friend, the leader, he was not that way \nbefore. He should go back as a leader the way he was before and not \nthink he can do that. He does not own the Senate. He does not run the \nSenate in that manner. We didn't give anybody that authority and we \nought to get on with an understanding and agreement in the normal way \nthat we have always done it and see how this comes out. It will \nprobably come out right for the American people if we do that. It will \nbecome an asset for them. It will help bring down the prices, and \ncertainly it will take millions of dollars we would otherwise be \nthrowing away and we will keep it for ourselves as we keep some of \nthese oil and gas revenues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the assistant Republican leader is \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, are we currently in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the bill.\n  Under the previous order, the minority whip is recognized to offer an \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5082\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5082.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the period during which appropriations may be made \n  to carry out this Act and to create a point of order in the Senate \nagainst any appropriation to carry out this Act that exceeds the amount \n                    authorized for fiscal year 2013)\n\n       On page 129, strike line 21 and all that follows through \n     ``(b)'' on page 130, line 3, and insert the following:\n       (a) In General.--Section 401 of the United States \n     Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of \n     2003 (22 U.S.C. 7671) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``$3,000,000,000 for \n     each of the fiscal years 2004 through 2008'' and inserting \n     the following ``--\n       ``(1) $40,000,000,000 for the 4-year period beginning on \n     October 1, 2008; and\n       ``(2) $10,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2013.''; and\n       (2) by striking subsection (c).\n       (b) Point of Order Against Any Appropriation That Exceeds \n     the Amount Authorized.--\n       (1) Point of order.--Subject to paragraph (2), it shall not \n     be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     contains an appropriation to carry out this Act or any \n     amendment made by this Act that exceeds the amount authorized \n     to be appropriated for such purpose under this Act or any \n     amendment made by this Act.\n       (2) Waiver and appeal.--\n       (A) Waiver.--Paragraph (1) may be waived or suspended in \n     the Senate only by an affirmative vote of \\3/5\\ of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (B) Appeal.--An affirmative vote of \\3/5\\ of the Members of \n     the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to \n     sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of \n     order raised under paragraph (1).\n       (c)\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl \nbe recognized for up to 5 minutes for debate only, and that following \nhis remarks, Senator Klobuchar be recognized to speak for up to 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the agreement be \namended by also providing that Senator Judd Gregg would follow Senator \nKlobuchar.\n  Mr. CARDIN. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it will only take me 5 minutes to describe \nthis amendment. If we need to have debate about it later, we can \ncertainly do that.\n  This is an amendment to the bill. The bill, recall, provides for an \nauthorization of $50 billion over 5 years. If you divide $50 billion by \n5 years, you get $10 billion a year. All my amendment does is to \nprovide that, at least in the last year of the 5 years, the \nappropriation to fill the authorization would be limited to $10 \nbillion. If it were more than that, there would be a point of order \nthat would lie against that.\n  The reason for the amendment is twofold. First, the House of \nRepresentatives provides for an annual authorization of $10 billion per \nyear for 5 years. The Senate bill doesn't break it down that way. We \nare open as to that. I am not trying to limit what the appropriations \nwould be during years 1 through 4, but what I am saying is the fifth \nyear would be $10 billion, exactly one-fifth of the amount authorized.\n  The second reason is this. Frequently in the reauthorization of \nlegislation we take as the baseline the last year of appropriations. I \nwant to make sure if we are authorizing $50 billion that when we get to \nthe end of this, the baseline for the next year is at least not going \nto exceed $10 billion, which would be one-fifth of the $50 billion. It \nturns out under the existing program we have not limited ourselves to \nthat degree of discipline. The existing law authorizes $15 billion over \n5 years. You would think that would be $3 billion year. If you think \nthat, you would be wrong. What the Appropriations Committee has done is \nto appropriate more money than that authorized. In the last year, the \ncurrent year, for example, there is about $6 billion that has been \nappropriated as a result of which, over the 5-year period, the total \namount appropriated is just under $20 billion. That is $20 billion \nappropriated for a $15 billion authorization.\n  All I am trying to do is to keep us honest here. If we are saying \nthis is going to be a $50 billion authorization--I think that is way \ntoo much money--let's leave it at $50 billion. All my amendment does is \nto say in the last year, the appropriation to fulfill that would be \nlimited to $10 billion. I think that is eminently reasonable.\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\n  To those who say, ``We are going to oppose all amendments to the \nbill, let's just do it the way it was written,'' I say think for a \nmoment. You are going to make people feel a lot better about this if \nthere is some discipline in our spending in furtherance of the \nauthorization. There is some degree of skepticism, at least by some on \nmy side, that Congress will restrain itself to the level of \nauthorization.\n  This amendment doesn't go as far as the House in setting an amount \nevery year, but it does at least set an amount for the last year. \nTheoretically, we could appropriate more than $50 billion. In the first \n4 years you could appropriate $12 billion a year. This amendment \ndoesn't prevent that. But I do want to say in the last year we confirm \nthe discipline of limiting it to $10 billion.\n  That is the extent of my amendment. I hope my colleagues will approve \nit. We don't need a great deal of debate time, as far as I am \nconcerned. If somebody wants to argue against it, I wish to have the \nlast word and then have a vote on it as soon as is agreeable to the \nMembers on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator yields back his time.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, \nis recognized.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, as you noted, I come from the State of \nMinnesota and the State of Minnesota is a State that believes in \nscience. We brought the world everything from the Post-it note to the \npacemaker. We are the home of Mayo Clinic and the University of \nMinnesota. We believe in science. As a former prosecutor, I also \nbelieve in evidence. What we have been hearing from this \nadministration, time and time again, whether it is about energy \npolicy--where they have actually done literally nothing the last 8 \nyears when it comes to pushing us forward to where we should be when \nyou look at the rest of the world with technology and hybrid cars and \nelectric cars and new gas mileage standards which came out of this \nCongress, or whether it is about climate change, which I am about to \naddress today--they have been living in an evidence-free zone. It is \ntime to bring out the evidence.\n  The administration made headlines twice last week in its ongoing \neffort to do nothing about climate change. We learned there was \npolitical interference with science--political interference with the \nevidence and the facts. We also learned the administration will not \nissue the global warming regulations mandated by the Supreme Court.\n  I am a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Some of \nmy colleagues might recall last fall when Dr. Julie Gerberding, the \nDirector of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, was invited \nto testify before our committee. She was invited to testify on how \nclimate change could impact public health. Unfortunately, her testimony \nthat she delivered was markedly different from what she and her staff \nat the CDC had prepared. The Office of Management and Budget got its \nhands on the speech and removed about 7 pages that discussed the impact \nof global warming--7 pages redacted. These pages included explanations \nand descriptions of the links between climate change and heat stroke, \nweather disasters, worsening air pollution, allergies, food and \nwaterborne infectious diseases, mosquito and tickborne infectious \ndiseases, and food and water scarcity. I would say those things seem \nvery relevant to the job of the head of the CDC, and something she \nshould be allowed to testify about when it comes to climate change.\n  Well, at the time there was brouhaha because someone leaked the \nactual testimony, a whistleblower brought it to our attention.\n  At the time, the White House claimed they needed to edit it because \nof its ``broad characterizations about climate change science that \ndidn't align with the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nReport.''\n  Last fall, we provided a number of examples of how her testimony was, \nin fact, closely aligned with that report. Her testimony, in fact, \nincluded the statement that:\n\n       The west coast of the United States is expected to \n     experience significant strains on water supplies as regional \n     precipitation declines and mountain snowpacks are depleted.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       Forest fires are expected to increase in frequency, \n     severity, distribution, and duration.\n\n  In fact, the IPPC has found that ``warm spells and heat waves will \nvery likely increase the danger of wildfire.''\n  So they were completely consistent, and I do not have to tell anyone, \nyou do not have to read a report on what has been going on in \nCalifornia in the past 2 weeks.\n  Global warming did not cause these fires, but it certainly \nintensifies the three main causes of wildfires: high temperatures, \nsummer dryness, and long-term drought.\n  Minnesotans know when the wool is being pulled over their eyes. Let's \nface it, the Bush administration did not change Dr. Gerberding's \ntestimony because of concerns regarding accuracy. They did not worry \nabout if it matched with that record because it, in fact, exactly did. \nThey did it for political reasons.\n  So it was no surprise to me when the news broke last week that both \nthe Office of the Vice President and the President's Council on \nEnvironmental Quality had actually stepped in to interfere with her \ntestimony. This revelation came to us from Mr. Jason Burnett, a former \nDeputy Administrator of the EPA, who informed Chairman Boxer that he \nhad been approached by the Council on Environmental Quality staff and \nasked to work with the CDC to remove from the testimony any discussion \nof the human health consequences of climate change.\n  Upon reviewing the original testimony, Mr. Burnett came to the same \nconclusion we have reached since: The science was correct. He did not \nthink he should alter the statement. He was not operating in an \nevidence-free zone. He wanted the facts out there. He wanted \ninformation out there.\n  I am sorry to report that even though the administration has been \ncaught redhanded in this behavior, time and time again, it has not \nstopped them from continuing their interference with scientific facts. \nLast week we learned the Office of Management and Budget has been \nsitting on an e-mail from that same former Deputy Administrator of the \nEPA regarding the endangerment of public health or welfare from global \nwarming.\n  The OMB received this e-mail, and once they realized what it \ncontained----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. The OMB received this e-mail. Once they realized what \nit contained, they first tried to make Mr. Burnett take it back, and \nthen they actually tried to bury it.\n  We also learned last week of the administration's decision to leave \noffice without taking any regulatory action to address climate change. \nThis is wrong. The bottom line is that this White House is leaving it \nto the next President to show leadership, to show leadership on energy, \nand to show leadership on climate change.\n  I cannot say it more plainly than this: Our climate is changing. If \nwe do not act to stem the tide, it will have grave and disastrous \nimpacts on every single facet of our lives, from our health, to our \neconomy, to our foreign policy.\n  It should begin with science, it should begin with evidence, it \nshould end with science, and it should end with evidence. That is how \nwe will come to the right policy outcome. We cannot have the wool \npulled over the eyes of the American people anymore.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5081\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to the Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment, I do not know why we are \ntaking up this amendment at all. It is an amendment which is going to \ntry to make funds spent under this bill be responsibly spent. It sets \nup an IG to review how these funds are spent.\n  We are taking a program which we presently spend $15 billion on and \nwe are tripling it, we are doing more than tripling it, we are taking \nit to more than $50 billion. I know the taxpayers of America would hope \nand expect that when we take a program and radically expand it in this \nmanner, we would expect that those dollars be spent efficiently and \neffectively.\n  Now, we put inspectors general into a lot of different programs \naround here. There are programs which spend less than $20 million that \nhave inspectors general tied to them. It is only reasonable that if you \nare going to take a program and radically expand it, the way this \nprogram is being expanded, which will lead to significant pressure to \npush money out the door, and, unfortunately, that quite often leads to \ninstances where the money is not well spent, that you should have \nsomeone looking over the shoulders of the folks who are spending the \nmoney and saying: Is this money being spent for what, first, it was \nintended to do, which is to help people in nations who are suffering \nfrom the plague of AIDS, specifically, and, secondly, that people who \nare the recipients of those dollars are handling those dollars in a way \nwhere the dollars are not being wasted or handled in a corrupt manner.\n  Now, one of the unfortunate factors involved in the PEPFAR Program is \nthat many of the countries which receive PEPFAR funds are countries \nwhich have governments which are not all that committed to integrity \nand are not transparent at all. In fact, a corruption index by \nTransparency International took a look at the various countries around \nthe world to determine which countries are basically corrupt and which \nare not; which have governments that function under the rule of law and \nwhich do not, and which governments end up with a large amount of \npatronage, waste, and fraud when they manage their funds.\n  This map shows that conclusion of that index. The darker the colors \nget on this map, the more problematic is the nation relative to the \nissue of transparency and integrity in their government. Well, as you \nlook at this map, you maybe cannot see it, but there are little yellow \nstars on the countries which are going to be receiving most of the \nPEPFAR funds or are presently receiving PEPFAR funds.\n  Almost all those countries are nations which have serious issues on \ntransparency and where the governments have some questions about \nintegrity and management and waste.\n  So it is very reasonable that we should put in place an inspector \ngeneral within the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator to make sure \nthese dollars, which are fairly significant--in fact, they are dramatic \nwhen you look at the increases--are being spent well. You know, \nAmerican taxpayers and most Americans are extremely generous people. We \nas a nation are generous. There is no other nation in the world that \nhas stepped up to the AIDS fight, especially in Africa, the way we \nhave. I congratulate this Administration for taking the lead on that. I \ncongratulate Senator Lugar for being one of the leaders on this effort \nand Senator Biden.\n  They are reflecting, the President and the leadership of the Foreign \nRelations Committee are reflecting the inherent nature of the American \npeople, which is to try to help people out who have problems. We \nrecognize AIDS is a scourge, and it is a terrible situation, especially \nin these African countries.\n  But the American people also expect that when they are generous with \ntheir dollars, as they are being under this program, and have been \nunder this program, that these dollars are going to be well used; they \nare not going to end up in the pocket of some cousin of somebody who is \ngoing to be running the program; or not end up in a Swiss bank account \nor not end up going for somebody's new Mercedes or, alternatively, they \nare not going to go into an NGO, a nongovernmental organization, which \nrather than being an efficient provider of care, turns out to be simply \na place where a lot of money is spent on administration, instead of a \nlot of money being spent on trying to cure or address the problem of \nAIDS.\n  One of the ways we accomplish that, to make sure we have accurate \naccountability, is through the use of inspectors general. Now, some \nwill say: Well, there is already an inspector general who can be \nresponsible for this money. Well, those inspectors general who would \nlogically have jurisdiction over these dollars are spread thin in their \nresponsibility; they have a lot of other accounts to cover. It is not \nlike this is a small account. Under this bill, this account explodes.\n  So we have actually set up inspectors general in other accounts which \nare much smaller and had no problem with that. Inspectors general do \nnot cost a lot of money actually, and they get a pretty good return on \nthe investment, usually, because these individuals set up small offices \nof people who have oversight of the dollars that are being spent. They \nusually end up saving enough money to easily justify their existence.\n  But we have an inspector general, for example, in programs such as \nthe Smithsonian Institution, which is not very significant compared to \nPEPFAR; programs such as the Postal Regulatory Commission, which is \nalmost nonexistent on a spending level compared to PEPFAR; we even have \nan IG for the Denali Commission, and obviously for the Library of \nCongress and National Archives; two organizations which I suspect do \nnot need an inspector general because they are pretty well managed \norganizations, to say the least. But we put inspectors general in those \npositions in order to make sure the American tax dollars are \nefficiently, effectively, and appropriately used and that the programs \nthat are supposed to be addressed are addressed.\n\n  Well, there is resistance, for some reason, to putting an inspector \ngeneral into this program. I cannot understand it. I mean, it is just \nlogic that you would, when you are expanding a program at this rate, do \nthat, put an inspector general in. So I would hope there would not be \nopposition to this amendment, that it would be accepted, that we would \ntake this responsible action.\n  If we do not, I have to ask the question: What is all this new money \ngoing to be spent on? Is there some plan we have not been informed of \nthat is of a nature that does not want to have oversight, that does not \nwant to have a legitimate review of the way the money is spent?\n  Are there groups out there thinking they are going to have this money \nand have the influence to basically stop before it even starts the \naccountability of those groups? Are there countries out there that fall \ninto that category? It would seem there would have to be if there is \nresistance on the inspector general program for this proposal.\n  So that is why I hope it will be supported. On the side issue, which \nis actually not a side issue, it is an overriding issue, but it does \nnot relate so much to the inspector general. On the spending side, this \ninitiative in PEPFAR is a huge expansion of a program, just massive. \nThis year we are going to go from a budget deficit last year that was \n$177 billion to a budget\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\ndeficit that is already projected by CBO as being well over $400 \nbillion.\n  Because of the slowdown in the economy, which has slowed revenues, \nbecause of the slowdown in the economy, which is putting more pressure \non us to come in and support various activities in the marketplace such \nas our banking industry and our housing industry, that number will \nprobably even go up, probably well over $400 billion, we could be \nheaded to a $450 or $500 billion deficit in 1 year, this year, 1 year, \na massive expansion in the deficit which fundamentally undermines our \nNation and, in the long run, it adds to our debt.\n  These young people down here who are pages today are going to end up \npicking up that bill. It is going to be passed to them. So we do have \nto be very responsible when we decide to expand programs in the face of \nthe deficit because all this new spending that is going to come in on \nPEPFAR is either going to be borrowed or it is going to have to come \nfrom other programs.\n  Now, let me try to impress upon people how big this expansion is. In \nrelation to our foreign aid account, which I have jurisdiction over, to \nsome degree, because I am the ranking member of the Foreign Aid \nCommittee in the Appropriations Committee. This is a pie chart that \nshows today's international development aid program. PEPFAR represents \na fairly significant portion under today's funding level, which is at \n$15 billion authority. It represents about a quarter of what the \nforeign aid funding is.\n  Well, after we pass this bill or after this bill gets passed, because \nI am not planning to vote for it in its present profligate state, even \nthough I support the basic program and would support a reasonable \nincrease in it, PEPFAR is going to represent about 77 percent of all \nforeign aid development money.\n  The question becomes, what happens to all these other accounts? If I, \nas ranking member, and Senator Leahy, as chairman of this committee--\nand maybe that will be reversed next year; it has been reversed in the \npast--are responsible for dividing up this development aid money, how \nis it going to work? We are going to receive an allocation. That is \nwhat we will get from the full Appropriations Committee after the \nBudget Committee acts, of which I also happen to be ranking member. I \ndon't expect that allocation to be increased by 25 percent. There has \nnever been a whole lot of enthusiasm for dramatically ramping up \nforeign assistance in this body. So I don't think we are going to see a \n20- to 25-percent increase in our allocation, which is what it would \ncost to fully fund PEPFAR and keep that funding from impacting the \nother programs.\n  The last couple of years we have received an increase--3 percent, 5 \npercent, 4 percent. Let's presume we continue with that increase level. \nLet's presume we get the increases we have received in the last couple \nof years which have been bigger than most other accounts have received \nin the Federal Government that are not related to defense. That is \nstill going to leave literally somewhere around $8 billion--\npotentially, $6 to $8 billion, by my guesstimate--we are going to have \nto find somewhere else, if we are going to fully fund the PEPFAR \nProgram.\n  People say this is an authorization. We pass authorizations all the \ntime. Everybody knows that is a number put out there for the political \npurpose of making a statement about how important the program is.\n  In this instance, that is probably not the case. When you are talking \nabout funding AIDS and the fight against diseases such as malaria in \nAfrica, there is a consensus that we need to be aggressive and \nparticipate. I fully expect this authorization will be very close, if \nnot fully funded. So where are we going to get the money? We are going \nto have to take it out of other foreign aid accounts because of this \nthreefold increase, going from a $15 billion program to a $50 billion \nprogram. That is a tripling of the program.\n  The accounts that are going to be impacted are pretty popular \naccounts. They are going to be cut. We are going to have to cut funds \nto Israel. We will have to cut funds to Egypt. We will have to cut \neducational and communications funding we are making in the Middle East \nand in the Arab world to try to communicate our message over the \nmessage of al-Qaida and the radical Muslim fundamentalist movement. We \nwill have to cut the Foreign Agricultural Service, the international \nnarcotics and Andean initiatives, the migration and refugee assistance \ndisaster program. The USAID organization itself will be cut \nsignificantly, operations and people on the ground. Child survival and \nhealth programs will be cut. Obviously, the Millennium Challenge will \nbe cut, and sustainable development assistance programs will have to be \ncut. They will simply have to be cut. You can't produce these types of \nfunds for PEPFAR at this rate of increase without making reductions. I \nbelieve PEPFAR is a program that is a success. I believe we as a nation \nhave done the right thing and stepped up to what was our responsibility \nas a nation. I certainly support a reasonable increase that is, as the \nadministration suggested at one time, around $30, $35 billion as a 5-\nyear number. That is a pretty big increase. That is double. But this \nbill goes too far; $50 billion is simply too much for this budget and \nfor the Appropriations Committee, on which I have some responsibility, \nto handle, unless we will start running a surplus where we can find \nfunds. I put out that red flag.\n  This is a feel-good vote. Everybody is going to vote for it. People \nwant to make a statement. But this statement is going to have \nconsequences. I suspect a year from now, when people insist on full \nfunding for this over the next 5 years, people will be a little upset \nabout the accounts that will have to be reduced into in order to \naccomplish that full funding. That is a red flag I am putting out.\n  The issue I am talking about today is whether we will put in place a \nprocess where the American taxpayer, no matter what the final dollar \nfigure is, can have some confidence that money going into these \nnations, which have been identified as having fairly significant \nproblems, for the most part, with the way they handle money, is going \nto be efficiently and effectively used so that we actually do care for \npeople who have AIDS, so that we do get money out to that mother and \nchild who suffer from these conditions.\n  I certainly hope Members would look favorably on this amendment, put \nin place an IG on an account that is fairly significant and a lot \nbigger than a lot of other accounts that have inspectors general and \nwhich cries out for review because it is going into areas which are not \nquite as stable as the National Archives. The National Archives is \npretty stable. The Library of Congress is a pretty stable place. You \npretty much can figure out what is going on there when money goes to \nthose folks. But when you send money into some of these nations which \nare governed, in many instances, by people who are not subject to the \nrule of law as we are, or to transparency rules as we are, you need to \nthink about having somebody look over the shoulder of the folks \nspending the money to make sure the American taxpayer gets what they \npay for and that this deep commitment by Americans to compassion, \nespecially on the issue of AIDS, leads to actual positive action rather \nthan simply people going out and wasting taxpayers' dollars or using it \nin a fraudulent way.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by \nthe distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg. I would say, \nto begin with, I clearly agree with the oversight goals he seeks to \nachieve. But the underlying bill we are considering today creates a \nstrong inspector general infrastructure for PEPFAR, and it constructs \nit at less cost than the proposal made by the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  To begin with, PEPFAR has set a high standard for results-based, \naccountable development programs both within our own Government and in \nthe international community. PEPFAR has been among the most evaluated \nof new programs in the U.S. It has been the subject of five GAO reports \nalready completed, with a sixth on the way, examining operations and \nexpenditures. The inspectors general of the Department of State and \nUSAID have so far conducted evaluations of 10 of the 15 focus countries \nof PEPFAR. These inspections have occurred in South Africa, Guyana, \nNigeria, Tanzania, Haiti,\n\n[[Page S6696]]\n\nUganda, Rwanda, Zambia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. The Institute of Medicine \nconducted a congressionally required multiyear evaluation entitled \n``PEPFAR Implementation: Progress and Promise.'' Another review is \nrequired by this bill we consider presently. The inspector general of \nHealth and Human Services is currently conducting an extensive \nfinancial audit on all PEPFAR funding received by HHS from the State \nDepartment for the fiscal years 2004 through 2008. The Peace Corps, \nbeginning in September, will be conducting an internal management \nassessment on PEPFAR implementation in Ethiopia.\n  Clearly, officials are paying close attention to how PEPFAR money is \nbeing spent. This is particularly important given that various agencies \nall apportion funds through the office of the Global AIDS coordinator. \nIt is their money, and they know they must account for it. That is why \nour bill calls on the Global AIDS coordinator to expend some $15 \nmillion to fund these IG efforts to ensure that they have adequate \nresources.\n  Based on a recommendation from the State Department inspector \ngeneral, the U.S. Global AIDS coordinator has formally requested that \nthe inspectors general of PEPFAR agencies submit a joint memorandum \ndescribing options, feasibility, and estimated costs of conducting a \ncollective independent financial audit of U.S. Governmentwide PEPFAR \nfunds.\n  The State Department's inspector general has confirmed that he is \nacting on this request and will be inviting all PEPFAR IGs to come \ntogether to develop plans by the end of July.\n  In addition to the additional funding of inspector general \noperations, the managers' bill requires the submission of an annual \ncoordinated audit plan by the Department of State, USAID, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services in relation to PEPFAR, in \ncollaboration with all PEPFAR implementing agencies and the GAO.\n  In this context, a stand-alone inspector general for PEPFAR, \nsuggested by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire in his \namendment, may not be the best way to evaluate the program. I believe \nwe now have a strong system of oversight already in the bill that \nrecognizes the participation of many agencies in our antidisease \nprograms. I believe we should retain that system.\n  I would point out that I share the distinguished Senator's views with \nregard to economies, but I am suggesting that the inspector general \nresults that he anticipates can be achieved for less money. This is why \nI have outlined, tediously and laboriously, specifically all of the \naudits that have already been conducted, plus the ones now being \ncoordinated by the Department of State. I take seriously, as I think \nall Senators do, the thought that these moneys must be carefully spent \nin whatever country they may reside. I would simply say this is why I \nhave enumerated the 10 countries in which extensive examination has \nalready occurred, with the five to go to be completed shortly.\n  Finally, clearly the Congress does have to make choices with regard \nto expenditures. We all take that responsibility seriously. I come, as \ndo many Senators today, as an advocate for the PEPFAR Program, for all \nof the reasons we have expressed in outlining the introduction of the \nbill. In very quick review, they come down to the saving of hundreds of \nthousands of lives, the alleviation of extraordinary suffering on this \nEarth, and from the standpoint of our foreign policy, one of the \nstrongest ways in which the United States has made an impact on a \nnumber of countries in which our public diplomacy or diplomacy of any \nsort has not been very successful in the past. We make an impact \nbecause people in those countries know that we care. We do care for the \npeople, but we also care for the relationships and for the roles these \ncountries play in the formulation of world peace and in preservation of \na world in which we all do better.\n  Therefore, the PEPFAR Program does have merit and, I believe, \nextensive popularity not only in our country but in so many other areas \nof the world in which we have served. That does not obviate for a \nmoment the need to carefully detail precisely the results that I \nbelieve we have tried to take account of, and I believe have done so \nwith economy in the underlying bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Of course.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding that presently the inspectors \ngeneral for Defense, for Labor-HHS, the State Department, and the USAID \nall have line responsibility for PEPFAR; is that not true?\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is essentially true. Each has responsibility for \nthose programs that are a part of their jurisdiction and their funding.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is also my understanding that every one of those \nagencies which I have listed has billions--and in the case of HHS and \nDefense, hundreds of billions of dollars--to be sensitive to as to how \nthey are being spent.\n  The only IG who I believe has done any reports of those five who \ntheoretically have been charged with that responsibility of overlooking \nPEPFAR spending is, as I understand, USAID, which is using a small \nnumber of its membership to do that, and spending, I think, less than \n$1.5 million a year on that program.\n  So doesn't it make sense that we should acknowledge the fact that \nthese very large entities--Defense, Labor-HHS, USAID, and State--\nprobably on their radar screen of relative issues are not going to \nplace PEPFAR very high and we should have, instead, an individual in an \noffice which does place it right at the center of its responsibility to \nmake sure the money is being spent well?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a----\n  Mr. GREGG. That was a question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That was a question? Oh. I am sorry.\n  Mr. LUGAR. And my response, at least, would be that very clearly each \nof the agencies does take it seriously. But I have outlined how all are \nto be brought together by our Federal Government in a coordinated way. \nIt appears to me the inspector general function occurs in this manner \nwith the same results and for less money than the Senator's amendment \nwould suggest, and that is that an independent effort going outside of \nall of this is not productive in terms of savings, either on the face \nof it or in terms of fraud and abuse that might be found. But that, \nobviously, is the nature of our debate, and I respect the Senator's \nopinion.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Although the question was not asked of me, before the \nSenator leaves the floor, I say to the Senator from New Hampshire, if I \ncould point out one of the problems--this may well have been mentioned, \nand I apologize if it has--but essentially what the Senator is \nsuggesting is going to require us not only to set up a new agency, but \nan agency that does not have any experience overseas and an inspector \ngeneral who will basically start from scratch.\n  These are two binders full of the reports, which I hold in my hands, \nthat have been done thus far by the present system of the three \ndifferent agencies: State, Health and Human Services, and AID. They \nhave considerable experience in going into the field overseas, knowing \ntheir way around. Part of this has to do with knowing your way around.\n  I used to have a friend who was a great basketball player. He wasn't \nthe brightest candle on the table intellectually, but he had a great \nexpression. He said: You gotta know how to know. These guys know how to \nknow. They know where to look. They have been doing some versions of \nthis overseas for the last 30 years in the case of State and AID.\n  I am not going to dare suggest this material be printed in the \nRecord, but I have here two large binders full of reports of the IGs, \nthe coordinated efforts here, mostly done through State and AID, of \noverseeing these programs. The last point I will make: It is \noverwhelmingly in their interest to see that this money is spent well \nbecause it affects so many other aspects of their ability to provide \nthe kinds of services the 150 account provides out of the whole effort \nwe have for development and diplomacy.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for being kind enough to hang \naround and listen. To use President\n\n[[Page S6697]]\n\nReagan's expression, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it''--it ain't \nbroke. It costs more money to fix it, in my view. I believe the \nagencies in place, coordinating their efforts, have vastly more \nexperience in knowing where to look and determining whether the money \nis being spent as intended.\n   Mr. President, the Global AIDS program is operated in this way: a \nspecial coordinator, Dr. Mark Dybul, sits in the Department of State, \nand provides policy development and guidance to the agencies in the \nfield implementing the program.\n  The main agencies implementing the program in the field are the \nAgency for International Development and the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, or CDC.\n  Ambassadors in the field, in every country where PEPFAR operates, \nprovide overall supervision.\n  So there are three main agencies involved--the Department of State, \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development.\n  There are others, such as Peace Corps and the Defense Department, but \nthese are the big three.\n  All three agencies--State, AID and HHS--already have an inspector \ngeneral. These were created by Congress a long time ago.\n  In the last several years, the volume of audit and inspection reports \nprepared by these entities on the PEPFAR program and the President's \nMalaria Initiative fills these two large binders, which run hundreds \nand hundreds of pages in length.\n  The AID inspector general alone has conducted 25 audits and made \nnearly 100 recommendations.\n  The State Department inspector general has reviewed PEPFAR activities \nat 10 overseas posts during embassy inspections.\n  In the last 3 years, there have been five GAO reports, and another \none is underway.\n  The Global AIDS coordinator, Dr. Dybul, has formally requested that \nthe PEPFAR agency inspectors general get together on a collective \nfinancial audit.\n  In other words, there is already a lot of work that is being done. \nBut in order to ensure that it continues and indeed increases, the bill \nbefore the Senate has a provision on this very point--a provision that \nthe Senator's amendment would strike.\n  It requires the three inspectors general from these agencies to come \nup with a coordinated annual plan to review the programs under this \nact. And then it provides $15 million that is specifically allocated to \nthis work, out of the $50 billion in this bill.\n  So we have already addressed the Senator's concern in a way that \nbuilds on an existing structure, which will save taxpayer dollars and \nwill ensure a coordinated effort.\n  The Senator's amendment, by contrast, requires us to build a whole \nnew outfit from scratch.\n  It calls for $10 million in annual funding, or $50 million over the \nlife of the bill--almost as much as Dr. Dybul's own office spends to \nmanage the entire program.\n  As everyone knows, these programs are implemented overseas, not only \nin the 15 ``focus countries,'' but dozens of other countries.\n  The inspector general for the Agency for International Development \nhas several overseas offices--including two of them in sub-Saharan \nAfrica, in South Africa and Senegal--that do the bulk of the audit \nwork.\n  The State Department inspector general sends teams out to inspect \nevery embassy every 5 years or so. During these inspections, they \nreview aspects of the PEPFAR program.\n  How will this new office be able duplicate this existing \ninfrastructure? Where will these overseas offices be located? What are \nthe startup costs for all this?\n  Do we really need a special IG for every $6 billion program we create \nin the Government? Why do we bother to fund the permanent IGs?\n  Where will staff be recruited for this new IG? The community of IGs \nin the Government is already struggling to find competent auditors and \ninvestigators. The new IG will almost certainly end up poaching staff \nfrom existing IGs, thereby weakening those offices. Is that a result we \nwant?\n  I think it makes no sense to start over, when we have existing \noutfits that can do the job. I oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I was seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forgive me. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have a question. I have a question, if \nthe Senator from New Hampshire would yield.\n  I understand I was put in order to speak after Senator Lugar. Could \nsomeone clarify the order we are speaking, please, because I most \ncertainly do not mind waiting.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. OK, Mr. President, then I will go ahead and take the \nfloor, then. Thank you for recognizing me.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To the Senator from Louisiana, there is no \norder to that effect.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Would the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I think it was the intention to allow the Senator from \nNew Hampshire to finish on his statement.\n  How much time does the Senator from New Hampshire need to respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire had been \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Yes. I think he was seeking to finish on his amendment. \nAnd then the Senator from Louisiana was supposed to follow the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. So the proper order would be to allow the--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized, \nand the Chair will announce the order.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would be more than happy to wait. I \nwas given some other information, and I apologize to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, Mr. President, I am not sure what has happened here, \nbut I was seeking recognition. I do not believe I had lost the floor, \nand I think it is inappropriate that I was taken off the floor. I am \nnot going to continue this debate at this point, and I will yield to \nthe Senator from Louisiana and let her proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                            High Gas Prices\n\n  Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to speak, actually, on a \ndifferent subject, and I am very sorry that the wires got crossed about \nthe debate that is on the floor because I know it is very important to \ntry to pass this bill we are speaking about before we leave this week. \nBut there is another issue that is very important to our constituents \nas well. That is the issue of high gas prices in America.\n  I know there are many people who are concerned on this Senate floor \nabout our foreign policy and about contributions to foreign countries. \nI most certainly put myself in that category. But, in my view, there is \nnothing more important than energy policy right now in the United \nStates--the prices people are paying at the pump--and the debate that \nis going on on this floor, in committees, and behind the scenes on \nenergy. I most certainly had a great deal of conversation with my \nconstituents when I was home over this past weekend.\n  In fact, in the time I have been back, I have spoken with Democrats \nand Republicans who have expressed very similar concerns, that the \nquestion most asked, the topic of most interest, is not about foreign \naid, it is not even about the war in Iraq, although that is a very \nimportant point. The American people are interested and focused on \nenergy prices: our consumers, our small businesses, our manufacturers, \nas well as our major industries, such as airlines and domestic \nmanufacturing.\n  So I think it would be important for us to spend as much time as we \ncan on the floor debating the issues that are\n\n[[Page S6698]]\n\nmost important. I hope we can resolve the previous issue. Again, I \napologize if I came to the floor too prematurely. But I do want to \nshare a few thoughts about responding to some of the things that have \nbeen said by the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from \nWashington State who spoke earlier this morning, and the Senator from \nNew Mexico who was here an hour ago talking about the Republican \nproposals for energy.\n  I think while we fumble--and I do not think that is an inappropriate \nword at all because that is what is happening--as we fumble with not \ngetting our energy price right in this country, the people are paying a \npremium at the pump. We have to stop fumbling this ball and try to make \nsome strategic passes to move this ball down the field.\n  This is election-year politics at its worst. Our energy policy has \nfallen victim to a partisan stalemate. I hope we can, in the next \ncouple of weeks, move forward together to a place that can immediately \nstart reducing the price of gasoline. I think there are steps that can \nbe taken to get quick results, and then most certainly steps that can \nbe taken to reduce that price over time.\n  I believe also there are people of good will on both sides of the \naisle, Republicans and Democrats, who realize we are in a place we have \nnot been before in quite some time. That place is an economy that is in \na very fragile circumstance right now based on extraordinarily historic \nhigh energy prices.\n  This economy was not built, this model was not built, to sustain \nthese high prices. There is a European model--although the pain is \nsignificant in Europe--that can sustain it because they have some \npressure point relief. They have mass transit. They have more \nsophisticated nuclear power. They have some other technologies that we \nhave not. They can sustain something longer than we can. But we have to \nact.\n  I have been proud to be part, in the last few weeks, of a specific \ndiscussion that has five Democratic Members and five Republican \nMembers--the Gang of 10. I have been part of these gangs before. I \nguess sometimes it is not good to be part of a gang, but in this case I \nthink these are good gangs to belong to because these are gangs of 14 \nand gangs of 10 who are trying to help the Senate find its way.\n  I do not profess to have every answer. I do not even have every \nquestion. But I do know something about energy policy as a member of \nthe Energy Committee for 10 years. And I do know a lot about our \ndomestic production and what we are doing and what we are not doing and \nwhat we should be doing more of because I happen to represent a State \nthat does a tremendous amount of production.\n  It is time for action, not for studies; for action, not for talk. On \nthe floor of the Senate, as we continue to debate energy policy, I hope \nwe can do more production and more conservation.\n  I want to put up a chart that I think is very illustrative of our \nsituation. I want to say unequivocally as a Democrat that I think in \nmany instances the Democratic Party has been wrong on the issue of \nproduction. I also want to say that I think the Republican Party has \nbeen in many instances wrong in their lack of aggressiveness on \nconservation.\n  Again, I am not saying I have been right on every one of these \nissues. There are votes I would like to take differently. No one is \nperfect in this policy. But fundamentally Democrats have not supported \nenough domestic production, and fundamentally Republicans have not \nsupported enough conservation and new fuels. It has gotten us into more \nthan a jam; it has gotten us into a lot of pain and a lot of \nunnecessary suffering.\n  There is much that can be done to move us forward, which is why our \ngroup has come together--five Democrats and five Republicans--to try to \nmove both parties to the center for some sensible center solutions.\n  But I want for a few minutes to start with the facts about where we \nare drilling offshore and where we are not because there are so many \ncharts that are brought to this floor and they are little pieces of the \ncountry or they are one little section to try to sway people one way or \nanother. So I thought I would bring the whole enchilada--the whole \nenchilada.\n  As shown on this map, this is it. This is Canada--all of it--and the \nUnited States of America--all 50 States. There is no fudging here. I \nhope the camera can get a big look at this entire map of Canada and the \nUnited States--all 50 States.\n  If you notice, the area in blue is all of the area of the \ncongressionally mandated and--up until 1 o'clock yesterday--\nPresidentially mandated moratoria. The entire coast of the United \nStates of America: off limits to drilling, off limits to exploration, \nof what might actually be there.\n  So if anyone comes to this floor and says they know what is \nunderneath these blue sections, I am going to stand here until they \nhave to admit they don't, because they do not. No one can know. I don't \nknow; the Energy Department doesn't know because there has never been \nan inventory conducted on one inch of this blue space, except for the \npurple right here. Even though some of us have been trying literally \nfor decades to get an inventory, which has been put in the energy \nbills--as my colleagues know, every 10 years or so we manage to get \none; it takes a lot of pain and suffering on the Senate floor to get \nany kind of energy bill, but every 10 years we are lucky enough to get \none--there is an inventory provision in the bill, but it gets taken \nout, by Democrats primarily and some Republicans, who don't want to \nhave an inventory because they don't even want to think about domestic \ndrilling off their shores.\n  Then in the last energy bill we kept the inventory provision. \nHowever, I wish to announce on this Senate floor right now--and I am \nsorry I don't have the language, that the inventory was conducted--the \ninventory was conducted, but we would not allow the use of seismic \nequipment.\n  I will be finished in a minute. I see the leader here. I am going to \nwrap up in 30 seconds because I know he has an important announcement \nto make. It would be like saying to a doctor: Go find the cancer, but \nyou can't do a biopsy and you can't have a microscope. You cannot \nsearch for oil and gas without using seismic methods. So the fact is--\nand I am going to conclude, because I know the leader is here and I am \ngoing to wait until he finishes what he has to say for me to finish--\nbut no one in America would know what is here because we have never \nlooked. I have other chapters to this speech, but I see the leader is \nhere so I am going to stop.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 6331\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana for yielding while I make this \nunanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives from the House \nthe veto message on H.R. 6331, it be considered as read, it be printed \nin the Record and spread in full upon the Journal, held at the desk, \nand that the Senate consider the veto message at 5:30 p.m. today, \nTuesday, July 15; that the time from 5:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. be equally \ndivided and controlled between the leaders and their designees, with \nthe majority leader controlling the final 10 minutes; that at 6 p.m. \nthe Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, the objections of \nthe President to the contrary notwithstanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes, and then I will be happy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            High Gas Prices\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. So, Mr. President, to continue, the case is and the \nfacts are--and anybody here who wants to actually know the facts, let \nme repeat again: There is no one who can tell us--not an oil executive, \nnot a bureaucrat--excuse me, not even a government official under a \nRepublican or Democratic administration--who could say with certainty \nwhat might be here because there has simply not been enough \nexploration. There have been scattered seismics taken back in the 1960s \nand 1970s, but as a general rule.\n  Now, this is going to be hard for the American people to understand \nor believe is true, but I am saying it is true and I can give them the \ninformation.\n\n[[Page S6699]]\n\nYou see these yellow and red sections right here off of our coast? This \nis Canada here, this is Cuba right here, and this is Canadian. This is \nwhere Canada is drilling offshore, which is actually closer to the \nMaine coast than we will allow drilling off of the Maine coast. This is \noffshore Canadian production and exploration. That is underway now off \nthe shore, because Canada knows what the United States doesn't know, \nwhich is that offshore oil and gas drilling can be done in a \nresponsible way that protects the pristine coastlines, that protects \nthe environment, because our technology has so greatly improved since \nthe 1940s. It is sort of like being stuck in the space program and \nsaying we couldn't possibly go to space because we don't have the \ntechnology. We have developed the technology. We can go into deep areas \nand do it safely.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has not generally been a supporter of \ndrilling off of his coast, and I am very respectful of that position, \nas well as many other Senators. The good news is we don't have to drill \noff of every coast. We have a big coastline here. We don't have to \ndrill off of every part, but the secret or the smart approach is to try \nto identify maybe 10--not 100; maybe 10, maybe 5, but something more \nthan zero--to begin looking for places to drill for oil and gas. Cuba \nis going to be leasing land closer to Florida for China to drill on \nvery shortly; closer than America is going to be allowing us to drill \noff the coast of Florida. When Americans are paying $5 at the pump, \nthat is going to be very hard to explain to them, how China is coming \nto waters closer to Florida to get oil for its people and our Congress \nwill not allow us to get some of this oil to replenish the supply.\n  If anyone wants to come to the floor and debate with me that \nproduction doesn't matter, that supply and demand have no place here, \nthen I am looking forward to that debate. I don't hold myself out to be \nan expert on markets, but trying to convince people that supply and \ndemand is not operative here is like trying to explain to our voters \nthat gravity doesn't exist. They don't buy it. They are not going to \nbuy it. You could tell it to them 100 years long and they are not going \nto buy it because it is not true and they gut-check know it. It \nabsolutely has an impact, supply and demand, and we don't have enough \nsupply.\n  Now, can we absolutely drill our way out of this? The answer is no. \nWe cannot drill our way out, but we can drill more, we can drill more \nsafely, and we can in some places drill rather quickly--not in all \nplaces. I am going to show my colleagues where we can drill more \nquickly to have an impact. We must also, as we gear up to do that, put \nour foot on the accelerator on conservation, because we have been slow \nin that area. We have done a lot of studies. It is like going to the \ntip of the water and before you dive in, we have been dabbling our toe \nin the water. We have to jump in on conservation, and I think we can do \nit.\n  I see the Senator from Indiana. Let me wrap up in 1 minute.\n  I wish to show in Louisiana where a lot of our gas and oil is coming \nfrom. We know a lot about this because we have been drilling there for \n40, 50 years. When my colleagues come to the floor--this is what I am \nshowing, which is pretty dramatic. This is the infrastructure necessary \nto produce oil and gas. Each of these pink dots is an oil well; the \nblue represents pipelines. Quickly, in Louisiana and Texas we permit \nfor the drilling of oil and gas. We permit for these pipelines and we \ndo it very quickly. All day long we lay these pipelines and we drill \nfor oil. In other States when you try to go do this, States that aren't \nused to this, it takes them so long because the infrastructure is not \nthere. I understand that.\n  So as a result, this is the only place we are basically getting our \ngas--from Louisiana. Lucky for us, because a lot of it goes to the \nNortheast. We send a lot of our oil and gas to the Northeast. We know \nthe prices are high there, but we are sending about as much as we can. \nWe can send more, but it takes infrastructure. So when people say to \nme--and I will wrap up with this--it doesn't matter if you open \ndrilling, you can't get the oil in 30 days or 60 days, that is true, \nbecause it takes wells, it takes pipelines, it takes trucks, it takes \nconcrete. The oil does not jump out and into people's automobiles, but \nyou can lay this infrastructure, you can lay these pipelines, and you \ncan do it safely. We made a lot of mistakes doing this, and so did \nTexas, but the good news is we are learning from our mistakes and we \nknow how to do it better and we know how to do it more safely, and we \ncan.\n  I am not going to take up any more of my colleagues' time because \neverybody has other issues to discuss as well, but I am going to come \nback every day as this debate goes forward and talk about the truth \nabout production and what is actually being produced in this country \nand how much more can be produced, as well as pushing the conservation \nside, which most certainly has to be done to get our supply up and our \ndemand down. I think this is a crucial issue, not only in this \nreelection, but for the future of the country.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have an amendment I wish to talk about, \nand I will be glad to offer it now. I see the chairman on the floor. If \nhe wishes to make a statement, that is fine.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator's amendment is in \norder. We have signed onto it. I ask unanimous consent that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5073\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. \n5073, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] offers an amendment \n     numbered 5073.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 401(a) of the United States \n     Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of \n     2003 is amended by striking ``2004 through 2008'' and \n     inserting ``2009 through 2013''.\n       (b) Malaria Vaccine Development Programs.--Section 302(m) \n     of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2222(m)) is \n     amended by striking ``2004 through 2008'' and inserting \n     ``2009 through 2013''.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nPresident's emergency plan for AIDS relief. However, the bill that is \nbefore us today--the so-called PEPFAR reauthorization bill--is a far \ncry from our original proposal to combat AIDS in Africa.\n  PEPFAR is one of our most successful foreign assistance programs. \nSince enactment in 2003, it has provided lifesaving treatment to 10 \nmillion people afflicted by HIV/AIDS, including children orphaned by \nAIDS. It has prevented 7 million new HIV infections and is on track to \nsupport treatment for an additional 2 million people. This is a \nsuccessful program, and I am proud to have supported it. Through \nPEPFAR, the United States continues to be a leader in international \nassistance. With our generosity, we have created strong partnerships in \ncountries where 5 years ago AIDS threatened to destroy entire \ngenerations. I wish to see us remain a leader in this effort, and it is \nbecause of this that I am concerned about the substantial changes made \nin the program in both the House and Senate reauthorization bills. \nThese are not small changes made to a program to increase authorization \nlevels or the number of patients treated in a bill; these are \nsubstantial changes that would jeopardize the success of the program as \nwell as compromise the integrity of America's foreign assistance.\n  Aside from tripling the current funding levels, which I will address \nin a minute, the focus of the bill seems to be less on prevention and \ntreatment of AIDS and more on development assistance. I am not opposed \nto development\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\nassistance, but I do not believe an emergency global AIDS bill is the \nplace to address issues such as water sanitation and/or the inheritance \nrights of women.\n  It detracts from the focus of the bill and shifts away funding from \nthe core components of the program: treatment and prevention. They are \nwhat have made PEPFAR successful.\n  I oppose any efforts to weaken them or to needlessly shift money away \nfrom them to other lower priority programs.\n  This is why I was shocked and disappointed that both the House and \nthe Senate committee-passed bills removed the AIDS treatment and \nprevention mandates.\n  Why would you remove language in a Global AIDS bill that would \nrequire the money to be spent on the treatment and prevention of AIDS? \nIs it not the purpose of the bill to prevent and treat AIDS?\n  Two months ago, I had the opportunity to meet with several doctors \nand patients from Uganda. Through their firsthand account, I could see \nhow PEPFAR dollars, when used wisely, can combat the spread of AIDS and \nbe used to provide lifesaving treatment.\n  One of the women I met with told me how PEPFAR saved her life. \nThrough the program, she was able to treat this deadly disease in a way \nthat enabled her to live a normal life. She now has a job and provides \nfor her four children. In speaking with her, I was not only struck by \nher conviction for life but her insistence that I continue to work to \nstrengthen the reauthorization of PEPFAR. Like me, she knew the changes \nmade to the program could severely weaken its effectiveness and \njeopardize its future success.\n  This woman is a living example of how PEPFAR can be successful if \nimplemented as the program originally intended. Through her conviction, \nI, along with several of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, \nworked to fix this bill. We were able to make some improvements, such \nas restoring a treatment mandate that is still lower than the current \nprogram levels--but many problems still exist.\n  When so many Americans are facing economic problems at home, I have a \nhard time needlessly tripling the funding for this program. This is not \nthe level requested by the administration. This is not even the level \nthat the Congressional Budget Office says can be spent down by PEPFAR \norganizations within 5 years. This is $15 billion more than that.\n  To put that in context, this is triple the amount of money needed to \nfund the reauthorization of our domestic health care program for \nchildren, which is called SCHIP.\n  I know many Kentuckians would like to see this program reauthorized.\n  This is reckless spending, plain and simple. We owe it to the \nAmerican taxpayer to be better stewards of their tax dollars. We should \nknow where our taxpayer dollars are going--or not going--as in the case \nof Senator DeMint's amendment on abortion.\n  We should also prioritize our funding for global AIDS. We need to \nensure that these funds reach the neediest countries and not those that \ncan afford their own space and nuclear programs, such as China and \nRussia.\n  At a time when China is tripling--I say tripling--their defense \nbudget and manipulating their currency, I have a hard time spending \nbillions of dollars in China to provide funding for treatment that we \ncould use at home for our own AIDS programs.\n  Unfortunately, this is another example of how the so-called PEPFAR \nreauthorization bills have gone so far outside the original intent of \nthe program. This is why I am offering my amendment.\n  The Bunning amendment simply reauthorizes the current program for \nanother 5 years, while also continuing to fund the development of a \nmalaria vaccine.\n  It maintains our original commitment to support the global fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS.\n  I urge my colleagues today to join me in my support for the current \nPEPFAR Program. I ask them to support my amendment so we can ensure \nthat this program continues to be successful within the original scope \nof the program as intended by Congress and by the President.\n  Madam President, before I yield the floor, I ask for the yeas and \nnays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I respect the Senator from Kentucky and \nunderstand his position. I am pleased to see his strong support for the \nintention of the PEPFAR legislation. But as appealing as the Senator's \namendment is, it belies a very important underlying point. Originally, \nthis was authorized for $15 billion. At the time of the authorization, \nit was clear to everyone that was not nearly sufficient to deal with \nwhat is a worldwide dilemma, a worldwide problem. There is also \nrecognition that it is not like you can isolate AIDS to a single \ncountry. The notion that we became clearly aware of, as knowledge of \nthis disease became more apparent to the world at large, is that this \nhas no borders. It has no geographic bounds. It has no ideological \ncomponent. We hear statements that sound very appealing, such as: Why \nshould we help a country like China deal with AIDS? We have the \ntechnology and the medical capability and PEPFAR and the world \norganizations know how to deal with it in ways that individual \ncountries, including developed and developing countries such as China, \ndon't.\n  What happens in China affects what happens in the rest of the world. \nThe idea of us not being part of the world effort to stem the spread of \nAIDS in China--or Russia, for that matter--impacts on the well-being of \nall humanity and, specifically, American citizens along the line. That \nis a generic point I wished to make.\n  Let me be more specific. This would slash funding from the $50 \nbillion mark we have proposed to a $15 billion mark, which would be \ncutting current assistance substantially. It also assumes that the \nUnited States or the U.S. Global AIDS coordinator or our other partners \nhave not learned anything in the past 5 years. In fact, we have learned \na great deal. The Lantos-Hyde Reauthorization Act, which we are voting \non now, and amendments to it, seeks to build on the current progress we \nhave made.\n  The Senator outlined the real progress, but we ought not to freeze in \nplace or, worse yet, set backward the progress we have made.\n  This bill draws heavily on several reports that have been \ncommissioned by the Congress. The GAO, which is Congress's watchdog, \nand the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the U.S. National \nAcademy of Sciences, both recommended substantial changes in current \nlaw in order to improve our programs. This bill acts on a number of \nthose recommendations. First and foremost, it needs to be pointed out \nthat the earmarks established in 2003--it would come back, as I \nunderstand it, in the proposal by my colleague from Kentucky--were \nactually impeding our progress in fighting AIDS, in some ways.\n  These earmarks set specific percentages for spending on HIV/AIDS \nprevention, treatment and care and, further, they set percentages on \ncertain kinds of prevention activities.\n  In 2003, these earmarks may have served their stated purpose. For \nexample, they emphasized the importance of treatment at a time when \ntreatment was almost unheard of in parts of the world. They also \nunderscored the ideas that abstinence and being faithful were key \ncomponents of HIV prevention programs. Those principles were important \nand they are now well established.\n  But the Institute of Medicine also found that such rigid earmarks \nhave ``adversely affected implementation of the U.S. Global AIDS \nInitiative'' and ``have been counterproductive.''\n  The GAO also found the 2003 earmarks effectively pitted some of these \nearmarks against other very highly valued prevention efforts that \nshould be under way to prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to \nchild. As a result, fewer funds were available to expand programs to \nprevent transmission of the disease from HIV-infected mothers to their \nchildren. Every day, for example, over 1,000 children are infected by \nHIV.\n  The reauthorization bill removes or modifies most of those earmarks \nin order to promote the approach that better allows each country to \nfight its\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\nown epidemic. Balanced prevention strategies are still important, but \nthey also allow for new science to be brought to bear on the problem.\n  Let me say this. One of the things we found--remember, when we first \nstarted discussing this program on the floor, there was overwhelming \nresistance to many countries in Africa to even acknowledge that they \nhad a problem. There was resistance in other parts of the world to \nacknowledge that they had a problem. It was viewed as somehow \nnegatively reflecting on the people of a country or on the society and \nthe governance of that society if there was an acknowledgement of the \ndegree to which this disease was prevalent in their country. In order \nto get it going to begin with, we did a lot of things to sort of break \nthrough that membrane of resistance that existed out there. To that \nextent, the original notions were very productive and positive.\n  We have gone way beyond that now. The problem is larger than we \nthought when we first initiated this program. Let me conclude by \nquoting the administration's position on the bill that Senator Lugar \nand I are proposing for our colleagues today:\n\n       The administration strongly supports S. 2731, the Tom \n     Lantos-Henry J. Hyde U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, and the \n     managers' substitute amendment for this bill, both of which \n     would reauthorize PEPFAR and ensure the continued success of \n     this program. . . . S. 2731 would reauthorize the emergency \n     plan in a manner consistent with the program's successful \n     founding principles and would maintain a continued focus on \n     quantifiable HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care goals.\n\n  So I say to my colleagues, the starting block from which our friend \nfrom Kentucky wishes us to return was just that. It was operating with \nwhat we knew and what we needed at the time to get started. We have \nlearned a great deal more since then. We should not, in fact, turn back \nthe clock. This reauthorization represents a true bipartisan \ncompromise.\n  It includes 15 Republican amendments in the bill and suggestions we \nincorporated even before we reached the unanimous consent agreement \nlast Friday. From the outset, it was a bipartisan effort. It passed out \nof our Foreign Relations Committee in a bipartisan way overwhelmingly.\n  When the appropriate time comes, I will move to ask our colleagues to \njoin me and my colleague in opposing this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to strongly support the \nchairman and ranking member's initiative on the Lantos-Hyde U.S. Global \nLeadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization \nAct.\n  As we discuss how to support the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \nRelief, we have the chance to take on the most devastating diseases the \nworld has ever known.\n  The death toll from the AIDS epidemic stands at 22 million. Malaria \nwill claim more than 1 million lives this year alone, most of which \nwill be children under the age of 5.\n  This country has seen time and time again how the fate of the \nAmerican people is intertwined with the fate of people all over the \nworld. The AIDS epidemic is just one more case of that. More than half \na million American lives have been lost.\n  Not just from a moral standpoint, but from an economic standpoint, a \nnational security standpoint, and the standpoint of our own health as a \nnation, the fight against deadly diseases is a fight we are all in \ntogether.\n  Addressing these diseases is not just a humanitarian endeavor, it is \nalso in the national security interests of the United States. These \ndevastating diseases are a destabilizing force for many countries in \nAfrica, and it is in our interest to ensure that sufficient funds are \navailable to make meaningful progress in this area. This bill moves us \ncloser to that goal.\n  The bipartisan bill we are considering offers ambitious but \nachievable targets, including supporting prevention of 12 million HIV \ninfections, care for 12 million people with or affected by HIV/AIDS, \nincluding among those 5 million children, and an antiretroviral \ntreatment for an increasing number of persons whose rising target is \nexpected to represent at least 3 million lives saved.\n  Cutting funding would require a dramatic downsizing of these targets. \nTuberculosis and malaria combined claim more than 3.6 million lives a \nyear. The President's initial proposal of $30 billion did not address \nfunding for these diseases, except through the Global Fund. This bill, \nlike its House counterpart, does include these diseases and increases \nthe treatment goals for persons with HIV/AIDS, as well as for the \ntreatment of children, thus justifying the additional authorization of \nfunds. Authorization of funds--this is only to say we have the ability \nto go up to that amount. It does not guarantee we will spend that \namount.\n  The amendment that is being offered by the Senator from South \nCarolina would slash the funding of this bill by almost a third.\n  While international organizations estimate that achieving universal \naccess to antiretroviral medications would demand $40 billion in \nresources--a number the world needs to do all it can to achieve--this \namendment shaves down America's contribution, putting medication \nfurther out of the reach of thousands of people.\n  I chaired hearings on behalf of the committee. I know Senator Lugar \nwas with me during those hearings. This country hasn't gone into our \ngreatest challenges halfheartedly. When we entered the Second World \nWar, our allies knew we were in it with our hearts and our souls. When \nPresident Kennedy announced we would go to the Moon, friend and foe \nalike knew that we would not rest until we had allowed mankind to take \nthat giant leap.\n  This is our chance to show that America is ready to lead. We should \ncome together as Republicans and Democrats, as Americans, as human \nbeings, to stop this vast catastrophe, to attack it with all that we \nhave. This is about our vision for the world, a world where disease can \nbe controlled, a world ultimately free from fear.\n  If we act today to give PEPFAR full funding, it is more than just a \npowerful statement. We will have saved hundreds of thousands of lives, \nand that--that--is the essence of this debate. That is what is at stake \nright now, pure and simple. It is an expression of our humanity. It is \nan expression of the fulfillment of being able to do the one single \nthing that I think is the highest calling in public service, which is \nto save the life of another. It is an understanding that is in our \nnational interests and our national security interests because disease \nknows no boundaries. We have faced that time and time again during the \ncourse of our history. If we believe this is someone else's problem, we \nare sadly mistaken. This is a chance for us to lead. It is an \nopportunity to do it in a bipartisan way.\n  I hope my colleagues will ultimately support the underlying bill and \ncertainly oppose the amendment offered by my colleague from South \nCarolina so we can fulfill that obligation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I wish to speak in favor of the bill. \nI inquire of the manager if I need to receive any time allocation. I \nwould like to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  I rise to speak in favor of the U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/\nAIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 as it will \nbe modified by the managers' amendment.\n  I have had the pleasure over the years to work with Senator Lugar and \nSenator Biden. These are men of integrity, knowledge, and, I add, \nwisdom. They have seen a lot, done a lot. I think they have seen a few \nthings that work, and I think they have seen a few things that don't \nwork. This is one of those rare foreign policy programs that really \nworks. Unfortunately, too often they do not.\n  While I am here, I wish to recognize the work of my colleague from \nIndiana for getting nuclear material out of the Soviet Union as one of \nthose programs that works, and the world is a safer place because it \nworks.\n  I have seen a lot of foreign policy issues that have not worked. \nThose sorts of things discredit foreign policy, particularly spending \nin the foreign affairs field. This is one of those programs that has \nworked. Because of it, hundreds of thousands of people are alive today \nwho would not be alive. If we are able to get this reauthorization\n\n[[Page S6702]]\n\nand some additional support, there will be more who will be alive.\n  It is amazing how grateful people are if you help save their lives. \nThe approval rating of the United States in Africa is the highest in \nthe world, even including North America. I think it is primarily \nbecause of the health care support the United States does, and this is \nthe leading bill to do it.\n  I am pleased as well that it is HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. \nThose three are not the only scourges that exist, but they are \ncertainly the main ones, and they are ones that if we can go at each of \nthem together, we are going to save people's lives. We are going to \ntake away a lot of the difficulty--not all of it, by any means--but we \nare really going to help people where they need help, and this bill \ndoes it.\n  We all know that from whom much is given, much is expected. We have \nbeen given much in the United States. It is not that we don't have \npeople struggling here as well because we certainly do. But a number of \nus have traveled to many of these countries where the HIV/AIDS scourge \nhas been, and we have had a great deal of difficulty with it as well.\n  I have been to places where they have not had any resources to combat \nthis disease at all. People wasting and dying in these terrible \nsituations just have no hope at all. This gives them hope. This gives \nthem help.\n  Since its creation in 2003, the Global AIDS initiative, commonly \nknown as PEPFAR, has been a bright point of U.S. foreign aid policy. \nThe United States has become the world's leader in prevention, \ntreatment, and care for individuals suffering from this terrible \ndisease. That 2003 law, which I was pleased to support and have \nsomewhat a hand in helping it move on through, now needs to be \nreauthorized to continue this success.\n  From the beginning of this program, it has been my intention to do \nall that I could to make sure any reauthorization of the Global AIDS \nProgram stayed true to its mission. This is a mission that has worked. \nWe should not be taking it into other fields. We should stay with what \nthis one program has accomplished. Often Government programs, when they \nlose sight of their mission, also lose their effectiveness. This one \nneeds to stay true to its mission. I want to be certain it stays with \nthis lifesaving program and not slip into other areas, some perilous \nwaters that some may want it to do as it will get divisive for this \nbody and for the United States.\n  Some people may want to push some of these funds over time into \nfamily planning or population control, possibly into abortion. That \nthen divides us. Regardless of how one feels about these programs, it \ndivides this body. If we can stay with the primary mission of what this \nhas been about, it can keep us united. And the people on the ground \nreceiving this treatment and assistance need us to stay together and \nstay closely focused on what the mission of this program has been.\n  I further want to see to it that fidelity programs, which have proven \ntheir effectiveness internationally over the last 5 years, will remain \nan integral part of this program, and that recently with the President \nof Uganda and the First Lady--they were the ones who first started this \nprogram, ABC: A, abstinence; B, be faithful; and C, condoms. They \nstarted reducing their AIDS rates in Uganda. It worked so well. We want \nto make sure all three of those aspects stay in this program too.\n  Again, I am grateful, in working with Chairman Biden and Senator \nLugar, to keep this bill on its lifesaving course and keep us pulling \ntogether with the administration on this issue.\n  While I, and I am sure many of my colleagues, have additional \nprovisions we would like to see included, the carefully tailored \ncompromise is a credit to the bill managers.\n  On my part, I am pleased to see that abstinence and fidelity programs \ncontinue to be important components of prevention. The pledge to oppose \nsex trafficking is maintained. That is important. Conscious clause \nprotection language is included to prevent discrimination against \nfaith-based organizations such as World Vision, Catholic Relief \nServices, and many others that are so key to putting boots on the \nground in this battle against AIDS.\n  I am concerned about the price tag on this overall bill. I do have \nconcern about ratcheting it up that much that fast, given our own \ndeteriorating economy and the difficulty we have. We have had a slow \ngrowth rate recently. I am hopeful that can improve, but I think for us \nto look at that big of an increase when we are looking at a \ndeteriorating Federal budget situation is not responsible on our part. \nI hope we can get that budgetary number up, but not as high as it is \nput forward in this bill. That would be responsible of us.\n  The Global AIDS Program called for by President Bush and brought to \nfruition by a strong bipartisan effort in Congress in 2003 has touched, \nand I might indeed say saved, the lives of many people worldwide. I am \nproud to have supported that 2003 law. I am pleased to be able to \nsupport this reauthorization effort.\n  Let's stay true to the mission, let's get a number that we can hit, \nand let's continue to save lives with the abilities that we have been \ngranted as a country to be able to do that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, there are two very important matters \nthat will be coming before the Senate this afternoon. The first is the \nlegislation we are now considering to strengthen our efforts to fight \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The second is the President's veto \nof the Medicare legislation.\n  First, with respect to the important work that has been done that we \nare discussing on this floor, the United States should take a \nleadership role on behalf of those suffering from HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis, and malaria around the world. I am very proud that this \nlegislation includes portions of a bill that I introduced, the PEPFAR \nAccountability and Transparency Act, to monitor and improve the \nprograms we fund so that we know what we are getting for the money we \nspend; that, in effect, we are looking for ``best practices'' so that \nwe can learn from what works and discontinue what does not work. It is \nnot based on ideology or some kind of personal preference but on \nevidence, on looking for the best evidence to determine how our dollars \ncan be used more smartly and making each dollar go as far as possible.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation focuses on the needs of women \nand girls. This has been neglected in the past, and I call on my \ncolleagues to stand against any efforts to undermine the bipartisan \nconsensus to invest more in saving lives and demonstrating the best of \nAmerican values in the eyes of people around the world.\n  This is one of the ways we can lead with our values and demonstrate \nclearly that the United States cares about people who are suffering, \nthat we are seeking to find common ground to alleviate that suffering, \nand that we are willing to stretch out our hands in partnership and \nfriendship. This is an important piece of legislation. I look forward \nto it passing and being signed into law.\n  Secondly, later today we will consider the legislation which the \nPresident vetoed this morning. I find it hard to understand why the \nPresident did so. He clearly stood against both the doctors of America \nand the patients of America on behalf of the insurance companies of \nAmerica. Personally, I don't understand that kind of calculation.\n  Today, we will be joining colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nstand against the cutting of reimbursements for doctors who care for \nMedicare recipients and standing up for making sure there is access to \ncare for seniors, Americans with disabilities, and the men and women \nwho serve in our military.\n  Couched by lofty goals and cloaked in misleading rhetoric, the \nPresident essentially vetoed health care for seniors, for veterans, and \nfor Americans with disabilities. It is a disgrace, but unfortunately it \nis not a surprise. This is a battle which has been waged ever since \nPresident Johnson signed the Medicare legislation into law 33 years ago \nthis month, and long before. I hope\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\ntoday's veto and the narrow margin by which we will override it serves \nas a wake-up call. By seeking to undermine Medicare, President Bush and \nhis allies continue an unyielding, uncompromising, unrelenting \nideological crusade, a long twilight struggle to eviscerate Medicare, \nSocial Security, and the means by which our Government actually solves \nproblems for the people of our country.\n  It really comes down to basic values, and it comes down to our \npriorities as a nation. Will you stand with our seniors, with our \nveterans, with our Americans with disabilities? Will you stand with \nhospitals that are already forced to stretch their budgets to the \nlimit? Will you stand with the doctors who care for Medicare recipients \nand are already struggling to see more patients in less time every \nsingle day? Will you stand with the people of this country who need a \nchampion in the White House?\n  I believe strongly that we have to override this veto. We have to \nmake it clear to the hard-working physicians in America that we are \nwith you, that we will help by investing in preventive medicine such as \nscreening, in health information technology which will limit costs \nwhile improving care, in new measures that will lead to improved \nquality, and by actually seeing what works and what doesn't work.\n  We know that the cuts in reimbursements that the President and his \nallies are seeking will also affect cuts in reimbursement and care that \nis accessible to military families. You see, Medicare sets the \nstandards for payments that are used by TRICARE. TRICARE is the program \nthat cares for our veterans, cares for Active Duty, cares for family \nmembers. TRICARE uses the Medicare formula for physician payments.\n  I have just finished an incredible experience, crisscrossing our \ncountry for the past 17 months, and I was inspired each and every day \nby the resolve and the resilience of the American people. I learned a \nlot, and one of the lessons I learned is that Americans are ready, even \neager to have a government that actually works again, that solves \nproblems, that produces results. Thirty-three years ago, our Government \ndid that. It wasn't easy and it literally took years, even decades, to \nachieve, but when Lyndon Johnson signed the Medicare law, he sent a \nvery clear signal to those who worried about whether they would be able \nto afford to take care of themselves or take care of their parents and \ntheir grandparents that health care would be available to them.\n  We have a lot of work to do in the next years to make sure Medicare \nfulfills its promise. I look forward to working with like-minded allies \non both sides of the aisle to make it clear that we will stand behind \nMedicare. We will need to be modernized. We will have to make some \nchanges so that it works better, so that it emphasizes prevention. But \nyou don't start by penalizing the people who take care of those who are \non Medicare today.\n  The doctors and nurses of America do heroic work every single day. \nOur hospitals stand ready to care for those in need. Let's not make it \nmore difficult to actually deliver the services that will save lives, \nameliorate suffering, and extend the quality of life.\n  I am hoping that when this vote is held in a few hours, we will have \na resounding repudiation of President Bush's veto and send a message, \nnot only to doctors and nurses and other health care professionals but \nto the people of our country, that we are better than this and we are \ngoing to stand with you to make sure you have the health care you \ndeserve under the program that has meant so much to so many for so \nlong--Medicare.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I have a unanimous consent I am about to \npropound that has been cleared on the Republican side. I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 5 p.m. the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \nBunning amendment, No. 5073; further, that the time until 5 p.m. be \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5073\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I will use a minute or so of this time. I \nbelieve the Bunning amendment is well intended, but I think the irony \nis the Bunning amendment fails to understand what it was that was \nintended at the first effort to bring forward PEPFAR and get this \nunderway.\n  As I said, we had a number of nations that needed help badly denying \nthe need for help because they viewed it reflected so negatively on \nthem as a people and as a nation. So we did a lot of things the first \ntime around that now, in the clear light of day, and much broader need, \nand the fact that PEPFAR and the world Global Fund is being embraced by \nthe rest of the world, that actually acts as an impediment if we went \nback to Senator Bunning's proposal.\n  So at the appropriate time, 5 o'clock, I am going to suggest again \nthat my colleagues support a ``no'' vote. We will have an up-or-down \nvote on this amendment and vote no on the Bunning amendment, which \nwould quite frankly eviscerate, literally eviscerate the President's \ninitiative.\n  I will conclude by saying, I am often critical of the President and \nhis foreign policy and his aid programs, et cetera. But the President \nof the United States, George W. Bush, deserves great credit. If the \nPresident did nothing else in his administration, this is justification \nenough for his legacy to be looked back on favorably because of the \nphenomenal and dramatic impact this initiative has had and will have in \nthe rest of the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, in the concluding time before the \nscheduled vote, I want to give a statement in opposition to the Bunning \namendment and also to the DeMint amendment, No. 5077, that was \nintroduced earlier today. Both seek to reduce the authorization in the \npending bill.\n  The amendment posed by the distinguished Senator DeMint poses a \nfundamental question with regard to this legislation, which likewise is \nreiterated by Senator Bunning: How much should we authorize for the \ncontinuing fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis? It is a \nquestion for honest debate and on which Members may have different \nviews.\n  The figure of $50 billion in the bill we are debating today rose out \nof bipartisan negotiations between Congress and the White House. It is \nbased on what the President and we believe can be spent efficiently and \neffectively in the years ahead.\n  It presumes that funding will gradually increase each year over the \ncoming 5-year period. Of the $50 billion authorized, $5 billion has \nbeen reserved for malaria, and $4 billion has been reserved for \ntuberculosis.\n  The global impact of malaria and tuberculosis has been underestimated \nfor years. And the bill before us takes an important step to invigorate \nthese worldwide efforts. As other Senators have observed, this is an \nauthorization bill that will be subject to the annual appropriations \nprocess. It is meant to establish policy and overall parameters of \nspending on the PEPFAR Program.\n  Congress may not deem it necessary or possible to spend the entire \n$50 billion over the course of 5 years, but if the funds authorized by \nthis bill are being spent efficiently and effectively and productively \nfor the lifesaving and life-altering purposes in the bill, I believe we \nshould have the authorization in place to spend that much.\n  There is no question that the crisis created by these diseases is \nreal, that our programs are preserving or improving millions of lives, \nand it is difficult to put the dislocation and human devastation caused \nby AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis in context because the impact \nextends well beyond the lives lost.\n  The HIV/AIDS pandemic, coupled with the effects of tuberculosis and \nmalaria, are rending the socioeconomic fabric of communities, nations, \nand entire continents. The U.S. National Intelligence Council and \ninnumerable top officials, including President Bush, have stated that \nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic is a threat to our national security and to \ninternational security.\n\n[[Page S6704]]\n\n  Communities are being hobbled by the disability and loss of consumers \nand workers at the peak of their productive, reproductive and \ncaregiving years. In the most heavily affected areas, communities are \nlosing a whole generation of parents, teachers, laborers, peacekeepers, \nand police.\n  The projections of the United Nations indicate that by 2020, HIV/AIDS \nwill have depressed the GDP by more than 20 percent in the hardest hit \ncountries, and many children will have lost parents to HIV/AIDS or left \nentirely on their own, leading to an epidemic of orphan-headed \nhouseholds.\n  When they drop out of school to fend for themselves, they lose the \npotential for economic empowerment that education can provide. Such \ndislocation has obvious implications for our efforts to suppress and \nprevent terrorism. It has implications for our ability to expand \neconomic opportunity and trade with emerging nations.\n  It has implications for our efforts to solidify partners to combat \nclimate change and environmental degradation. Countries and regions \nthat are prostrate due to the massive incidence of deadly diseases \ncannot effectively address the problems we need them to address. When \ncircumstances reach such dire proportions, the countries in question \ncan become the source of extreme instability. Therefore, we should \nunderstand our investments in disease prevention programs have yielded \nenormous foreign policy benefits during the past 5 years, and we look \nforward to extraordinary progress during the coming 5 years. This is \nwhy I support the $50 billion authorization, appreciating that there \nwill need to be constant auditing, constant debate with the White House \nand the Congress on priorities, a tailoring during the appropriations \nprocess in each year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I would like to try to respond to all \nthese statements made since I offered my amendment. It seems that when \nwe get a good program going in the Congress, one that is funded \nproperly for the first 5 years, we try to expand the program and expand \nthe program, and actually, in this expansion, we have differentiated \nthe mission of the program.\n  The mission of the program originally was to fight infectious AIDS \nand AIDS-related things in every area of the world we could find them. \nIt was something the United States wanted to do. This bill before us \ndoesn't do that. It takes away a lot of the mandates that we had to \nfight infectious HIV and AIDS in areas of necessity. Instead, it puts \nit into the Global AIDS Fund at the United Nations. The Global AIDS \nFund at the United Nations, unfortunately, is just in the first year, \nand then you have unlimited sums in years 2, 3, 4, and 5. There is no \ntransparency at all in that Global AIDS Fund at the United Nations, and \nwe all ought to reexamine and reauthorize this bill as it was \noriginally proposed. Then we could go on and fight AIDS around the \nworld in countries that need our assistance.\n  I beg my colleagues, think it over very seriously and vote for my \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 5073.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today we consider one of the most \nimportant international assistance bills of the 110th Congress.\n  I refer to S. 2731, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States \nGlobal Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \nReauthorization Act of 2008, or better known as the PEPFAR \nReauthorization Act.\n  Originally created in 2003, PEPFAR was funded at $15 billion dollars. \nAt the time, this was the single largest bilateral program ever created \nto address a disease.\n  President George Bush should rightfully be commended for creating an \ninnovative program designed to support HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, \nand care programs.\n  I also wish to commend the chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Biden and Senator Lugar, for their \npersistence and hard work on bringing this bill to the floor of the \nSenate for today's vote.\n  The nature and extent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic varies from country \nand region. In some countries in East Asia, the AIDS rate is less than \n1 percent, while in some Sub-Saharan African countries the rate is more \nthan 20 percent. In fact, two-thirds of all people infected with HIV, \nsome 22.5 million, live in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n  When we look at the health care infrastructure of most Sub-Saharan \nAfrican countries, we find little technology, personnel, or physical \nstructures. Most, if not all, of these nations are ill prepared to \naddress the epidemic.\n  AIDS has destroyed many African families, leaving an estimated 11.4 \nmillion children without one or both parents. Many elderly grandparents \nare left to care for the children, draining their meager resources and \nenergy. There are many cases where orphans are denied inherited land \nand cattle and ultimately left to fend for themselves.\n  With anecdotes such as these, it is vital that we pass S. 2731 to \ncontinue our efforts to combat AIDS. S. 2731 would require the \nPresident to establish a 5-year strategy to fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and \nmalaria. S. 2731 will also intensify prevention, treatment, and care \nprograms and include groups particularly vulnerable to the disease such \nas women and young girls.\n  S. 2731 will also boost funding for research, public-private \npartnerships, and reinforce vaccine development.\n  I have consulted with an organization in my home State of Maryland \ncalled Jhpiego.

The Senate having received the veto message \nfrom the House of Representatives on H.R. 6331, the Medicare \nImprovements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, the message will \nbe considered read, spread upon the Journal, and printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate a message from the \nPresident of the United States to the House of Representatives, as \nfollows:\n\nTo the House of Representatives:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 6331, the ``Medicare \nImprovements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008.'' I support the \nprimary objective of this legislation, to forestall reductions in \nphysician payments. Yet taking choices away from seniors to pay \nphysicians is wrong. This bill is objectionable, and I am vetoing it \nbecause:\n  It would harm beneficiaries by taking private health plan options \naway from them; already more than 9.6 million beneficiaries, many of \nwhom are considered lower-income, have chosen to join a Medicare \nAdvantage (MA) plan, and it is estimated that this bill would decrease \nMA enrollment by about 2.3 million individuals in 2013 relative to the \nprogram's current baseline;\n  It would undermine the Medicare prescription drug program, which \ntoday is effectively providing coverage to 32 million beneficiaries \ndirectly through competitive private plans or through Medicare-\nsubsidized retirement plans; and\n  It is fiscally irresponsible, and it would imperil the long-term \nfiscal soundness of Medicare by using short-term budget gimmicks that \ndo not solve the problem; the result would be a steep and unrealistic \npayment cut for physicians--roughly 20 percent in 2010--likely leading \nto yet another expensive temporary fix; and the bill would also \nperpetuate wasteful overpayments to medical equipment suppliers.\n  In December 2003, when I signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act (MMA) into law, I said that ``when \nseniors have the ability to make choices, health care plans within \nMedicare will have to compete for their business by offering higher \nquality service. For the seniors of America, more choices and more \ncontrol will mean better health care.'' This is exactly what has \nhappened--with drug coverage and with Medicare Advantage.\n  Today, as a result of the changes in the MMA, 32 million seniors and \nAmericans with disabilities have drug coverage through Medicare \nprescription drug plans or a Medicare-subsidized retirement plan, while \nsome 9.6 million Medicare beneficiaries--more than 20 percent of all \nbeneficiaries--have chosen to join a private MA plan. To protect the \ninterests of these beneficiaries, I cannot accept the provisions of \nthis legislation that would undermine Medicare Part D, reduce payments \nfor MA plans, and restructure the MA program in a way that would lead \nto limited beneficiary access, benefits, and choices and lower-than-\nexpected enrollment in Medicare Advantage.\n  Medicare beneficiaries need and benefit from having more options than \njust the one-size-fits-all approach of traditional Medicare fee-for-\nservice. Medicare Advantage plan options include health maintenance \norganizations, preferred provider organizations, and private fee-for-\nservice (PFFS) plans. Medicare Advantage plans are paid according to a \nformula established by the Congress in 2003 to ensure that seniors in \nall parts of the country--including rural areas--have access to private \nplan options.\n  This bill would reduce these options for beneficiaries, particularly \nthose in hard-to-serve rural areas. In particular, H.R. 6331 would make \nfundamental changes to the MA PFFS program. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated that H.R. 6331 would decrease MA enrollment by \nabout 2.3 million individuals in 2013 relative to its current baseline, \nwith the largest effects resulting from these PFFS restrictions.\n  While the MMA increased the availability of private plan options \nacross the country, it is important to remember that a significant \nnumber of beneficiaries who have chosen these options earn lower \nincomes. The latest data show that 49 percent of beneficiaries enrolled \nin MA plans report income of $20,000 or less. These beneficiaries have \nmade a decision to maximize their Medicare and supplemental benefits \nthrough the MA program, in part because of their economic situation. \nCuts to MA plan payments required by this legislation would reduce \nbenefits to millions of seniors, including lower-income seniors, who \nhave chosen to join these plans.\n  The bill would constrain market forces and undermine the success that \nthe Medicare Prescription Drug program has achieved in providing \nbeneficiaries with robust, high-value coverage--including comprehensive \nformularies and access to network pharmacies--at lower-than-expected \ncosts. In particular, the provisions that would enable the expansion of \n``protected classes'' of drugs would effectively end meaningful price \nnegotiations between Medicare prescription drug plans and \npharmaceutical manufacturers for drugs in those classes. If, as is \nlikely, implementation of this provision results in an increase in the \nnumber of protected drug classes, it will lead to increased beneficiary \npremiums and copayments, higher drug prices, and lower drug rebates. \nThese new requirements, together with provisions that interfere with \nthe contractual relationships between Part D plans and pharmacies, are \nexpected to increase Medicare spending and have a negative impact on \nthe value and choices that beneficiaries have come to enjoy in the \nprogram.\n  The bill includes budget gimmicks that do not solve the payment \nproblem for physicians, make the problem worse with an abrupt payment \ncut for physicians of roughly 20 percent in 2010, and add nearly $20 \nbillion to the Medicare Improvement Fund, which would unnecessarily \nincrease Medicare spending and contribute to the unsustainable growth \nin Medicare.\n  In addition, H.R. 6331 would delay important reforms like the Durable \nMedical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies competitive \nbidding program, under which lower payment rates went into effect on \nJuly 1, 2008. This program will produce significant savings for \nMedicare and beneficiaries by obtaining lower prices through \ncompetitive bidding. The legislation would leave the Federal \nSupplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund vulnerable to litigation \nbecause of the revocation of the awarded contracts. Changing policy in \nmid-stream is also confusing to beneficiaries who are receiving \nservices from quality suppliers at lower prices. In order to slow the \ngrowth in Medicare spending, competition within the program should be \nexpanded, not diminished.\n  For decades, we promised America's seniors we could do better, and we \nfinally did. We should not turn the clock back to the days when our \nMedicare system offered outdated and inefficient benefits and imposed \nneedless costs on its beneficiaries.\n  Because this bill would severely damage the Medicare program by \nundermining the Medicare Part D program and by reducing access, \nbenefits, and choices for all beneficiaries, particularly the \napproximately 9.6 million\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\nbeneficiaries in MA, I must veto this bill.\n  I urge the Congress to send me a bill that reduces the growth in \nMedicare spending, increases competition and efficiency, implements \nprinciples of value-driven health care, and appropriately offsets \nincreases in physician spending.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \n                                        The White House, July 15, 2008.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to reconsider the bill (H.R. 6331), the Medicare \nImprovements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, returned to the \nHouse by the President on July 15, 2008, without his approval, and \npassed by the House of Representatives, on reconsideration, on July 15, \n2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 43 years ago, we created Medicare because \nthis country recognized that no American should go without health care, \nespecially once they reach retirement age.\n  As President Johnson was signing the Medicare bill into law, he \npraised Congress for its ability to ``see beyond words to the people \nthat they touch,'' to put politics aside, and to create legislation \nthat truly transforms society.\n  Well, today President Bush failed to heed those words, to see beyond \npolitics and think of the seniors who have spent their lives paying \ninto the Medicare system, and the doctors who treat them. Instead, he \ntold millions of struggling American seniors, and military families as \nwell, that he simply did not care. He vetoed a bill that would make \nvital improvements to the program that has helped ensure that millions \nof seniors and the disabled can get the care they need.\n  One of the most important provisions of that bill would have \npostponed a 10.6-percent reimbursement payment cut for doctors. That \nwas a cut that would have forced many of our doctors across this \ncountry to stop seeing Medicare patients and would severely limit their \naccess to health care. I believe the President was wrong to veto that \nbill.\n  Today, we can stand up for Medicare. We did it last week when we came \ntogether and voted for this bill by a veto-proof margin, and I believe \nwe can do it today by overriding that veto. So I hope we can come \ntogether on the floor of the Senate today and override the President's \nveto and make sure that 44.1 million seniors who are enrolled in \nMedicare, as well as all the military families who rely on TRICARE, \nwill continue to have access to health care.\n  We have spent a lot of time in the Senate debating this. My \ncolleagues have thoroughly explained the improvements this legislation \nwould make, but I wish to speak for a few minutes this evening on some \nof the provisions that illustrate why it is so important to take this \nvote tonight and override the veto.\n  First of all, many of our rural communities in Washington State and \nacross the country are struggling today to provide health care \nservices. This bill will help them strengthen their health care \nnetworks and extend the services that are available.\n  Importantly, this bill puts an emphasis on preventive care that will \nhelp our seniors stay healthy, and it will help to keep costs down by \nenabling those patients to get care before they get seriously ill. This \nbill will improve coverage for low-income seniors who need expert help \nto afford basic care. It will help make sure our seniors get mental \nhealth care. Currently, the copays for mental health care are 30 \npercent higher than those for physical care. The legislation we are \nabout to vote on and override the President's veto, if it is passed, \nwill treat mental and physical health care the same. Also, importantly, \nas we have talked about, this bill will block the cut in reimbursements \nfor providing Medicare services. It will block that cut and ensure that \ndoctors can afford, again, to take Medicare patients.\n  All the improvements I talked about are important, but it is critical \nwe take action as soon as possible to ensure that the cut in payments \nto doctors does not go into effect. No doctor should have to choose \nbetween staying in business and taking care of their patients, but if \nwe don't override this veto, that is exactly what will happen; our \nseniors and disabled will end up paying the price.\n  Cuts in payments would mean seniors will face longer drives in order \nto find doctors, they will see closed doors, and they will see fewer \nchoices, even though they have spent their lives paying into this \nMedicare system. Out in our rural communities, the problem, I know, \nwould be even worse because out there we already face a shortage of \ndoctors and nurses and health care providers.\n  Finally, this cut would limit access to health care for our military \nretirees and our servicemembers at a time when we see many of our \ntroops returning home from war. TRICARE uses the Medicare formula to \npay their doctors, too, and doctors have said those lower \nreimbursements would force them to drop TRICARE patients. I think we \ncan all agree this country cannot afford to jeopardize the health care \nfor our servicemembers, especially during a time of war.\n  So this country took a huge step forward when we created Medicare \nback in 1965--when we agreed as a nation that all seniors should have \naccess to health care services. We cannot afford, at this critical \ntime, to let our country take a step backward. We have the opportunity \nthis evening to do the right thing. Let's support our seniors, let's \nsupport our military families, let's stand together and override the \nPresident's veto and keep our commitment to the people who depend on \nus.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nreserved for the majority leader be reduced to 3 minutes and that the \nremainder be returned to the time under control by the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask that Senator Stabenow be recognized for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we have a historic opportunity in a few \nmoments to reaffirm the fact that Medicare is a great American success \nstory and to join with our colleagues from the House--383 Members of \nthe House--who voted to override a Presidential veto and squarely side \nwith our seniors, our military families and our veterans and to side \nwith those in the disability community who use Medicare. We have an \nopportunity to vote to strengthen Medicare, to add mental health \nservices, prevention, to focus on low-income seniors, to modernize \nMedicare with e-prescribing and telehealth. This is an opportunity to \nmove Medicare into the future.\n  I am very proud to have offered the original bill to extend or block \nthe cuts for 18 months into the future that were to be given to our \nphysicians. I am proud of the work of the Finance Committee. I wish to \nthank Senator Max Baucus for his leadership and our leader, Senator \nReid, for coming to the floor and bringing this back, over and over, \nuntil we got it done.\n  This is an opportunity for us to join together on a bipartisan basis \nto do the right thing, to overturn a very misplaced veto, and to say to \nall the seniors, our military families, and the disabled in this \ncountry that we understand what Medicare is all about and we stand with \nyou to strengthen it, to add to the services available, and to \nmodernize it for the future.\n  I urge a strong bipartisan vote to override this President's veto.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have an opportunity once every decade--\nmaybe once every generation--to reaffirm our commitment to some of the \nmost fundamental values in this country. The Medicare Program is not \njust another Government program. The Medicare Program said in the early \n1960s that the United States was committed to our senior citizens and \nthat commitment involved making certain they would always have access \nto affordable, quality health care. There were many at the time who \nwere skeptical and said it was too much Government and socialism; it \ngoes too far. Thank goodness their voices were drowned out by reason, \nthe understanding that without this protection, seniors could lose \nevery penny they had saved to a medical crisis.\n  Medicare passed and it worked. The proof of its success is the fact \nthat senior citizens now live longer than ever\n\n[[Page S6707]]\n\nbecause of the quality of the health care they have available through \nMedicare. Skeptics have returned and said: Let's get rid of that \nsystem; what we ought to do is bring in private health insurance \ncompanies. They call it Medicare Advantage. We let them try. Over the \nlast 10 years or so they have tried, and at considerably more expense \nthey are not offering benefits as good as basic Medicare.\n  This bill we are going to consider overriding the President's veto on \nvery shortly says some of the money they have taken out of the system \nand out of the program has to be returned to taxpayers. That is fair. \nIt is fair compensation for doctors, to make certain Medicare is there \nfor the seniors who need it; to make certain TRICARE is kept up to date \nin reimbursement, but most importantly this vote today on overriding \nPresident Bush's ill-fated veto is a reaffirmation of how important \nMedicare is to America's future.\n  It was a strong bipartisan vote of 69 who voted a week or so ago in \nfavor of this measure. I hope the vote today in the Senate reflects an \neven stronger bipartisan commitment to the future of Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. It is \nmy understanding the time from the quorum call will be taken evenly \nfrom both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It requires unanimous consent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for that, unless there is someone \non the Republican side who is seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, Senator \nGrassley, on our side, is responsible for this. I am waiting to consult \nwith him. I would ask my colleague to wait a moment on that request, \nand we will see if we can find Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that we go into a quorum call and \nit not get charged against either side.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if we can have the time run----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I see Senator Dorgan is on the floor, so I \nwithdraw my request and ask that Senator Dorgan be recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleagues have described it well. This \nis a very important vote. I think the reason we have gotten to this \npoint shows how difficult it is to get anything done in this Chamber. I \ncome from a State that is first in the Nation in the number of people \n80 years old or older as a percentage of our population. I think we are \nin the top five or six, of people 65 years of age or older as a \npercentage of our population.\n  Medicare is so unbelievably important to the folks who live in my \nState. Does anybody think it serves the interests of this Medicare \nprogram to say: Well, let's decide on provider cuts--in this case \nphysician cuts--of 10.6 percent? Let's take a big whack, a 10.6-percent \nwhack out of the reimbursements and it would not matter; it would not \naffect the program. It doesn't make any sense to me at all that we \nwould do that.\n  What we need to do is strengthen this program, and that is what the \nunderlying bill does. We have had an awful time trying to pull it \nthrough the Congress. We finally got it through the Congress, and then \nwe had the President veto the bill. We had a colleague come out of his \nsick bed and fly to Washington, DC, to cast the 60th vote, after which \nthe other side collapsed and we got 9 other votes. This is very \nimportant. This is about who we are as a country, what we decide to \ninvest in.\n  It is said that 100 years from now we will all be dead. I guess that \nis not just said; it is a fact. Only historians will take a look at our \nvalue system. They can take a look at what we decided to do as a \nCongress: How did we decide to spend money? What did we invest in? What \ndid we think was important? What were our value systems? Did we believe \nthe Medicare Program--providing health care to America's elderly--was a \nsuccessful program, or did we decide we wanted to begin to take it \napart?\n  That is what this vote is about. I don't understand at all why the \nPresident decided to veto this.\n  This passed the House of Representatives by a margin of 6 to 1 and \ngot 69 votes in the Senate, and the President decides to exercise his \nveto.\n  It is unfathomable to me how much money we shovel out of this \nbuilding and how much the President recommends when we spend overseas: \n$170 billion, $180 billion this year in emergency funding for Iraq and \nAfghanistan and all these programs to replenish all these accounts; \ncontractor abuse. Somehow that doesn't matter so much. All of a sudden \nwe want to make an investment in the Medicare Program, and that is not \nsomething that is valuable to us, the President suggests. It makes no \nsense to me.\n  In this bill, we have also tried to address the problem of disparate \nreimbursements for the various States. Some of the smallest States in \nthis country--mine included--receive reimbursements under the Medicare \nprogram for providing health care that are dramatically different than \nreimbursements in other areas. Without fixing that, there will be a \ndegradation of medical services and the delivery of services. This bill \naddresses part of that. That is why this bill is so critically \nimportant.\n  I hope we will have a resounding vote overriding the President's veto \nthis evening at 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if Senator Grassley arrives, I will defer to \nhim, but let me make some comments. It is distressing that the effect \nof this bill has been misrepresented to the extent it has. There have \nbeen some very wild claims that this has to do with killing Medicare, \nthat it has to do with punishing America's doctors, that it has to do \nwith hurting America's seniors. This is not the language of a reasoned \ndebate of the Senate. The bill has nothing to do with any of those \nthings, and all my colleagues know that.\n  Let me describe why we are where we are today. I will take a minute \nto remind everyone of the promise we made to America's seniors 5 years \nago. The 2003 Medicare Modernization Act achieved two very important \ngoals. The first was to provide comprehensive drug coverage, \nprescription drug coverage, a very important benefit for America's \nseniors.\n  Secondly, to explain private health plan choices, similar to the \noptions available to Members of Congress and other Federal employees. \nWe wanted America's seniors--the Medicare patients--to have the same \nkind of private health insurance options for Medicare that all of us \nhave.\n  Today, as a result of this plan, somewhere in the neighborhood of \none-fourth of America's seniors have taken advantage of this private \ninsurance alternative to traditional Medicare. From the beginning, I \nknow a lot of people on the other side of the aisle didn't like that. \nThey wanted a one-size-fits-all program, one program. Republicans said \nwe need more choices. Seniors have been happy with the prescription \ndrug benefit and with those choices.\n  The problem with this bill is it cuts both the choices for America's \nseniors and negatively impacts the prescription drug coverage. That is \nwhy Members on this side of the aisle have said they would like to see \nan opportunity to amend the bill, to try to fix the bill, to have a \nbipartisan bill instead. But, no, we were jammed--not once, twice, but \nthree times: Take it or leave it. It is the partisan approach, despite \nthe fact that the chairman and ranking member negotiated a bipartisan \nbill in good faith. Nonetheless, we had to revert to a strictly \npartisan approach.\n  That is what this was all about. It was never about covering the \nphysicians to make sure they didn't take a pay cut. I doubt that there \nis any Senator who doesn't support the 1.1-percent increase in \nphysician reimbursement, an increase for physicians who treat Medicare \npatients. We all support that. It was in the Grassley proposal, it was \nin the Baucus proposal, and it was in the bipartisan Grassley-Baucus \nproposal. So this was never about that. None of the Republicans ever \nopposed providing the physicians their update. It had to do mostly with \nan attempt that has been undertaken for many years to undercut the \nprivate insurance part of Medicare that many on the other side of the \naisle have never liked. It is one of the signature\n\n[[Page S6708]]\n\nachievements of the Bush administration, and it is no wonder that the \nPresident vetoed the bill because of the fact that was hurt.\n  First of all, according to the nonpartisan CBO, as a result of this \nbill, 2.3 million seniors will be removed from their private coverage \noption under Medicare. That is one of the effects of this bill. Instead \nof all the scare tactics you have heard, I can honestly say that voting \nfor this override of the President's veto will result, according to the \nCBO, in the removal of 2.3 million American seniors from this private \nhealth care option. That is not a good result.\n  Here is what the President's veto message personally said today:\n\n        . . . the provisions that would enable the expansion of \n     protected classes of drugs would effectively end meaningful \n     price negotiations between Medicare prescription drug plans \n     and pharmaceutical manufacturers for drugs in those classes. \n     If, as is likely, implementation of this provision results in \n     an increase of a number of protected classes, it will lead to \n     increased beneficiary premiums and copayments, higher drug \n     prices, and lower drug rebates.\n\n  That is the second pernicious effect of the bill. It will undermine \nthe Medicare prescription drug plan's ability to negotiate good drug \nprices for seniors.\n  I know some on the other side were always skeptical of the ability to \nbring down drug prices. In fact, the Medicare Part D has reduced them \nprecisely because of this competition in the market. This bill \npartially eliminates that competition. That is the reason some of us \noppose the bill, and they are good and legitimate reasons. I believe \nthe President was correct to veto the bill because of these provisions.\n  Five years after the Medicare passage, we are rewinding the clock, \nchipping away at the very plan choices and prescription drug coverage \nthat seniors asked us to provide.\n  These are not pro-patient policies. Rather, the bill reduces access, \nbenefits, and choice for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  In conclusion, it was a very flawed process. As we know, there was an \nattempt at a bipartisan solution. There are 51 Democrats and 49 \nRepublicans. You would think that Republicans could have a say in \nwriting the legislation. But, no, that was not to be. We were required \nto deal with the take-it-or-leave-it proposal of the majority.\n  Twice the majority walked away from these bipartisan negotiations I \ntalked about before. When we tried to suggest, at a minimum, that we \nshould extend existing law so that doctors would not see the reduction \nin their payments, we were told it was a ``phony exercise.'' It was, in \nfact, a good-faith effort on our part to ensure that physicians would \nbe protected.\n  As I stated earlier, I support the need for a positive physician \nupdate. We all do. I know physicians in Arizona know I mean that when I \nsay it. I have led the fight for this in past years. However, I am \nstrongly disappointed that the Senate was blocked from a bipartisan \nsolution, and I regret that seniors, as a result, will suffer if this \nlegislation is adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend from \nArizona, I wanted to make it clear that there are no rate cuts for any \nprovider in this legislation. As it relates to rate increases, the \nprivatization that has been put into place over the last 3 years has \nactually raised rates, according to the CBO, for the 85 percent of the \nseniors and the disabled who use traditional Medicare. But there are no \nrate cuts.\n  There is a small change, which doesn't even take effect until 2011, \nto give the opportunity for the private fee-for-service entities to be \nable to make the changes by 2011. So with all due respect, this is in \nno way a dramatic change, a cut in services, or rate reductions for any \nprovider, including the private insurance providers.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I never said there was a rate reduction. I \nsaid all Senators, I suspect, on both sides support not having a 10.6-\npercent cut in physician fees and that we all support the 1.1-percent \npositive update. That was never the issue.\n  The issue had to do with the other items I talked about. The fact \nthat 2.3 million seniors will lose their private coverage option has to \ndo with the way that the Medicare Advantage Program was used as an \noffset to pay for the additional benefits in the bill as a result of \nwhich CBO claims and believes--and I believe they are probably \ncorrect--that 2.3 million seniors will lose their private option \ncoverage.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is a very unfortunate and \ndisappointing set of circumstances that got us to the point we are in \ntoday.\n  I want to make very clear where we stand on the physician fix. There \nis widespread Republican support to block the 10.6-percent reduction in \nphysician fees and replace it with a 1.1-percent update.\n  I introduced S. 3118 on June 11 with Senators McConnell and Kyl and \nothers to do just that.\n  In fact, the doctors would not be getting a 1.1-percent update in \nthis bill if it had not been for Republicans who announced support for \nthe higher update.\n  Everything that I have been trying to do is to get to a bipartisan \nsolution that would avoid a veto and avoid the pay cut from going into \neffect even for a short time.\n  But the other side decided to play politics with this issue.\n  They ran the clock right up to the deadline and then refused to agree \nto an extension to keep the cut from going into effect. They repeatedly \nobjected to an extension even though the Senate had passed 28 \nextensions on other matters just during this session alone.\n  And, to my absolute amazement, the majority leader said that \nRepublicans had been given months to work out a Medicare bill so that \nwas why no amendments would be allowed.\n  The fact is that Republicans and Democrats had been working together \nfor months until the Democratic leadership pulled the rug right out \nfrom under that effort.\n  Let's review the facts here. At the end of last year, we agreed to a \nshort-term Medicare extension so that we could complete work on a \nbipartisan Medicare package this year. We were very close to a deal \nthen and needed time to finish that work.\n  Both sides agreed we would work quickly to get a bill that could be \nsigned into law.\n  Unfortunately, that effort has been intentionally derailed by the \nmajority's desire to play politics with Medicare.\n  The fact is that the majority has twice walked away from good faith \nbipartisan negotiations.\n  The fact is that we had been working for months before they pulled \nthe plug.\n  The fact is that we had actually completed that bipartisan deal 2 \nweeks ago. It was a deal that would get signed into law, not vetoed.\n  But the other side thought they saw a political advantage and they \nhave taken it. They scuttled that deal in favor of a bill that would \nget vetoed.\n  So it is a bit on the laughable side to blame us for failed \nnegotiations that they seem to have intentionally sabotaged.\n  The fact is that the other side is more than willing to play politics \nwith this issue. I believe that has been the wrong approach. It was not \nthe approach I took as chairman of the Finance Committee. It was not \nthe approach that Republicans took while we were in the majority.\n  Playing this kind of brinksmanship politics with Medicare and with \npeople's lives is not what we should be doing around here.\n  I also warned the White House early on in this debate that their \nposition on private fee for service was not defensible. As Republicans, \nwe should not support the idea of allowing private plans to use \ngovernment-set payment rates.\n  The basic premise of Medicare Advantage is that the private sector \ncan do a better job than government in delivering health benefits to \nseniors. When we allow those private plans to force providers to accept \nthe government rates, we undermine the philosophy behind the Medicare \nAdvantage program. When we do that, we have conceded defeat up front.\n  There are some serious problems with this bill. I think the bill has \nsome significant flaws that need to be addressed. I am going to be \nlooking for opportunities to fix this bill and look forward to coming \nto the floor to do so.\n\n[[Page S6709]]\n\n  As I have said before, I know the other side wants to argue that \nRepublicans are only fighting this fight to protect Medicare Advantage \nplans. That is a good soundbite, but it is simply not true.\n  I, for one, could live with some Medicare Advantage reforms.\n  There would have been more than enough Republicans who would support \nmore reforms, if the Democrats had been willing to make changes in \nother areas.\n  So let's talk about some of the problems that would have been fixed \nif this had been a truly bipartisan process.\n  First and foremost, if this bill becomes law, it will do serious harm \nto the Medicare drug benefit that millions of seniors have come to \ndepend on.\n  It would tie the hands of the Medicare Part D plans resulting in \nhigher drug prices and higher premiums on seniors.\n  Medicare's Office of the Actuary concluded that it will raise Part D \ndrug costs. And outside analysts have likewise concluded that this \nprovision has the potential to undermine the long-term financial \nsustainability of the Medicare drug benefit.\n  This bill also includes entitlement expansions that are well-\nintentioned but ill-timed with the pending insolvency of the program.\n  Let's spend a moment on what a truly bipartisan bill would have \nlooked like.\n  A truly bipartisan bill would have included much-needed assistance \nfor the so-called ``tweener hospitals.'' This is something myself and \nSenator Harkin consider a high priority because of the tweener \nhospitals we have across Iowa.\n  A truly bipartisan bill would have included hospital value based \npurchasing in Medicare.\n  A truly bipartisan bill would have included physician payment \nsunshine provisions that Senator Kohl and I have worked out together.\n  A truly bipartisan bill wouldn't undermine the Medicare drug benefit \nand cause increased premiums on seniors.\n  The bill is riddled with problems and missed opportunities.\n  But instead of writing a bipartisan bill, the Democrats twice walked \naway from the table and now here we are. They scuttled a deal that \ncould have become law right away.\n  Now I believe I have shown myself willing to join in bipartisan \nefforts to solve major issues. We have health care reform and more \nMedicare bills in the future. But this process has called into question \nwhether the other side is willing to start and stick with a truly \nbipartisan effort.\n  The process that has been followed on this bill has done a great \ndisservice to the Senate. But more than that, it does a disservice to \nseniors, doctors and everyone who depends on Medicare.\n  And I would hope that the other side will not take us down this path \nagain. Bipartisanship is more than lipservice. It requires action and \nsometimes difficult choices. Compromise is not easy work. But if you \nwant to tackle the big issues that are ahead of us, then it will \nrequire a better process than the one followed to produce this bill.\n  To my colleagues today, that is the full story on this vote today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is 2 minutes left, right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield that time to Senator Baucus. I have a short \nstatement, and I will use leader time. It is maybe 2\\1/2\\ minutes. I \nyield 2 minutes to Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, sometimes when Senators vote in this \nChamber, the real-world results of our actions are unclear.\n  But tonight, we can make a real-world difference for 44 million \nAmerican seniors, and for nine million TRICARE users in America's \nmilitary families.\n  In less than an hour, the Senate will vote to override the \nPresident's veto of the Medicare bill.\n  Here is the difference that our votes will make: Will doctors' doors \nstay open to older Americans, and to the children of our fighting men \nand women?\n  Our votes tonight will make the difference.\n  Will seniors living on a shoestring, and those in rural areas, be \nable to get decent health care when hospitals are few and far between?\n  Our votes tonight will make that difference.\n  Will the ambulances keep running? Will the medicines be covered by \nMedicare prescription drug plans?\n  Our votes tonight will make all the difference.\n  The President made his decision. His veto of the Medicare bill would \nshut the doctor's door to seniors and military families, and all on \nideological grounds.\n  My bill does good things for seniors. It makes Medicare better for \nevery beneficiary, and it's time to enact it into law.\n  The House has already voted to override the veto. Overwhelmingly--383 \nto 41.\n  Folks in my home State of Montana know I am going to do what is \nright, and vote to make the Medicare bill law--for Montana seniors and \nfor our 32,000 folks in TRICARE.\n  Today I told a large rally of folks supporting this bill, reversing \nthe cuts that keep our seniors and military families from seeing their \ndoctors will be our finest hour.\n  I hope--and expect--that the Senate will stand together, just as our \ncolleagues across the Capitol have done.\n  Senators of all parties have one more chance to make all the \ndifference.\n  Let's do what is right for seniors.\n  Let's do what is right for military families.\n  Let's do what is right for America. Let's do it together and enact \nthe Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act tonight.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, we must override the President's veto of \nthe Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008.\n  This bill will ensure that Medicare and TRICARE beneficiaries have \ncontinued access to health care. It will also enhance Medicare \nbenefits. Finally, the legislation will provide much needed resources \nfor Hawaii hospitals that care for the uninsured and Medicaid \nbeneficiaries.\n  This legislation will maintain Medicare physician payment rates for \n2008 and provide a slight increase in 2009. If this veto override \nfails, doctors will be subject to a 10.6-percent cut in Medicare \nreimbursements for the rest of the year. This severe cut could also \nrestrict access to health care for our troops and their families \nbecause TRICARE reimbursement rates are linked to Medicare \nreimbursement rates. Rising costs and difficulty in recruiting and \nretaining qualified health professionals make it essential that we \nimprove reimbursements to ensure that Medicare and TRICARE \nbeneficiaries have access to health care services.\n  The act will make improvements in Medicare benefits. It increases \ncoverage for preventive health care services and makes mental health \ncare more affordable. The legislation will also help low-income seniors \nto obtain the health care services that they need.\n  Finally, the legislation will provide vital assistance for Hawaii \nhospitals. The legislation extends Medicaid disproportionate share DSH, \nallotments for Hawaii until December 31, 2009. Hawaii hospitals are \nstruggling to meet the increasing demands placed on them by a growing \nnumber of uninsured patients and rising costs.\n  Hawaii and Tennessee are the only two States that do not have \npermanent DSH allotments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created \nspecific DSH allotments for each State based on their actual DSH \nexpenditures for fiscal year 1995. In 1994, Hawaii implemented the \nQUEST demonstration program that was designed to reduce the number of \nuninsured and improve access to health care. The prior Medicaid DSH \nProgram was incorporated into QUEST. As a result of the demonstration \nprogram, Hawaii did not have DSH expenditures in 1995 and was not \nprovided a DSH allotment.\n  The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection \nAct of 2000 made further changes to the DSH Program, which included the \nestablishment of a floor for DSH allotments. States without allotments \nwere again left out.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of\n\n[[Page S6710]]\n\n2003 made additional changes to the DSH Program. This included an \nincrease in DSH allotments for low DSH states. Again, States lacking \nallotments were left out.\n  In the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, DSH allotments were \nfinally provided for Hawaii and Tennessee for 2007. The act included a \n$10 million Medicaid DSH allotment for Hawaii for 2007. The Medicare, \nMedicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 extended the DSH allotments \nfor Hawaii and Tennessee until June 30, 2008. This provided an \nadditional $7.5 million for a Hawaii DSH allotment.\n  This additional extension in the Medicare Improvements for Patients \nand Providers Act of 2008 authorizes the submission by the State of \nHawaii of a State plan amendment covering a DSH payment methodology to \nhospitals which is consistent with the requirements of existing law \nrelating to DSH payments. The purpose of providing a DSH allotment for \nHawaii is to provide additional funding to the State of Hawaii to \npermit a greater contribution toward the uncompensated costs of \nhospitals that are providing indigent care. It is not meant to alter \nexisting arrangements between the State of Hawaii and the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, or to reduce in any way the level \nof Federal funding for Hawaii's QUEST Program. This act will provide \n$15 million for Hawaii DSH allotments through December 31, 2009.\n  All States need to benefit from the DSH Program. This legislation \nwill make sure that Hawaii and Tennessee continue to have Medicaid DSH \nassistance. I will continue to work with Chairman Baucus, Ranking \nMember Grassley, Senators Alexander, Corker, and Inouye to permanently \nrestore allotments for Hawaii and Tennessee. However, we must override \nthe veto to help our struggling hospitals.\n  Many of our hospitals in Hawaii desperately need resources. Layoffs \nhave been announced and reductions in services are possible. These DSH \nresources will strengthen the ability of our providers to meet the \nincreasing health care needs of our communities.\n  Mr. President, we must enact this legislation. It will protect access \nto health care for seniors, individuals with disabilities, and members \nof our armed services and their families. The bill will improve \nMedicare benefits and provide much needed financial assistance for \nhospitals in Hawaii that care fore the uninsured and Medicaid \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. REID. Mr President, it may have taken just one flourish of a pen \nto affix the name ``Lyndon Baines Johnson'' to the law that created \nMedicare in 1965.\n  But that one pen stroke created a program that has come to reflect a \nbedrock American principle: That all those seniors who have worked \nhard--and all those who need a helping hand--will find themselves \nembraced by the care of our compassionate Nation.\n  And though Medicare was created by a Democratic Congress and a \nDemocratic President, that principle has always been anchored far too \ndeep in our soil for the roots of partisanship to entangle.\n  When the program has been threatened, Democrats and Republicans have \nrisen to the occasion to protect it.\n  So it was last month, when the House of Representatives approved the \n``doctor's fix'' by an overwhelming vote of 355-59.\n  So it was last week, when Senator Kennedy led a veto-proof majority \nof all Democrats and 18 Republicans voting yes.\n  So it was earlier today, when the House voted to override President \nBush's veto, 383-41.\n  So it must be now, as we follow suit to reject the veto and place \nthis legislation into law.\n  On the July day in 1965 when President Johnson signed the original \nMedicare bill, he said this:\n\n       Just think, because of this document--and the long years of \n     struggle which so many have put into creating it--in this \n     town, and a thousand other towns like it, there are men and \n     women in pain who will now find ease.\n       There are those, alone in suffering who will now hear the \n     sound of some approaching footsteps coming to help.\n       There are those fearing the terrible darkness of despairing \n     poverty--despite their long years of labor and expectation--\n     who will now look up to see the light of hope and \n     realization.\n\n  Since the day President Johnson handed the very first Medicare card \nto President Truman, hundreds of millions of senior citizens and people \nwith disabilities have received their own card.\n  Each new card issued strengthens our commitment to the health and \nwell-being of our most vulnerable.\n  Now it is our turn to do our part--to renew the light of hope for \nthose who need our help the most, those people in their golden years, \nthe senior citizens of America who depend on Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, shall the bill pass, the \nobjections of the President of the United States to the contrary \nnotwithstanding?\n  The yeas and nays are required.

Mr. President, I wanted to take some time this early \nevening to talk a little bit about our energy crisis and gas prices. \nBut I first want to say thank you so much to our leaders, Senator Reid \nin particular, to Senator Baucus, to all those who helped score a real \nvictory for the Medicare Program for our senior citizens today. It is \nnot every day that a President has a veto overridden, but this \nPresident is just out of touch in so many areas. This was one area. Now \nI truly think we have saved Medicare for the moment, and that is a good \nfeeling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6710-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6710-S6712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know you care a lot about the way we \nmove toward addressing our energy crisis,\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\nand I think the American people are very wise about this. I think they \nwant to see action, but they do not want to see phony solutions to a \nreal problem.\n  I remember when the idea came up for a gas tax holiday and it was put \nforward by Senator McCain and others, it took a few days for people to \nunderstand that our gas tax funds our highway program and we were not \nabout to put our highway program at risk because that program is \nessential to building the infrastructure of our Nation. That program is \nessential for hiring millions of workers. The American people are wise. \nThey want to see solutions that are real and that work.\n  That is why I believe so strongly that as we shine the light of truth \non this idea to undo a moratorium we have had on magnificent areas of \nour coastline, as people shine the light of truth on that, they will \nunderstand that this is another phony solution. It doesn't do a thing \nto lower gas prices. Just as the gas tax holiday put the highway trust \nfund at risk, this idea puts our national coastal economy at risk, \nwhich, as my friend knows, is a $70 billion economy with millions of \njobs, many of them in his State of New Jersey and my State of \nCalifornia. It makes no sense to tell the American people that by \nundoing this very important protection for our coastline, that is going \nto result in lower prices at the pump. It simply is not going to \nhappen.\n  There are many things we can do. I am going to outline some of those \nthings for the consideration of colleagues, but I think the important \nthing for us to note as we reach this election year is that we are \ngoing to hear a lot of silly stuff. We are going to see a lot of \nproposals to try to take the focus off why we are where we are.\n  Two oil men in the White House for 8 years equals $4 per gallon for \ngasoline. That is 8 years divided by two oil men in the White House \nequals $4 per gallon of gasoline.\n  As my colleagues were coming up with this idea on how to show us \nwhere we are--and Senator Whitehouse was one of those--I said to him: \nWe better be careful, because in California we are getting to $5 a \ngallon gasoline and this math will not work.\n  But I am happy we did this, because one of the hallmarks of being a \nmature adult is taking responsibility. And this administration does not \nwant to take responsibility for anything; not for the housing crisis, \nnot for the war in Iraq, not for the deficit, the debt, not for the \nstock market, not for anything, and certainly not for a 300-percent \nincrease in gas prices that has occurred while we have had two oil men \nin the White House.\n  The oil companies have gotten everything they have wanted: record-\nbreaking profits, CEOs taking tens of millions of dollars home in their \npockets. And guess what the President's solution is: Give the oil \ncompanies more of what they want. Give them access to beautiful land, \nland in the OCS, the Outer Continental Shelf, that was set aside first \nby President George Bush, G.W.'s Dad. He did not listen to him on Iraq \nand he is not listening to him on this either, and then carried forward \nby President Clinton.\n  Now, here is the point: Do we need to drill? Do we need to have \ndomestic drilling? No problem. I agree with that. I agree with that. So \ngo to the places where it makes sense. Do not go to the places where \nyou are going to threaten a thriving coastal economy.\n  That leads me to the next chart which is: Use it or lose it. What do \nI mean? The oil companies have available to them 68 million acres they \nhave leases on for drilling. Have they drilled there? No, not really. \nThey have not. So I would say, rhetorically, why would the oil \ncompanies, in a time of these prices, not go and drill in these acres \nwhere they have all of this oil?\n  Answer--it is easy to answer your own question. Answer: They love the \nfact that there is a shortage of supply. I have seen in my own State \nwhere they tried to shut down a refinery and made up a whole story that \nit was losing money, that there were no buyers. That was baloney. And \nnow why do you think they want more access to these leases? It is \nbecause they can put it on their balance sheet and their stocks can go \nup and their CEOs can make more money. Even the Bush administration \nstated very clearly there would be no impact on gas prices if you gave \nthem access to more OCS. So let's go through this again. There are 68 \nmillion acres available for the oil companies right now this minute. \nAnd they want more, more, more, so they can put it on their balance \nsheets, get their stocks to go up higher, get their CEOs to earn more \nmoney. They are not going to drill. It would be foolhardy to believe \nthis President when it comes to this issue. He said, and I am quoting \nhim almost verbatim--if I do a disservice I am sure I will hear about \nit because I listened to him say it. He said: There is only one thing \nstanding in the way of lower gas prices, and that is the Congress.\n  I thought: Well, that is interesting. What does he want us to do? \nThen he said he wants us to reverse our policy of preserving the \npristine areas of our coastline. By the way, 80 percent of our \ncoastline, 80 percent of the resource, is already available for \ndrilling, so this represents 20 percent, so it is not an answer, \nanyway. His own people tell him it is not, but he is so desperate to \ndetract the flak away from himself and his oil partner, Dick Cheney, \nthat he comes up with this idea.\n  I am here on the floor tonight because I am trying to tell the \nAmerican people the God's honest truth. Here is what you are going to \nhear. You are going to hear: There were no problems with oil spills \nafter Katrina. My friend from New Jersey, Senator Menendez, is in the \nchair. I heard him give a little speech about this. He has documented \ntens of thousands of gallons of spills after Katrina. We have spills in \nCalifornia all the time. We have a lot of offshore oil drilling in our \nState.\n  But we know we do not want it expanded, because we count on the \nquarter million jobs we have in our State in the tourist industry and \nthe fishing industry and the recreation industry. So I say to my \nfriend: What can we do then to push for lower gas prices? There is a \nwhole host of things we can do. I want to say for the 68 million acres \navailable for drilling now: Use it or lose it, oil companies.\n  There is another 22 million acres in the naval reserve that is off of \nAlaska. They have only bid for a few million acres there, so they can \ndo that. But do not come into our coasts. They are a gift from God. It \nis a moral responsibility to protect it, and it is an economic \nresponsibility to protect it, because once you start the drilling, it \nchanges the whole nature of that coast. I know that because I have got \npart of the coastline that allows drilling and part that does not, and \nthe difference is immeasurable in terms of the activities that go on, \nin terms of the wildlife, in terms of the scenic value, the beauty, and \nthe pristine feeling you have.\n\n       So what can we do? First, tell the oil companies: Drill \n     where you have got leases. Oh, and the other thing you hear, \n     in addition that there were no problems after Katrina, you \n     will hear other stories about how we do not know if there is \n     any oil in those acres. Excuse me, we do, because in the 2005 \n     Energy bill we ordered an inventory to be taken. That \n     inventory was started and we are getting the information. We \n     know there is six times the amount of oil here than in ANWR, \n     the Alaska preserve. So use it or lose it. That is one.\n\n  I did a whole study in my office about what it would mean to our \nimports of foreign oil if we could suddenly have every car on the road \nget in the high 30s, toward 40 miles per gallon fuel economy. I drive a \nhybrid. It is very good. One of my hybrid cars, the newest one, gets \nover 50. So I wanted to know if we all suddenly shifted--we know it is \nnot going to happen, but it was an exercise. If we were able to get 39, \n40 miles per gallon, that would save every single bit of import of oil \nfrom the Persian Gulf. Can you imagine?\n\n  So why are we sitting around being so dour about this? The technology \nis already there. We know we can do even better. If we can get that \nfuel efficiency up to 39, up to 40, we will no longer have to import \nnearly as much foreign oil. That is a very exciting point. So what can \nwe do to lower gas prices and have the impact not be felt on our \npocketbook? One way is to lessen the demand. Another way, because that \ndoes not always work, as my friend knows, if you get cars that do \nbetter so that, yes, you may be paying more at the end of the day but \nyou need less to keep your car running, I would like to see some strong \nincentives for buying a hybrid car. Those incentives are gone now. We \nlimited them to a certain number of cars. I would like to see that come \ndown here,\n\n[[Page S6712]]\n\nand we do not need to give people who earn $200,000 or $300,000 a year \nthose benefits, but I would like to give people who earn $30,000, \n$40,000 even up to $100,000, $150,000, a break when they buy a hybrid \nvehicle, an electric vehicle, because families do save up and do make \nthese decisions. And we should incentivize them for purchasing such an \nautomobile.\n  What else can we do? We have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. One of \nthe reasons it is set aside is so we can avoid the shock for the \neconomy of high gas prices. Now is the time. I agree with Speaker \nPelosi, who has put this out as an idea, to release some of the oil \nfrom the SPR. It is 97 percent full. Even if you kept it at 90 percent \nfull, it is the highest it has been in history. That would have a \nsalutary impact by allowing that supply to get right into the market.\n  And, by the way, if we did it in a swap, and it is complicated here, \nthere are ways we could actually make money on such a plan. So that is \nanother way.\n  Incentives for conservation, use it or lose it, while we protect our \ncoasts. I am saying to you there are many ways to move.\n  Speculation. Some experts have said speculation is anywhere from 25 \npercent of the problem to 50 percent. I do not know where it comes out. \nBut I can tell you this: We ought to go after the speculators. I talked \nto my friend Maria Cantwell from Washington. She and I and Senators \nFeinstein and Murray were so burned on the Enron scandal. Now we have \ngot traders doing the same thing. And we know there are many people \nplaying in the futures market who are unregulated. They go abroad.\n  So I am hopeful, and Senator Reid said he is working on this, he will \nbe able to bring down to this floor a bipartisan measure that goes \nafter the speculators. We can do these things. There are many other \nthings we can do.\n  Let me tell you, the bottom line in the long run is global warming \nlegislation, which I know my friend was such a strong supporter of. The \nfact is, we have 54 Senators who said: Yes, let's go forward on this. \nBut we did not have 60, so we were cut short.\n  The fact is, our next President is going to take this on, and when he \ndoes and we work with him, we will unleash the genius of America. Once \nthere is a price on carbon that will probably be set in the private \nmarket through a cap-and-trade system, the investments that will be \nmade in cellulosic fuels, in biofuels, all of these things that we \nneed, they are going to happen.\n  I have been told by Silicon Valley that they are going to spend more, \nmore in finding alternative energy that is clean, that does not have a \ncarbon footprint, than they did in the biotech revolution and in the \nhigh-tech revolution. That is pretty remarkable.\n  What we need to do in the long term is to stand up together, fight \nglobal warming, save the planet, have a transition fund to help our \nconsumers get through the early years. We know from our modeling that \nby the time we get to the outyears, people will be saving money because \nwe will have the alternatives.\n  So when it comes to energy, efficiency is the name of the game too. \nYou know, if you have a leaky house, meaning that if you do not have \ndouble-paned windows, you double-pane them, the difference in your bill \nis overwhelming. If you are putting in a new air conditioner, and you \nhave to do it, if you go to the high efficiency end, your bills will go \ndown by two-thirds. That is a fact. We cannot drill our way out of \nthis. Anyone who tells you we can is not telling the truth.\n\n  Senator Biden was saying to me, suppose you opened up every single \ndrop of oil to drilling. It is a tiny percent of the energy we need. \nWhy on Earth would we tell people, therefore, if you just open the \ncoastline, your gas price will go down? That is what the President is \nsaying. It is not true. His own energy people tell him it is not true. \nIt will not have an impact on gas prices. Why don't we do something \nthat will? I think I talked about some of those ideas.\n  I will close where I started, which is to the oil companies and to \nthis President: Let the oil companies start drilling in the acreage \nthey have access to before we start giving away the crown jewels of our \ncountry. We are just not going to do it.\n  I know the Senator from New Jersey very well. He and I are close \nfriends. We worked hard on coastal protection. We will use every tool \nat our disposal to make sure that an energy policy we embrace is real, \nis not phony, does not give away more gifts to the oil companies and \nthese CEOs who are making hundreds of millions of dollars in 1 year. We \nare not going to allow it. It is not going to happen. It shouldn't \nhappen. What should happen is a balanced approach where we have \ndrilling where it makes sense, where it doesn't endanger our precious \ncoastline.\n  By the way, to think of the millions of dollars we have put into \nsanctuaries to protect wildlife and to hear our President say what he \nsaid was, to me, extraordinary. I haven't had a note in front of me \nthrough this speech because, honestly, I wasn't going to speak about \nthis formally. But I couldn't resist the opportunity to get into the \nRecord my dismay at having a President who is an oilman, who has \npresided over the biggest runup in gas prices we have ever seen. He has \nnot ordered one investigation. He hasn't used any of the tools at the \nFTC, at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, not one thing to say \nto the oil companies: Shape up.\n  We have proven in California that they are trying to control the \nsupply. All he can do to deflect attention away from 8 years divided by \ntwo oilmen in the White House equals $4 per gallon of gasoline, all he \ncan do now is to say: Congress, it is all your fault. It won't work. \nThe American people are too smart.\n  Where is the President on the renewable energy tax credits we have \ntried and our Republican friends stopped us every single time? There is \nso much genius out there. We have the technologies, the solar, the \nwind, the geothermal. In California, we have 400 new solar companies \nbecause we are taking the lead on global warming. Thank God, we do \nbecause as the housing market is doing very badly in California and \npeople are laid off of construction, they are going over to work \nputting solar panels on, building windmills. Thank goodness. That is \nwhat we could be doing all over this great Nation if we had a leader in \nthe White House and enough of us here to overcome the status quo, the \nsucking up to the oil companies. I hate to be crude about it, but I \nhave to say that is what it is like. We don't have an energy policy \nthat works for anybody but the oil companies. It is quite obvious.\n  I hope the American people watch this debate. I hope they embrace the \nvalues we have had for so long, since George Bush's dad was in the \nWhite House, when we said there is a value to our unspoiled coast and \nthere is not enough oil there to make a difference overall, so why \nshould we jeopardize the many jobs that come from this unspoiled coast \nby drilling there when there are so many other places to drill and so \nmany other ways we can work on this problem?\n  My colleague has been a leader on this issue. In many ways, he has \nbeen inspirational to many of us. I hope he has a chance to take the \nfloor of the Senate and make some remarks. Leadership is very \nnecessary.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6712-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMORNING BUSINESS\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6712-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6712-S6713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF LA RAZA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to call the attention of the Senate \nto the 40th anniversary of the largest national Hispanic civil rights \nand advocacy organization in the United States. The National Council of \nLa Raza and its nearly 300 community-based affiliates across the \ncountry have worked for more than 40 years to expand the opportunities \nof Hispanics in the United States.\n  The National Council of La Raza is strongly rooted in America's civil\n\n[[Page S6713]]\n\nrights movement of the 1960s and has been a critical force in the \nadvancement of the Hispanic community's fight to obtain a voice in the \npublic sphere. Thanks to the fine leadership at NCLR by individuals \nsuch as current president and CEO Janet Murguia and past president and \nCEO Raul Yzaguirre, NCLR has much to celebrate. In its 40 years of \nservice in 41 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, the \nNational Council of La Raza has worked ardently to provide a much \nneeded Latino perspective in the policy areas of civil rights, \nimmigration, education, employment, health and asset building. In \naddition, I recognize NCLR's dedication to encouraging civic \nparticipation among Hispanics through its voter registration \ninitiatives.\n  In the Silver State, NCLR has been a valuable partner in meeting \nnational challenges at the local level through its four Nevada \naffiliates: the East Las Vegas Community Development Corporation, \nHousing for Nevada, The Nevada Association of Latin Americans, Inc., \nNALA, and Nevada Hispanic Services, Inc.\n  In recent months, Nevadans have endured the highest foreclosure rate \nin the country and struggled to overcome the challenges of an ailing \neconomy. Unfortunately, the Hispanic community has been especially \nvulnerable to foreclosure and more susceptible to falling victim to \neconomic decline. I have been comforted to know that local partners in \nthe NCLR affiliate network have been tackling this problem head on by \nproviding homebuyer education programs, assistance for loss of a home \ndue to foreclosure, and counseling for individuals facing mortgage \ndefault, among many other services and valuable affordable housing \nprojects.\n  In addition to these valuable housing services, NCLR's Nevada \naffiliates also offer programs that focus on job placement, education \nservices, nutrition services, immigration assistance, and important \nhealth issues, such as HIV/AIDS prevention and substance abuse \nprevention. These efforts have been especially important during an \neconomic recession, and I share the gratitude of the many Nevadans who \nhave benefited from the services and programs in Las Vegas, Reno, and \nthroughout the Silver State.\n  I commend the National Council of La Raza for their 40 years of \nsupport to the Hispanic community and to these affiliates in Nevada and \naround the United States. It is through the hard work of these \norganizations that we will be able to overcome the challenges of our \ncurrent economy and of the longer term battles against racial and \nethnic disparities in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6713-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR JESSE HELMS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to my late colleague, \nSenator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. Other Senators have spoken at \nlength in remembrance of our friend, recalling the man and his many \naccomplishments in this body. It was wonderful to hear the tributes by \nfriends and family at his services in Raleigh, NC.\n  It was my good fortune to come to the Senate when Senator Helms was \nleading a lot of fights for a strong America. Senator Helms took charge \nof the Foreign Relations Committee at the same time I arrived in the \nSenate. From that perch as chairman, he steadfastly defended the \nNation's interests. Senator Helms relished defending his principles, \nand I am sure he enjoyed his victories.\n  One such victory in this body is of particular note to me, for I was \nprivileged to play a part in it. In 1999, in Senator Helms's fifth and \nfinal term in office, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was before the \nSenate, and it was poised for ratification. But, with his support and \nblessing, I helped secure the votes to defeat the treaty, and it fell \nfar short of the two-thirds vote that had at one time seemed assured.\n  That is but one of the many victories for U.S. national security in \nwhich Jesse Helms was involved in his three decades in the Senate.\n  Senator Helms fought some of most contentious and courageous fights \nin the Senate on issues of profound significance. Yet even when the \nstakes were so high that they involved preserving and safeguarding this \nNation, Senator Helms remained unfailingly courteous. He held to his \nprinciples even when they were not popular, but he did so in a way that \ndid not damage friendships.\n  My wife Caryll and I offer our sympathies to Jesse's wife Dot and \ntheir family. Senator Helms took the positions he judged to be right \nand he didn't flinch. He was a kind and gentle man who deeply believed \nin his country, his family, and his God.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6713-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, on Friday, July 11, 2008, I regrettably \nmissed a vote on H.R. 3221 due to a prior commitment in Michigan. If I \nhad been present, I would have voted for Record vote No. 173, the \nmotion to disagree to the amendments of the House adding a new title \nand inserting a new section to the amendment of the Senate to H.R. \n3221. This represented the final hurdle in passing the much-needed \nHousing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. I strongly support this \nbipartisan, comprehensive bill to address the root of our economic \nproblems--the housing crisis. This bill would strengthen the regulatory \noversight of government sponsored enterprises, GSEs, and provide FHA \nmodernization reforms to help stabilize the housing finance system and \nbegin to restore confidence to the market. The bill's Hope for \nHomeowners FHA refinancing program would help as many as 400,000 \nhomeowners at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure. It also \nincludes foreclosure counseling for families in desperate need of help, \nassistance for communities hit by foreclosures, an affordable housing \ntrust fund, provisions to help returning soldiers avoid foreclosure and \nimportant tax benefits targeted to help the recovery of the housing \nmarket. I am especially pleased that the package includes my provision \nto allow struggling American businesses to invest in the economy and \ncreate jobs here at home. This bill is an important first step in \nhelping struggling families in Michigan and throughout the country. I \nlook forward to the swift enactment of this legislation to provide \nrelief to homeowners and to uphold the American dream for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6713-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPLANATION OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

This evening, were I able to be present for the vote on the \nPresident's veto of the Medicare bill, I would have voted to override.\n  Following consultation and discussion with my physicians, including \nthe Capitol Physician's Office, I made the decision earlier this summer \nto treat my atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, and made arrangement \nfor scheduled admission to Inova Fairfax Hospital.

CON. RES. 70\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to sections 221(f) and 227 of S. \nCon. Res. 70, I previously filed adjustments to the 2009 budget \nresolution for H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and \nProviders Act of 2008. Those adjustments reflected the Congressional \nBudget Office's estimate at that time of the budgetary effects of H.R. \n6331.\n  CBO has since revised that estimate. While H.R. 6331 still meets the \nconditions required for the release of the reserve funds under sections \n221(f) and 227, including being fully paid for over both the 6- and 11-\nyear time periods, the net effect of CBO's revisions is to\n\n[[Page S6714]]\n\nlower the estimated net savings of the legislation.\n  Consequently, I am revising the adjustments made on July 9 pursuant \nto sections 221(f) and 227 to both the budgetary aggregates and the \nallocation provided to the Senate Finance Committee to reflect CBO's \nrevised scoring.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to praise the \nefforts of the innumerable men and women who contributed to the success \nof the Berlin Airlift as we observe its 60th anniversary this year. The \nBerlin Airlift began in an effort between British and American forces \nto supply a post-WWII West Berlin population with the daily food \nrations necessary to sustain the entire city. In 1948 the Soviets began \ngradually closing down routes to West Berlin; routes by road, rail, and \nwater were all eventually closed. Ingeniously, American and British \ncommanders discovered the existence of air corridors over West Berlin \ndue to a loophole in a 1945 agreement allowing 20-mile air corridors \ntherefore providing free access to the city.\n  It was concluded that roughly 3,475 tons of daily supplies would be \nneeded to sustain the city; the supplies included flour, meat, cereal, \nwheat, fish, milk, potatoes, sugar, coffee, salt, vegetables and \ncheese. The first supplies were dropped to West Berlin on June 26, \n1948, by American C-47 aircraft under the orders of GEN Lucius Clay.\n  By April 1949 airlift operations had been running with almost \nflawless efficiency thanks to the perfection of airlift methods by LTG \nWilliam Tunner after the Black Friday incident. Lt. Gen. Tunner decided \nto show the capabilities of his airlift operation to boost morale and \nbreak the spirits of the opposition at the same time; he decided to \nbreak any existing tonnage records. On Easter Sunday 1949, 12,941 tons \nof coal had been delivered to West Berlin from 1,138 flights without a \nsingle accident. This event raised daily airlift tonnage and \ncontributed to the downfall of the Blockade. The Blockade officially \nended May 12, 1949 yet airlift operations continued until September 30 \nof that year. In the struggle to supply the citizens of West Berlin \nwith daily rations of food, 31 Americans lost their lives thus paying \nthe ultimate price for the freedom of others. Mr. President, I would \nlike to honor those men who lost their lives as well as all the men and \nwomen who contributed to the Berlin Airlift. They saved two millions \nlives through their heroic actions and shall never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6715-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA SORORITY\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Alpha Kappa \nAlpha Sorority for 100 years of sisterhood and service and for the \nsorority's commitment to living lives of excellence that can serve as \nan example for us all.\n  Founded on the campus of Howard University in Washington, DC, in \n1908, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority is the oldest Greek organization \nestablished by African-American college-trained women. The small group \nof founders hoped the organization would ensure that their college \nexperiences were as significant and helpful as possible. As the \nsorority expanded, members emphasized dual themes of the importance of \nthe individual and the strength of an organization of women of ability \nand courage.\n  Alpha Kappa Alpha is currently comprised of more than 950 chapters \nlocated in the United States, the Caribbean, Germany, Korea, Japan and \nmy home State of Delaware. It includes more than 200,000 women who \nrepresent a diverse group including educators, politicians, lawyers, \nmedical professionals, media personalities and decisionmakers of major \ncorporations. They can certainly serve as role models to each of us.\n  Furthermore, the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority is dedicated to service. \nCurrently, members are actively involved in a voter education and \nregistration drive in order to mobilize Americans for the upcoming \ngeneral election. They are also implementing the Extraordinary Service \nProgram Platforms with activities dedicated to improving the living \nstandards within the Black community, creating opportunities for women \nentrepreneurs, assisting Black families and improving the mental and \nphysical health of local communities.\n  I am enormously proud to welcome members of the Delaware chapter of \nAlpha Kappa Alpha, along with many of their sisters, to Washington, DC, \nfor their 100th anniversary celebration.\n  With this important anniversary in mind, the women of Alpha Kappa \nAlpha are to be commended and applauded for their leadership in \ncommunities across America, their commitment to service and the \noutstanding character that they personify.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6715-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6715-S6717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate .gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Hello Mike, One of your comments on the topic hit home with \n     me--the fact that, due\n\n[[Page S6716]]\n\n     to the size of our state, Idahoans are being left with few \n     options in the face of higher gasoline prices. That is, \n     sadly, my personal case.\n       I have the good fortune to be employed in Moscow for the \n     University of Idaho. My home is up near Sandpoint. It is more \n     than a commute distance, but I do get to go home on the \n     weekends--a two-hour drive through, as I'm sure you're aware, \n     some of the loveliest country anywhere. It is also twice as \n     expensive now as it was when I joined the University in 2003.\n       Sure, I would love an alternative. But population density \n     in our state does not allow light rail to be competitive, \n     public transportation on that route runs only between such, \n     ah, urban centers as Desmet and Hayden. (That would be \n     greater metropolitan Desmet. If you go through there, do not \n     blink.)\n       In short, we are stuck. Along the way, I've been noticing \n     quite a few more cars parked near the highway than I used to. \n     Big ones--Tahoes and Suburbans and other 4WD monsters too \n     uneconomical to run under the new energy regime. Cars that \n     offered their owners a measure of safety during the Idaho \n     winters, and you are aware of what the last one was like. (By \n     the way, it snowed in Moscow on the 10th of June. I am not \n     kidding.)\n       What we are compromising with here in the name of economy \n     is safety. There aren't really any numbers to describe that \n     sort of choice, but it is not unusual in the transportation \n     arena. Mandating a higher mileage requirement for domestic \n     automobiles, for example, runs straight into the safety \n     issue. I'd like people in D.C., to be aware that SUVs aren't \n     necessarily useless affectations, and that choosing an \n     alternative is not quite as easy out here as it is, say, to \n     hop a train on the Boston-Atlanta metropolitan axis.\n       What to do? Well, it is generally good guidance to advise \n     the government to get the heck out of the way in \n     circumstances such as these. That means reviewing and \n     discarding out-of-date environmental restrictions, for one. \n     Can we really believe in this age of nuclear fuel re-\n     processing that we still need to have swimming pools full of \n     poisonous spent rods when something practical might be done \n     with them? Silliness. It needs to be reviewed and corrected. \n     It means not mandating nationwide speed restrictions when \n     region A has different requirements than region B. It means \n     stopping every state from mandating different gasoline \n     formulae so that the refineries have to guess what and how \n     much to make for where, when. That drives up their cost in \n     the meantime. I'd love the government to ``encourage'' \n     private research into alternate energy, largely by refraining \n     from over-regulation.\n       Sure, I'd love a cheap, government-subsidized train ride \n     from Moscow to the Canadian border, but I simply cannot \n     countenance robbing my fellow citizens to pay for it. If it \n     cannot stand on its own, let it be.\n       What I want most of all is for the government to stop \n     flapping mindlessly to the gassy wind coming from the global \n     warming hucksters. Just because it is an international \n     political enthusiasm does not make it backed by valid \n     science. And if we are going to clobber our economy in an \n     effort to choke off carbon dioxide, of all things, we really \n     ought to do so based on something other than computer \n     modeling with more assumptions than data backing it. The \n     government can say ``no'' to that sort of garbage but if it \n     says ``yes'' it better be ready to pay for the damage. And \n     not, I hope, with my money. Thanks for letting me vent, Mike.\n     Tim, Moscow. \n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo. Thank you for the opportunity to voice my \n     opinion and state my case in this situation.\n       Oil is the fuel of democracy, and there is no other natural \n     resource available at this time that can replace it. None. I \n     am convinced that unless the Congress acts now, they will be \n     harnessed by the undertakers of historical fact with \n     sabotaging our once-vibrant and globally-dominant economy \n     with fuel prices that will cripple our ability to remain \n     competitive at home and abroad.\n       [Conservatives] have a real opportunity to take this issue \n     and own it. I cannot fathom a capitalist democracy offering \n     up to investigate the profits of private industry when the \n     government themselves are the only ones clearly guilty of \n     benefiting from a windfall profit. By definition, a windfall \n     profit is benefiting from a market occurrence you had nothing \n     to do with. The government has nothing to do with the \n     profitability of these oil companies, but benefits by levying \n     the taxes and regulations.\n       Here's an Idahoan's approach to solving this:\n       1. Suspend the federal taxes immediately--this will not fix \n     a thing, but will give a brief reprieve while you approve \n     more domestic oil exploration.\n       2. Immediately announce that all [conservatives] will unite \n     to pursue immediate off shore drilling, on shore drilling and \n     especially drilling in remote locations such as the ANWR.\n       3. Stop corn subsidies to the corn growers for ethanol that \n     has proven to be a political hay-making machine. I see right \n     through this pandering to the early caucus and primary \n     states, and it is wrong. It does not bring down the cost of \n     fuel.\n       4. Approve more refineries to handle the flow of crude from \n     our own wells and pipelines.\n       5. Explain to the American public why Iraq fuel is not \n     flowing here yet in an amount that would benefit both \n     nations.\n       6. Approve more clean energy like nuclear fuel and get \n     Yucca Mountain open.\n       7. Approve more clean coal-burning power stations in the \n     West. Look at the Navajo Nation!!!!\n       Most level-headed like-minded Americans will follow your \n     lead in the pursuit of patriotic exploration of oil in our \n     country. We need it. It has been long enough since we last \n     cared about the state of our country in preserving our \n     economy so we can preserve our country and way of life.\n       I love my way of life and wasted about five minutes \n     calculating my [carbon] footprint on some website. I found \n     out what I already knew--my carbon footprint was ten times \n     larger than the average world citizen. Well, no news flash--\n     the average Idahoan produces ten times more benefit to the \n     world than the average world citizen. That is what makes \n     Idaho great, and I love my state!\n       Get out front of this wave of frustration and cash in on \n     the patriotic exploration of domestic oil. We will support \n     you. I hate depending on politicians--but I have no choice on \n     this one. I am depending on you to get something fixed.\n     Ben.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo. Lowering the price of gasoline will not \n     solve the current crisis for our country. If, by legislation, \n     we were able to gain another source within our country, \n     Americans would return to complacency and fail again to \n     conserve. I believe a better use of legislative power is \n     this:\n       Actually ask Americans to conserve what we have.\n       Support those many innovative people now researching \n     alternative fuel (cooking oil, peanut butter, soybeans, \n     hydrogen, whatever) for a sensible, quick and urgent \n     solution--with the same fervor that went into the race to be \n     first on the moon.\n       Offer incentives to car manufacturers to discontinue gas \n     hogs, or provide an economical conversion option for existing \n     engines; and to begin consistent production of hybrid \n     vehicles with stellar mileage capacity on these alternate \n     fuels.\n       Reduce dependence upon oil and gas from all sources, \n     whether from unfriendly nations or from our own reserves.\n       Thank you for asking.\n     BJ, Post Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       To Whom It May Concern: The energy prices are of great \n     concern to our family. We budget very conscientiously and \n     always spend less than we make and try our best to pay down \n     our mortgage and invest regularly. Our budget for gasoline \n     has had to double over the past two years from $150/month to \n     $300/month. We are a one-income family, and my husband \n     commutes 50 miles round trip to work every day.\n       Due to the housing market, moving closer to work would cost \n     us even more over a five to ten-year period, since the value \n     of our house has decreased and the value of housing near his \n     work has managed to stay pretty level. Not to mention that we \n     like where we live and do not want to move. We have a very \n     low fixed interest rate in our current mortgage as well.\n       As a result of the increasing costs, even camping, as a \n     family vacation, is becoming cost-prohibitive. To manage the \n     increase so far, we have reduced our travel plans and cut \n     some from our regular savings and investment budget. However, \n     with the concurrent grocery price increases and overall \n     inflation, I foresee further cuts across the board for our \n     budget as our costs rise and income stays the same.\n       Unlike the government, gas pumps, grocery stores, etc., we \n     have no one to pass along our ``cost increase'' to. We have \n     to make do with what we have.\n       I am infuriated that we allow other countries to drill \n     offshore and yet not ourselves. The U.S. would run a cleaner \n     and more efficient operation offshore than any of the other \n     countries we currently encourage to work there. I am also a \n     supporter of nuclear energy and think we need to keep \n     building refineries for oil, concurrently with nuclear energy \n     plants and other energy sources.\n       I often look at the policies that are being proposed and it \n     is difficult not to believe the conspiracy theories that \n     there are many in power who want Americans to suffer, who \n     want the dollar's value to keep plummeting, who want energy \n     prices to soar for their own political ends.\n       I hope my story and my opinion help in your research.\n           Blessings,\n     Lorna, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo, I recently completed a complete analysis of \n     sources of alternative energy at my ranch in Swan Valley, \n     Idaho. Fuel and energy costs are now so prohibitive that we \n     cannot sustain our business without passing on those costs or \n     we will have to face the prospect of just shutting down. I \n     looked at wind, water, bio gas and solar and, initially, I \n     did not consider the capital costs required to install them. \n     I used actual history for electricity and propane usage over \n     the past couple of years. We raise beef cattle and registered \n     horses, so I have plenty of possible methane production; we \n     have a pretty constant canyon wind, especially in the summer; \n     and we have a large stream that borders the property and it \n     has a high flow rate in the spring and early summer. I \n     carefully estimated wind days, solar days, flow volumes and \n     efficient, but realistic manure collection. What I found was \n     that for about $300,000 to $500,000 of capital, I could cover \n     no more\n\n[[Page S6717]]\n\n     than 30 percent of my annual electricity and propane needs! I \n     didn't even start on my diesel and gasoline requirements. My \n     conclusion from this analysis is that we must utilize oil, \n     coal and nuclear power to continue to provide the majority of \n     our energy requirements in this country long into the future. \n     It is not just our economy that we need to worry about, but \n     the very fabric of our society is at stake! Renewable energy \n     is a curiosity and may help in small amounts in localized \n     applications, but it is obvious to me that you cannot take \n     small net energy sources and produce big net energy sources \n     from them. Be concerned about ethanol and bio diesel for that \n     very reason. We need to stop this anal conservation lunacy \n     and utilize our natural resources to solve our energy \n     problem! Absolutely, we need to take care of the environment, \n     but we cannot afford to pay these prices (especially as the \n     money goes directly to the Middle East to fund our enemies!). \n     The solution to the problem is obvious--why cannot we set \n     aside political posturing and get this done???\n     Ken, Swan Valley.\n                                  ____\n\n       I consider Idaho my home. I love the state, the out of \n     doors and, most of all, the people. I have lived here for \n     over ten years having moved here from Bend, Oregon. My career \n     has taken me all over the world. I have lived or traveled \n     through 39 countries in the last twenty years prior to moving \n     here, and there is nowhere else I would rather live. \n     Presently, I live 45 miles north of Boise, near New Plymouth.\n       For a number of years, I worked for Woodgrain Millwork as \n     manager of one of their testing and coatings sections. When \n     that closed, I transferred to Kelly Moore as the outside \n     Industrial and Commercial Sales Rep. Life has been very \n     enjoyable. However, a large portion of my activity centers \n     around construction, food processing and manufacturing. Each \n     of these sectors has had to restructure a good many of their \n     plans as one might expect.\n       It is my belief the market in Idaho will recover at some \n     point; however, it is simply a matter of how long the \n     individual can hold out. Commissions, as one would expect, \n     have lagged, and, of course, the cost of living has not. I \n     have a pretty good-sized territory requiring considerable \n     driving. Every two weeks, I have been spending around $250 \n     for gas. Today, I turned in receipts for close to $500. While \n     the company offsets the majority of this, I still bear a \n     portion and, with the increase in the overall cost of living \n     and the decline in commissions, I am having to look for work \n     elsewhere. I have been supplementing the difference out of \n     savings; I cannot keep doing that. The fact of the matter is \n     Friday I fly to Portland for an interview, a bitter pill, but \n     I must get the bleed under control. Given the changes over \n     the last seven to eight months, I see no other choice.\n     Roger.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo, Even though I make a good living these gas \n     prices couldn't have hit at a worse time. I am trying to get \n     my bills paid down so that I can afford to retire. It does \n     not look like I'll be retiring anytime soon.\n       I am very upset with Congress; they should be opening up \n     exploration and drilling in this country. I agree with Newt: \n     Drill here, Drill now, Pay less. Please work towards this \n     goal.\n           Thank you for asking,\n     Bill, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       Yeah, gas is too high and it makes the price of everything \n     go up. Food prices are going crazy, produce, it is killing \n     the farmers the truckers and the consumers. Now the electric \n     bill is going up, natural gas going up, but wages not so \n     much.\n       I make $15.60 an hour, pretty good for Idaho; but if I \n     hadn't already bought into my house eight years ago, I would \n     be out of luck.\n       I believe transit would help a good deal, but the bus \n     system [is not adequate]. Not enough money to run a real bus \n     system. Federal funding keeps getting cut and cut again. It \n     does not make sense. If you want people to cut consumption of \n     gas, you have to give them options.\n           Sincerely,\n     Connie, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would like to respond to your request for comments \n     regarding energy prices and their effect on the people you \n     represent.\n       Like many people in the greater Boise metro area, I work in \n     downtown Boise but live in communities in the surrounding \n     areas. I work as a software developer, and as such I make \n     what is largely considered to be a comfortable income. I \n     drive a late 80s sedan that I have owned for ten years, and \n     was owned by my parents before me. Unlike many neighbors, I \n     carry no debt outside of my home mortgage, but my mortgage is \n     a significant portion of my after-tax income (greater than 35 \n     percent). My family functions on a very lean budget, not \n     eating out often, producing our own vegetables in our garden, \n     and taking few road trips or vacations.\n       Lately I have needed to cut back on my driving due to \n     increased fuel costs. My commute now costs me roughly $5.50 \n     per day just in gas. According to the IRS standard vehicle \n     expense deduction, the real cost is $12.12 daily, which \n     includes upkeep and repair as well as fuel costs. Just last \n     year, I was able to function within a $3 per day commute \n     budget. To counteract these increases in cost, I have \n     purchased a road bicycle and am starting to ride in to work \n     the 12 miles one way. Unfortunately, this adds an extra 1.5 \n     hours to my day. So now my workday increased from roughly \n     nine hours away from home to almost eleven hours.\n       However, I also suffer from severe allergies specifically \n     relating to tree pollen, grasses and weeds, of which our \n     desert climate and river surrounding community has plenty. \n     These allergies cause my eyes to swell shut when pollen \n     levels increase beyond reasonable levels. The Boise valley \n     area has especially bad pollen problems, due to frequent \n     inversions and stale summer air conditions.\n       So I am faced with the choice of saving money by riding a \n     bicycle, but suffering debilitating allergic reactions, or \n     paying an additional 54 percent in transportation costs, \n     which cuts out monies allocated in our budget to spending \n     time with my family in local restaurants, or for charitable \n     giving to the Rescue Mission. Those businesses and charities, \n     in turn, no doubt, are feeling the pinch from other families \n     in similar situations, so local businesses are suffering as \n     well.\n       The net result of rising costs of fuel and inadequate \n     public transportation in suburban cities, is a lose-lose \n     situation for both me and my community. Add to this problem \n     the speculative nature of fuel prices due to our nations \n     reliance on fuel imports, and the future becomes even less \n     certain. An uncertain future means less spending. Less \n     spending means economic shortfalls and contraction.\n       I am entirely in favor of new efforts to expand new \n     domestic oil exploration and refining capacity as well as \n     investments in nuclear energy infrastructure to help reassign \n     valuable fossil fuels like natural gas or oil to \n     transportation uses and away from electrical power \n     generation. And I also am in favor of long term research in \n     alternate energy and alternate transportation but not to the \n     exclusion of shorter term solutions that make use of our \n     nations existing vehicle inventory and infrastructure.\n       Thank you for your desire to hear from your constituents.\n     Jason, Meridian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6717-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               IN HONOR OF THE HEALTH CENTERS OF DELAWARE\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, each year the Nation celebrates \nNational Health Center Week to honor the efforts of the nearly 40,000 \nmedical professionals who strive to provide quality health care to \nAmericans throughout all 50 States. I am pleased to announce that this \nyear National Health Center Week will be held August 10 through 16.\n  As an annual supporter of this event, I once again commend the work \nof the Mid-Atlantic Association of Community Centers and the many \nhealth centers in my home State for the role they play in delivering \nquality, affordable health care to lower-income Delawareans.\n  These health centers are community-run and open to all Americans \nregardless of their ability to pay. Delaware is fortunate to have a \nnumber of these health centers, including Westside Health in Wilmington \nand Newark, Henrietta Johnson in Wilmington, Delmarva Kent Community \nHealth Center in Dover, and La Red Health Center in Sussex County.\n  These centers and those across our Nation are extremely valuable, \noperating in both rural and urban medically underserved areas and \nproviding care that might not be otherwise available to residents.\n  By serving as a point of access for affordable primary and \npreventative care, our Nation's health centers allow to patients to \nstay healthier, or if they are ill to allow them to seek earlier \ntreatment. This prevents patients from relying solely on costly \ntreatments, such as emergency room visits, saving money for them and \nour health care system as a whole.\n  Again, I wish to commend the health centers of Delaware for their \nhard work and dedication. I thank them for all of the valuable services \nthey provide to so many of us who call Delaware home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6717-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6717-S6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MAN MOUND\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nimportance of Man Mound and congratulate the citizens of Sauk County \nand the Sauk County Historical Society for their extensive and \nsuccessful preservation efforts.\n  Hundreds of years ago, before the Europeans came to this land, a band \nof Native Americans began efforts to alter the landscape by creating \neffigy mounds. Although the purpose is still unclear, effigy mounds \nwere primarily\n\n[[Page S6718]]\n\nused for religious purposes, though some served as burial mounds. \nParticularly in the Midwest, American Indians often built the earthen \nmounds in the shape of animals; however, Man Mound, located in Sauk \nCounty in Greenfield Township, WI, is the one of the few effigy mounds \nin the shape of a man. Over 900 mounds once existed in Sauk County, yet \nover 75 percent of the mounds have been plowed, erased by floods or \ndestroyed by looters and construction. Although the legs of Man Mound \nwere partially destroyed during road construction in the early 1900s, \npreservation of Man Mound continues and further destruction to the \nmound has not occurred. Due to the shrinking number of mounds and the \nrare human shape of the mound in Greenfield Township, Man Mound needs \nto be recognized as a valuable part of history.\n  The Sauk County Historical Society dedicated Man Mound Park, the area \nsurrounding the mound, in 1908 and has since made efforts to keep the \nmound in its original state. The efforts of the people of Sauk County \nand the Sauk County Historical Society to protect the effigy mound were \nprogressive and laudable. Man Mound is believed to be the best \npreserved man-shaped Native American effigy mound remaining in the \nUnited States, a title only possible through the commitment of the \nHistorical Society and the citizens of Sauk County.\n  On August 9, 2008, citizens from many parts the State of Wisconsin \nwill gather to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the preservation of \nthe Man Mound. The commemoration will highlight this unique Native \nAmerican effigy mound, increase awareness of its value as a landmark \nand allow for further investigation as to whether there are more mounds \nin the area. Man Mound will serve as an educational resource for the \npeople in Greenfield Township, Sauk County and Wisconsin. The \npreservation efforts by the people of Sauk County have not gone \nunnoticed. The Sauk County Historical Society, the Ho-Chunk Nation, the \nWisconsin Historical Society, the Wisconsin Archeological Society, the \nGeneral Federation of Women's Clubs-Wisconsin, the Wisconsin \nArcheological Survey and the Sauk County UW Extension, Arts and Culture \nCommittee have dedicated valuable time and resources toward the \ncommemoration of Man Mound. The individuals involved deserve \nrecognition, praise and thanks for their hard work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6718-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to \nexpress my gratitude to the Philadelphia Phillies for their \nextraordinary effort during a recent mentoring event at PNC Park in \nPhiladelphia on June 21, 2008. This particular event was the most \nrecent in a series of events that have been an integral part of a youth \noutreach program.\n  Since my days as district attorney in Philadelphia, I have devoted a \ngreat deal of time and attention to developing ways to reduce violent \ncrime. I believe one of the best ways to reduce the rate of youth crime \nand violence is to develop mentoring programs with the explicit goal of \nimbuing the youth of Pennsylvania with ideals such as hard work and \ncivic responsibility. With this goal in mind, I have worked diligently \nto secure funding for mentoring style programs and have subsequently \nheld events focusing on mentoring and the issues of youth crime and \nviolence throughout Pennsylvania including Philadelphia, Reading, \nLancaster, York, Pittsburgh, and Allentown.\n  The mentoring events in which I have participated are intended to \nprovide the young people of Pennsylvania with a day all their own and, \nsimultaneously, highlight how fun and special mentoring relationships \ncan be for everyone involved. It is my belief that when these young \npeople see that there are positive role models readily available in \ntheir community to whom they can turn when searching for someone to \nemulate, the chance of perpetuating violent patterns of behavior will \nmarkedly decline. Specifically, youth involved in a formal mentoring \nprogram are 46 percent less likely to start using drugs and alcohol and \n33 percent less likely to hit another person. Participants also \nattended school more regularly and completed their school work more \nconsistently and on time. Finally, the children demonstrated improved \npeer and family relationships as a result of their involvement in \nmentoring. These indicators make me hopeful that wide-scale mentoring \ncould have a tremendous impact in this city.\n  The day with the Philadelphia Phillies was no exception. Between the \nplanning efforts and resources of the Phillies organization and the \nrecommendations of my exceptional staff, the event turned out to be \nmemorable for all those who attended. The accommodations the Phillies \nafforded the kids were exceptional. They went so far as to honor one \nyoung person from their own mentoring program and me, and we had the \nopportunity to get involved in the ``First Ball'' ceremony. I am sure \nthis is a memory that this young man will carry with him for the rest \nof his life. I know it is one I will always reflect upon fondly.\n  In the wake of the numerous scandals plaguing professional athletics, \nthe event on June 21, 2008, reminded all those in attendance how \npowerful professional athletes can be in serving as positive role \nmodels for the children of our communities. There is no doubt that the \nyoung people of the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will continue to \nlook toward players such as Chase Utley, Tom Gordon, Jimmie Rollins, \nPat Burrell, and others in the future when determining who they should \nemulate.\n  What I feel is most important to take away from this event is how \nsignificantly it reflects the desire of the entire Philadelphia \ncommunity to become involved in programs that have the potential to \neffect real change in the lives of our youth. When a group as notable \nas the Philadelphia Phillies sets aside time and resources to enhance \nthe lives of our youth, it establishes a powerful standard for \ninvolvement for the rest of the community. For this program to be a \nsuccess, it is essential to engage groups of caring professionals. The \nPhillies, much to my pleasure, have done just that.\n  I look forward to working further into the future with this great \norganization and the others that I hope will follow their lead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6718-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6718-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6718-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6718-S6719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd) reported that he had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill, which was previously signed by the Speaker of \nthe House:\n\n       S. 2967.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     New Jersey urging Congress to not require purchase of flood \n     insurance based on new flood insurance rate maps; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 74\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is \n     charged with reviewing, revising, and updating flood \n     insurance rate maps Under section 1360 of the ``National \n     Flood Insurance Act of 1968'' (42 U.S.C. s.4101); and\n       Whereas, as part of the this charge, through the National \n     Flood Insurance Program's Map Modernization Program, FEMA is \n     conducting a national reassessment of flood insurance rate \n     maps as authorized and funded by the United States Congress; \n     and\n       Whereas, FEMA is currently reviewing and revising the maps \n     for the Bayshore area in Monmouth County, and has determined \n     that the existing beach and dune system located along the \n     Raritan Bay in the Borough of Keansburg, Monmouth County, \n     does not comply with the requirements of the National Flood \n     Insurance Program's regulations found at section 65.10 of \n     title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations concerning FEMA \n     Levee Accreditation; and\n       Whereas, as a result of FEMA's flood map modernization \n     effort, several thousand residents of the State in the \n     Township of Hazlet, the Borough of Keansburg, the Township of \n     Middletown, and the Borough of Union Beach will be now be \n     required to purchase flood insurance; and\n       Whereas, the currently effective maps for the affected area \n     are from 1983, prior to the federal regulations established \n     in 1986 which are the basis for the determination that the \n     area is in non-compliance; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 3121, known as the ``Flood Insurance Reform \n     and Modernization Act of 2007,'' currently pending in the \n     United States Senate, would make a number of changes to the \n     National Flood Insurance Program, including prohibiting FEMA \n     from adjusting the chargeable flood insurance premium rate \n     based on an updated flood insurance rate map, or requiring \n     the purchase of flood insurance for a property not subject to \n     such a purchase requirement before the updating of the map, \n     until such time as an updated map is completed for the entire \n     district of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers affected by the \n     map: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey:\n       1. This House urges the United States Congress to enact \n     legislation that would prohibit the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency from requiring the purchase of new flood \n     insurance based on revised flood insurance rate maps \n     developed as part of the National Flood Insurance Program's \n     Map Modernization Program so that New Jersey residents do not \n     have to incur the cost of the purchase of flood insurance.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging Congress to reauthorize transportation \n     funding with appropriate recognition of the importance of the \n     Great Lakes' infrastructure to the nation's economy; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 194\n\n       Whereas, the future viability of the United States' economy \n     depends on the ability to produce and export marketable \n     products. The state of Michigan is an integral part of the \n     North American manufacturing supply chain, with its \n     international borders and waterways. The Detroit and Port \n     Huron crossings are the busiest land borders in the entire \n     country, bringing $2 trillion in trade value into this \n     country each year; and\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\n       Whereas, transportation infrastructure support is necessary \n     to facilitate the movement of products back and forth, across \n     our borders and around the country, thus feeding the United \n     States' economy. Michigan's aging transportation \n     infrastructure carries an enormous amount of heavy truck \n     traffic to that end and is in need of structural upgrades and \n     expansion; and\n       Whereas, Michigan has been a donor state for transportation \n     dollars for many years. As such, Michigan has subsidized \n     transportation projects in other states to the detriment of \n     state infrastructure and in disproportion to our contribution \n     to the national economy; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize Congress to \n     reauthorize transportation funding with appropriate \n     recognition of the importance of the Great Lakes' \n     infrastructure to the nation's economy; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United House of Representatives, and the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-413.

Wherefore \n     your memorialist, the House of Representatives of the State \n     of Arizona. the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1.

A joint resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Colorado relative to support \n     for the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All \n     Forms of Discrimination Against Women; to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations.\n\n                   House Joint Resolution No. 08-1009\n\n       Whereas, the United States supports and has been an active \n     participant in the drafting of, and is a signatory to, the \n     United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Discrimination Against Women, but the U.S. Senate has failed \n     to ratify the Convention; and\n       Whereas, the spirit of the Convention is rooted in the \n     goals of the United Nations and the United States, to affirm \n     faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth \n     of the human person, and in the equal rights of men and \n     women; and\n       Whereas, the Convention provides a comprehensive framework \n     for challenging the various forces that have created and \n     sustained discrimination based on gender against one-half of \n     the world's population; and\n       Whereas, although women have made major gains in the \n     struggle for equality in social, business, political, legal, \n     educational, and other fields during the past century, there \n     is much yet to be accomplished; and\n       Whereas, through its support, leadership, and prestige, the \n     United States can help create a world in which women are no \n     longer discriminated against and have achieved one of the \n     most fundamental of human rights, equality; and\n       Whereas, in 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed the \n     Convention and submitted it to the Senate for ratification; \n     and\n       Whereas, the U.S. is the only country to have signed but \n     not ratified the convention; and\n       Whereas, ratification of the Convention would entitle the \n     United States to join the United Nations Committee on the \n     Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, \n     which monitors reports of progress in the treatment of women \n     from the countries that have ratified the Convention; and\n       Whereas, as of November, 2007, a total of 185 countries \n     have ratified or acceded to the Convention, and the state \n     legislatures of more than 10 states have endorsed U.S. \n     ratification: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-sixth \n     General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein:\n       That the members of the Colorado General Assembly support \n     the continuing goals of the United Nations Convention on the \n     Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and \n     strongly urge the United States Senate to ratify the \n     Convention; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolution be sent to \n     the President of the United States, the Secretary of State of \n     the United States, the President and the Secretary of the \n     U.S. Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the Chair and members of the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee, and to each member of the Colorado \n     Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-415. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of New Hampshire urging the federal government to \n     create a simplified process for short-term admissions to \n     nursing homes for the purpose of respite care; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, an increasing number of elderly and disabled \n     citizens are being cared for in the home, often by family \n     members, and\n       Whereas, the home care providers of such persons need time \n     to relax and take care of other responsibilities; and\n       Whereas, there is an acute need for safe and appropriate \n     short-term placements where elderly and disabled citizens can \n     stay while their home caregivers have a period of respite \n     from providing home-based care; and\n       Whereas, certain nursing homes in New Hampshire would be \n     willing to provide short-term respite care if there was a \n     simplified and streamlined process for such admissions; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives \n     concurring:\n       That the general court of new Hampshire hereby urges \n     Congress to develop a simplified and streamlined process for \n     short-term admissions to nursing homes for the purpose of \n     respite care that minimizes, to the greatest extent possible, \n     paperwork and recordkeeping that needs to be completed prior \n     to and during such admissions; and\n       That copies of this resolution shall be sent by the senate \n     clerk to the President of the United States, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the United States \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, and each member of \n     the New Hampshire congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-416. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     provide a federal extension of unemployment benefits for \n     those unemployed workers in the State of Michigan; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 117\n\n       Whereas, our nation, the state of Michigan in particular, \n     has been hard hit by the country's recent recession. Although \n     the overall economy has seen improvement, for states reliant \n     on certain industries the recent years have been \n     characterized by an inordinately high level of unemployment. \n     This situation has been especially difficult in our state's \n     manufacturing and other professional sectors; and\n       Whereas, in recognition of the country's unemployment \n     difficulties, the United States Congress has provided federal \n     13-week extensions of unemployment benefits. These extensions \n     have been invaluable in helping working men and women provide \n     the necessities for their families while seeking work. It is \n     only fitting that an extension of benefits be provided to our \n     hard working men and women when, through no fault of their \n     own, these workers are faced with extended periods of \n     unemployment; and\n       Whereas, a host of Michigan workers have exhausted their \n     state employment security benefits. Without a federal \n     extension, these people and their families face tremendous \n     financial hardships. Moreover, spiraling energy costs and a \n     continuing slow job market spell disaster for far too many of \n     Michigan's working families. The economic well-being and \n     human dignity that a federal extension can help provide in \n     these troubled economic times are critical; Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to provide a \n     federal extension of unemployment benefits for those \n     unemployed workers in the state of Michigan; and be it \n     further\n\n[[Page S6721]]\n\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-417. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     enact the Youth Promise Act; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 310\n\n       Whereas, among the most effective approaches to reducing \n     juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang activity are \n     those preventing children from turning to crime in the first \n     place--encouraging early childhood home visitation, parental \n     love and education, quality schooling, and proven youth and \n     family development initiatives; and\n       Whereas, there are many alternatives to incarcerating youth \n     that have been proven to be more effective in reducing crime \n     and violence at the national, state, local, and tribal \n     levels. Failure to provide for such effective alternatives is \n     a pervasive problem that leads to increased youth, and later \n     adult, crime and violence; and\n       Whereas, research funded by the U.S. Department of Justice \n     indicates that gang membership is short-lived among \n     adolescents--with very few youth remaining gang-involved \n     through their adolescent years. This indicates that there are \n     opportunities for intervention; and\n       Whereas, over-reliance on incarceration and confinement of \n     youth, particularly in the early stages of delinquent \n     behavior and for nonviolent delinquent behavior, has been \n     shown to increase long-term crime risks; and,\n       Whereas, Congress has before it the Youth Prison Reduction \n     through Opportunities, Mentoring, Intervention, Support, and \n     Education Act, the Youth PROMISE Act, (H.R. 3846), which \n     seeks to provide for evidence-based and promising practices \n     related to juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang \n     activity prevention and intervention and to help build \n     individual, family, and community strength to ensure that our \n     youth lead productive, law-abiding, addiction- and gang-free \n     lives; and\n       Whereas, the Youth PROMISE Act will provide resources to \n     enable communities with the greatest concentration of \n     juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang activity to \n     come together to assess unmet needs and implement research-\n     based prevention and intervention approaches to promote youth \n     success and community safety; and\n       Whereas, the Youth PROMISE Act creates a PROMISE Advisory \n     Panel, which will help the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention select PROMISE communities. It will \n     also develop standards for the evaluation of juvenile \n     delinquency and criminal street gang activity prevention and \n     intervention methods carried out under the Youth PROMISE Act. \n     Further, it provides for the collection of data related to \n     the juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang activity \n     prevention and intervention needs and resources in each \n     designated geographic area in order to facilitate the \n     strategic geographic allocation of resources provided under \n     the act; and\n       Whereas, the Youth PROMISE Act establishes grants to enable \n     local and tribal communities, via PROMISE Coordinating \n     Councils, to conduct an objective assessment regarding \n     juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang activity, \n     resource needs, and community strengths necessary to \n     effectively address juvenile delinquency and criminal street \n     gang activity. Based upon the assessment, the PROMISE \n     Coordinating Councils will develop plans that include a broad \n     array of prevention and intervention programs that are \n     responsive to the specifIcs of the community, account for the \n     cultural and linguistic requirements of the community, and \n     utilize approaches that have been shown effective in reducing \n     the likelihood of a young person becoming involved in or \n     continuing delinquent conduct or criminal street gang \n     activity. Upon completion of the plan, the PROMISE \n     Coordinating Councils may then apply for federal funds to \n     assist with implementation. The act also provides for \n     national evaluations of PROMISE programs and activities; and\n       Whereas, the Youth PROMISE Act requires that local units of \n     government or Indian tribes receiving grants shall provide \n     from nonfederal funds, in cash or in-kind, 25 percent of the \n     costs of the activities carried out with such grants; and\n       Whereas, the Youth PROMISE Act establishes a National \n     Center for Proven Practices Research, which will collect and \n     disseminate research to PROMISE Coordinating Councils and to \n     the public (including via an Internet website), as well as \n     other information regarding evidence-based promising \n     practices related to juvenile delinquency and criminal street \n     gang activity prevention and intervention. The act also \n     provides the opportunity for regional research partners to \n     assist with developing their assessments and plans; and\n       Whereas, The Youth PROMISE Act provides for the hiring and \n     training of Youth-Oriented Policing officers to implement \n     strategic activities to minimize youth crime and \n     victimization and reduce the long-term involvement of \n     juveniles in illicit activities, juvenile delinquency, and \n     criminal street gang activity.

We have few more important foreign policy priorities than \nencouraging stability in Pakistan and throughout the region, and \nproviding sustainable cooperation to fight the terrorists who threaten \nboth our countries.\n  We worked closely with the State Department's Deputy Secretary \nNegroponte, as well as officials at USAID, to craft this legislation. \nThis bipartisan effort reflects the important realization that our \nrelations with Pakistan must be broad-based and enduring. As Mr. \nNegroponte told the committee earlier this year, following the \nelections that ended military rule, we have ``a strategic opportunity \nto help the nation consolidate its democratic gains by encouraging \ndevelopment and economic reform.''\n  This legislation marks a good first step toward seizing that \nopportunity. Its success will be contingent upon effective progress in \ngood governance by the leaders throughout the Pakistan government, and \nupon their commitment to combating terrorism within their borders. The \nU.S. National Intelligence Estimate revealed in June of\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\nlast year that al-Qaeda had reestablished its pre-2001 capacity in the \ntribal areas of Pakistan. This reconstituted capacity across the border \nfrom Afghanistan, together with the extreme Taliban leadership based in \nPakistan, represents a threat to Pakistan, to the region, and to the \nUnited States.\n  The legislation recognizes that strengthening democracy and \ncountering terrorism go hand in hand. American Defense, intelligence \nand State Department officials have all said that economic development \nand improved governance are at least as critical as military action in \ncontaining the terrorist threat.\n  While our bill envisions sustained cooperation with Pakistan for the \nlong haul, it is not a blank check. It calls for tangible progress in a \nnumber of areas, including an independent judiciary, greater \naccountability by the central government, respect for human rights, and \ncivilian control of the levers of power, including the military and the \nintelligence agencies. It recognizes that Pakistan will need security \nassistance to fight the terrorists, but it subjects this assistance to \na certification that the government is using the money for its intended \npurpose, namely, to go after the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and that \ncivilian control is maintained. It calls for a comprehensive, cross-\nborder approach to the very difficult situation along the adjoining \nAfghan and Pakistani tribal areas, combining the economic and security \naspects.\n  This bill represents a lot of hard work by many parties, but we \nrecognize the job is not yet done. Passing it into law will require \nfurther efforts, first of all by us on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Then we must take it to the floor of the Senate, where I \nlook forward to working with our chairman on advancing the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 3264. A bill to amend the Public Works and Economic Development \nAct of 1965 to reauthorize that Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nreauthorize the Economic Development Administration, EDA. EDA was \ncreated in 1965 to provide assistance to economically distressed areas, \nprimarily those experiencing substantial and persistent unemployment \nand poverty. EDA works with partners in local communities to create \nwealth and minimize poverty by promoting favorable business \nenvironments to attract private investment and encourage long-term \neconomic growth.\n  Studies show that EDA uses Federal dollars efficiently and \neffectively, creating and retaining long-term jobs at an average cost \nthat is among the lowest in government. Reauthorization gives us an \nopportunity to ensure the continuation of this good work and to provide \nthe tools necessary to improve performance even further.\n  The reauthorization bill I am introducing today includes many of the \nprogram administration improvements proposed by the President, while \nreaffirming a commitment to acceptable funding levels. Specifically, \nthe bill reauthorizes the agency for 5 years; allows for increases in \nthe minimum level of funding for planning districts; provides needed \nresources and reforms to improve administration of the revolving loan \nfund program; and adds flexibility in addressing grant recipients' \nchanged economic development needs.\n  In my home State of Oklahoma, we have some communities that struggle \nwith economic distress, and EDA has worked long and hard with those \ncommunities to bring in private capital investment and jobs. Durant, \nClinton, Oklahoma City, Seminole, Miami, and Elgin are just some of the \nOklahoma communities that have made good use of EDA assistance. In \nfact, over the past 5\\1/2\\ years, EDA grants awarded in my home State \nhave resulted in almost 12,000 jobs being created or saved. With an \ninvestment of about $22.7 million, we have leveraged another $24 \nmillion in State and local funds and more than $437 million in private \nsector funds. I would call that a wonderful success story.\n  The EDA's authorization is set to expire on September 30, 2008. \nEspecially in these times of economic uncertainty, it is imperative not \nto create uncertainty for this very successful agency and the \nstruggling communities that depend on its assistance by allowing the \nauthorization to lapse. I look forward to working with the \nadministration, as well as my colleagues here in the Senate and in the \nHouse of Representatives, to try to reauthorize EDA before that \nhappens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3264\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A committee to which a \n     Commission Schedule and Review bill is referred under this \n     paragraph may review and comment on such bill, may report \n     such bill to the respective House, and may not amend such \n     bill.\n       (B) Reporting.--Not later than 30 calendar days after the \n     introduction of the Commission Schedule and Review bill, each \n     Committee of Congress to which the Commission Schedule and \n     Review bill was referred shall report the bill.\n       (C) Discharge of committee.--If a committee to which is \n     referred a Commission Schedule and Review bill has not \n     reported such Commission Schedule and Review bill at the end \n     of 30 calendar days after its introduction or at the end of \n     the first day after there has been reported to the House \n     involved a Commission Schedule and Review bill, whichever is \n     earlier, such committee shall be deemed to be discharged from \n     further consideration of such Commission Schedule and Review \n     bill, and such Commission Schedule and Review bill shall be \n     placed on the appropriate calendar of the House involved.\n       (b) Expedited Procedure.--\n       (1) Consideration.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 5 calendar days after the \n     date on which a committee has been discharged from \n     consideration of a Commission Schedule and Review bill, the \n     majority leader of the Senate, or the majority leader's \n     designee, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or \n     the Speaker's designee, shall move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the Commission Schedule and Review bill. It \n     shall also be in order for any member of the Senate or the \n     House of Representatives, respectively, to move to proceed to \n     the consideration of the Commission Schedule and Review bill \n     at any time after the conclusion of such 5-day period.\n       (B) Motion to proceed.--A motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of a Commission Schedule and Review bill is \n     highly privileged in the House of Representatives and is \n     privileged in the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is \n     not subject to amendment, to a motion to postpone \n     consideration of the Commission Schedule and Review bill, or \n     to a motion to proceed to the consideration of other \n     business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion \n     to proceed is agreed to or not agreed to shall not be in \n     order. If the motion to proceed is agreed to, the Senate or \n     the House of Representatives, as the case may be, shall \n     immediately proceed to consideration of the Commission \n     Schedule and Review bill without intervening motion, order, \n     or other business, and the Commission Schedule and Review \n     bill shall remain the unfinished business of the Senate or \n     the House of Representatives, as the case may be, until \n     disposed of.\n       (C) Limited debate.--Debate on the Commission Schedule and \n     Review bill and on all debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith shall be limited to not more than 10 \n     hours, which shall be divided equally between those favoring \n     and those opposing the Commission Schedule and Review bill.

All time used \n     for consideration of the Commission Schedule and Review bill, \n     including time used for quorum calls (except quorum calls \n     immediately preceding a vote) and voting, shall come from the \n     10 hours of debate.\n       (D) Amendments.--No amendment to the Commission Schedule \n     and Review bill shall be in order in the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives.\n       (E) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on the Commission Schedule and \n     Review bill, the vote on final passage of the Commission \n     Schedule and Review bill shall occur.\n       (F) Other motions not in order.--A motion to postpone \n     consideration of the Commission Schedule and Review bill, a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or \n     a motion to recommit the Commission Schedule and Review bill \n     is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the \n     Commission Schedule and Review bill is agreed to or not \n     agreed to is not in order.\n       (2) Consideration by other house.--If, before the passage \n     by 1 House of the Commission Schedule and Review bill that \n     was introduced in such House, such House receives\n\n[[Page S6735]]\n\n     from the other House a Commission Schedule and Review bill as \n     passed by such other House--\n       (A) the Commission Schedule and Review bill of the other \n     House shall not be referred to a committee and may only be \n     considered for final passage in the House that receives it \n     under subparagraph (C);\n       (B) the procedure in the House in receipt of the Commission \n     Schedule and Review bill of the other House, with respect to \n     the Commission Schedule and Review bill that was introduced \n     in the House in receipt of the Commission Schedule and Review \n     bill of the other House, shall be the same as if no \n     Commission Schedule and Review bill had been received from \n     the other House; and\n       (C) notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the vote on final \n     passage shall be on the Commission Schedule and Review bill \n     of the other House. Upon disposition of a Commission Schedule \n     and Review bill that is received by 1 House from the other \n     House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the \n     Commission Schedule and Review bill that was introduced in \n     the receiving House.\n       (c) Rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives.--\n     This section is enacted by Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed \n     to be part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a Commission Schedule and Review \n     bill, and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that \n     it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/15/senate-section/article/S6735-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.
