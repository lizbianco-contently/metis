Mr. President, today, following any time that may be used \nby the leaders, there will be 60 minutes of debate on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the Dorgan drug reimportation amendment, with the \ntime divided between Senators Dorgan and the Republican leader or his \ndesignee. The vote then will occur around 10:30 or a few minutes after \nthat this morning. Members who have second-degree amendments to the \nDorgan amendment must file them by 10 this morning. A number of other \namendments are still pending, and today will be a busy day, with votes \noccurring throughout the day.\n  Another issue which will need the Senate's attention will be the \nconference on the budget resolution. The House is going to act either \ntoday or Monday appointing conferees, which will mean we will act \nshortly thereafter. The chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nConrad, and the ranking member, Senator Gregg, have had initial \nconversations about the likelihood of there being motions to instruct \nthe conferees.\n  Under the Budget Act, there is a maximum of 10 hours of debate to get \nto conference. I would hope the two managers of that budget resolution, \nSenators Conrad and Gregg, can make a determination as to how many \nmotions to instruct there will be to give some idea. As I understand \nthe rule, we have 10 hours of debate no matter what. If there are \nmotions to instruct that have been filed and not enough time to debate \nthem, the votes will take place with no debate. I hope there will be \nadequate time to debate whatever motions to instruct and basic \nconversation about that most important budget resolution that we need \nto complete so we can get to the appropriations bills. I will be \ndiscussing this matter with the Republican leader and may have more to \nsay during the day.\n  If there is a lull in the schedule today, we have a number of judges \nwe can vote on. We may do that. Senators Kennedy and Enzi have done a \nmasterful job in moving this matter along. We hope they will continue \ntheir masterful work and complete this legislation.\n  I do say, as I have said, but it is worth repeating, Senator Enzi and \nSenator Kennedy, some would say, are not a matched pair. They have \ndifferent political philosophies, they come from different parts of the \ncountry. But that is really what the Senate is all about. They have set \nan example of how individual Senators can work together. They are \nreally exemplary, as far as I am concerned, in being able to move a \nvery difficult, complicated piece of legislation by understanding that \nthis is not the last word. There is going to be a conference. Senator \nKennedy has told Senator Enzi that he would be a part of that \nconference. They trust each other. That is important. We finished the \ncompetition bill last week. This is another step forward. I hope we can \ncomplete this bill today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/03/senate-section/article/S5525-7", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5525-S5526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1082, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1082) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act to reauthorize and amend the prescription drug \n     user fee provisions, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Landrieu amendment No. 1004, to require the Food and Drug \n     Administration to permit the sale of baby turtles as pets so \n     long as the seller uses proven methods to effectively treat \n     salmonella.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 990, to provide for the importation of \n     prescription drugs.\n       Cochran amendment No. 1010 (to amendment No. 990), to \n     protect the health and safety of the public.\n       Stabenow amendment No. 1011, to insert provisions related \n     to citizens petitions.\n       Brown (for Brownback/Brown) amendment No. 985, to establish \n     a priority drug review process to encourage treatments of \n     tropical diseases.\n       Vitter amendment No. 983, to require counterfeit-resistant \n     technologies for prescription drugs.\n       Inhofe amendment No. 988, to protect children and their \n     parents from being coerced into administering a controlled \n     substance in order to attend school.\n       Gregg/Coleman amendment No. 993, to provide for the \n     regulation of Internet pharmacies.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be an hour for debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on amendment No. 990, with the time equally divided between the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, and the Republican leader or \ntheir designees.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator from Wyoming yield me 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Certainly.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we now have an agreement that we are \ngoing to vote on cloture on the Dorgan amendment. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota will be here to speak on that. He has a half hour. To \nbring our colleagues up to date, we have made very good progress during \nthe evening, clearing matters with the Members. There are still a \nnumber of items that we will want to accept. We will indicate to the \nMembers the topical areas so they will be familiar with the areas that \nwe are moving ahead on. But we have narrowed the areas of controversy \nto probably four or five important areas where we may very well have \nvotes during the day. The rest we will announce the agreements that \nhave been made with the particular Senators on these issues.\n  We want to thank all of our colleagues. This has been very \nconstructive. A number of these suggestions and ideas are extremely \nvaluable. We will tell our colleagues the areas and the content of \nthese agreements as we move on through the day.\n  We are in touch with a couple of Senators so we will be able to make \na judgment decision at the conclusion of this vote on the cloture. We \nwill be ready to go so we will not miss any opportunity to make \nprogress on the bill.\n  I thank the Senator. The Senate will now debate the underlying \ncloture motion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have not had an opportunity to speak \nwith the Senator from North Dakota. I hope I am not abusing my \nprivilege of working with him and having some time this morning. I \nyield myself 7 minutes.\n  The Dorgan amendment is the moment American consumers have been \nwaiting for. I am here to urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we \ncan finally legalize drug importation.\n  As I said yesterday, the Dorgan amendment is the result of a \ncollaborative effort by myself, with Senators Dorgan, Snowe, and \nKennedy, to finally make drug importation legal. This is a golden \nopportunity that we have been waiting for years to accomplish. The bill \nbefore us is the vehicle this year to get it done.\n  The bill we are debating is a must-pass Food and Drug Administration \nbill. The Senate should send a strong message that we are committed to \nfinally getting it done this year. This is what we have been working to \naccomplish today.\n  Making it legal for Americans to import their prescription drugs is a \ntop priority at the grassroots of America. It needs to be a top \npriority here in Washington.\n  It is something that shows up in almost every one of my town meetings \nthroughout Iowa. I have long advocated allowing American consumers \naccess to safe drugs from other countries. I have always considered \nthis more a free trade issue than I have a health or prescription drug \nissue.\n  Imports create competition and keep domestic industry more responsive \nto consumers. In the United States--so that I explain why I consider \nthis a free trade issue more than a health issue--we import everything. \nWe allow everything that consumers might want to buy; based upon the \nquality they choose and the price they choose, we have allowed it to \ncome into the country if Americans want to buy from overseas. \nHopefully, they want to buy American-made products. But we have \nconsidered free trade something that has given consumers the best deal \nthey can get. So why not do it for pharmaceuticals as well as any other \nproduct people want to buy?\n  Consumers in the United States now pay far more for prescription \ndrugs than consumers in other countries. If Americans could legally and \nsafely access prescription drugs from outside the United States under a \nregulation that we established to guarantee safety, drug companies will \nbe forced to reevaluate the price strategies that they have for \nAmerican consumers. They would no longer be able to gouge American \nconsumers by making them pay more than their fair share for the high \ncost of research and development. I sort out research and development \nbecause I think Canadians are getting a better deal from American \npharmaceuticals. Germans are getting a better deal from American \npharmaceuticals. They get such a low price. They don't pay the fair \nshare. The American consumer of pharmaceutical products pays for most \nof the research and development that benefits the entire world. It is \nnot fair to the American consumer.\n  It is true that pharmaceutical companies do not like the idea of \nopening American consumption of drugs to the global marketplace. They \nwant to keep the United States closed to other markets in order to \ncharge higher prices here. They would argue: We have to charge higher \nprices here. The Government directs what we pay the consumers or charge \nthe consumers of Germany. Well, that is not fair to the American to pay \nfor that sort of research.\n  However, with the Dorgan amendment--and this is what we are talking \nabout on this important vote coming up--prescription drug companies \nwill be forced to compete, forced to establish a fair price here in \nAmerica.\n  Some don't want this to happen. I want to reiterate that there is an \nattempt to kill drug importation, as has been done many times before in \nthis Chamber. I am referring to an amendment to make sure there is \ncertification of health and safety. That amendment is designed to kill \ndrug importation once again. It is a clever amendment, but it is a \npoison pill. Our effort develops an effective and safe system. This \namendment requires all imported drugs to be approved by the Food and \nDrug Administration. That is the right thing to do. The amendment sets \na stringent set of safety requirements that must be met before \nAmericans can import drugs into this country, and there are stiff \npenalties for violation. Don't be fooled by this poison pill amendment. \nVoting for that amendment is a vote to kill drug importation. That \namendment surely will be up if we get beyond the cloture vote, the next \nvote. It is important that people vote for cloture.\n  With the Dorgan amendment, we are getting the job of safety done. We \nneed to make sure Americans have even greater, more affordable access \nto wonder drugs by further opening the doors to competition in the \nglobal pharmaceutical industry. We must make sure they have access to \naffordable prescription drugs.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  One additional editorial comment that is legitimate to maybe \ncriticize Grassley for voting for this amendment but a criticism that I \nthink I would now explain; that is, that comes\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\nfrom a very good fellow Member and friend of mine in the Senate who \ncame up to me yesterday and said: Then wouldn't I be for having all \nrestrictions against ethanol coming into this country done away with \nbecause I represent a State that is very high in ethanol.\n  I said the answer to that is twofold: No. 1, all restrictions ought \nto go off when ethanol is no longer an infant industry, and it is still \nan infant industry. Secondly, and more importantly, there is already a \nfree importation of ethanol in this country of up to 7 percent of our \nproduction, and we have not even reached that 7 percent importation of \nethanol. I will debate that issue when the leeway within present law \nallows.\n  So I do not think there is an inconsistency on my part in what I said \nabout the free entry from the mature industry of pharmaceuticals--maybe \nnot mature in biotechnology but surely mature in pharmaceuticals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time in the quorum call be charged to both \nsides equally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me yield myself 5 minutes from the \ntime allotted.\n  Mr. President, the vote that will occur at 10:30 or thereabouts is a \nvote that will determine whether we can proceed to have a vote on my \namendment. It is called a cloture vote--to shut off debate so we can \nmove to the amendment I have offered. I wish to remind my colleagues \nagain of what this amendment is.\n  This amendment is a bipartisan amendment sponsored by 33 Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats--Senator Grassley, who just spoke, myself, \nSenator Snowe, Senator McCain, Senator Kennedy, Senator Stabenow; a \nwide range of Senators, Republicans and Democrats--who believe U.S. \ncitizens ought to be able to purchase FDA-approved prescription drugs, \nthe identical FDA-approved drugs that are sold in other countries for a \nfraction of the cost of what they are sold for in this country. We \nbelieve the American people ought to be able to make the global economy \nwork for them and ought to be able to access those same prescription \ndrugs as long as they are in a chain of custody that makes them safe \nand as long as they are FDA approved.\n  I described them yesterday, and let me, again, ask unanimous consent \nto describe to my colleagues these two bottles.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. In these bottles is the medication called Lipitor. \nLipitor is made in Ireland. It is a common cholesterol-lowering drug \ntaken by a good many Americans. As you can see, when made in the plant \nin Ireland, it is put in these bottles--identical bottles--with a label \nthat is blue in this case, red in this case, otherwise identical. The \ndifference in this situation is that this blue bottle is sent to Canada \nfrom Ireland, this red bottle is sent to the United States. It is the \nsame pill, same bottle, made in the same manufacturing plant, FDA \napproved.\n  The difference? Well, the American consumer is told: You get to pay \ntwice as much for the identical drug. You get to pay twice as much.\n  It describes a serious problem of what I believe is the overpricing \nof prescription drugs in this country. We pay the highest prices in the \nworld for prescription drugs. I do not know of anyone in this Chamber \nwho stands up and says: Let me sign up for that. Let me tell you, I \nthink it is right, I think it is fair, and I think it is important that \nthe American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs.\n  I do not think anybody stands up here and claims that. What they \nclaim is, if they do not get that kind of money, they will shut down \nresearch and development, and they are forced to charge lower prices \noverseas because those governments overseas won't allow them to make \nmoney.\n  Let me show you what happened a while ago. This Chamber--without my \nsupport because it was a foolish thing to do--said: Do you know what. \nWe want to say to the biggest economic interests in our country, the \nbiggest companies that have moved American jobs overseas and make \ninvestments overseas, we want to say to them that if you make profits \noverseas, we will allow you to repatriate those profits into this \ncountry, back here, and you get to pay a special tax rate.\n  Normally, when a company repatriates its profits made elsewhere, it \npays normal income tax rates. But this Congress said to them: Do you \nknow what. We will give you a special deal, a big fat tax break. If you \nrepatriate your foreign profits, you get to pay a 5.25-percent income \ntax rate. Nobody gets to pay a 5.25-percent income tax rate. I would \nlove to pay that. Everybody else would, as well. But the biggest \ncompanies in our country got to repatriate a massive amount of money \nand save, I estimate, about $100 billion in taxes that should have been \npaid because they got a 5.25-percent sweetheart deal.\n\n  So let me just turn to one drug company--Pfizer, a good company, one \nof the world's biggest drugmakers. This is from the New York Times of \nJune 24, 2005. It said it would return ``$8.6 billion in overseas \nprofits.'' So the combined repatriation of $36.9 billion--it had \nalready announced $28.3 billion--so that makes it $36 billion they are \nrepatriating in profits they have made overseas. The New York Times \nsays that is four times what Pfizer spent on research and development \nlast year.\n  But isn't it interesting that they charge lower prices for \nprescription drugs in other countries, they say they do not make money \nin other countries, yet when they get a big fat sweetheart deal to pay \na 5.25-percent income tax rate, they repatriate $36 billion. That is on \nthe profit they made in other countries. It looks to me as if it is \nprofitable selling these drugs at lower prices in foreign countries. So \nmuch for that argument.\n  The price discrepancy I have indicated previously. I used Canada as \nan example, but I could use France, Italy, Germany, Spain--it would not \nmatter. Lipitor, 96 percent higher prices for Americans; Prevacid, 97 \npercent higher prices for Americans; Nexium, 55 percent higher prices; \nZocor--the fact is, we are paying the highest prices for brand-name \nprescription drugs in the world, and it is unfair. We are trying to \nchange that.\n  What we are saying is: Let's let the global economy work for \neverybody, not just the large pharmaceutical industry. How about \nallowing it to work for regular folks, to buy a safe FDA-approved \nprescription drug, for example, from a Canadian pharmacy.\n  Can anybody give me one reason why a U.S.-licensed pharmacist should \nnot be able to go to a licensed pharmacist in Winnipeg, Canada--both \nlicensed, both with an identical chain of custody--why a U.S.-licensed \npharmacist should not be able to go to a licensed pharmacist in Canada \nand acquire an FDA-approved drug, such as Tamoxifen, at one-fourth or \none-fifth of the price charged in the United States and pass the \nsavings along to the consumer? I am not asking for five reasons. I am \nasking: Can anyone give me one reason why that should be prohibited? I \nthink the answer is that there is not a good reason why we should \nprohibit that sort of thing.\n  So we will have a vote on this amendment. My hope is we will be able \nto invoke cloture so we will be able to proceed to the amendment. There \nwill be a Cochran amendment to my amendment, a second degree, and then \na vote on my amendment. My hope is we will be able to do that today.\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am on the floor to urge the Senate not \nto invoke cloture. This is a very serious amendment the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has proffered and is being considered by the Senate, and \nit should attract the attention and careful review of all Senators.\n  I noticed in the Washington Post, in an article on Thursday, May 3, \nthe editorial writer says--of the amendment the Senator from North \nDakota has offered, which ``would allow the importation of prescription \ndrugs from other countries,'' which he claims and other supporters \nclaim ``would let cut-rate pharmaceuticals flow into the United \nStates'' allegedly ``saving ailing Americans untold amounts of money.'' \nBut here is the catch, and I quote from the editorial:\n\n       This is a mirage; importation will not solve the problem of \n     drug pricing. U.S. drug firms sell prescription medications \n     to countries such as Canada at low prices, a situation that \n     would quickly change if Canadian distributors started to \n     recycle large quantities of drugs back to the United States.\n\n  Another fact in this debate that should not be overlooked is that \nPresident Bush has threatened to veto the bill if it contains this \nlanguage.\n  So to achieve our goal of helping to ensure safe and unadulterated \nprescription drugs marketed in the United States are safe, we need to \nhave the Federal agencies that have the responsibility of assuring that \nsafety to be in charge of certifying that.\n  So I have offered an amendment to the Dorgan amendment--if cloture is \ninvoked, it will be subject to consideration--that says unless the Food \nand Drug Administration or the Department of Health and Human Services \ncan certify and vouch for the safety and efficacy of imported drugs, \nthis amendment would not be operative. And we have been told by \nadministration officials they cannot make that certification. They do \ntry. We all try to help by working together to ensure that what the \nconsumers are buying is what the labels on the drugs say they are. But \nwe have seen in recent years a growing threat from counterfeit drugs \nthat are made in other countries--not Canada necessarily but other \ncountries--which could be transshipped through Canada or could be \nmailed directly to purchasers in the United States that aren't what \nthey say they are. Some are even dangerous. Some contain nothing at \nall--nothing that is effective to do what the drug is supposed to do.\n\n  So we are already confronted with a serious problem. This is going to \nmake it much worse and exceedingly difficult for those who are charged \nwith certifying the efficacies of drugs, protecting our citizens from \ndangerous drugs, counterfeit drugs, to do their job. This is going to \nmake it much more difficult.\n  This is not the first time the Senate has been asked to make a \ndecision on this amendment or amendments similar to it. On three \ndifferent occasions the Senate has, without objection, or on a vote--\none vote was 99 to nothing--rejected this amendment. There have been \nvotes that have been closer. Recently, I think Senators have gotten the \nmessage this is not an amendment that is going to achieve the goals \nthat the proponents who are offering it say it will. There will be some \ncheaper drugs coming into the country--but maybe temporarily--for the \nreasons that have been pointed out by others and in the Washington Post \neditorial this morning.\n  So I am hopeful Senators will carefully look at the situation we \nface. The intent, of course, is certainly laudable, but we have an \noverriding responsibility to make sure medications purchased by \nAmerican citizens in the United States are safe and that those are \ndecisions made by the regulators and the inspectors in the United \nStates who have the responsibility of making those decisions. So I am \nhopeful the Senate will not vote to invoke cloture. If it does, we will \ntalk a little more about the situation. But up until that point, I hope \nSenators will review the history of the Senate on this subject and vote \nagainst the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have an interesting challenge in \nfront of us today. All of us support drug availability at affordable \nprices. The challenge that brings us to the floor today is how to \nensure that prescription drugs used by Americans are both affordable \nand safe. That is the goal for all of us, I believe, in the Senate.\n  We trust the drugs we get at our local pharmacies, our neighborhood \npharmacies, are safe because they go through a rigorous FDA approval \nprocess, and a series of tests and inspections are done before they \nreach our medicine chests. Those drugs improve, extend, and save lives.\n  I am proud so many of these drugs originate in my home State. In \nfact, more than half the medicines approved by the FDA in 2001 were \ndeveloped by 70,000 hard-working people employed in the pharmaceutical \ncompanies of New Jersey. These companies have received more than 11,000 \npatents for their products since 1985 for their innovative work. Many \nof these products are life-extending and limit often painful and \ndebilitating conditions.\n  When we look at the prospects these companies are offering, we want \nto encourage the research. I heard this morning about an inoculation \nthat could be sufficient, given one time to women, that could prevent \nosteoporosis. What a wonderful thing. Recently, we have had a product \ncome to the market called Gardasil. It says that young women who \nreceive an injection of Gardasil can be protected against cervical \ncancer for their lives. What a wonderful thing that is. Lipitor has \nbeen known for some time to reduce plaque gathering in the valves and \nthe veins that lead to the heart. We want to encourage that kind of \ndevelopment, and our goal is to make sure these workers continue \ndeveloping lifesaving medications and at the same time lower costs and \nincrease access to these drugs.\n  I support the efforts to lower prescription drug prices, and I \nunderstand the appeal of reimportation, as long as we are absolutely \nassured of the safety and efficacy of these products. So if we are \ngoing to trust drugs imported from other countries, we need to be sure \nthey are as effective and completely safe. We cannot put our citizens \nin the position of buying medicine they think will lower their \ncholesterol or prevent heart disease only to find out years later the \ndrug was a fake.\n  According to the World Health Organization, up to 10 percent of all \ndrugs sold across the globe are counterfeit. We heard debate about the \ncountries that some of these drugs come from. If we want to give \nconsumers the chance to buy drugs imported from other countries, we \nhave to insist these drugs are authentic, reliable, and safe.\n  That is why the Senate has, on three prior occasions, required the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to certify that importation be \nwithout additional risk to the public health while it reduces costs. \nThat is why I intend to support the Cochran second-degree amendment, \nand I encourage my colleagues to do the same thing. Let's make sure \nwhat we are telling the public to buy is absolutely safe, harmless, and \ncan improve life's qualities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds \nmore.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Cochran amendment would require \nthe same certification this body has approved three times before--to \nguarantee prescription drugs and provide consumers peace of mind, \nknowing that the drugs they are taking are safe and effective no matter \nwhere they originated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article \nI referred to from the\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\nwashingtonpost.com be printed in the Record, and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey for his excellent statement. We \nurge the Senate to reject this motion to invoke cloture.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washingtonpost.com, May 3, 2007]\n\n                          Almost the Right Rx\n\n       Legislation to give the FDA important new powers can do \n     without one provision\n       While most attention this week has been focused on the Iraq \n     supplemental appropriations bill, the Senate also has been \n     debating far-reaching legislation to give the Food and Drug \n     Administration a long-needed increase in its regulatory \n     powers. A very unneeded amendment, however, is threatening \n     the bill.\n       The bill would reauthorize the system of user fees that the \n     FDA charges pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers of \n     medical devices. Congress approved this arrangement in 1992 \n     to speed FDA decision making and get needed drugs onto the \n     market more efficiently. User fees account for a large \n     portion of the FDA budget, but the agency's authority to \n     collect them expires in September. There is broad support not \n     only for maintaining the system but for increasing the amount \n     of fees that the FDA can collect.\n       Attached to the must-pass user fees measure are a number of \n     important enhancements to the FDA's regulatory authority and \n     responsibilities. Under the legislation, the agency would be \n     required to collect massive amounts of data on prescription \n     drug use from public and private sources after drugs have \n     been approved, to detect harmful side effects and other \n     dangers that testing before approval might have missed. The \n     FDA would also be able to require drug companies to alter \n     warnings and other information on labels. And, critically, \n     the agency would have the power to order drug trials after a \n     drug's approval in certain cases.\n       All of these reforms would lead to better-informed \n     regulators, patients and doctors. Everyone has an interest in \n     enhancing the data available to the government and, \n     ultimately, the public on prescription drugs after they enter \n     the market. Compiling more evidence more quickly would help \n     detect problems with new prescription medications faster and \n     with greater accuracy and assist consumers in making reasoned \n     choices about the drugs they take.\n       Complicating the bill's prospects for passage, however, is \n     an amendment from Sens. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) and Olympia \n     J. Snowe (R-Maine) that would allow the importation of \n     prescription drugs from other countries, a proposal that \n     supporters claim would let cut-rate pharmaceuticals flow into \n     the United States, saving ailing Americans untold amounts of \n     money. This is mirage; importation will not solve the problem \n     of drug pricing. U.S. drug firms sell prescription \n     medications to countries such as Canada at low prices, a \n     situation that would quickly change if Canadian distributors \n     started to recycle large quantities of drugs back to the \n     United States. Further, President Bush has threatened to veto \n     the bill if it contains such language. For the sake of common \n     sense, and to enhance the chances of urgently needed \n     legislation, the Senate should reject the importation \n     amendment before passing the bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, if I could ask the ranking member for a few \nminutes to speak about reimportation.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member.\n  I find it somewhat ironic that we are on the floor to discuss an \namendment to a drug safety bill which would allow drugs to be imported \nfreely from any country around the world. Maybe I am the only one who \nfinds some irony in that. We are constructing a mechanism in this \ncountry to set up a system of surveillance, to recognize red flags that \nmay suggest to us we need to look deeper into the unintended \nconsequences of drugs that have already been proven safe and effective; \nand we go even further than that and codify into law a very regimented \nprocess for the Food and Drug Administration to go through if, in fact, \nit is triggered that there might be a problem. Then, in the same bill, \nbecause of the outrage over the concerns we have for prescription \ndrugs, now we are going to say to the Chinese: continue to manufacture, \ncontinue to ship in, and these products may not even have an active \ningredient.\n  We adopted Senator Durbin's amendment that related to pet food safety \nstandards. Well, what this suggests to me is that for us to consider \nthe importation or reimportation of drugs is to say we put pet food \nabove the drug chain for the American people, that we are willing to \nput more standards on pet food today than we are on the importation of \nthese drugs.\n  Passage of the Medicare prescription Part D plan, which was a year \nago, lowered significantly the pressure that was felt to obtain drugs \nover the Internet or drugs from other countries. Why? Because in the \nfirst year, we have seen a 33-percent reduction in the price of those \npharmaceuticals for our Medicare-eligible population. It is not that \nall the pressure is off, but I am not sure the remaining pressure is \ngoing to be alleviated by providing a drug supply that has no active \ningredient or that denies consumers the security of knowing they are \ngoing home and they are taking their drugs but then they suffer the \nconsequences of ending up in an emergency room because they didn't get \nthe active ingredient they needed.\n  Last year, 1.7 million tablets of counterfeit Viagra were uncovered; \n1 million tablets of Lipitor that were, in fact, counterfeit; and a \nhalf a million tablets of Norvasc were seized in China.\n  What is unfortunate is China is not the only country in the world \nwhere we have created a cottage industry of producing drugs that look \njust like the ones we sell in a pharmacy but that we regulate at a gold \nstandard that many on this floor have tried to protect every time we \ndebate legislation that is about the Food and Drug Administration. We \nare here today to assure the American people that we are raising the \ngold standard--that it is not just the bar of where we determine safety \nand efficacy but we are raising the standard when the population at \nlarge is exposed to that medication to make sure that, in fact, \nunintended consequences are fully investigated. To accept the \nimportation of foreign drugs is to open the door for a cottage industry \ntoday to become a mega industry tomorrow by supplying counterfeit drugs \nwith no active ingredient, with the potential that there are \ningredients in it that are adulterated, that will not only not solve \nthe health problems but, as has been proven in the pet food supply, \ncould kill. Now, when people die, we put the standards higher than we \ndo the standards of reimportation or importation of drugs. I urge my \ncolleagues to at least accept the Cochran amendment which puts a safety \nstandard in, but do not pass this importation legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague is apparently going to win a \ndebate we are not having: that this is a bill that will allow the \nimport of prescription drugs from any country around the world. I don't \nknow of that piece of legislation, but if it exists, I will be happy to \nvote against it. That is not what this amendment is. This amendment \ndoesn't allow imported drugs from anywhere around the world at all. So \nI am not interested in losing a debate I am not involved in. This \ndebate is about a piece of legislation, carefully constructed, in which \nwe allow imported drugs from countries which have been judged to have a \nsafe supply of drugs.\n  Let me give an example of testimony from David Kessler. I would say \nif you could find an expert better on these subjects than David \nKessler, I would like to hear the name. He ran the FDA for 8 years and \nhas been identified by everybody as an outstanding FDA Commissioner. \nHere is what he says. The Dorgan-Snowe bill provides:\n\n       A sound framework for assuring that imported drugs are safe \n     and effective. Most notably, it provides additional resources \n     to the agency to run such a program, oversight by the FDA of \n     the chain of custody of imported drugs back to the FDA-\n     inspected plants, a mechanism to review imported drugs to \n     ensure that they meet FDA's approval standards, and the \n     registration and oversight of importers and exporters to \n     assure that imported drugs meet these standards and are not \n     counterfeit.\n\n  All of this discussion about counterfeit that is happening \ntoday, under today's rules, without importation. That is a specious \nissue. Dr. David Kessler says it provides a sound framework for \nassuring that imported drugs are safe and effective.\n\n  Let me show you a chart from Dr. Rost. I mentioned earlier that they \nhave been doing this for 20 years in Europe. Dr. Peter Rost, former \nvice president of marketing at Pfizer, said:\n\n       During my time responsible for a region in northern Europe, \n     I never once--not once--heard the drug industry, regulatory \n     agency,\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\n     the government, or anyone else saying that this practice was \n     unsafe--\n\n  He was talking about importation of prescription drugs. If you are in \nGermany and you want to bring a drug in from France, you can do it \nthrough what is called parallel trading. If you are in Spain and want \nto bring a drug in from Italy, you can do that. So he said not once has \nanybody raised the issue that this practice was unsafe.\n  He also said:\n\n       Personally, I think it is outright derogatory to claim that \n     Americans would not be able to handle reimportation of drugs, \n     when the rest of the educated world can do this.\n\n  That is the fact. One other thing: the Congressional Budget Office \nsays this amendment will save $50 billion in 10 years. The leading \nexpert says there is no safety issue. We have a regime in this bill \nthat provides for safety. So the question isn't on all of these \nancillary issues--by the way, the Washington Post doesn't take on this \nissue with respect to safety. It says there is, in fact, a problem with \ndrug pricing. I will read it. They don't want this passed, but the \nreason is they are worried it will undercut the underlying bill because \nthe President will veto it.\n  Here is what the President said when he was running in 2000. He was \nasked:\n\n       What about importing drugs?\n\n  The President said:\n\n       Well, if it is safe, then it makes sense.\n       Obviously, he was telling those at that debate that he \n     thinks it makes sense if it is safe. How about consulting Dr. \n     David Kessler, who says it is safe and effective, as we have \n     described it in this legislation. So what the Washington Post \n     says--because the President threatened to veto the bill--they \n     are talking about ``importation will not solve the problem of \n     drug pricing.''\n\n  Apparently, the Washington Post thinks there is a problem in drug \npricing. What is that problem? To respond to my colleague's comments, \nin the first quarter of 2007 we had the largest price increase in \nprescription drugs in this country in 6 years. The American Association \nof Retired Persons, AARP, said in 2006 the price of prescription drugs \nrose four times the rate of inflation. There is no problem? I think \nthere is a problem. The Washington Post says there is. The numbers show \nthere is a problem.\n  The question is, Are we going to solve the problem, or are we going \nto punt it down the road one more time?\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from North \nDakota for the extraordinary and comprehensive outline of this issue \nthat he has made not only today but in the past.\n  Mr. President, every single day in this Congress, and throughout \nAmerica, people sit down and eat their lettuce and tomato and their \nsalads. Their tomatoes come from Mexico, Latin America, and their \nlettuce comes from Latin America. Other foods they eat come from as far \naway as China. Billions of dollars of food imports come into this \ncountry, but I don't hear anybody in this body standing up and saying, \noh, we have a problem about food safety or food coming from other \ncountries. They come in.\n  There is a problem--and I don't hear it too often here, but somehow \nthe U.S. Government, with the FDA, cannot regulate a small number of \ndrug companies so that we can safely bring in prescription drugs from \nCanada and other industrialized countries so that, as a result, we can \nsubstantially lower the cost of medicine for millions and millions of \nAmericans. This is absurd. Of course, we can safely regulate the flow \nof medicine coming into this country.\n  The real issue is not the safety of medicine. The real issue is the \npower of the pharmaceutical industry, the most powerful industry in \nterms of lobbying impact in the United States of America. If you think \nthe oil companies are powerful, take a look at the drug companies. If \nyou think the banks are powerful, take a look at the drug companies. \nToday, we are living under a Medicare Part D prescription drug program \nthat was written by the drug companies, for the drug companies. Today, \nbillions of dollars of taxpayer money goes into research and \ndevelopment for new medicines that go to benefit the drug companies, \nwhile the American people do not get reasonable prices for the products \nthey help to produce.\n  Mr. President, since 1998, the pharmaceutical industry has spent over \n$900 million on lobbying activity--$900 million. That is more than any \nother industry. Today, there are over 1,200 prescription drug lobbyists \nright here on Capitol Hill and throughout this country. Do you know \nwhat their job is? Their job is to make sure in the United States of \nAmerica we continue to pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for \nthe medicine we use.\n  If you have a chronic illness, there is a strong likelihood you will \nbe paying two times as much for the same medicine as our friends in \nCanada or Europe pay. Why is it that the same medicine, manufactured in \nthe same factory, costs us, in some cases two times, and in some cases \nthree times, as much money as it costs our Canadian and European \nfriends?\n  The answer is pretty simple. It has everything to do with the power \nof the pharmaceutical industry and the enormous amounts of money they \nspend on lobbying, on campaign contributions, on advertising, and the \npressure they put on Members of the United States Congress.\n  Mr. President, I have been involved in this issue for a number of \nyears. I have been involved in it in an emotional way because I was the \nfirst Member of Congress to take constituents over the Canadian border \nto purchase, in that case Tamoxifen, which is a widely prescribed \nbreast cancer drug that ended up costing Vermont women one-tenth the \nprice they had to pay in the United States.\n\n  In our country today, there are people struggling very hard with \nterrible illnesses who have no health insurance and who need their \nprescription drugs. Some of them simply cannot purchase their \nprescription drugs. Some are taking money out of their food budget to \nbuy their prescription drugs. We are a great nation in many respects. \nBut the time is long overdue for Members of the Senate, for Members of \nthe House, to reclaim this institution from the powerful special \ninterests.\n  Today is a day of reckoning. This is very important legislation. This \ncan drive the price of prescription drugs down by 25 to 50 percent. \nLet's stand together and, for those Members who are wavering on the \nissue, who think they cannot vote for it, I hope at least they will \nsupport cloture to allow us to continue this debate and to finally \nlower the cost of prescription drugs for the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 10 minutes. The \nSenator from North Dakota has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to oppose cloture on the amendment. I \nfind it ironic that in the midst of the work on the biggest drug safety \nreform in the last decade, perhaps longer than that, we are even \nconsidering the issue of drug importation.\n  Our drug safety bill is an acknowledgment that we don't have things \nquite right in our domestic drug safety system. I am baffled that we \nwant to take on all the hard work and effort to fix our drug safety \nproblems and throw it away by opening our borders to foreign drugs.\n  When I was Chairman of the HELP Committee, we held three hearings on \ndrug importation. The witnesses at the hearings raised a number of \nproblems and questions about importation in general, and this bill in \nparticular. In fact, one of those hearings was entirely about this \nbill. At that time, I asked my colleague from North Dakota if he would \nwork with me to develop a State-based pilot program for drug \nimportation. He turned me down. He was convinced then, as he is now, \nthat this bill is the way to go. I would like to take these kinds of \nproposals in small chunks, if we are going to have to take them, to \nensure we don't create a large-scale disaster. I hope we are not going \nto create a disaster here by accepting this amendment without further \nconsideration.\n  I respectfully suggest that this bill is not the way to go, and even \nif it were, this isn't the time for it to go there. We have heard a lot \nof comments about the Washington Post editorial, and I refer people to \nthat editorial. They\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\ncover a number of factors, but they do emphasize that the main bill, \nthe safety bill--the FDA safety reform bill that we are working on--is \na very important bill. They do recognize this amendment would add some \nvery strong complications to it. The Senator from North Dakota suggests \nwe read the bill. You know, that is a good suggestion for anything we \ncover around here. I make an effort to read all of the bills we do, and \nI have read this one. I hope everybody takes a look at this one.\n  I think you will vote against cloture if you read the bill. It is a \nroadmap to loopholes. Yes, every time somebody brings up a potential \nsafety issue, they stick another clause in there that might cover that \ngap. But it shows where the gaps are most likely. They keep adding \nparagraphs to try to patch up these loopholes. We have an amendment \nthat would have been a second degree, but it was too late for it to be \nsubmitted as a second degree, so it is a first-degree amendment that \nwould deal with anti-counterfeiting.\n  That is another area that has to be looked at carefully. The Senator \nfrom Vermont talks about taking people into Canada to buy drugs. Well, \nyou know they are going to the exact pharmacy at that point. They are \nnot going through the Internet or through the telephone. These drugs \ncan be intercepted--there are false sites that are set up out there, \nand people may think they are getting drugs from Canada, but are \nactually getting them from Saudi Arabia and other places around the \nworld. It is so easy to get information and believe it is coming from a \nparticular location--they may even imply it is a particular location to \nget the consumer's confidence. There are so many ways they can mislead \nconsumers and it may not be that location. To try to solve some of \nthat, Senator Gregg has an amendment that would perhaps tighten up the \nInternet problems. But look at that, too, and you will see there are \nproblems if you are not getting it directly from the pharmacy.\n  I am a strong supporter of people getting drugs from their local \npharmacist, the one who will help you interpret all of the sheets of \npaper that come with the prescription. They are going to know what \nother drugs you are taking and if there are possible interactions. \nLocal pharmacists are the most valuable asset we have in the entire \npharmaceutical chain. But bills like this work against them and may \nhave consequently put them out of business. That is going to be a \ntragedy for America.\n  I have read the amendment. I encourage people to read it and look at \nthe complexity of the amendment and look at the loopholes they are \nsuggesting they have fixed. See if you think this patchwork fixed them. \nBut I also ask that you look at what the Washington Post said, and I am \nnot one of those who normally advocates that you listen to what they \nsay. But it is definitely food for thought on this bill. It will take \naway a major reform that we could have by throwing something else in \nthat we need to discuss more.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose cloture for the sake of the safety of \nour drug supply. Let's get it fixed at home before we try to open it up \nto the world.\n  Mr. President, how much of my time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, in order to allow the Senator from North \nDakota to have the final word, since it is his amendment, I ask people \nto vote against cloture.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming. I \nregret he cannot be a supporter of cloture and the amendment. I respect \nand understand his position. We disagree, and I do so respectfully.\n  I do wish to mention one thing with respect to a pilot program. \nFollowing that hearing, I did put together a pilot project and went to \nTommy Thompson. I went down to his office and made a presentation of a \nnorthern plains pilot project on prescription drugs. He felt like he \ncouldn't move forward with it.\n  I do want to say what he said to me after he left Health and Human \nServices. I met him in the elevator outside the Senate Chamber one day \nafter he left being Secretary. I badgered him a lot about the issue of \nreimportation. As I got off the elevator and he was getting on, we \ngreeted each other. I liked him. I thought he was a good Health and \nHuman Services Secretary. He said: By the way, Byron, you keep working \non the imported drug issue. You are right about that. That was after he \nleft Health and Human Services.\n  Let me again respond with respect to David Kessler. All this talk \nabout safety. First of all, this is where this amendment belongs, on \nthis bill. This improves the bill. It doesn't detract from safety \nissues at all. It does address something not addressed in this bill, \nand that is a serious pricing problem with prescription drugs in our \ncountry.\n  There is no answer to this that I have heard in all the discussion. \nDavid Kessler, head of FDA for 8 years--I think he is the expert on \nthese issues--said: The Dorgan-Snowe bill ``provides a sound framework \nfor assuring that imported drugs are safe and effective.''\n  He says they will be safe and effective. Why would someone go to some \nfraudulent Web site, as was discussed, or maybe go to a bad Web site, \nwhy would somebody go to a bad Web site in order to import prescription \ndrugs if a Web site by the FDA exists that would describe where they \ncan access these prescription drugs safely? Those are specious \narguments.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says this amendment will save $50 \nbillion over 10 years. Why would they say that? Precisely because the \nWashington Post acknowledges there is a pricing problem with \nprescription drugs in our country. There will be a $50 billion savings \nover 10 years.\n  I mentioned that in the first quarter of this year the price of \nprescription drugs had the largest increase in 6 years in this country. \nLast year, 2006, according to AARP, it rose four times the rate of \ninflation.\n  There is a pricing problem with prescription drugs. The identical \ndrug FDA approved, same pill, put in the same bottle, made by the same \ncompany, is sent virtually every other place in the world at a lower \nprice, and the American consumer is told: You know what, we have a \nspecial deal for you. You get to pay the highest price in the world.\n  The question is whether this Congress will decide that special deal \nof the highest price in the world ought to stop. I hope this Congress \nwill decide we are going to stand with the consumers. Yes, we are going \nto insist on safety, but we are going to stand with consumers. There is \na pricing problem. This amendment is one way to fix that problem in a \nmanner that is safe and effective.\n  Finally, Mr. Rost says that for 20 years, they did this in Europe. He \nsaid:\n\n       I think it is outright derogatory to claim that Americans \n     would not be able to handle reimportation of drugs, when the \n     rest of the educated world can do this.\n\n  Of course, we can do this. Of course, we can allow someone to go to \nCanada and buy from a Canadian drugstore that has as safe a chain of \ncustody as we do and buy prescription drugs, in this case Lipitor, for \nhalf the price that is being charged 5 miles south across the border.\n  Why on Earth should the global economy not be able to work for \naverage folks? The pharmaceutical industry imports all of these drugs. \nWhy should the average person in this country not be able to put \ndownward pressure on prescription drug prices by being able to access \nFDA-approved drugs from other countries, such as Canada and other \ncountries, that have a supply of safe drugs. That is what our amendment \ndoes. It is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Then I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 63, the \nnays are 28. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1010\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. It is to \nS. 1082. I propose this amendment in my behalf and in behalf of \nSenators Carper, Nelson of Nebraska, Hatch, Bennett, Enzi, Burr, and \nMenendez. I ask the amendment be stated or reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator is already \npending. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nrequire, before importation can be undertaken, a certification by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services or the Food and Drug \nAdministration that the importation of the drugs will indeed have an \neconomic benefit to the consumers who buy those drugs and that they are \nsafe and not harmful for human consumption.\n  We have had discussions over the last several years, really, with \nadministration officials who have been very concerned that the \nimportation of drugs that would be permitted by the Dorgan amendment \nneeds to be balanced by the interest we have in protecting the \nintegrity of the marketplace so no counterfeit drugs are imported, \ncreating the impression that they are something that they are not.\n  This is a very real problem. I recall having meetings here in the \nSenate with members of the committees with jurisdiction, learning about \nthe growing problem and the continuing increase in instances where \npostal inspectors and others who are charged with the responsibility of \nenforcing our laws and protecting American consumers are finding that \ndrugs which are manufactured in other countries--not Canada necessarily \nbut in India, in Asia, in South America--are counterfeit. They look \nlike the real thing. The labels look like the legitimate and ordinary \nlabels you see on the drugs being purchased, but they are not what they \nsay they are.\n  This is a very difficult issue to deal with. What we are asking in \nthis amendment is that the Senate insist that if drugs are going to be \nimported, then there has to be a certification by the FDA or the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services that they are safe for human \nconsumption, that they have not been tampered with, and that they are \nnot counterfeit.\n  I hope the Senate will approve this amendment to the Dorgan \namendment. I don't know of anything else to say. I submitted, in \nearlier comments, a washingtonpost.com article, which is printed in the \nRecord now, which supports this effort and talks about the importance \nof certification to the consuming public. We have a lot of information. \nWe will be happy to discuss the details with any Senator who is \nundecided about approving this amendment, but I hope the Senate can \nadopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 991\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment so I may call up my amendment, amendment No. 991, and \nI ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ENZI. There is still a lot of work being done on this amendment. \nSenator Kyl and others are involved in it and would not want the debate \nuntil we had more chance to work on it.\n  Mr. KOHL. I will offer the amendment after that.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak to amendment No. 991, which is \nsupported by Senators Grassley and Leahy. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir support. Our amendment is in almost all respects identical to S. \n316, the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, which passed the \nJudiciary Committee unanimously earlier this year.\n  Our amendment will prevent one of the most egregious tactics used to \nkeep generic competitors off the market, leaving consumers with \nunnecessarily high drug prices. The way it is done is simple--a drug \ncompany that holds a patent on a brandname drug pays a generic \ndrugmaker to not put a competing product on the market. The brandname \ncompany profits so much by delaying competition that it can easily \nafford to pay off the generic company. And the generic company can also \nmake much more money by simply accepting this pay-off settlement. The \nlosers are the American people, who would continue to pay unnecessarily \nhigh drug prices for years to come.\n  Our amendment is basically very simple--it will make these \nanticompetitive, anticonsumer patent payoffs illegal. We will thereby \nend a practice seriously impeding generic drug competition, competition \nthat could save consumers literally billions of dollars in health care \ncosts.\n  Despite the FTC's opposition, recent court decisions have permitted \nthese backroom payoffs. And the effect of these court decisions has \nbeen stark. In the year after these two decisions, the FTC has found, \nhalf of all patent settlements--14 of 28--involved payments from the \nbrandname to the generic manufacturer in return for an agreement by the \ngeneric to keep its drug off the market. In the year before these two \ncourt decisions, not a single patent\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\nsettlement reported to the FTC contained such an agreement.\n  When brandname drugs lose their patent monopoly, this opens the door \nfor consumers, employers, third-party payers, and other purchasers to \nsave billions--63 percent on average--by using generic versions of \nthese drugs. A recent study released earlier this year by \nPharmaceutical Care Management Association, showed that health plans \nand consumers could save $26.4 billion over the next 5 years by using \nthe generic versions of 14 popular drugs that are scheduled to lose \ntheir patent protections before 2010.\n  We have heard from some in the generic drug industry that on occasion \nthese patent settlements may not harm competition. That is why our \namendment includes a new provision not contained in S. 316. This new \nprovision would permit the Federal Trade Commission--the guardians of \ncompetition in this industry--to exempt from this amendment's ban \ncertain agreements if the FTC determines such agreements would benefit \nconsumers. This provision will ensure that our amendment does not \nprevent any agreements which will truly benefit consumers.\n  It is also important to note that--contrary to the arguments made by \nsome--our amendment will not ban all patent settlements. In fact, our \namendment will not ban any settlement which does not involve an \nexchange of money. Our amendment will do nothing to prevent parties \nfrom settling patent litigation with an agreement that a generic will \ndelay entry for some period of time in return for ending its challenge \nto the validity of the patent. Only the egregious pay-off settlements \nin which the brandname company also pays the generic company a sum of \nmoney to do so will be banned.\n  We understand that several of our colleagues would prefer alternative \nversions of this proposal. As I have said all along, we continue to be \nwilling to consider modifications to this measure as long as this \nlegislation will be effective to ensure these anticonsumer payoff \nsettlements stop. I am happy to work with my colleagues to find an \neffective manner to do this. I have directed my staff to work with the \nstaff of other interested Senators in this regard, and I am willing to \ncontinue to engage in this process. Short of such an effective \nalternative being presented to me, we will ask for a vote on adoption \nof this amendment.\n  In closing, we cannot profess to care about the high cost of \nprescription drugs while turning a blind eye to anticompetitive \nbackroom deals between brand and generic drug companies. It is time to \nstop these drug company pay-offs that only serve the companies involved \nand deny consumers to affordable generic drugs. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in this effort by supporting this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Kohl amendment seeks to end abuse of \nthe system for bringing generic drugs to the market. Under Hatch-\nWaxman, there is a sensible and balanced system for rewarding generic \ndrug makers who enter the market first, but some companies have \nsubverted this balanced system.\n  Instead of allowing market forces to bring medicines to consumers at \nlower prices, companies collude to deny consumers the benefit of the \nlower cost drugs through ``reverse payments.'' Essentially, there is a \npayoff from the brand drug companies to the generic companies to split \nthe benefits of the incentives provided under Hatch-Waxman.\n  Everyone benefits under these arrangements, except consumers. Brand \ndrug companies get further protection from competition, generics get \npayoffs and a guaranteed market. Only consumers get left behind, stuck \nwith high prices and lesser competition.\n  The Judiciary Committee reported legislation on this important issue. \nI commend Senator Kohl for his leadership. I know Senator Specter and \nSenator Hatch have important recommendations. I am sure we can work \nthese matters out in a proposal to include the best ideas.\n  We understand there are members of the Judiciary Committee who may \nwant to speak to this amendment. I would hope the Senator would \nwithhold further comments until we can see if there are members of the \nJudiciary Committee who want to address this amendment. I hope we will \nbe able to include it and adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Domenici, be added as a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modified version of \namendment No. 1001 to the desk. We are adding Senator Kohl, Senator \nHatch, and Senator Coburn as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as was indicated earlier, the Cochran \namendment, with cosponsors, is currently pending, I believe, or has \nbeen appropriately offered and is pending. I would like to make a \ncouple of comments about the vote we will have at some point in the \nfuture on the Cochran amendment. And what I would like to do is go \nthrough so that all of our colleagues understand what is in the \nunderlying bill.\n  I indicated earlier that one of my colleagues stood up and said the \nlegislation we had offered would allow drug importation from any \ncountry in the world, and that is not true. There is no such debate on \na bill that doesn't exist.\n  Mr. President, I have a piece of information distributed by Pfizer \nCorporation that is opposed to my amendment. It describes various \nproblems with the drugs that are purchased online and counterfeit \ndrugs, and so on. Interestingly enough, all of these problems would be \nsolved by the legislation I have introduced with all of the safety \nissues involved. You know these are specious issues because the \nunderlying legislation would address all of those issues.\n  Now, let me go through a list--this is the list; you won't be able to \nread it, but I will go through them--of the safety provisions in this \nlegislation. First of all, with imported drugs, drugs imported from \nother countries, which, as I have indicated, Europe has done for 20 \nyears with no safety issues at all, so we are as competent as the \nEuropeans are in being able to do this.\n  Our bill would require that all imported drugs be approved by the \nFood and Drug Administration. So we are not talking about any renegade \ndrugs, all FDA-approved drugs, all of them imported be approved by the \nFDA.\n  It creates a process to approve medications sold outside the United \nStates which are identical to FDA-approved products. It sets a process \nby which the FDA may approve medications which differ from the domestic \nversion of the drug; provides that no imported drug may be misbranded \nor adulterated, and requires compliance with GMP. It requires the FDA \nto enter into agreements to monitor drug recalls and approval status \nchanges; establishes a set of standards which countries must meet to be \na ``permitted'' country. With respect to pharmacies and wholesalers on \nthis list, we say it provides for registration and regulation of \nexporting pharmacies and importing wholesalers, only by licensed \noperators in both cases; requires registrants to pay an application \nfee, submit to evaluation, and post a substantial bond; requires \npharmacists and wholesalers to be fully compliant with applicable \nlocal, State, provincial, and national laws; requires the FDA to \nperform inspections of operations, including facilities and records, at \nleast 12 times per year; requires exporting pharmacies to verify \nprescriptions, to review medications for interactions, to ensure \nprivacy; requires pharmacies to maintain records for 2 years for FDA \nreview.\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\n  Exporting pharmacies must preserve samples of each lot of a drug for \nthe FDA to utilize for testing. It gives authority to FDA to monitor \nand inspect the full chain of custody of a drug; sets penalties for \nviolation, including suspension, lifetime revocation, and criminal \npenalties. It requires every imported drug to have a full record of the \nchain of custody, which is a pedigree. That is very important. Every \nimported drug will have to have a pedigree, full record of the chain of \ncustody.\n\n  It requires every package to have an FDA-approved label affixed, and \nevery product must clearly be identified as ``imported.'' Drug labeling \nwould also include the name of the registrant who handled the \nmedication and the product lot number as a part of that pedigree. Any \ndifferences in the imported drug, even in an inert ingredient, must be \nnoted on the label.\n  It requires packaging to include anticounterfeiting or track-and-\ntrace technologies. Exporters must provide the FDA with prior notice of \nshipments of prescription drugs to the U.S. importing wholesalers.\n  It provides, for the first sale of a drug, it may not be shipped \noutside of the permitted countries. It requires the FDA to provide \ninformation to consumers to identify the safe and legal directed \nsources of approved imports. It gives Customs Service the authority to \nseize and destroy any unauthorized shipments; blocking elicit \nelectronic payments to unauthorized foreign pharmacies by Customs; full \nfunding for FDA to facilitate the drug import regulatory operations \nthrough a 2\\1/2\\-percent user fee.\n  It provides implementation of drug pedigrees for domestic medications \nby 2010, which do not exist now, by the way; requires the packaging of \nall prescription drugs to incorporate a standardized numerical \nidentifier unique to each package of a drug and counterfeit resistant \ntechnologies.\n  When one reads through these safety features and then alleges that \nthis is unsafe, I mean it just--it baffles me how one can reach that \nconclusion.\n  Tommy Thompson, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said: In \norder to import drugs from any country, and especially Canada, I have \nto certify that all of those drugs are safe. That is an impossible \nthing. If Congress wants to import drugs, they should take out that \nprovision.\n  Well, let me ask this question: Would it be possible for the Health \nand Human Services Secretary to certify that all drugs sold in this \ncountry, FDA-approved drugs, are safe? Does one think the HHS Secretary \ncould certify that? The answer is, no, of course not.\n  I can give you examples of metal traces and things in pharmaceuticals \nthat were sold in this country, FDA-approved, by major manufacturers. \nCould a Health and Human Services Secretary certify that the existing \ndrug supply is ``safe,'' possess no ``risk''? They can't do that for \npet food. They could not do that for lettuce. They could not do it for \ncarrots. They could not do it for celery. They could not do it for \nimported vegetables. They can't do it for imported meats. They can't do \nit for domestic production to say, there is no risk.\n  The issue of requiring certification is an attempt to kill the \nlegislation. It is perfectly appropriate for some to say: The current \nsystem works fine, don't change it. I don't quarrel with that. I don't \nagree with it, but I respect those who hold that view. But I do believe \nit is hard for anyone to, with great merit, make the case that with \nwhat we have done in this legislation, on a bipartisan basis, it still \nrenders this to be an unsafe process.\n  The experience in Europe, of course, undermines that argument. They \nhave done it for 20 years. It has been perfectly safe. Also, let me go \nback to David Kessler's statement. I don't know of an FDA Commissioner \nwho comes to his belt buckle, let alone his shoulders in terms of \ncapability.\n  I thought David Kessler had been an extraordinary FDA Commissioner \nback for 8 years. I worked with him when he was there. He said this: \nThe Dorgan-Snowe bill ``provides a sound framework for assuring that \nimported drugs are safe and effective.''\n  Now, we can talk all day about these drugs being unsafe, but, \nobviously, that does not change the facts. It does not change Dr. \nKessler's opinion. It does not change the circumstances of the safety \nprovisions we put in the bill. They are there. They are there for a \nvery specific reason. We took the interests and concerns of Secretary \nShalala and Secretary Thompson. We wrote them into this bill dealing \nwith safety provisions.\n  The fact is, this bill will make our domestic supply of prescription \ndrugs safer. That is the plain fact. Then we will have a pedigree for \nall prescription drugs, imported or domestic. That is just a fact.\n  Now, the second part of the amendment says it has to be assured that \nit will save money and pose no risk. Well, ``save money,'' that is \neasy. The Congressional Budget Office has said it is going to save $50 \nbillion in 10 years. And $6.1 billion--I thought it was 5--$6.1 billion \nof that is savings to the Federal Government.\n  We just have a new estimate by the Congressional Budget Office that \nif the Cochran amendment is passed, that savings goes to zero. Why? It \nundermines the bill. It means this will not have impact. Importing \nwon't happen. Not because anyone wants to import an unsafe drug \nbecause, in fact, the safety provisions we have included will make this \nsupply, the drug supply, domestic supply included, as well as imported \ndrugs, safer. That is the point.\n\n  This issue is not horribly complicated. The question is, should the \nAmerican people have the ability in this global economy to access a \ndrug that has been produced, in many cases by an American company, with \nresearch in many cases paid for by American taxpayers, produced in many \ncases in a plant here in the United States, and then sent to another \ncountry at a much lower price? Should the American consumers be able to \naccess that FDA-approved drug that is sold for a lower price elsewhere? \nStated another way, should American consumers continue to accept the \nnotion that they should pay the highest prices in the world?\n  Some say: There is not a problem here. They cite the Washington Post \neditorial today. That editorial says there is a problem with respect to \ndrug pricing. The first 3 months of this year saw the highest price \nincreases on prescription drugs in the last 6 years. In 2006, it was \nsix times the rate of inflation, the price increase in prescription \ndrugs. In addition, we pay the highest prices of all the other \ncountries. Does that make sense? It doesn't to me.\n  I want to have somebody stand up on the other side of this issue and \nsay: I disagree; I think the American people should pay the higher \nprices; I think that is fair.\n  That is the alternative, it seems, because that is the reality. I am \nnot interested in debating some fiction. The reality is this: We pay \nprices that I believe are wrong. I said yesterday, I don't come here \nwith any disrespect for the pharmaceutical industry. I have met many of \nthese people. I know the head of PhRMA, former Congressman Billy \nTauzin. I used to serve with him. I like him. I don't come here \ndisrespecting the industry. They do important work. I have a profound \ndisagreement with their pricing policies because they are unfair to \nconsumers in this country. That is my difference and my beef. Their \npricing policies are wrong.\n  Why should an 80-year-old woman have to go to Canada every 3 months \nas she is fighting breast cancer in order to buy Tamoxifen at a price \nshe can afford? Why should you be able to cross an imaginary line into \nCanada and discover that you could pay one-fifth the price you have to \npay for Tamoxifen in this country? The pricing policy is wrong, and we \nought to fix it. This is an approach that will fix it.\n  We will have other debate. I do not disrespect the pharmaceutical \nindustry. I have great respect for what they do. I have a profound \ndisagreement about their pricing policy. I don't disrespect those who \nhave a profound disagreement with my amendment. I respectfully think \nthey are wrong.\n  In the end, the question for the Congress is, do you think what is \nhappening with respect to drug pricing is appropriate? My answer is no. \nThe American people are being disserved by a pricing policy that the \npharmaceutical industry can make stick. They have the capability to \ncontrol prices. They do it behind a law that says the\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\nonly interest that is able to import prescription drugs is the \nmanufacturer of that drug. Europe doesn't require that. Europe hasn't \nrequired that for a long while. They allow parallel trading so the \nconsumer can take advantage of price shopping among the countries of \nEurope. Only this country has decided, no, the consumer doesn't have \nthis right. The manufacturer has the right but not the consumer.\n  I say let's let the consumer, let's let the American people have \naccess to the benefits of the global economy as well. Yes, let's make \nit safe. We have done that. This legislation with the safety \nprecautions I have described in some detail, if passed, this amendment, \nif passed, would significantly improve the safety of the domestic drug \nsupply and significantly improve safety of the reimportation that now \noccurs on an occasional basis by people driving back and forth across \nthe border, those who are fortunate enough to live near a border.\n  We have just gotten a Congressional Budget Office score on the \namendment I have offered. It says the amendment, if passed, will save \nthe Federal Government $10.6 billion in a 10-year period. I believe it \nis a $50 billion savings in total for consumers. I will put in the \nCongressional Record the specifics. But I do know the Congressional \nBudget Office has just scored this amendment. It will save consumers \ntens of billions of dollars. The specific savings to the Federal \nGovernment itself, as a result of savings through our programs and \nexpenditures, will be $10.6 billion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, I will \nseek to define in more specific terms exactly what the Dorgan-Snowe \nprescription drug amendment does.\n  Before proceeding to that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, be added as a cosponsor to amendment \nNo. 1010.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Dorgan-Snowe bill, pending before the \nSenate as an amendment, eliminates language from the Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act that allows importation to take effect only if the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services can demonstrate to Congress that \nit will pose no additional risk to the public health and result in a \nsignificant reduction in the cost of covered products to the American \nconsumer.\n  The amendment I have offered to the Dorgan-Snowe bill would restore \nthis language. The Senate has overwhelmingly voted on three occasions \nto include a safety and savings certification provision in prescription \ndrug importation legislation for the purpose of protecting the public \nhealth. Following passage of the safety and savings certification \nrequirement, no Secretary of HHS, Democrat or Republican, has been able \nto demonstrate that importation is safe or will lead to cost savings. \nBoth Secretary Shalala in the Clinton administration and Secretary \nThompson in the Bush administration could not demonstrate that \nimportation poses no additional risk to public health or would lead to \nsignificant cost savings.\n  Back in 2000, Secretary Shalala concluded it was ``impossible . . . \nto demonstrate that it [importation] is safe and cost effective.''\n\n  Secretary Thompson reached a similar conclusion in the next year, \n2001, by saying he could not ``sacrifice public safety for uncertain \nand speculative cost savings.''\n  The Dorgan-Snowe bill contains numerous provisions that would expose \nAmericans to harmful or adulterated imported drugs--could expose. In \nparticular, the bill permits the importation of drugs that originate in \nsuch countries as Latvia, Estonia, Slovakia, Greece, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic. These are outside the control of the manufacturers and \noutside of the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration.\n  The bill also permits the importation of drugs that are not FDA \napproved and are not equivalent to FDA-approved products. Some of the \ndrugs that could be imported under this provision would violate Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act requirements against adulteration and \nmisbranding.\n  Canadian law has been discussed here. It permits the transshipment of \nunapproved prescription drugs from any country in the world through its \nborders to the United States. These shipments move across borders, free \nfrom examination from Canadian regulators who have said their \nGovernment will not ensure the safety and effectiveness of exported \ndrugs. The FDA and Customs officials have seized counterfeit drugs \nentering the United States from alleged Canadian pharmacies that are \nestablished for the purpose of permitting transshipments from other \ncountries outside of Canada into the United States. These places where \nthe drugs have originated include countries such as India, Pakistan, \nChina, and Thailand.\n  If my amendment is not adopted, the underlying bill, as amended by \nthe amendment of the Senator from North Dakota, would permit \ntransshipment and severely restrict the ability of border officials to \nstop suspected drug shipments entering the United States. My amendment \nwould not allow importation to begin unless these safety concerns are \nresolved and the Government can assure the American public that \nimported drugs will not endanger their health.\n  There is no guarantee that American consumers will experience \nreductions in their prescription drug costs if the Dorgan bill takes \neffect, because middlemen have shown they may keep the savings. The \namendment I have offered ensures that consumers would benefit from \nimportation before weakening consumer protections against potentially \nunsafe drugs.\n  In conclusion, the Dorgan bill requires the FDA to allow importation \nfrom Canada within 90 days of enactment, whether the FDA has had time \nto set up an appropriate regulatory framework or not.\n  In addition, the bill places an arbitrary cap on user fees collected \nto oversee the importation system. My amendment would ensure that an \nimportation program would take effect only after a regulatory system \nhas been put in place to protect American consumers.\n  I hope the Senate will approve my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I won't speak at length. I do want to make one point. The \nSenator from Mississippi indicated the amendment I have offered would \nallow for the reimportation of drugs that are not FDA approved. I don't \nknow where that information comes from, but it is demonstrably untrue. \nI don't want there to be a mistaken impression on that. I ask my \ncolleague from Mississippi if we could at least resolve that issue. The \nintent of this, the written version of this, is very clear. No drug \nwill be imported into this country unless it is FDA approved. My \ncolleague indicated this amendment would allow drugs to come in that \nare not approved. I don't know where that information comes from. If he \nand I could at least exchange information so that we resolve that, I \nwould appreciate that.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am advised \nthat the FDA has said it could not put a regulatory framework in effect \nto guarantee what my amendment insists it should guarantee; that is, \nthe effectiveness of the drug, the fact that there will likely be \nsavings that will result for American consumers if the Dorgan amendment \nis adopted.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that is a different issue. The amendment \nitself, whether there is a regulatory framework or not, will not allow \na drug to be imported that is not FDA approved. That is the written \nprovision in the amendment itself.\n  Second, with respect to cost, we may have a disagreement on that, but \nI again observe that the Congressional Budget Office this morning has \ngiven us another score, and the score from the Congressional Budget \nOffice says this will save the Federal Government $10.6 billion in a \n10-year period. I believe the global savings--the rest would be for \nconsumers--is slightly over $50 billion in 10 years. So it seems to me \nit is self-evident. If the Congressional Budget Office is putting out \ninformation to the Senate this morning that describes the amount of \nsavings, in this case averaging about $5 billion a year,\n\n[[Page S5536]]\n\nit is quite clear, someone is going to save something somewhere. I \nthink we also can resolve the cost issue at some point down the road.\n  Let me say, I respect the Senator from Mississippi. He is a very \nworthy legislator, cares passionately about the things he works on. I \ndo the same. I think the way to resolve this is to talk through what \nare the safety provisions in the bill. If they are inadequate, \ndemonstrably inaccurate, I will accept that we would make some changes. \nBut I do not believe that is the case. I do not believe it has been \ndemonstrated.\n\n  As I have indicated previously, Dr. David Kessler, who ran FDA for 8 \nyears, says this bill provides a sound framework for assuring that \nimported drugs are safe and effective. I understand the pharmaceutical \nindustry does not say that. I understand some others do not believe \nthat. I understand and respect that. But I also believe, very strongly, \nthat the evidence is overwhelming. We have added the safety provisions \nthat were raised by Secretary Shalala. We have added the provisions \nraised by Secretary Thompson.\n  I believe--and 33 of my colleagues in this Chamber, Republicans and \nDemocrats, believe--we have done a very good job in resolving those \nissues. This issue almost has a gray beard. It has been around a long \ntime. We have been trying a long time. It is hard to win on this issue. \nI accept that, and I understand it. But I am hoping that perhaps this \nis the year in which we might give the American consumer an opportunity \nto be able to participate in the global marketplace in a safe and \neffective way, just as the Europeans do, and be able to access a lower \nprice of FDA-approved drugs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague that this issue \nhas been around for a long time. One of the reasons we continue to \ndebate it is because we continue to have real-life examples of a \nproduct that comes in that is adulterated. I am not sure we have done \nanything to eliminate the ability to counterfeit, other than to confuse \nit even more, because, in fact, today we basically say it is almost \nimpossible, unless you are an individual crossing the border, to bring \nin drugs from another country.\n  We are challenged at Customs today with immigration. Oh, we are just \nas challenged at Customs today on the shipment of pharmaceutical \nproducts that come into this country from abroad. It is not held to a \nsingle country.\n  I do not believe the reason we embrace this bill is because the \nEuropeans do it. There are a lot of things the Europeans do today that \nI would not necessarily suggest are right for America. As a matter of \nfact, we have some international treaties that suggest we should \nharmonize our drug standards with the European Union. What we found \nwas, for the European Union, with 22 members, they accept whichever \ncountry the application was applied for. If that country approves it, \nthen it is good for the EU. If you look at some of the standards \nthroughout the 22 countries, it would be dismantling the gold standard \nof the FDA.\n  So for those who suggest what we would do in this amendment maintains \nour gold standard, it would not happen. The reality is, as you accept \nwhat they do--which does not come close to the gold standard of the FDA \nfor safety and efficacy--over time it would bring further deterioration \nto the confidence of our drug supply. When every American goes to their \nlocal pharmacy and they have their prescription that is written by a \ndoctor, they go in with 100 percent confidence of knowing there is an \nactive ingredient in it, that it is not adulterated, that their health \nis not going to be affected adversely when they take it.\n  We are on the floor today. This is part of the drug safety bill. Why? \nBecause in some cases when products are approved and given to a much \nlarger population, that larger population experiences different side \neffects because every person is genetically different. There are no two \nalike, unless we change the cloning laws in this country. The reality \nis, I do not think we are going to do that, so we do not have it to \nworry about. But we are here trying to strengthen the safety of the \nproduct. We currently can maintain the chain of custody because it is \nmanufactured, it is distributed, and every product has a case lot \nnumber.\n  What have we experienced with counterfeit drugs? They have been able \nto make a pill look identical to the pills we go to the pharmacy and \nbuy--identical in not just the pill but the packaging. As we shift \npackaging, so do those who are trying to game the system. The reality \nis, the person who is on the receiving end--and I sympathize with \nexactly what the Senator from North Dakota has claimed; that in many \ncases, pharmaceuticals are not affordable for some people. That is why \nwe created Part D Medicare. That is why over 30 million Americans who \nare Medicare eligible now have coverage--coverage that has brought down \nthe price of pharmaceuticals 33 percent in the first year.\n  For any other area for which we would propose legislation, if we saw \na trend like this, we would be embracing the fix we put in. But no, we \nare going to delude it even further and confuse seniors across the \ncountry and say: Now just go on the Internet and buy it because we have \nsaid it can only come in if it is an FDA-approved product. Well, FDA-\napproved products are the only things we write prescriptions for in the \ncountry. The reality is, the only counterfeit product that \ncounterfeiters are making are FDA look-alikes.\n  There is nothing in the Dorgan bill that says somebody cannot \ncounterfeit anymore. There is nothing in the bill that says if we do \nnot catch it at Dulles Airport when it flies in and test it immediately \nto find there is no active ingredient, we have not put somebody's life \nin danger. There is no assurance in this bill that if there is an \nadulteration of some kind that affects somebody's health--in the host \nof millions of pills that come in, if we do not catch it, there is \nsomebody on the receiving end who is going to be adversely affected \nhealth-wise.\n  So I appreciate the fact that everybody wants cheaper drugs. We all \ndo. But there is a reality about the United States of America: We \nprotect intellectual property; therefore, we attract companies. And it \nis not just limited to pharmaceuticals. I guess the next thing we are \ngoing to do is claim Microsoft software is too expensive, so we are now \ngoing to allow that to come in from somewhere else. Well, we protect \nhandbags. We protect clothing. We protect the copyrights, the \nintellectual property. There is even more of a reason to do it in \npharmaceuticals. It is because there is a safety component.\n  I think when many people think they might be buying a counterfeit \nhandbag--if they buy it on the streets of this town or some other \ntown--they probably think: Well, if I get a year's use out of it, based \non the price, that is OK. I do not think you can apply the same \nstandard to pharmaceuticals. If it does not have the active ingredient, \nsomebody might die. In fact, we beefed up, in the drug safety bill, dog \nfood higher than what this importation provides for our pharmaceutical \nsupply in this country.\n\n  We are going to have plenty of time to talk about it. And just as the \nSenator from North Dakota brings a lot of facts and figures to the \nfloor, there are a lot of facts and figures from the 8 years--maybe \nmore--we have debated this issue. It has not been Congress that has \nturned it down, it has been the American people. At the end of the day, \nthey send us here to make decisions that are positive in relation to \ntheir health and their future. I do not think Americans want to take a \npig in a poke on pharmaceuticals. But that is what this amendment will \nallow to happen.\n  This will probably change America being the innovator of drugs and \nmedical devices because we will ignore patents and copyrights. We are \nadvantaged by that. There are many countries in the world where you do \nnot have access to the drugs and biologics and devices we have in this \ncountry. Yes, they are expensive because they are expensive to develop, \nbut we put more value on quality of life, the ability for us in this \ncountry to treat what others are not able to treat because we believe \nthat, in the overall scheme of our system, we save more money in health \ncare if, in fact, we give somebody a pill. If that was not the case, we \nwould not have programs for HIV/AIDS. But every time we supply that\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\ntherapeutic for an HIV/AIDS patient, we know they are not going to have \none case a year with some type of retinal infection. We know they are \nnot going to be admitted to the hospital for a week because of \npneumonia. We know the savings over that incident is probably going to \nbe $15,000 or $20,000, and that is before we put any cost on the \nquality of life of the patient who is affected by the disease.\n  Well, I would imagine we will see counterfeit HIV products because \nthey are expensive. It is one of those diseases that does not stay in \nthe same place. It is smart. It changes itself within somebody's body, \nand it means that over a period of time, you can take a drug that is \nvery effective or a combination of drugs that is very effective, and \nafter 2 or 2\\1/2\\ or 3 years, the disease has now changed, and if you \ndo not change with new therapies, the reality is there is going to be a \ndeterioration of that person's quality of life and a further advance of \nthe disease.\n  Right now, we have companies that are excited about working on the \nnext product that will continue to take a disease we cannot cure today \nbut for which we can stop the progression right in its tracks. What we \nare going to say to those companies that spend hundreds of millions of \ndollars, if not billions of dollars, is: Well, the United States does \nnot put any value on that anymore. Say that to the population that is \naffected by the disease. Say that to the population of any group of \nAmericans that is affected by a disease, that we are not going to have \nthe policies in place that advance the development of drugs, biologics, \nand devices. When we do this, that is what we are saying.\n  Again, I appreciate the authors' attempts to try to assure us that \nsafety is at the forefront. But that is only there if we are smart \nenough to catch it. If we were that smart, we would not have an illegal \nimmigration problem in this country. If we were that smart, we would \nknow that we caught 100 percent of what was coming in the country. But \nI do not think there is anybody who is going to take this floor and \nsuggest to the American people that we catch 100 percent of the \nadulterated or counterfeit drugs. There is certainly nobody who can \ncome to the floor, even with our food safety standards where they are--\nwhere the FDA is in charge and USDA is in charge and DHS now has some \nresponsibility for it--and suggest to the American people that we catch \n100 percent of the contaminated food before it finds its way to the \nshelf or to a plate in our house.\n  The reality is, we have had 12 examples just in the last year where \nwe are just not that good. We are not perfect. I would suggest to you, \nto try the system, by setting up a program that cannot be policed--and \nI think that is what my colleague from Mississippi was saying. Time and \ntime again, we have had the debate. We have pulled in the experts. They \nhave said this is just something which is undoable for us. We cannot do \nit.\n  My hope is that as this debate goes on, more and more Members will \nrealize it sounds good, but it is not a risk we should take in this \ncountry. It is a risk that affects people's lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the observations I made when I was \nprivileged to come to the Senate is that virtually everyone here is a \npretty effective communicator. I am reminded of that every day. I hear \ndebate by people who really are effective, and I always appreciate it, \nand it is always interesting to me.\n  I do think--certainly everybody is entitled to their opinions; I \nrespect their opinions--not everybody is entitled to their own set of \nfacts. We have to deal with a common set of facts.\n  My colleague just made a statement, a philosophical statement, about \nwhat he believes. I respect that. But the statement included thoughts \nlike that this piece of legislation would probably abrogate or not \nrespect copyrights. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is \nnothing in here that would abrogate copyright protection, and so on. In \nfact, this amendment provides the requirement of serial numbers on lots \nand samples by those who are engaged in this sort of thing that has \nbeen prevented from occurring inside this country. It requires it for \nimportation, and it requires it for domestic medicines. This will \ndramatically change the safety of the drug supply here and with respect \nto that which would be imported.\n  With respect to the American people, the American people are not \nundecided on this issue. Mr. President, 70 or 80 percent of them \nbelieve there ought to be allowed the importation of prescription \ndrugs. This is not something the American people are undecided about. \nIt is only in this Congress that it has not been decided. So I think \nthat is something we should understand. Why would the American people \nbelieve they should be able to import FDA-approved drugs? Because they \nbelieve it is fair for them to be able to do it.\n\n  Let me describe where the prescription drugs come from by the \nmanufacturers of the drugs. If you are taking Lipitor, that is not made \nhere; that is made in Ireland. If you are taking Toprol XL, that is \nmade in Sweden. Nexium is made in France. Altace is made in Malta. \nVytorin is made in Singapore and Italy. These drugs are already \nimported. Regrettably, by the way, I might say they are imported \nwithout the protections that would exist in our amendment. It would \nrequire the manufacturer--the manufacturer of the drug--to have serial \nnumbers on the lots, to have samples of every lot reserved, to have a \npedigree for every medicine that is moved. That is for domestic \nconsumption. I am not talking about the imported drugs under my bill; I \nam talking about the drugs that are made in these countries and other \ncountries that ship them into this country, and every drug that is \nproduced in this country will require the same.\n  The fact is we have tried to get that same requirement on domestic \ndrugs and have been blocked for a long time. This legislation will make \nthe drug supply in this country far more safe than it currently is.\n  We all know the amendment that is being offered about risk. Were that \namendment to be offered with respect to new prescription drugs that \ncome from research to say, you can't put a drug out there if there is \nrisk, do you think you would have a new drug on the market anytime \nsoon? Do you think a Health and Human Services Secretary or an FDA \nadministrator can say: By the way, I am approving this drug and there \nis no risk. Of course, they can't. Of course, they would not. We know \nthat. Drugs have risks. In fact, some drugs are put on the marketplace, \nand we discover later they should not have been there--a substantial \nrisk. Vioxx. An official at the FDA says he believes 50,000 to 70,000 \nAmerican people died of heart attacks as a result of Vioxx being put on \nthe market. Further, he says--this isn't me, this is an official at the \nFDA--that Vioxx was widely advertised and widely promoted as some \nwonderful new drug, when in fact it was not a new class of drugs that \nhad any significant benefit over existing drugs. The point is this: If \none were to ascribe this risk category to new drugs, there would be no \nnew drugs.\n  I know all this talk about counterfeiting--and man, have we talked a \nlot about counterfeiting in this Chamber in the last couple of days--\nall this talk about counterfeiting ignores the point that it is \noccurring under today's laws. The way to fix that and the way to stop \ncounterfeiters is to do what we do in this amendment: You require on \nevery prescription drug that is sold, that it have a pedigree. You \nrequire in every circumstance there be serial numbers on lots and \nsamples. It is incontrovertible, in my judgment, that this will \ndramatically improve the safety of domestic prescription drugs as well \nas imported prescription drugs.\n  One final point with respect to the issue of research. My colleague \nsaid: Well, if we pass this amendment, what the Senate has said is \nthere is no value to research on prescription drugs. I don't have the \nfoggiest idea where that concept comes from. We spend a lot of money on \nresearch. I was one of a group of Senators who said: Let's double the \namount of money at the National Institutes of Health, and we did, in 5 \nyears, to dramatically improve and increase the amount of research at \nthe National Institutes of Health. I am a big supporter of research. We \ndo a lot of wonderful research, some in the public sector, some in the \nprivate sector.\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\nAt the NIH, by the way, we do the research and often much of that \nresearch is used by the pharmaceutical industry to produce lifesaving \ndrugs. But lifesaving drugs save no lives if you can't afford to get \nthem, if you can't afford to have them, and if you can't afford to take \nthem.\n  It is true none of us have a problem, in this Chamber, dealing with \nthe price of drugs; we have health care policies and those kinds of \nthings. But there are a lot of folks all over the country who are \ntaking a lot of different prescription drugs. I think prescription \ndrugs are wonderful. They keep people out of an acute care hospital \nbed, the most expensive kind of health care. Interestingly enough, in \nmany cases they are taking 10 or 12 different kinds of prescription \ndrugs to manage various diseases. As a result of that, we passed Part \nD; my colleague is correct about that. Part D provides drug benefits to \nthose who have reached the age of Medicare. Regrettably, of course, \nthere was nothing in Part D that would put downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices. I would say look at the increase in \nprescription drug prices in the first quarter in this country. Look at \nthe increase in prescription drug prices in 2006, and then ask yourself \nwhether all of this is working to put some downward pressure on \npricing. It is not. It is just not.\n  So as I said earlier this morning, I hate to lose a debate I am not \nhaving. I would love to have a debate in which we are both debating the \nsame bill, but a suggestion somehow that this bill allows drugs to come \ninto this country that are not FDA-approved means that you are off \ndebating some other bill someplace. Well, fine. Win that debate if you \nwant. It is not the bill that is on the floor of the Senate. It isn't. \nThe same is true with a number of statements that have been made about \nrespecting copyrights, and so on. In fact, what we have required is a \nregulatory burden that the industry doesn't like--I understand that--\nbut it will, in fact, protect them and protect their copyright because \nit will make it much harder for anyone to counterfeit. That is a fact.\n\n  One of the interesting aspects of this country is that we are seeing \nsome unbelievably good news. The good news is people are living longer \nand better lives. In a century, in 100 years, we have increased the \nlifespan by somewhere around 30 years, from 46 years old to about 76 \nyears old. That is good news. People are living longer and better \nlives. A significant part of that, I think, is being able to, at an \nadvanced age, manage diseases. A significant part of that is \nprescription drugs. There are some who don't have that. I have an uncle \nI have described before who is now 86 years old. He and his wife take \nno prescription drugs at age 86. The fact is, as I have also described \nto my colleagues, he is a runner. He runs in the Senior Olympics at age \n86. He used to run in his seventies and early eighties the 400 meter \nand the 800 meter. Now he tells me he is a specialist in the 100-meter \ndash, at age 86. He has a good life. He is healthy. He likes life. He \nis very active. He is not riding his motorcycle so much anymore, but he \nhas one of the biggest motorcycles you can get sitting in his garage. \nHe doesn't need to take prescription drugs. Good for him.\n  We have a lot of folks who reach their eighties and nineties. We know \nabout that because in our part of the country, my State of North Dakota \nranks No. 1 in the Nation in the number of people 86 years of age or \nolder as a percent of the population. We rank No. 5 in the country in \nthe number of people 65 years of age or older as a percent of the \npopulation. So a lot of people are living a lot longer. That is good \nnews. It puts some drain on Social Security and Medicare.\n  A quick way to fix Social Security and Medicare is to go back to the \nold life expectancy, go back to age 46. We wouldn't have any trouble. I \nam digressing a bit, but when Social Security was created, on average, \npeople lived to be 63. So we created a system that says: When you \nretire, you get benefits at 65. Well, I went to a small school, but I \nunderstood enough in math to think that works out real well. You pay \ntaxes and, on average, you are going to live to age 63, and when you \nretire at 65, you get some benefits. That is not a system that is going \nto have financing trouble at all. But then the problem is people began \nliving much longer. That is not a problem. That is a success. So good \nfor them.\n  At any rate, prescription drugs about 40 years ago became a much \nlarger part of the discussion in modern life, to keep people out of the \nacute care hospital beds and to manage their diseases. So that is a \nwonderful thing. I have said before, and I will say it again: The \npharmaceutical industry is a fine industry; I have serious problems \nwith their pricing strategy. I think it is wrong. I want them to \nsucceed. I want them to research. I want them to do the research on \nprescription drugs. I would like them to stop advertising early in the \nmorning when I am shaving and brushing my teeth and getting ready for \nwork, telling me what I ought to go talk to my doctor about. They have \nall these pills they want me to ask the doctor if they are right for \nme. I get confused. I am not sure I need them. But there is a lot of \nadvertising going on and a lot of promotion.\n  I want them to find new medicines to unlock the mysteries of dread \ndiseases. I want the Federal Government, through the NIH, to \nsubstantially invest in new research and development. I want all of \nthose things. But I also want, even as I compliment the pharmaceutical \nindustry and I compliment the NIH and all those who are spending their \ndays--today, Thursday--trying to figure out how do you unlock the \nmysteries of ALS or diabetes or cancer or heart disease, even as I do \nthat, I say to the pharmaceutical industry: I think your pricing \nstrategy is wrong and it is unfair to the American people. We ought not \nbe paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That \nis unfair.\n  The amendment I have offered with 33 of my colleagues, Republicans \nand Democrats, would change that. No, it wouldn't shut down research, \nnot at all. No, it wouldn't exacerbate counterfeiting, not at all. The \nfact is this will be fair to the American people, if we pass this \nlegislation. It will continue, I think, to see substantial research. It \nwill also, in my judgment, contribute to shutting down the \ncounterfeiting of prescription drugs, but most importantly, it will \nfinally say to the American people that we are on your side on this \nissue. We believe in fair pricing and we finally are going to insist on \nit.\n  I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nCochran amendment. We should be very clear. For anybody who is \ninterested in prescription drug reimportation, for anybody who is \ninterested in lowering the cost of prescription drugs in this country \nfrom 25 to 50 percent, for anybody who is interested in standing up for \nthe working families of this country who are getting ripped off every \nday by outrageously high prescription drug costs, the Cochran amendment \nis a poison pill. To vote for the Cochran amendment is to vote against \nprescription drug reimportation; it is to kill the Dorgan amendment.\n  The idea of asking permission from the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, from the Bush administration, who have already gone on record \nrather firmly and decisively in opposition to reimportation, is to \nsimply mask your vote. The Bush administration represents the \npharmaceutical industry. They will kill prescription drug \nreimportation. To ask their permission to go forward is simply to kill \nprescription drug reimportation. So anyone who is serious about \nlowering the cost of prescription drugs will not be supporting the \nCochran amendment.\n  The unfortunate reality is, in the United States of America we \ncontinue to pay, by far--it is not even close--the highest prices in \nthe world for prescription drugs. Because of the escalating cost of \nmedicines, many of our fellow Americans, many working people, many \npeople with chronic health problems, simply do not get their \nprescriptions filled. I am sure in Montana the experience is the same \nas it is in Vermont. People tell me they walk into the drugstore and \ncannot believe\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\nthe prices they are being charged. They can't afford those prices. I \nhave talked to pharmacists, as I suspect the Chair has as well, who \nhave been embarrassed. They have seen tears coming out of people's eyes \nwhen they have told them the cost of their medicine.\n  Meanwhile, as a result of the power of the pharmaceutical industry, \nwe have the highest prices in the world, and those prices are rising \nevery single day. In fact, tomorrow, if an American walks into a \npharmacy and the pharmacist says to that person: I am sorry to have to \ntell you this, but the cost of your medicine went up 50 percent, or 75 \npercent, we can do nothing about it. Unlike the rest of the \nindustrialized world--Canada, Europe--where they understand \nprescription drugs are an integral part of a whole strategy regarding \nhealth care, we let the drug companies do anything they want to do.\n  As the first Member of Congress to take constituents across the \nCanadian border to enable them to pay substantially lower prices than \nthey were paying in the United States, I have seen firsthand what it \nmeans to people's lives when they get the drugs they need at a price \nthey can afford. I will never forget--never forget--when in 1999 I \nbrought a busload of Vermonters over the Canadian border. Many of the \nwomen there were struggling with breast cancer, fighting for their \nlives, and they didn't have a whole lot of money. They went to Montreal \nand purchased Tamoxifen, a widely prescribed breast cancer drug, which \nat that time--at that time--was one-tenth the price they were paying in \nthe United States. Imagine that. Fighting for your life, not having a \nlot of money, and needing a drug. Suddenly, they looked at the price \nthey were paying and they literally could not believe it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a chart which compares \nprices in the year 2005--so the prices may be different today, but as \nof April 2005, a price comparison between United States prices and \nCanadian prices, and United States prices and German prices.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 SOME PRICE COMPARISONS AS OF 4/06/2005\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Canadian\n        Drug  (in US $)          Illness/condition   US price    price\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nActos (15mg, 90)...............  diabetes.........     296.89     257.97\nCardizem CD (240mg, 90)........  heart............     215.89      88.03\nCelexa (20mg, 30)..............  depression.......      81.99      52.05\nClarinex (5mg, 30).............  allergies........      74.99      37.31\nFosamax (10mg, 100)............  osteoporosis.....     242.89     178.62\nImitrex (50mg, 27).............  migraines........     503.89     365.08\nNexium (20mg, 30)..............  heartburn........     144.99      87.77\nNorvasc (5mg, 90)..............  blood pressure...     127.59     135.32\nPrevacid (15mg, 30)............  ulcers...........     129.99      74.40\nPrilosec (20mg, 30)............  ulcer............     128.99      74.50\nProcardia XL (30mg, 30)........  heart............      53.99      33.84\nRelafen (500mg, 200)...........  arthritis........     340.19     183.86\nTamoxifen (20mg, 30)*..........  breast cancer....      68.59      40.21\nTiclid (250mg, 60).............  stroke...........     171.99     101.36\nVasotec (10mg, 60).............  heart............      70.99      63.30\nZocor (20mg, 30)...............  cholesterol......     131.99      74.65\nZoloft (50mg, 100).............  depression.......     227.49     182.04\nZyrtec (10mg, 30)..............  allergies........      69.99      41.87\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDrug                             Illness/condition   US Price    German\n(in US $)                                                        price\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nActos (15mg, 30)...............  diabetes.........     116.64      50.62\nCelexa (20mg, 30)..............  depression.......      85.46      35.72\nClarinex (5mg, 30).............  allergies........      77.06      38.64\nImitrex (50mg, 9)..............  migraines........     166.40     102.67\nNexium (20mg, 30)..............  heartburn........     145.33      60.25\nNorvasc (5mg, 30)..............  blood pressure...      54.83      35.72\nPrevacid (15mg, 30)............  ulcers...........     146.47      35.22\nZocor (50mg, 30)...............  cholesterol......      85.39      23.83\nZoloft (50mg, 30)..............  depression.......      89.44      54.98\nZyrtec (10mg, 30)..............  allergies........      73.02      34.33\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAll prices found via www.walgreens.com and www.canadadrugs.com.\n*Price found at www.cvs.com.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me talk about a few of the drugs.\n  Actos is a drug for diabetes. As of 2005, in the United States, the \nprice of that drug was $116. For the same number of pills and the same \nmilligrams, it was $50.62 in Germany. Twice the price--same product, \nsame company, same factory, but less than half the price in Germany.\n  For Celexa, a drug for depression, it was $85 in the United States \nand $35 in Germany. Same company, same product. Clarinex was $77 in the \nUnited States and $38 in Germany. On and on it goes--sometimes more, \nsometimes less but often half the price in Germany, and different \nprices in Canada but often the same end result.\n  The very simple question the Members of the Senate have to ask \nthemselves is: Why is it that in the United States we have to pay the \nhighest prices in the world for our medicine? Why is it that at a \nmoment in history when we are eating food products from farms in Mexico \nand in Latin America, produced in China, and they are coming to our \nkitchen tables today, why is it that anybody here can say with a \nstraight face it is OK for products all over the world to come into \nthis country from tens of thousands of farms, but in terms of a handful \nof major drug companies, somehow we cannot regulate the flow of those \nmedicines from Canada, for goodness' sake, into the United States?\n  Give me a break. That argument is so totally absurd as to be almost \nbeyond the laugh test. This debate has nothing to do with drug safety. \nAll of us are concerned about drug safety, and the Dorgan amendment has \npage after page after page of regulations making sure the FDA-approved \nmedicines that come into our country will be safe.\n  What saddens me very much is that in many ways the American people \nhave given up on this issue in terms of the ability of their own \ngovernment to act, and they have taken matters into their own hands. I \ndon't know what goes on in Montana, but in the State of Vermont \nthousands of people in our State go over the Canadian border. They go \nto the Canadian drugstores and buy the products they need. It is not a \nbig deal, and they save substantial sums of money.\n  There was an estimate a few years ago, and I don't know what those \nnumbers are today, but there was an estimate several years ago that \nabout 2 million Americans were buying their medicine in Canada. What \nthe Dorgan amendment is about is simply saying that it is a little bit \nabsurd for Americans to have to get in their cars and drive to Canada \nto get the drugs they need; that it might make more sense for our \npharmacists to be able to purchase that medicine, our prescription drug \ndistributors to be able to purchase that medicine so, in fact, \nAmericans could take advantage of the lower prices at their own local \ndrugstore.\n  That is what we want to do. We don't want all of America to have to \ngo to Canada or Germany to buy reasonably priced medicine. We want \nthose products sold in this country at an affordable price.\n  I think many Americans are wondering: Well, how does it happen that a \nproduct made by an American drug\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\ncompany--at a time when the taxpayers of this country, by the way, \nspend billions of dollars in research and development for drugs that go \nto the drug companies--that in the midst of all this, how does it \nhappen that we pay two or three times as much as our neighbors in \nCanada or our friends in Germany or throughout Europe? How does that \nhappen?\n  Well, the answer is pretty simple. The answer is pretty simple. The \nanswer has everything to do with the way we do politics in this country \nand the enormous power of large multinational corporations and the \nenormous power of lobbyists who represent those corporations. Let me \nquote from a Washington Post article of Friday, January 12, 2007. It is \na front page article. This is what it says. This is January 12, 2007:\n\n       This month alone [i.e. January] the Pharmaceutical Research \n     and Manufacturers of America [PhRMA] spent more than $1 \n     million on full-page newspaper ads touting the success of the \n     existing Medicare drug system.\n       Drug companies spent more on lobbying than any other \n     industry between 1998 and 2005--$900 million, according to \n     the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. They donated \n     a total of $89.9 million in the same period to Federal \n     candidates and party committees, nearly three-quarters of it \n     to Republicans.\n       ``You can hardly swing a cat by the tail in Washington \n     without hitting a pharmaceutical lobbyist,'' said Senator \n     Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, a key sponsor of the \n     2003 legislation that created the current program.\n\n  That is what we are dealing with today, and we should not kid \nourselves. The pharmaceutical industry, year after year, turns out to \nbe one of the more financially successful industries in our country. \nAccording to Fortune magazine, the top 19 pharmaceutical companies in \n2005 made $42.1 billion in profit; in 2004 the profit margin was almost \n16 percent, three times higher than the average Fortune 500 company.\n  That is what you have. We have a situation where millions of \nAmericans are struggling to pay their prescription drug costs. We have \na situation where many Americans simply cannot afford the medicine they \ndesperately need. We have a pharmaceutical industry which, year after \nyear, enjoys some of the highest profits of any industry in this \ncountry. We have an industry which pays its CEOs very exorbitant \nsalaries. We have an industry which has an estimated 1,200 paid \nlobbyists in this country, many of them former leaders of the \nRepublican and Democratic Parties. We have an industry that makes huge \namounts of campaign contributions. We end up with a situation in which \nwe pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\n  Senator Dorgan quoted a study from the CBO, I believe it was, that \nsuggests we could save some $50 billion over a 5-year period if we move \nto prescription drug reimportation. In this body we have people who get \nup every day and tell us how wonderful they perceive unfettered free \ntrade to be. It is not a problem when American workers are thrown out \non the street because factories are moved to China where people are \npaid 30 cents an hour; hey, that is part of the global economy. No \nproblem there. There is no problem when food comes into this country \nfrom China and our farmers lose money. No problem. That is part of the \nglobal economy.\n  But somehow, amazingly enough, when an aspect of free trade works for \nthe average American and not for a large multinational corporation, \nsuddenly we do not like unfettered free trade. Suddenly we cannot \nreimport prescription drugs from Canada--from Canada, which neighbors \nus, obviously--from a handful of drug companies. We cannot do that. I \nthink that argument is very absurd.\n  Let me conclude. A vote for the Cochran amendment is a vote to kill \nprescription drug reimportation, pure and simple. The Bush \nadministration has said they will not go forward with reimportation. \nLet us defeat the Cochran amendment. Let us pass the Dorgan amendment. \nLet us lower prescription drug costs in this country by 25 percent to \n50 percent. Perhaps even more important, let us show the American \npeople that the Congress has the courage to stand up to the most \nwealthy and powerful lobby on Capitol Hill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. As a member of the HELP Committee and someone who was \nan active participant in shaping this legislation, I rise to let \neveryone know it is very important that we pass this bill. This \nlegislation is perhaps one of the most important bills in more than a \ndecade to improve drug safety. I am very distressed that for a variety \nof ideological reasons, this bill is being impeded. Yet drug safety \nshould not be impeded. Drug safety is one of the most important issues \nwe face. The recent testimony of two former FDA commissioners--one \nappointed by a Republican, Dr. Mark McClellan, and the other appointed \nby a Democrat, Dr. David Kessler--discussed the need for this \nlegislation as one of the most important items to come before the \nSenate.\n  Congress has a unique opportunity to change the way we monitor the \nsafety of drugs. We can't afford to miss this chance. We owe it to \nconsumers, physicians, and patients, who rely on FDA to be the gold \nstandard, to pass this legislation. This is about protecting the \nAmerican people. There are countries all over the world that can't \nafford an FDA so they look to us to see what drugs are approved.\n  I have long been a supporter of the Food and Drug Administration. It \nis in my State, and I am very proud of it. I have fought hard for the \nemployees at the FDA; for the resources to maintain the mission of the \nFDA. Through the years we have done a variety of things to improve FDA \nbut nothing as important as this bill.\n  When we began to work on this legislation, I wanted to know what \nimpact I could make. I was concerned about the fact that FDA seemed to \nhave lost its way. It seemed not to have the right leadership, and it \ncertainly didn't have the right monitoring for drug safety--\nparticularly post-market surveillance. So we ended up with the Vioxx \nsituation. We ended up with drugs to treat young adolescents triggering \nsuicidal thoughts and worse. The issue of drug safety is paramount in \nAmerica. When I looked at this legislation before the HELP Committee, I \nwanted to find a way to strengthen the FDA but not create a whole set \nof regulations that were bureaucratic and technocratic but without \nefficacy. So where did I turn? I turned to the Institute of Medicine. \nThe Institute of Medicine is the premier agency that often gives advice \nand direction to the larger community.\n  They published a report called ``The Future of Drug Safety.'' It had \nbeen commissioned by the FDA itself. As I read this report, I was \nstruck by its commonsense provisions. I was also struck by the fact \nthat we have endless reports. We have lots of commissions that Congress \nasks to be created, but we never act upon them. Just yesterday, the \nJournal of the American Medical Association ran an editorial about how \nthe Institute of Medicine developed the right prescription for FDA, but \nno one is going to act on it.\n  Well, I acted on it. I took the prescription to help the ailing FDA. \nWhile our leadership, through Senators Kennedy and Enzi, was working a \ncomprehensive bill, I brought to their attention these recommendations. \nBy working in a civilized, collegial way, my amendments were adopted. \nIt is not about my amendments. It is about the Institute of Medicine \nrecommendations. Isn't it great when we can take the best thinking, \nwork on a bipartisan basis, and put it into action to protect the \nAmerican people. To me, that is what it is all about.\n  Today when I look at this bill, I am so proud of the provisions we \nincluded. It strengthens science. It increases transparency. It \nimproves drug safety. Yet it doesn't shackle the FDA.\n  Let me share the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine. In \nterms of strengthening science, they were very clear and said that \nscience must be strong to protect the public and to keep the best and \nbrightest scientists at FDA. What did we do? No. 1, we created the \nOffice of Chief Scientist at the\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\nFDA. A single scientist will now oversee all of the offices to be sure \nthey have strong scientific guidance from the very top of the agency. \nThis Chief Scientist will work with a strengthened Scientific Advisory \nBoard who will make sure the Commissioner and the Center Directors are \ngetting the best scientific advice. Imagine, the FDA didn't have a \nchief scientist. We have a chief scientist at the National Space \nAgency. We should certainly have a chief scientist at the Nation's drug \nsafety agency.\n  Then we made sure that all new drugs would be reviewed by an Advisory \nCommittee. That means all new drugs will receive a comprehensive \nreview. You might ask: Don't they now? No. Most got an advisory \ncommittee review, but under this legislation, there will be an advisory \ncommittee review of ALL new drugs to help assure that as a drug moves \ninto clinical practice, it will be as safe as it can be. Remember, the \nFDA has a job to make sure drugs do two things: are safe and effective. \nThese Advisory Committees will help make sure the drugs do no harm but \nalso make sure they do good.\n  We also reinforced the ability of scientists at the FDA to publish \ntheir scientific papers. One might ask: Can't they now? No. If you work \nat the FDA, you often can't publish articles unless your boss says it \nis OK. Imagine that. We are talking about allowing scientists to \npublish in peer-reviewed scientific journals. This might sound kind of \nwonky, but it is important to morale. Its important for Scientists who \nnow work at the FDA and important for recruiting new scientists that \nthe FDA desperately needs.\n  The other actions we took were to improve transparency. Transparency \nat the FDA is critical, especially throughout the drug approval process \nwhere all scientific views, even dissenting ones, should be made \npublic. I added provisions to make sure this will happen. Through \nlanguage I had incorporated in the bill, we will make summaries of the \ndrug approval process available to the public on the Internet. A \nsummary will be available 48 hours after the drug is approved and the \nwhole drug review package will be publically available within 30 days. \nIf there are dissenting scientific views, they will also be made \navailable as well. If you are a scientist, a researcher, even if you \nare a consumer, you will be able to know the history of a particular \ndrug and review its approval process. You can learn if there were there \nflashing lights raised during the approval process about which you can \ntalk to your doctor.\n\n  This is big. I know the distinguished presiding Senator was the \nattorney general for the great State of Colorado. I know he would also \nbe very concerned about protecting proprietary information. This is not \ngoing to be about that. It is about safety issues, and they will be \nmade public. We are also going to make sure patients and consumers help \nto make sure the FDA is communicating well with the public by creating \nan Advisory Committee on Risk Communication. This is modeled after two \ncommittees at the NIH and will facilitate getting FDA's message out to \nthe public.\n  We also made additional changes that will directly improve drug \nsafety. Throughout the approval process, it is important to include \nscientists who know how to follow drugs after they are approved. This \ntakes me to one of my most important considerations. This legislation \nwill strengthen the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology to make \nsure it is part of the drug process from the beginning and all the way \nthrough.\n  This legislation will also generate additional money for drug safety. \nProvisions in this bill would add $29 million in PDUFA fees and up to \nan additional $65 million specifically for monitoring drug safety.\n  In sum, there are about 15 IOM drug safety recommendations we added \nto this bill. By working together, we have improved safety, we have \nimproved transparency, we have improved morale, and we have improved \nresources. This is a good bill.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: I don't know \nwhat you are cranky about. I don't know why you are holding up this \nbill. I will tell you what I am cranky about. I am real cranky when a \ndrug goes out into clinical practice, and all of a sudden kids have \nproblems. Kids have problems because they are trying to be like other \nkids. They are taking medication and it triggers something biomedical \nin their brain and gives them very dark thoughts. We don't want them to \ndo dark things to each other. I am cranky when we have a doctor working \nin a rural part of my State, who doesn't have the time to read every \nmedical journal but is relying on the fact that the drug he is \nprescribing to a patient for a heart condition has been approved by the \nFDA. He relies on the FDA to make sure that drug is as safe and as \nreliable as that doctor is in his own clinical practice.\n  I get cranky, real cranky, when we cannot improve drug safety. If we \nwant to talk about that, we have to get back to mission and to purpose. \nIt is the mission of the FDA to stand sentry over our food and drug \nsupply to ensure safety and efficacy. It is incumbent upon us to give \nthem the right policy framework and the right resources. I think we \nought to get into action and pass this bill. Let's work together to \nmake sure that when we talk about defending America, we defend \nAmericans by passing this bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wanted to speak briefly, partially in \nresponse to statements made on the other side of the aisle, \nspecifically by the Senator from Vermont whom I had the good fortune to \nlisten to and whom I always enjoy listening to--the junior Senator from \nVermont. Although I always enjoy listening to him, the junior Senator, \nI enjoy listening to the senior Senator, too, but in this case it was \nthe junior Senator, a very eloquent individual and a neighbor.\n  I did want to make a couple of points. He said, or implied--in fact, \nhe said--that the Cochran amendment was essentially a poison pill to \nthe efforts of Senator Dorgan to generate reimportation language which \nwould be effective in allowing Americans to purchase drugs from Canada, \nor over the Internet for that matter. Then he said this was a result of \nthe fact that the Bush administration was basically a tool--those are \nmy words, but I think that is a characterization that is fairly \naccurate--a tool of the pharmaceutical industry, and the Cochran \nlanguage was a reflection of that sort of attitude.\n  I think it is important to understand what the genesis of the Cochran \nlanguage is. The Cochran language did not come from the Bush \nadministration. The Cochran language actually came from the Clinton \nadministration. I was here when it was originally proposed, and it was \nsupported by President Clinton and by his Secretary of Health and Human \nServices--I believe it was Donna Shalala--because they felt very \nstrongly, as does the Bush administration, that the FDA should not have \ntwo standards of safety. It should not have a standard of safety that \nsays the products that are sold in the United States have to be subject \nto FDA review to make sure they are safe, but for products which \nsomebody goes out of the country and buys and brings back to the United \nStates, the FDA will be forced to turn a blind eye and will not review \nthat product's safety.\n  The language is simple. It says if the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices cannot assure, through the FDA, a product coming into the \ncountry is safe and effective, then the product cannot be brought into \nthe country. That is pretty reasonable language. That is what we asked \nthe FDA to do. That is why the FDA was created, to protect American \ncitizens who are purchasing pharmaceutical products or medicines. What \nthis language which Senator Cochran is proposing would do is simply \nextend that language, should the Dorgan amendment pass, to products \nwhich are purchased outside of the United States and brought into the \nUnited States the same way, the exact same way, the FDA is required to \nreview the safety and efficacy of a product which is purchased in the \nUnited States. That is all the language does.\n  Yes, it will have a significant impact on the Dorgan language \nbecause, yes,\n\n[[Page S5542]]\n\nboth under the Clinton administration and under the Bush administration \nthe Secretaries of Health and Human Services have said it is going to \nbe extremely difficult, with the resources they have, with the \nauthorities they presently have, to assure the safety and efficacy of \ndrugs that are being reimported into this country.\n  But it is truly an inaccurate representation to say this is a Bush \ninitiative, the purposes of which are to protect the pharmaceutical \nindustry. It is just the opposite, in fact. This was an initiative \ncreated by President Clinton and his administration to protect the \nAmerican consumer from purchasing drugs which the FDA doesn't have the \nwherewithal to determine whether or not they are adulterated.\n  Now, the response to this, of course, the substantive response versus \nthe pejorative response, which is that it is just a pharmaceutical \nstalking horse--the substantive response to this from the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is, we are not suggesting anything that gets purchased \nisn't FDA approved. It has to be an FDA-approved drug. That is what the \nlanguage in his amendment says. Yes, that is true; that is what the \nlanguage of his amendment says. But the practical way it works is the \nFDA can't assure you, the American customer, my constituents, they \ncan't assure that customer who goes to Canada the product they purchase \nin Canada is FDA approved, is the FDA-approved drug it says it is \nbecause the FDA has no ability to monitor that drug in Canada.\n  In the United States, it can absolutely guarantee if you buy--the \nSenator from North Dakota has been using the example of Lipitor--if you \nbuy a bottle of Lipitor, that it is going to be Lipitor. But if you buy \nthat bottle and you cross the border and bring it back into the United \nStates, the FDA has no way of knowing or being able to manage the \nquestion of whether that is the drug that is supposed to be in that \nbottle. That bottle can be bottled in a way that puts a drug that has \nbeen adulterated into the bottle and then claim to be FDA approved. \nThat is not a projection. In fact, that is exactly what is happening \ntoday.\n  Yesterday, for example, the FDA put out a press release citing the \nfact that there are 24 pharmacies that are online today people use in \nAmerica that are not American pharmacies, that are international, and \nthey now have absolutely firm evidence those pharmacies, or the group \nof pharmacies, the group that manages those pharmacies, is selling \ndrugs representing that they are one type of drug but actually what is \nbeing delivered is something entirely different. In some cases it was \njust starch. It wasn't a drug at all. Even though it was claimed to be \nan FDA-approved drug, with the certification on it, with the batch \nnumber on it, with the expiration number on the package, it turned out \nit was starch.\n  In another instance it turned out it was an entirely different \ncomponent than the drug which was allegedly being sold, which could do \nsignificant harm to you if you took it. In fact, we have innumerable \nanecdotal examples of people being harmed by purchasing drugs both over \nthe Internet and by crossing the border because those drugs turned out \nto be fabrications. They turned out to be counterfeit. They turned out \nto be basically fraud on that consumer. So the purpose of the FDA is to \nensure that doesn't happen.\n  What this language says very simply is, the FDA will assure that \ndoesn't happen by giving the authority to the Secretary to make the \ndecision--the same authority asked for by President Clinton and his \nSecretary of Health and Human Services--to make the determination as to \nwhether a drug coming into this country through reimportation is safe \nand effective. That is what we charge the FDA to do. To claim it is \nsome sort of an attempt to undermine the purpose of keeping consumers \nsafe is just the exact opposite of what it is.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to make sure American consumers, \nwhen they buy a pharmaceutical, whether they buy it in the United \nStates or whether they go over the border and buy it and bring it back \ninto the United States, can be confident that pharmaceutical is safe \nand effective as determined by the FDA. So it is extremely reasonable \nlanguage. It is not language that was proposed, as was represented by \nthe Senator from Vermont, by the Bush administration as a stalking \nhorse for the drug industry. It is, in fact, language which was \nproposed by President Clinton, President Clinton's Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, supported by them. They asked for the authority, \nand it is now the same position which has been taken by this \nadministration, the Bush administration.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia has been very courteous in \nallowing me to go forward and taking this time before he and the \nSenator from Arkansas were to speak. So at this time I will reserve my \ncomments and yield the floor so the Senator from Georgia can take his \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from New \nHampshire for yielding. I certainly agree with everything he has just \nbeen speaking about relative to the bill that is on the Senate floor \nnow.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Chambliss pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1283 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nbills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the debate we are now having is an \nextraordinarily important debate; in fact, it will be one of the most \nimportant votes we will be casting this year.\n  This vote is about whether we stand with the American people, \nmillions of whom are having a very difficult time paying their \nprescription drug bills or whether we stand with the most powerful and \ngreedy lobby on Capitol Hill, and that is the pharmaceutical industry \nwhich has spent extraordinary sums of money to make sure the American \npeople pay outrageously high prices for the medicine they desperately \nneed.\n  I wish to briefly examine a chart which talks about the very high \nprofit margin of the pharmaceutical industry. One of the reasons why \nthe pharmaceutical industry can spend so much money on lobbying, on \ncampaign contributions, on advertising is because of the profits they \nmake year after year.\n  In 2004, drug companies ranked as the third most profitable industry \nin the United States with a 15.8-percent profit margin, which is about \nthree times higher than the profitability of a median Fortune 500 \ncompany, which is at about 5.3 percent. This is in 2004. This comes \nfrom the Kaiser Foundation.\n  What we can also see, and what this chart tells us, is the \nextraordinary profits the drug companies are making from particular \ndrugs. Epogen is the drug. Amgen is the company with profits of $2.5 \nbillion. Taxol is the drug; the firm is Bristol-Myers Squibb, $2.1 \nbillion for one drug, and on it goes. They are profitable year after \nyear. The pharmaceutical industry continues to be one of the most \nprofitable industries in this country.\n  I have another chart. One of the issues I look forward to discussing \nwith Members of the Senate is the fact that as taxpayers in our \ncountry, we contribute billions and billions of dollars to the National \nInstitutes of Health, the universities, the foundations for the very \nnoble and important purpose all of us support: to create drugs that \nwill address the major illnesses facing us, whether it is cancer, \ndiabetes, AIDS, whatever it may be. We have spent billions and billions \nof taxpayers' dollars in a sense subsidizing the drug companies and, in \nfact, taxpayers do not get any reasonable price returns from them. We \njust give them the money.\n  Here is an example. Taxol is a very important and widely used \nmedicine. According to a 2003 GAO report, the NIH spent $484 million on \nresearch for Taxol, Bristol-Myers Squibb spent $1 billion and \nsubsequently earned $9 billion in profits.\n  In other words, American taxpayers are paying twice: once in the form \nof underwriting pharmaceutical research and the second time in the form \nof monopoly prices.\n  When we talk about the drug companies, we should also deal with the \nissue they often bring up. PhRMA is a very powerful lobbying group, the \nmost powerful trade group on Capitol Hill. What they tell us is they \nneed these very\n\n[[Page S5543]]\n\nhigh prices, they need all of the taxpayers' money because they are \nputting all of that into research and development. Don't we all want \nnew drugs for diabetes, cancer, AIDS, and a dozen other terrible \nillnesses? This chart tells us something a little bit different.\n  This chart tells us the pharmaceutical industry spends far more for \nmarketing--and goodness knows we have seen their ads on television over \nand over again, and guess who is paying for those ads. We are, in terms \nof high prices for the drugs, far more for marketing than for research \nand development.\n  Let me get back to the thrust of what this debate is all about, and \nlet me be very clear. As I mentioned a little while ago, the Cochran \namendment is a poison pill. If anyone is serious about prescription \ndrug reimportation, if people are serious about lowering the cost of \nprescription drugs from 25 to 50 percent, if people are serious about \nstanding up for consumers in this country, they will vote against the \nCochran amendment.\n  So that no Senator has any doubt about what is going on, Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nStatement of Administration Policy, dated May 1, 2007, from the \nPresident's office, and I will quote from the bottom of page 2, where \nthere it is in black and white. This is a two-page letter. It says:\n\n       As a result, if any such importation provision were \n     included in the final version of the bill presented to the \n     President, the President's senior advisers would recommend \n     that he veto the bill.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2007.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n        S. 1082--Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act\n\n                         (Sen. Kennedy (D) MA)\n\n       The Administration strongly supports reauthorization of the \n     Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) and the Medical Device \n     User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA). These two programs \n     account for nearly one quarter of the Food and Drug \n     Administration's (FDA) annual budget and support more than \n     two thousand Agency employees who work diligently to ensure \n     the safety and efficacy of the medical products on which the \n     American people rely. Reauthorizing PDUFA and MDUFMA will \n     enhance FDA's ability to more efficiently and effectively \n     regulate drugs, biological products, and medical devices, a \n     critical component of the Agency's public health mission. \n     Additionally, the Administration is committed to \n     reauthorizing the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act \n     (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), which \n     have provided invaluable information to the Agency about \n     medical products' interaction with pediatric populations.\n       The Administration shares the goal of S. 1082 to provide \n     FDA with the appropriate tools and resources to enhance the \n     safety and efficacy of the products the agency regulates. \n     However, the Administration has serious concerns with S. 1082 \n     in its current form and will work with Congress to address \n     them as the legislative process moves forward.\n       The Administration appreciates that portions of S. 1082 are \n     consistent with the Administration's recommendations for \n     reauthorization, which strengthen FDA's ability to ensure the \n     safety and availability of new drugs and medical devices, \n     create a new program for review of television advertisements, \n     and strengthen post-market review. These user fee programs \n     expire at the end of the current fiscal year, and their \n     timely reauthorization is critical to the ability of FDA to \n     continue to carefully and expeditiously review and approve \n     new drugs and devices to benefit the health of the American \n     people.\n       The Administration is committed to further improving drug \n     safety through better tools for surveillance of drug events, \n     improved scientific tools for evaluating drug safety \n     problems, and better means of communicating drug safety \n     problems to providers and patients. However, the \n     Administration is concerned that the bill, as written, would \n     require significant resources to implement burdensome process \n     changes that will not contribute meaningfully to improving \n     drug safety. For example, the prescriptive timeframes to \n     develop and process Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies \n     are particularly burdensome and are not likely to contribute \n     to improving drug safety. Additionally, the Administration is \n     concerned about the provision in S. 1082 that would use \n     increased user fees to fund certain additional drug safety \n     activities that were not agreed to during the statutorily \n     required Agency-industry negotiations. This provision reopens \n     and is inconsistent with the Administration PDUFA proposal \n     that was developed through extensive consultation.\n       There are other provisions in S. 1082 that also raise \n     serious concerns. Specifically, the bill would make changes \n     to the BPCA and PREA to reduce the incentives to conduct \n     clinical trials for children, thus reducing the effectiveness \n     of the program. It also would impose administrative burdens \n     that would make the programs inefficient and in many ways \n     unworkable. These provisions would reduce the flexibility the \n     agency needs to conduct these programs, require an \n     inefficient duplication of scientific expertise, and cause \n     delays in the review of pediatric assessments. Both BPCA and \n     PREA have been very successful in providing the necessary \n     incentives for drug companies to conduct pediatric clinical \n     trials to improve our understanding of how drugs work in \n     children, thus enhancing the quality of their medical care. \n     BPCA and PREA should be extended without modification.\n     Potential Amendments: Follow-on Protein Products and \n         Importation of Prescription Drugs\n       The Administration supports the goal of making safe and \n     effective drugs available and affordable for American \n     consumers. While some in Congress may be interested in \n     attaching legislation related to follow-on protein products \n     to this bill, the Administration believes that these complex \n     issues should be considered thoroughly through a robust \n     scientific, regulatory, and legal discussion. Sufficient \n     discussion has not yet occurred and should not be abbreviated \n     for the convenience of a particular legislative vehicle. Any \n     legislative proposal considered to authorize a regulatory \n     pathway for follow-on protein products must, as a first \n     priority, ensure the safety and efficacy of the resulting \n     products, thus protecting patient safety. Furthermore, it \n     should also include adequate intellectual property \n     protections for innovators, in order to maintain the research \n     enterprise that has generated life-saving medications. The \n     Administration believes further discussion must take place \n     before addressing these issues in legislation. The \n     Administration strongly opposes the inclusion in this bill of \n     any provision related to follow-on protein products.\n       The Administration would also strongly oppose any provision \n     that might be added on the Senate Floor regarding the \n     importation of prescription drugs that does not address the \n     serious safety concerns identified in the December 2004 \n     Department of Health and Human Services Task Force Report on \n     Prescription Drug Importation. The Administration believes \n     that allowing importation of drugs outside the current safety \n     system established by the FDA without addressing these \n     serious safety concerns would threaten public health and \n     result in unsafe, unapproved, and counterfeit drugs being \n     imported into the United States. As a result, if any such \n     importation provision were included in the final version of \n     the bill presented to the President, the President's senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n       The Administration strongly opposes the inclusion of any \n     unrelated provisions that would disrupt the timely \n     reauthorization of the user fee program. The Administration \n     looks forward to working with Congress to reauthorize PDUFA \n     and MDUFMA expeditiously to avoid any disruptions to these \n     successful programs.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS If you are voting for the Cochran amendment, which says, \nwell, we want the Secretary to certify we can go forward, what you are \nvoting for is to kill reimportation. The White House was honest enough \nto make that very clear. So it would seem to me that for those people \nwho want reimportation, you have to vote ``no.'' If you don't want \nreimportation, then you can vote for it. But that is the simple \nreality.\n  There is another issue which I understand was raised a little while \nago--I was not on the floor at that moment--and that dealing with the \nClinton administration's attitude toward reimportation. I must say when \nI was a Member of the House, I was very involved in this issue. I was \none of the leaders in the House in fighting for prescription drug \nreimportation. Back in the year 2000, we worked very closely with the \nClinton administration and with then Secretary of Health and Human \nServices Donna Shalala to craft and pass reimportation legislation. \nDuring that process, the Clinton administration came to support \nreimportation over a period of time.\n  Unfortunately, as many in this Chamber remember, it was during that \ndebate on reimportation that the Senator from Mississippi first offered \nthe certification language he is putting forward today. So he has been \ndoing this for quite a while. It is true Secretary Shalala refused to \nimplement the reimportation legislation passed in 2000 as a result of \nthis certification. I know opponents of reimportation like to \ncharacterize Secretary Shalala's refusal to implement reimportation \nbecause she believed reimportation was impossible to make safe. That is \nthe argument we hear over and over again: Hey, it is not us. Even the \nClinton administration said reimportation could not be made safe. But \nwhat I must say,\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\nas straightforwardly as I can, is that argument is not accurate. It is \nnot right.\n  In her December 26, 2000, letter to President Clinton dealing with \nthis issue, Secretary Shalala outlined several ``flaws and loopholes'' \nthat would prevent the legislation from being effective. As someone who \nwas active in the debate of 2000, let me also say it is a fact that \nthese ``flaws and loopholes'' were identified prior to the passage of \nthat legislation, but opponents of reimportation refused to address \nthem because they knew those flaws and loopholes would be fatal.\n  The legislation being offered today by Senator Dorgan addresses each \nand every one of those flaws and loopholes identified by Secretary \nShalala. So let me say this again. If anyone comes to the floor of the \nSenate and says the Clinton administration thought reimportation should \nnot go forward because there were flaws in it that could not be dealt \nwith, that is simply inaccurate. What Secretary Shalala said is, there \nare concerns I have, and these concerns have got to be addressed. Well, \nguess what. Senator Dorgan's legislation does just that.\n  Let us take a look at her letter. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the letter I am referring to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 26, 2000.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The White House\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The annual appropriations bill for the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (P.L. 106-387), signed \n     into law earlier this year, included a provision to allow \n     prescription drugs to be reimported from certain countries \n     for sale in the United States. The law requires that, prior \n     to implementation, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     demonstrate that this reimportation poses no additional risk \n     to the public's health and safety and that it will result in \n     a significant reduction in the cost of covered products to \n     the American consumer.\n       I am writing to advise you that I cannot make the \n     demonstration called for in the statute because of serious \n     flaws and loopholes in the design of the new drug \n     reimportation system. As such, I will not request the $23 \n     million that was conditionally appropriated for FDA \n     implementation costs for the drug reimportation system \n     included in the FY 2001 appropriations bill.\n       As you know, Administration officials worked for months \n     with members of Congress and staff to help them design safe \n     and workable drug reimportation legislation. Unfortunately, \n     our most significant concerns about this proposal were not \n     addressed. These flaws, outlined below, undermine the \n     potential for cost savings associated with prescription drug \n     reimportation and could pose unnecessary public health risks.\n       First, the provision allows drug manufacturers to deny U.S. \n     importers legal access to the FDA approved labeling that is \n     required for reimportation. In fact, the provision explicitly \n     states that any labeling information provided by \n     manufacturers may be used only for testing product \n     authenticity. This is a major loophole that Administration \n     officials discussed with congressional staff but was not \n     closed in the final legislation.\n       Second, the drug reimportation provision fails to prevent \n     drug manufacturers from discriminating against foreign \n     distributors that import drugs to the U.S. While the law \n     prevents contracts or agreements that explicitly prohibit \n     drug importation, it does not prohibit drug manufacturers \n     from requiring distributors to charge higher prices! limit \n     supply, or otherwise treat U.S. importers less favorably than \n     foreign purchasers.\n       Third, the reimportation system has both authorization and \n     funding limitations. The law requires that the system end \n     five years after it goes into effect. This ``sunset'' \n     provision will likely have a chilling effect on private-\n     sector investment in the required testing and distribution \n     systems because of the uncertainty of long-term financial \n     returns. In addition, the public benefits of the new system \n     are diminished since the significant investment of taxpayer \n     funds to establish the new safety monitoring and enforcement \n     functions will not be offset by long-term savings to \n     consumers from lower priced drugs. Finally, Congress \n     appropriated the $23 million necessary for first year \n     implementation costs of the program but did so without \n     funding core and priority activities in FDA, such as \n     enforcement of standards for internet drug purchase and post-\n     market surveillance activities.\n       In addition, while FDA's responsibilities last five years, \n     its funding authorization is only for one year. Without a \n     stable funding base, FDA will not be able implement the new \n     program in a way that protects the public health.\n       As you and I have discussed, we in the Administration and \n     the Congress have a strong obligation to communicate clearly \n     to the American people the shortcomings in policies that \n     purport to offer relief from the high cost of prescription \n     drugs. For this reason, I feel compelled to inform you that \n     the flaws and loopholes contained in the reimportation \n     provision make it impossible for me to demonstrate that it is \n     safe and cost effective. As such, I cannot sanction the \n     allocation of taxpayer dollars to implement such a system.\n       Mr. President, the changes to the reimportation legislation \n     that we have proposed can and should be enacted by the \n     Congress next year. At the same time, I know you share my \n     view that an importation provision--no matter how well \n     crafted--cannot be a substitute for a voluntary prescription \n     drug benefit provided through the Medicare program. Nor is \n     the solution a low-income, state-based prescription drug \n     program that would exclude millions of beneficiaries and \n     takes years to implement in all states. What is needed is a \n     real Medicare prescription drug option that is affordable and \n     accessible to all beneficiaries regardless of where they \n     live. It is my strong hope that, when Congress and the next \n     Administration evaluate the policy options before them, they \n     will come together on this approach and, at long last, make \n     prescription drug coverage an integral part of Medicare.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                 Donna E. Shalala.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the first flaw Secretary Shalala \nidentified was the lack of any requirement that the drug manufacturers \ngive importers permission to use the FDA-approved labeling for imported \nmedicines.\n  The Dorgan amendment addresses that concern.\n  The second flaw identified by Secretary Shalala was the lack of any \nban on drug companies discriminating against foreign companies that \nexport medicines to the United States.\n  The Dorgan amendment addresses that concern.\n  The third flaw identified by Secretary Shalala was the 5-year sunset \nin that version of the bill. That sunset would limit the public benefit \nfrom the investment the public would be making to put a safe \nreimportation system in place. In other words, she was saying, why \nshould we go through all this effort if we are to only have a 5-year \nprocess.\n  The Dorgan amendment addresses that concern.\n  Finally, the Secretary noted the absence of a long-term income stream \nto fund enforcement of the reimportation system.\n  The Dorgan amendment addresses that concern.\n  In short, to characterize Secretary Shalala's letter as one that says \nreimportation is unsafe is to mischaracterize the essence of that \nletter. What Secretary Shalala was critical of was poison pills, what \nshe called ``flaws and loopholes'' that were put in, or allowed to \nremain in the bill at the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry so \nthey could defeat reimportation.\n  I have been involved in this issue for a long time, and that is what \nthe drug companies do. Every day there is another reason why we can't \ngo forward to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Every day there is \nanother reason why we have to pay the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs. We have 1,200 lobbyists, no doubt many of them \nrunning around right now knocking on doors, to make sure our people \ncontinue to pay the highest prices in the world.\n  Secretary Shalala wrote in her letter that she, in fact, hoped \nCongress would fix the flaws and close the loopholes in that 2000 \nlegislation of 7 years ago, and this is what she wrote to President \nClinton:\n\n       Mr. President, the changes to the reimportation legislation \n     that we have proposed can and should be enacted by the \n     Congress next year.\n\n  In other words, in 2001. Let me repeat that. Secretary Shalala wrote \nto President Clinton:\n\n       Mr. President, the changes to the reimportation legislation \n     that we have proposed can and should be enacted by the \n     Congress next year.\n\n  Unfortunately, it has taken 7 years of work to bring us to where we \nare today. This should have been done years ago. Under the Republican \nleadership, there was no question we could not get to first base on \nreimportation. I hope things have changed now.\n  Let me conclude by saying that anyone who comes up here and says they \nare for reimportation but they are voting for the Cochran amendment is \nin fact not for reimportation. Anybody who comes up here and says, \nwell, even the Clinton administration said we could not do that, I am \nafraid also that is not accurate and I think they are quoting Secretary \nShalala, who was then Secretary of Health and Human Services, out of \ncontext.\n  As I have mentioned before, I have been through these battles with \nthe\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\ndrug companies before. There is nothing the pharmaceutical industry \nwill not do--nothing--in order to make sure they remain one of the most \nprofitable industries in America. They will say anything, do anything, \nand put any kind of pressure they can on Members of the Senate or \nMembers of the House.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to do something important. For many \nyears there was growing concern in this country about a do-nothing \nCongress, about a Congress that was worried far more about the wealthy \nand the powerful than the needs of ordinary Americans. The elections in \nNovember have changed that. We have new leadership here. I hope very \nmuch that under this new leadership we will all summon up the courage \nto stand up to the drug companies, the most powerful, the most greedy \nlobby and industry right here on Capitol Hill, and that we will go \nforward and we will pass this legislation to lower the cost of \nprescription drugs for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, we are at a lull in the movement of the drug \nsafety bill, a bill to assure American consumers, American patients, \nthat there is more than just the acknowledgment by the Food and Drug \nAdministration that a drug is safe and effective; that there is a \nmechanism post-approval as Americans across the country begin to take \nthose medications; that we are watching for potentially any adverse \nreactions to a drug that a new population, an increased number of \nAmericans that may be taking the drug. It is in an effort to make sure \nthat if we see the signals of that unintended consequence, that we look \nmore thoroughly at the benefits of that drug being on the market.\n  When I left the floor earlier today, the sponsor of the importation \namendment suggested that Vioxx was not beneficial to anybody. The fact \nis, I do not think it is the role of Members of the Senate--unless you \nare Dr. Coburn--to suggest that you practice medicine. There are \nphysicians who found the advantages of Vioxx, while it was on the \nmarket, they found it was advantageous to thousands, if not hundreds of \nthousands, of patients.\n  I am sure those patients are back on ibuprofen, Naprosyn, or other \nproducts that might cause significant gastro challenges for them, and \nthat is why their doctors switched them originally. They needed relief \nfrom pain.\n  Well, a lot of things have been said, and the Senator from North \nDakota said we should stay focused on the facts. I have come to the \nfloor for a few minutes just to talk about some of the facts.\n  Many of us have suggested that, two years ago, when we created \nMedicare Part D--which is a prescription drug benefit for individuals \nin this country who are Medicare eligible--we lessened the problem that \nmany seniors had expressed; and that is, their inability to buy \npharmaceutical products.\n  Just recently, an analysis published by AARP, the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, showed the new Medicare drug benefit \nsaves seniors more money than buying pharmaceuticals from Canada. Now \nthere is a new one. For those who are on border States, the AARP--the \nauthority because they certainly had a loud voice before Part D was \ncreated--said drugs from Canada are actually more expensive than what \nPart D has been able to negotiate.\n  Let me say in every State we have multiple choices. Seniors make \ntheir choice. They participate in a plan. It is a private sector plan. \nBut there are basically four large benefit managers, and they negotiate \nprices. What they have done is, they have been able to negotiate a \nprice that has even exceeded what Canada could sell drugs for at \nretail.\n  This AARP bulletin found that many who choose the least expensive \nplan that meets their prescription drug needs--this is under Part D--\nwill still pay less for those drugs than they would purchasing them \nfrom Canada. So it is not the ``Cadillac'' plan that seniors would have \nto choose to get less expensive drugs in the United States than from \nCanada. In fact, with the least expensive plan, AARP evaluated they \nwould get a cheaper price on their pharmaceuticals by having Part D, \naccessing it at a U.S. pharmacy where they can feel fairly confident, \nif not totally confident, the product is, in fact, what they thought it \nwas.\n  Just recently, in Detroit, MI, an indictment charging 19 individuals \nwith operating a global racketeering conspiracy, was unsealed. The \nFederal court announced--the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of \nMichigan--the indictment alleges that portions of the profits made from \nillegal enterprises were, in fact, funding Hezbollah. This is a foreign \nterrorist organization, by the way. Nine of the individuals were \narrested. The indictment charged that between 1996 and 2004, this group \nworked together in a criminal enterprise to traffic in contraband \ncigarettes, counterfeit Zig-Zag rolling papers, and counterfeit Viagra.\n  So as to the claims we have made on the Senate floor--I believe the \nSenator from North Dakota when he says: We have done everything we can \nin this bill to assure the public of the safety and integrity of the \nproduct--though there is nothing in the bill that forbids anybody who \nwants to circumvent the law, in other words, make counterfeit drugs, \nmake drugs that have no active ingredient, make drugs that look just \nlike those drugs that are approved by the FDA, whether they are Viagra \nor Zocor, and to find a way for those to come to the marketplace.\n  It is not something the FDA today, or any FDA prior, has said they \ncan police. For those Members who have been intricately involved since \nSeptember 11, 2001, at understanding what our ability is to have a full \nknowledge of what comes into this country, some of us have actually \ngone to Washington Dulles Airport. We have seen the Customs officials \ngo through the bags and bags of pharmaceutical products that come into \nthis country. It is impossible, without a chemical test, to determine \nwhether one tablet is authentic or the next one is counterfeit, whether \none has an active ingredient or whether one is minus all active \ningredients.\n  There have been several operations conducted in this country that \ndeal with the cyber-trafficking of pharmaceutical products.\n  Fictitious pharmacies: These are companies that prey on individuals \nwho are solely looking for low-priced pharmaceuticals. They think they \nare dealing with reputable pharmacies around the world. Yet there is no \npharmacy. At the other end of the Internet are crooks. They prey on \npeople who look for pricing. In fact, as some of those groups have been \nrolled up by our law enforcement, what we find is the products that \nwere coming in had substantial deficiencies in things such as active \ningredients.\n  What happens when a patient takes a product where the active \ningredient does not exist? The illness they have is not affected. For \nan individual who might have high cholesterol who has been put on a \ndrug that will lower that cholesterol because they are susceptible to \nheart problems, to have no active ingredient means they have a \ncholesterol buildup in their veins, and without intervention the \nlikelihood is they might have a heart attack. They might die. \nUnfortunately, when they take a drug they think is real, but it has no \nactive ingredient, unfortunately, they do not know until they have a \nmedical incident.\n  So let me make this point to all my colleagues: If the purpose is to \nlower the cost of health care, then we are taking a mighty big risk \nbecause, in fact, what we may be doing is we may be raising the cost of \nhealth care in America, and with a disregard for the lives of the \nindividuals who might be affected.\n\n  When I came to the floor earlier today, I mentioned that last year \nalone 1.7 million tablets of counterfeit Viagra were uncovered, 1 \nmillion tablets of Lipitor. This is according to the Wall Street \nJournal. I think that is surpassed, though, by the fact that last \nyear--as we were in the heat of this new potential pandemic flu, H5N1, \nthe bird flu; and we aggressively in this country then and still today \nare trying to come up with a vaccine and with\n\n[[Page S5546]]\n\nother countermeasures that might be able to defeat or minimize the \nimpact of the bird flu--companies around the world started to look for \nTamiflu as a successful countermeasure.\n\n       Individuals in this country searched outside of the country \n     because the supply was so limited. Well, Customs agents have \n     intercepted more than 50 shipments of counterfeit Tamiflu. It \n     is an antiviral drug that is specifically designed to be \n     stockpiled for the pandemic flu.\n\n  You see, my point is this: Counterfeiting, the trafficking of \npharmaceuticals exists today. Anything that loosens the regulations on \naccess to these pharmaceuticals invites more people to participate in \ngaming the U.S. consumer and, for that matter, the global patient. This \nis not something that is limited to the United States.\n\n       Clearly, the adulterated product is usually a product that \n     is manufactured somewhere outside of this country. Not only \n     can they make a handbag look like a designer bag, they can \n     make a ``Viagra'' pill look like Viagra. Now, unfortunately, \n     you will know real quick whether there is an active \n     ingredient in that. But you will not know if it is, in fact, \n     a cholesterol-lowering drug or one of the things that really \n     does affect the long-term health of the American people.\n\n  A study published in the medical journal Science found when a \ncholesterol-lowering drug manufactured in the United States was \ncompared just to generic copies bought over the Internet from Mexico, \nThailand, India, and Brazil, there were differences in the blend, the \nuniformity of the blend--an error that could dilute their effect on \npatients. The authors concluded that clinically this would have \nsignificance for a patient who was prescribed a half a tablet per day, \nwhich is not an uncommon practice.\n  So for that senior at home, who has suggested an increase in the \namount of milligrams of active ingredients so they can cut their \npills--take half one day and half the next day because there are ways \nto maximize--what this report found, published in the medical journal \nScience, was that an adulterated product that does not reach the \ncorrect consistency throughout the pill might on one side provide the \nactive ingredient and might on the other side not provide any active \ningredient whatsoever. It could affect the dissolving rate, which could \naffect the onset of effect, or bioavailability.\n  These are stories that come right out of medical journals. This is \nnot about pharmaceutical companies and how powerful they are in \nWashington. This is about whether the focus of the Senate is on the \nsafety and the well-being of the American people. This is about \nwhether, in fact, we are going to maintain the gold standard of the \nFood and Drug Administration or whether we are going to accept the \nstandards of other countries in the world where their bar is not quite \nas high, where they are willing to accept less in innovation, just to \nreceive less in price.\n  I am not sure that is a good tradeoff for the country. Clearly, the \nSenator from North Dakota has the votes potentially to win this. I do \nnot find that too comforting, myself. I spent 2 years of my life \nactively involved in the 1997 modernization of the Food and Drug \nAdministration. I worked with people on the right, the left, and the \nmiddle. I worked with people who wanted to do things at the FDA that \ntoday we still have not done, thank goodness, but there are still \npeople who want to do it. But we all came together to uphold one thing \nin that process--not to lower the bar, not to lower the standard that \nwe asked companies to reach with their products for us to put that FDA \nstamp of approval, ``safe and effective,'' on it.\n  There are products sold outside the United States that could never \npass the application process in this country. I know the Senator from \nNorth Dakota does not, in his bill, allow those products to come in. He \nlimits it to FDA-approved products. So my focus is solely on the \nproduct that is FDA-approved in this country, but that has been \nmanufactured in a way that either provides little active ingredient or \nno active ingredient, and with potentially harmful components found in \nthat pill, or whatever the dosage might be.\n  It is my hope we will continue to talk about this issue. But when I \nleft the floor I thought it was important to go look at some of the \narticles to see if this is still a real problem. It is a problem today. \nIt will be a problem tomorrow, and if we pass this, I think it will be \na bigger problem in the future. It is a problem that is involved in \nfunding terrorism around the world. It is a problem that will not go \naway, but at least today, we are able to control it. We are able to \ncontrol it in a way that has a smaller effect on the quality of life of \nthe people in this country. I think that is why they have us here. But \nwe will continue the debate and we will see where we end. I think it is \nimportant enough that we spend days, if it takes days, to debate this \nlegislation and to make sure everybody in this country understands what \nis at stake.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I would like to offer a few comments \nabout this subject. My colleague has spoken on it several times. As I \nhave indicated, we all want to deal from the same set of facts. This is \nnot--let me emphasize again--it is not importing the standards of other \ncountries with respect to the safety of prescription drugs. It does not \ndo that. I want to make sure everybody understands what the facts are. \nEveryone is entitled to their own opinion; everyone is not entitled to \ntheir own set of facts. This does not import the standards of some \nother country into this country with respect to the safety of \nprescription drugs. This is simply the question of whether we want to \ncontinue to have FDA-approved drugs made in FDA-approved plants; that \nis, a plant inspected by our Food and Drug Administration, producing \nmedicine and put into a bottle that is approved by our Food and Drug \nAdministration and sold in this country and the same medicine, in the \nsame bottles, sold in France, sold in Italy, sold in Germany, sold in \nCanada, sold in England, to have the U.S. consumer pay the highest \nprices of all of those countries. Is that fair to the U.S. consumer? \nThe answer is no.\n  We have a lot of issues that are being raised on the issue of safety. \nAll the things I have heard discussed on the floor of the Senate apply \nto today--now--when we don't have importation. We are not able to \nimport safely. I should say we are not able to import, rather, \nprescription drugs because there is a prohibition against it. The only \nentity that can import a prescription drug is the manufacturer. \nLipitor. I held up two bottles of Lipitor on the floor today. Lipitor \nis made in Ireland. They send it all around the world. They send it to \nCanada and they send it to the United States. The bottle looks the \nsame, the pill looks the same because it is the same, and it is sold \nunder the same chain of custody--Canada and the United States. There is \nonly one difference. The U.S. consumer is treated to double the price \nwhen they purchase their Lipitor. Is that fair? Should we pay twice the \nprice for an FDA-approved drug? I don't think so.\n  My colleagues have said there are counterfeiting issues. Well, all of \nthe stories that have been recounted about counterfeiting issues are \noccurring under today's schematic of prescription drug sales in \nAmerica. This has nothing to do with importing. In fact, the \nlegislation I have offered is legislation that would make the supply of \nprescription drugs in this country and the supply that would come into \nthis country under reimportation much safer. They would be safer \nbecause we have put in place safety procedures that have previously \nbeen blocked in the Congress, establishing serial numbers on the supply \nof prescription drugs, samples of the supply of prescription drugs to \nbe held back by those who are manufacturing and moving the prescription \ndrugs, establishing a pedigree for all of these drugs and the bottles \nin which they travel. It is much safer. It will be much safer for the \ndomestic supply in addition to the supply of imported prescription \ndrugs. That is the point we make.\n  I suppose people will be tired of hearing me say that I respect those \nwho have a different opinion, but I would prefer if they would stand up \nand say: You know something. Here is my situation. I think the American \npeople ought to pay twice the cost for Lipitor because I believe that. \nThat is a pricing strategy that works for my constituents.\n  I don't hear anybody saying that, of course. They stand up and say \nthere will be big safety issues, or my colleague who in an earlier \nspeech this\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\nmorning said this amendment would allow drugs to be imported into this \ncountry from all over the world. I am sorry. That is not right. That is \nnot debating the bill that exists. We are not letting drugs in from all \nover the world; only from countries that would qualify, that meet the \nsafety standards. These would only be FDA-approved drugs, and they \nwould only be drugs that are retained under a chain of custody, with a \npedigree attached to the drug. There are no safety issues, unless one \nthinks it is unsafe for the pharmaceutical industry not to make the \nprofits they currently make. They perhaps would see some smaller amount \nof profit if they passed part of the lower cost along to the consumers.\n  Maybe perhaps the industry could do a little less advertising, just a \nlittle less advertising. When you turn on the television at night and \nyou sit down at the end of a long day and you see somebody driving in a \nconvertible with beautiful people and they park under a tree someplace \nand the Sun is setting, it is a beautiful appearance, and they say: \nThese people are feeling good because of medicine they are taking. You \nshould be asking your doctor whether you might want to take some of \nthat. Get some of this pill. Get some of this medicine. The Sun shines, \nyou get to ride in convertibles, feel better, hang around beautiful \npeople. That is the way advertising works, I guess. I have talked about \nthe purple pill. They say: Ask your doctor, is the purple pill right \nfor you? I don't know what the purple pill is, but I almost feel like \nasking the doctor, is the purple pill right for me? All of this \npromotion and advertising, maybe they could back off a little bit of \nthat and reduce the prices to the American consumer. But that is not \nthe strategy.\n\n  The strategy in pricing prescription drugs is that almost every \ncountry has some kind of limitation on what can be priced with respect \nto prescription drugs, except the United States of America, and here it \nis Katie bar the door. Whatever they want. We do have price controls in \nAmerica. Not imposed by the Government; price controls by the \npharmaceutical industry.\n  Now, this is a fine industry. They have men and women working, trying \nto unlock the mystery of diseases, trying to find ways to produce \nmedicines that will manage diseases. I admire all of that. I say \ncongratulations to them. But I have a serious disagreement with them on \npricing strategy. They are wrong to believe they have to charge the \nhighest prices to American consumers. That is a fact. They are wrong \nabout that. They say: Well, it is the only way we can do research and \ndevelopment. That is not true at all. That is not true. A substantial \nportion of research and development is done by the taxpayer through the \nNational Institutes of Health and others, and the product of that is \nturned over to the pharmaceutical manufacturers in terms of \nintellectual property that is developed and they manufacture drugs. \nGood for them. I know they also do substantial research on their own \nand I appreciate that. I don't appreciate the pricing strategy because \nI think it is unfair to the American consumer.\n  I don't know how many people I have talked to over the years who have \ncome up to me and told me of their problems: I am 80 years old. I have \nheart disease. I have diabetes. I take all kinds of medicines, they \nsay, but I can't afford them. The doctor says in Dickinson, ND, one \nnight: I have this welfare woman, and this patient has a pretty \naggressive form of breast cancer. He says: You have to be taking this \nmedicine to prevent a reoccurrence when you have surgery. You have to \ntake this medicine to prevent a reoccurrence of breast cancer. She \nsays: What does it cost? He tells her. She says: I can't possibly do \nthat. I can't possibly take that. I don't have the money to do that. I \ncan't buy that medicine. Does this matter? It sure matters to the \nperson whose life is at stake. So price is an issue. It is a big issue.\n  We have all these anecdotal stories. We know the data. The amendment \nI have offered will save $50 billion over the next 10 years--$50 \nbillion--most of it to consumers, through lower drug prices. That is a \nfact. It is not going to, in any way, injure the safety of our \nprescription drug supply. It will, in fact, enhance it dramatically by \nestablishing pedigrees with respect to the movement of prescription \ndrugs in this country and into this country. That is a fact as well.\n  I said this morning I hate to lose debates I am not having, and it \nhappens all the time on the floor of the Senate because someone is \ndebating a bill I didn't introduce. They are welcome to do that. If it \nis attractive, maybe I will introduce it someday, but I am not \ninterested in having a debate with somebody who wants to reformulate \nthe legislation I have introduced. This addresses safety, all of the \nissues that Donna Shalala, the former Secretary of Health and Human \nServices raised, so we have incorporated into the bill, Senator Snowe \nand I and others have incorporated that right into the legislation. So \nyou can't, it seems to me, make a strong case that there are valid \nsafety issues. Again, I don't have problems with those who come to the \nfloor saying let's continue the current system, but I think the current \nsystem is wrong. They have a right to advocate for the current system, \nbut the current system is unfair to the American consumer, in my \njudgment.\n  I want us to have the opportunity to have good health care and \nopportunities to be able to access miracle drugs, the opportunity to \nuse those miracle drugs to manage diseases so you can stay out of an \nacute care bed, which is the most costly health care in our country. \nBut I think it becomes almost a health care rationing in our country \nwhen we say we will ignore the situation that exists in this global \neconomy in which the American consumer pays one price and consumers in \nvirtually every other country pay a lower price for their prescription \ndrugs. That, I think, is a horrible disadvantage to consumers in our \ncountry.\n  Some will say: Well, you know now we have a Part D in Medicare which \noffers prescription drug benefits to senior citizens. Yes, that is \ntrue. It does. It has what has been defined around here only in the \nlexicon of politics as a doughnut hole. Only in the political system \ncould we use those kinds of descriptions, but it has a kind of a \ncircumstance where you reach a certain level and then there is no drug \ncoverage on up from that level. Obviously, the prescription drug Part D \nfor Medicare is helpful to senior citizens; there is no question about \nthat. But it certainly isn't perfect because there is a substantial \nportion of it in which prescription drugs are not covered. At that \npoint, senior citizens who are reaching the declining years of their \nlives are finding it very difficult to purchase their prescription \ndrugs.\n  There is much to say about this issue. I know there are some who \nworry that offering this amendment on prescription drug pricing to this \nunderlying bill, the FDA Reauthorization Act, injures the underlying \nbill. I support the underlying bill. I think my colleagues, Senator \nKennedy and Senator Enzi, have done some good work. I support that \nwork. Let me say--and I know they know this--it is perfectly \nappropriate to offer this amendment on this bill because this is where \nit belongs. This is exactly where you would offer an amendment of this \ntype. No one should express surprise about that.\n  So we offer the amendment and then we file cloture so we can actually \nget to a vote on it, and all of a sudden it is like the circus left \ntown. They pull up the tent stakes, fold up the tent, everybody is \ngone. All of a sudden we can't vote anymore. Why? I guess they are \nupset that my amendment is now in order to be voted on, and they say: \nYou know, I don't know. We can't do that.\n  As I have indicated before, I would be willing to offer this \namendment in a different form--the same amendment but in a circumstance \nwhere I had an agreement to be able to bring it up. Four hours of \ndebate, for example, a couple of amendments that would be offered by \nthe other side, I would have the right to offer second-degree \namendments, we would go to a vote and decide whether the Senate will \npass a proposition that would give us an opportunity to reimport FDA-\napproved drugs from other countries that are identical to the other \ndrugs we now purchase, except at a lower price. I would be happy to \nagree with others who would give us that time and that circumstance so \nthat we could have this vote. I don't need to have the vote today or \nMonday or Tuesday, if I have an agreement that we will be able to get \nthe vote at some moment.\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\n  This vote has been stalled a long while. Senator Frist, when he was \nthe majority leader, standing right back here at the end of this aisle \nat about 1 o'clock in the morning, in exchange for my releasing a hold \non the nomination of Dr. McClellan, indicated to me and then put into \nthe Congressional Record, in the Senate Record, that we were going to \nhave action on this kind of legislation. It turns out it never \nhappened. Senator Frist, of course, is now gone. For whatever reason, \nit never happened. I spoke at great length to him about these issues, \nbut it didn't happen.\n  So this is an opportunity for us to advance this legislation, and it \nis the right place at the right time. This has 33 cosponsors. John \nMcCain is a cosponsor, Ted Kennedy is a cosponsor, Chuck Grassley is a \ncosponsor, Debbie Stabenow is a cosponsor, and Olympia Snowe is the \nmajor cosponsor with me. It is the Dorgan-Snowe bill.\n  Thirty-three Republicans and Democrats are cosponsors of this \nlegislation. This is exactly where it should have been offered, and it \nwas. Now, all of a sudden, apparently there is some kind of gastric \ndistress because we had a cloture vote and we prevailed in the vote \nthat we say, all right, let's have votes on this amendment. So my hope \nis that, first, while we might form opinions on this amendment, we \ncould coalesce on a central set of facts that represents what the \namendment does and says; and, second, that we can begin, on behalf of \nthe American people, to make some movement here and to begin to have \nvotes.\n  I also hope that, as I listen to further debate on the floor, we can \nstick to what the amendment is. It is not to reimport lower priced FDA-\napproved prescription drugs from everywhere. It limits it to those \nareas where we have safe and effective supplies of prescription drugs.\n  I hope we can get all of the facts straight. This amendment has a lot \nof support. I believe the American people, by 75 to 80 percent, support \nthis. I have seen poll after poll where the American people believe it \nis wrong and unfair for them to be charged the highest prices in the \nworld for prescription drugs. Why on Earth should they drive 10 miles \nbetween two drugstores--one on the Canadian side and one on the \nAmerican side of the border--only to find that the same medicine, put \nin the same bottle, made by the same company, FDA approved, has only \none difference--the American consumer gets a chance to pay double. How \ndo you justify that? You don't. We ought to change it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          U.S. Policy in Iraq\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, President Bush marked the fourth \nanniversary of his announcement that major combat operations in Iraq \nhave ended by vetoing war funding legislation because he claimed it \nlimited his ability to prosecute a war unconditionally and \nindefinitely. Our Armed Forces are now well into their fifth year of \ncombat operations--longer than the U.S. was involved in World War II--\nand the time is overdue to examine and update U.S. policy in Iraq.\n  The legislation, which President Bush vetoed, would have set a \nresponsible, new course for the war that was a balanced and fair \nproposal that I was pleased to support. Sadly, the President continues \nto believe peace and stability can be forced on the Iraqi people at the \npoint of a gun. He was wrong in 2002 when he sought authorization to go \nto war, and he is wrong today.\n  However, now that the President has insisted on continuing down this \nfailed path, it is our responsibility to discuss alternatives that can \nbecome law. The Congress is not an ATM, spitting out billions whenever \nthe President requests it. It is a policy arm of the Government, as \nwell as its banker. The Constitution says the Congress shall have power \nto provide for the common defense. It is the Congress--yes, it is the \nCongress--that is given the sole power to declare war. The Congress is \nsworn to raise and support armies. The Congress and the people of the \nUnited States have a right to expect clarity in our mission and a \nforeseeable end to this conflict.\n  The situation in Iraq, in 2007, is very different from what it was in \n2002, when the Congress authorized the use of military force in Iraq. \nThe President himself said this:\n\n       This is not the war we entered in Iraq, but it is the war \n     we are in.\n\n  It is time to rethink, reset our goals, and consider a new \nauthorization which outlines the mission as the President now sees it. \nThe October 11, 2002, authorization for the President to use force in \nIraq was very specific. After expressing support for diplomatic efforts \nto resolve the causes of conflict with Iraq, the authorization allowed \nthe use of force for two purposes. The first was to defend the national \nsecurity of the United States against the continuing threat posed by \nIraq. The second reason was to enforce all relevant United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions against Iraq.\n  In 2002, and early 2003, President Bush made his case to Congress and \nto the American people for the invasion of Iraq. His stated goals \nincluded the elimination of the weapons of mass destruction programs \nthat Iraq was thought to possess, and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's \nregime. By that yardstick, the U.S. military has achieved brilliant \nsuccess. No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq--not just \nweapons that could threaten the national security of the United States \nbut also no weapons of mass destruction of any description. Saddam \nHussein and his Government are gone. The Iraqi people have elected a \nnew government. The U.S. military has achieved success in Iraq, and \nthat success has come at a high price, both in dollars and in \nlives. Thus far, over 3,350 American men and women have been killed, \nand many more have been wounded. Including the funding in the emergency \nsupplemental vetoed by the President, over $450 billion has been \nprovided by Congress to execute this war.\n\n  The October 11, 2002, authorization to use force has run its course. \nIt is time--past time--to decommission this authorization and retire it \nto the archives. If the President has more that he wants to do in Iraq, \nthen he needs to make that case to Congress and to the American public. \nOur continuing presence in Iraq is not supported by the people or the \nCongress. The President must redefine the goals and submit his plan to \nachieve them to a thorough and open debate in the Congress and \nthroughout the country. That is the American way. Success will elude us \nwithout the support of the people whose sons and daughters are being \nasked to die daily in the sands--yes, the sands--of Iraq.\n  I propose October 11, 2007, as the expiration date for the 2002 \nauthorization and that the President seek a new authorization from the \nelected representatives of the people in Congress. The President must \nbe clear about what he now hopes to accomplish in Iraq and how he \nintends to achieve it. President Bush must build support for his plan. \nWithout the support of the public and the Congress, we should no longer \nbe in this fight. It is now an Iraqi fight for national reconciliation, \nnot a war to ensure U.S. national security. If the President sees a \nfurther role for U.S. troops, he should articulate it and seek \nconsensus for a changed mission. I hope my colleagues on both sides of \nthis important debate and on both sides of the aisle can agree that the \n2002 authorization has run its course. It is no longer viable, and it \nshould be set aside.\n  What I propose does not mandate redeployment on any date certain. It \nsimply calls on the President to make the case for the new situation in \nwhich we find ourselves. My proposal does not set limits on troop \nlevels, nor prevent them from doing what is necessary to protect \nthemselves and U.S. personnel. It also does not prevent us from \npursuing terrorists who may have set their sights on the United States. \nWhat it does is stop our troops from fighting endlessly in an Iraqi \ncivil war after October 11, 2007, unless the President--our President--\nreceives a mandate from the American public and the U.S. Congress.\n  Let us try to give the President a chance to refocus his vision on \nthe changed circumstances in Iraq, free\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\nfrom the shackles of a shamelessly outdated grant of authority. I \ndeplore the political gamesmanship which has polarized our Nation. I \nregret the harsh partisanship which rages while our brave troops fight \nand die.\n  A fresh start could help to change the dynamic in this country. A \nconcerted effort by the White House to reassess its goals and \nopportunities in Iraq could point a path to progress. A new debate in \nCongress could resolve confusion and contention about continuing a \nstrategy for Iraq that no longer addresses the exigencies of today. We \nneed a new mission which makes clear the changed role of our troops. We \nneed a diplomatic component to the plan which might encourage the \nnational reconciliation so badly needed to quell the violence in Iraq. \nWe need a plan to reach out to other countries in the area which share \nour interest in seeking stability in Iraq. But first we need to clear \nthe cobwebs and the confusion caused by a grant of authority that no \nlonger has any relevance to the present conditions of Iraq.\n  I ask other Senators to consider my proposal, whether this proposal \nis considered on the supplemental, on the Defense authorization bill, \nor on the Defense appropriations bill. I ask cooler heads to see the \npossibilities of beginning a new assessment of where we are and where \nwe are going. I ask for a cease-fire in the political war in Washington \nfor the sake of our troops and for the sake of our country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise to join my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Byrd, to announce our intention to introduce \nlegislation which proposes October 11, 2007--the 5-year anniversary of \nthe original resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq--as the \nexpiration date for that resolution.\n  As Senator Byrd pointed out, the October 11, 2002, authorization to \nuse force has run its course, and it is time to reverse the failed \npolicies of President Bush and to end this war as soon as possible.\n  Earlier this week, President Bush vetoed legislation reflecting the \nwill of the Congress and the American people that would have provided \nneeded funding for our troops while also changing course in Iraq and \nbeginning to bring our troops home.\n  I believe this fall is the time to review the Iraq war authorization \nand to have a full national debate so people can be heard. I supported \nthe Byrd amendment on October 10, 2002, which would have limited the \noriginal authorization to 1 year, and I believe a full reconsideration \nof the terms and conditions of that authorization is overdue. This bill \nwould require the President to do just that.\n  The American people have called for change, the facts on the ground \ndemand change, and the Congress has passed legislation to require \nchange. It is time to sunset the authorization for the war in Iraq. If \nthe President will not bring himself to accept reality, it is time for \nCongress to bring reality to him.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Byrd and me in supporting this \neffort to require a new authorization resolution or to refuse to do so \nfor these new times and these new conditions that we and our troops are \nfacing every single day.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, what we are actually on, of course, is the \n30 hours of debate postcloture on the drug importation amendment, and I \ndo want to make some comments on that. I perhaps should have done more \nextensive debate before, rather than agreeing for a time specific for a \nvote on it, but that option has passed at the moment. I congratulate \nSenator Dorgan for his tremendous victory.\n  I am hoping there will be some changes yet. Perhaps there will not \nbe. We took a 300-page bill that dealt with drug safety in the United \nStates and we then added a 140-page bill that deals with bringing in \ndrugs from other countries. It is a limited number of countries, to \nstart with, but it is bringing in drugs from other countries. I suggest \nif they are as safe as what we have been told, parts of this bill would \nnot exist.\n  For instance, page 48, on bioequivalence. It was my understanding \nwhat would be brought into the United States would be drugs from \ncompanies from the United States that went to Canada, or went to some \nother place, and could be brought back into this country. These would \nbe FDA-approved drugs. These would be the ones we rely on the FDA for. \nIf they are exactly the same drugs, by exactly the same company, why \nwould there be a section on bioequivalence?\n  It says:\n\n        . . . if the Secretary determines that the qualifying drug \n     is not bioequivalent . . . the Secretary shall . . . include \n     in the labeling provided under paragraph (3) prominent \n     advisory that the qualifying drug is safe and effective.\n\n  Well, let me see. We didn't ask them to review it, we didn't ask that \nit go through the same procedure, but we want the Secretary to provide \nlabeling that says it is safe and effective. I don't know why we would \nexpect the FDA to say anything that is bioequivalent should have their \nendorsement of being safe and effective. If we do, it expands their job \ndramatically and there ought to be resources that go with it to be sure \nthat what we are promising will be done gets done.\n  There are a lot of pages here, a lot of different things. I am \ndefinitely not going to hit on all of them, but I am going to mention a \nfew that people probably ought to be a little concerned about.\n  Here again, on page 56, I thought it was going to be U.S. drugs, or \nat least drugs from U.S. companies that are already FDA approved that \nwe were going to make sure there was an absolute chain of making sure \nthey got back into the United States so that you could trust what came \nfrom U.S. companies. Yet on page 56 we see:\n\n       Notice; drug difference not requiring approval.\n\n  What?\n\n        . . . supplemental application would not be required for \n     the difference to be made to the U.S. label drug, or that \n     states that there is no difference.\n\n  And then a whole bunch of requirements again for the Secretary, which \ngoes down the line to the FDA. So I think we can conclude we are not \njust going to bring in U.S. drugs. If there is anything you would like \nto have, you can.\n  Then there is a section called ``Importation by Individual.'' This \ncovers the portion where each person can get on the Internet or \ntelephone or whatever way and order drugs. There are requirements in \nthis bill for exporters, which are the people who are sending drugs to \nother countries; there are requirements in here for importers, which \nare companies receiving drugs--and those could be pharmacies, probably \nwould be pharmacies, although there could be some wholesale--but there \nis also this section about importation by the individual.\n\n  I hope everybody takes a little look at that, because in the United \nStates I have been working a lot on financial literacy, trying to get \npeople to understand finances and how they can stay financially sound \nand hopefully financially secure, and it is a huge job. With regard to \nthe No Child Left Behind Act and in Education, we keep talking about \nplain old literacy; just being able to have people read, and read at \ngrade level, and hopefully read well enough to have a good job and to \nprotect themselves. They better be literate, because look on page 62 \nand read what the importing individual is responsible for. Because if \nthey are not responsible for this, they could easily be getting \nsomething that is not an approved drug or that is not from the source \nthey think it is. It could be a counterfeit drug, and particularly as \nthis opens up on the front end. How many people doing counterfeit drugs \nnow are going to want to jump into the breach and catch people before \nthey understand any of this? I suspect there will be a huge escalation \nof companies getting into the counterfeit business. There are a few \ndollars in it--quite a few dollars.\n  I would encourage people to look on page 62. There are things \nscattered\n\n[[Page S5550]]\n\nthroughout the bill an individual would have to know to be sure what \nthey were getting was safe, if they ordered individually. But that is \nkind of the point of the bill, because most of them probably will be \nordered individually.\n  On page 64, Request for Copy of Special Labeling and Ingredient List. \nI think that probably would be handy.\n  Then, on page 65, it goes into the question of adulteration, where it \nsays a qualifying drug that is imported or offered for import shall be \nconsidered to be in compliance if the drug is in compliance with all \nthese other sections.\n  There is also a section titled Standards for Refusing Admission. \nThere are quite a few ways it can be denied, but in order for these \nadulterated drugs to be denied, to be refused admission, somebody has \nto find them. So what kind of force are we going to add to the FDA to \nmake sure these things can be found?\n  I am particularly fascinated with item (F), which gives the Secretary \nsome extra capability if the drug is counterfeit or if the drug may \nhave been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions. Now, \nthe fact that they mention it has to make you believe there is a \npossibility--maybe a probability, the way it is put in here--that they \nwill be prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions.\n  The United States has a little different level of sanitation than a \nlot of the countries around the world. Of course, all of these aren't \ngoing to come from all around the world to begin with, or will they?\n  Let's see. They do not have to be bioequivalent. There are a whole \nbunch of things the individual has to watch out for themselves. It \ndoesn't have to be the same drug that was manufactured in the United \nStates or from a United States company, and if it gets into the EU, it \ncan come to us. That is EU now; EU later. The EU is expanding. We ought \nto take a look at some of the countries that are being brought into \nconsideration, particularly if you might be worried about them being \npacked, held, or prepared under insanitary conditions.\n  Then we get to page 71. Again, there are a lot of things I would like \nto mention in between, but this is all boring detail stuff, anyway, so \nI will highlight a few of these things and let people think about them \na little bit.\n  On page 71, we give the Secretary some more responsibilities. They \nhave to:\n\n       . . . enter into an agreement with the government of the \n     country to receive information about recalls and withdrawals \n     of qualifying drugs in the country; to monitor recalls and \n     withdrawals of qualifying drugs in the country using any \n     information that is available to the public in any media.\n\n  There are requirements for notice and changes in the labeling, \npackaging, and that sort of thing.\n  That is all additional. We are asking them to do some more things in \nthe United States to make what we have here and are relatively certain \nabout even safer. That is the purpose of the bill. Now we are adding \nthese additional sections, 140 pages, which bring the problem from \nother countries to our country. I grant it, a lot of those are made in \nthe United States or by companies from the United States.\n  Page 72, again, has a whole bunch of requirements for what kinds of \nthings ought to be included with the drug. You need to know those \nbecause if they are not, you maybe ought to suspect there may be a \nproblem. You have to be able to check the packaging and note whether it \nhas the proper seals and whether there could have been any damage to \nthem. It is your problem--unless, of course, the consumer consents to \nwaive the requirements after being informed the packaging does not \ncomply. There is fascinating stuff in here.\n  Here is one of the parts that really ought to interest us. When we \nget to page 76, page 76 says you have to play the game: You can't win, \nyou can't lose, and you can't get out. Here is how that works.\n  Canada has price fixing. There is no doubt about it. That is how they \nget some of the lower prices on some of the drugs. You can't buy all of \nthe drugs in Canada at lower prices. In fact, I have a friend in Afton, \nWY, who is a pharmacist. He had a fellow come in who was from Canada \nbut he could not get back to Canada and his prescription had run out, \nso he relied on an American pharmacy to get his prescription refilled. \nAll the time they were filling the thing, he is complaining about how \nthis darned prescription is going to cost him an arm and a leg because \nit is in the United States and the cheap drugs are in Canada. The \npharmacist gave it to him, told him what the price was, and he said: \nBut that is cheaper than I get it in Canada.\n  That is a little bit of financial literacy. Just because you heard \neverything is cheaper in Canada doesn't mean it is.\n  You should particularly pay attention if there are generics because \nU.S. generics do not translate to Canada nearly as quickly, if at all. \nThe companies had to go through this bidding process. The bid doesn't \ntake into consideration the change, and that is part of the deal, that \nyou get a little bit of exclusivity with your pill.\n  I was interested in Zocor. It is a big drug in the United States and \na big drug in Canada, although Canada has one-tenth the population of \nthe United States. The Health Minister called me and said: You cannot \nbe considering this import thing. We do not have the capability to \nsupply the United States with their drugs. We will be inundated with \nprescriptions, and we do not have that big of a supply because we have \na tenth of the people the United States has.\n  Getting back to my Zocor story, that has gone generic. In Canada, you \nstill have to get Zocor, and it is $33.64 for 30 pills. That is a 1-\nmonth supply of 10-milligram pills. That would not, of course, include \nthe cost of shipping and handling.\n  In the United States, there is a generic Zocor, simvastatin. The \nstatins are all designed so that part of the label talks about doing \nsimilar things. But the generic Zocor in the United States costs $29.99 \nfor 30. So that is $3.50 less. It is not a lot, depending on what you \nconsider a lot to be, but it is less. But if you are willing to use \nprovostatin or lovastatin, we are talking about $4 a month--$4 a month \nas opposed to $33.64 a month.\n  People need to be aware that just because we say Canada is cheaper, \nit is not always cheaper. But for those drugs which are cheaper, page \n75 has a little provision.\n  I need to explain how Canada gets this price fix. It is called \nnegotiated price. How do you negotiate a price if there is a sole \nsupplier? You really do not have much luck negotiating if it is a sole \nsupplier, so you have to take similars. I use the example that if there \nare five heart medicines, you make those five bid against each other. \nThat is your leverage. If you make them bid against each other, you \nhave to drop somebody to get the price down, and probably several to \nget the price down, so maybe you have one or two heart drugs instead of \nfive. But you tell your doctors--who in Canada work for the state--that \nis their choice, and they make it.\n  But in the United States, we are used to having our doctor make the \ndecision. And because of television advertising, we are able to make \nsome of our own decisions on what we think would be the best one and \ntell our doctor what he better do for us. Sometimes that is another \nlittle problem.\n  At any rate, that is how Canada gets lower prices. We can probably do \nthat in the United States, too, but people in the United States really \nexpect to be able to get the drug their doctor says they ought to have. \nI think we would have a large-scale revolution if we started suggesting \nthat the Government could figure out which drugs they could have so we \ncould get lower prices.\n  Page 75, section (b), that is where they say if a company has a drug \nthat is in Canada, it has to be sold in the United States at the same \nprice. So you really do not have to go through Canada. That will just \nmove Canada's price fixing down to the United States.\n  I have to mention a little thing on pricing when the Government gets \ninto that business. Back in 1975, I got married, and my wife and I \nstarted a shoe store in Gillette, WY. You will recall at that time that \nthe Government decided they would put some prices in there. This really \nshows that it was 1975. We always made sure there were several styles \nof men's shoes that were under $10. I don't know if you can get the \nlaces for $10--yes, you can. But you\n\n[[Page S5551]]\n\ncannot buy $10 leather shoes, leather lined, particularly not made in \nAmerica. That has disappeared, too.\n  But they decided, for a whole range of products in the United States, \nthat the Government would set the price to keep down inflation. The \ncompanies, as soon as they heard about that, said: This will really \naffect our profitability, and we are not going to be allowed to raise \nthem except at set particular times and for set amounts. So what they \ndid was raise their prices right away. A $10 shoe became a $15 shoe \novernight. Then the price setting went into effect and they were \nallowed to raise it again, and they raised it again to the maximum \nthere. And every time they were allowed to raise it, they raised it. It \nmade a huge difference in the price of shoes, as it did with everything \nthat was being attempted to be controlled. People wound up paying a lot \nmore than if there had been no Government pricing.\n  How will that work here, if you are a pharmaceutical company and they \nsay that you are not going to be able:\n\n     . . . to discriminate by denying, restricting or delaying \n     supplies of a prescription drug to a registered exporter or \n     other person in a permitted country that exports a qualifying \n     drug to the United States under this section. . . .\n\n  And you can't:\n\n     discriminate by publicly, privately, or otherwise refusing to \n     do business with a registered exporter or other person in a \n     permitted country that exports a qualifying drug to the \n     United States under this section . . .\n\n  And so on. I am reading from the bill here. What it says is that if \nyou are selling it to them now, you can't change at all.\n  If I am the company that is about to find out that the price I have \nin this deal with Canada, which is just a small part of the deal, and I \nam doing it--I am the only accountant in the Senate. For accounting \npurposes, sometimes these companies will sell to another entity a ways \naway--in this case, another country--for a lower price because they \ncover the costs and make a profit on what they are doing. But by \npicking up peripheral sales, there is less cost involved in them, so \nthere is still the same amount of profit. Granted, that is kind of an \naccounting technique, but it is the way a lot of businesses have to \npick it up. That is why they keep going for additional sales and \nlooking for ways to get additional sales. They have gotten additional \nsales in Canada by going through this bidding process which fixes the \nprice.\n  But what we are saying on page 75 of this bill is that if you sell to \nCanada, you have to keep selling, you have to keep selling at the same \nprice, and you cannot get out of the game unless--and here is the \n``unless'' that I bet you kicks in--unless you are not selling to them. \nSo unless there is some kind of ironclad contract that requires them to \ncontinue to do that, Canada is just about to lose its drug supply \nbecause they are not going to continue to sell up there at a rate that \nis below cost--if you are doing it at U.S. costs--if you can jerk that \ndrug.\n  That is why Canada is a little bit concerned about what we are doing \nhere. First of all, they don't have enough drugs in the pharmacy and \nenough pharmacies to supply 10 times their population, for the people \nin the United States, and second, they are worried because their supply \nwill be cut off before this bill goes into effect, so it really doesn't \ngo into effect. That would be the effect of it, that this would be 140 \npages of wasted trees.\n  You have to believe, unless there is an ironclad contract, that is \nwhat a business would do. It is a terrible thing to have happen to \nCanada or the other countries. But that is what happens when you fix \nprices.\n  I would mention that on page 115, it begins a section on Internet \nsales of prescription drugs. I will give them credit for giving it a \ntry. I will not give them credit for having a very complete or safe job \non it, but it is a try. It is important for them to try because most of \nthe people in the United States will be ordering their drugs, probably, \nthrough the Internet--perhaps over the telephone but not in person.\n  The examples we have heard of everything working fine have been of \npeople going across the border in a car and buying at a pharmacy. That \nmakes sure the trail of concern and safety is more likely to be there. \nBut the Internet is a little bit more universal. Things can go around \nthe world in a matter of minutes. They can go from one server to \nanother server to another server--you are now covering three \ncountries--and it looks as if it came out of the last country, perhaps, \nif you want it to look like that. There are a lot of things that can be \ndone. I know the kids would probably understand that more than I would \nbecause they are able to do a lot more things on the Internet than I am \nable to do on it.\n  I know there are some difficulties with the Internet because the FDA \nhas already intercepted problems and been able to confiscate some drugs \nthat were tremendous problems. They are pretty sure some got into the \ncountry and didn't wind up in a situation of death, but they did find \nout they wound up in a situation where the person was not getting what \nthey thought they were getting and it wouldn't digest and problems such \nas that. But they have also confiscated a huge amount of drugs which \nhave been sold over the Internet which came into this country and which \nhave a lot of problems.\n  I had a display up here on the desk. The Senator from North Dakota \nlikes to hold up two pill bottles and say: What is the difference \nbetween these two pill bottles? One is the United States and one is \nCanada. What is the difference in price? And he goes through the \npricing difference. But one of the things he ought to go through at the \nsame time is: Can you tell which was made in the United States and \nwhich was not? Can you be sure the one you say was made in Canada was \nmade in Canada? I will tell you, there are some absolutely marvelous \ncounterfeits out there.\n  The box I have here has a couple of examples of confiscated drugs \nfrom the FDA. You cannot tell by the box, you cannot tell by the \npackaging, you cannot tell by the pill. I am even told that if you \ngrind it up, you will wind up with the same components; they are just \nnot put together right, so they don't work. But as long as it is not a \nlifesaving drug for you, you can get along with it, anyway, you just \nwill not be getting the benefits from the drug. Something to think \nabout.\n  There is a possibility of improving that section, because one of the \namendments that has already been filed is by the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, who has been working this Internet problem for a \nlong time. He has an amendment that is a vast improvement over this \nsection and might be able to greatly enhance and perhaps correct some \nof the problems that can happen there.\n  I would mention one more. Page 131, a restricted transaction. See if \nyou have the pharmaceutical literacy to know exactly what is happening \nhere. A restricted transaction means a transaction or transmittal on \nbehalf of an individual who places an unlawful drug importation request \nto any person engaged in the operation of a registered foreign \npharmacy.\n  Now we have got to know who the registered and unregistered ones are \nand whether it is lawful or unlawful drugs. Again, there is so much \nliteracy that has to go into this, as opposed to what you get in the \nUnited States, that you know it was from the United States.\n  We probably do pay a premium for our safety. Most people want to be \nsure they are safe. There is also a little bit of a problem with the \nbill the way it is written and being able to tell about the wholesale \nlicensure and the pedigrees that go with that licensure. There will be \nanother amendment that will be submitted that hopefully can clear up \nsome of those problems. I hope people will work with us.\n  As you can see, one of the things we are trying to do is to make a \nproblem better. I think it would have been a lot better if we could \nhave gone ahead and had the drug safety taken care of today, which we \nwere on a track to do, because Senator Kennedy and I had already worked \nthrough all of the amendments that had been turned in, with the \nexception of the importation one. We had been able to resolve or have \nthem withdrawn for almost everything and could have wrapped it up with \na few more votes. But it will take us a little longer now. We are \nhoping there are opportunities to improve the bill. I know under the \nprocedure of the Senate there are ways to keep people from being able \nto have votes.\n  I mentioned a number of times the success Senator Kennedy and I have\n\n[[Page S5552]]\n\nhad with the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee, a big \nbite of the apple, the success we have had in the previous 2 years. \nSome was because we did not follow an exact procedure of going to a \nmarkup and arguing until things were polarized. We took what we could \nand worked with people through the process, and they trusted us enough \nto work through the process, so by the time it came to the floor, we \nhad a managers' amendment that covered a lot of the difficulties people \nhad with the bill.\n  When you put in an amendment, technically the amendment is one way or \nthe other. Oh, yes, there are ways to do second-degree amendments, but \nyou will not see many of those around here, because that is putting in \nanother very concise set of words that is accepted or rejected. They \ncan change the original bill a little, or perhaps a lot. Some of them \ncan be complete substitutes. But they are polarizing, and they do not \ntake care of the technicalities. The advantage of running the bill \nthrough this sized body, then through the other end of the building \nwith 435 people, is to get 535 opinions of what ought to be done. Out \nof 535 opinions, we can usually come up with a pretty good bill. But \nwhen an amendment is put in and there is no way to do any correcting, \nor the only way you can do correcting is another take-it-or-leave-it \nbill correction to it, it is a very difficult way to get any \nlegislation done.\n  Our success over the last 2 years of getting legislation done was \nbecause we worked this process of continually working until we got to a \nfinal product, which meant cleared through conference committee.\n  But evidently we are not going to do that this year with this piece. \nIt was a significant victory for someone who has worked very hard on \nit. Senator Dorgan has worked hard on it for a long time. He did an \noutstanding job of presenting it. Now I am hoping he will work to see \nthat it gets perfected a little bit more. It cannot be perfected in the \nway we normally perfect it, but a little bit more as we go through the \nprocess, and perhaps by about next Thursday we can finish with the \nbill. It is an extra week of work, but I think this could have been \nbrought up in a separate bill, handled individually, and had some of \nthe same mechanisms for improving it we would normally have in a bill. \nBut that is behind us now. So we continue to work on the bill, and we \nhope by a week from today we can have this concluded.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, to review where we are in this debate and \ndiscussion, we will be meeting again on Monday next, making critical \nchoices and decisions about the way we are going to proceed. We have \nmade good progress over the course of this week. Some of us were \nhopeful that we would be able to move toward the completion of this \nlegislation. But this legislation is enormously complex and enormously \nimportant.\n  We have made, as I say, good progress. We have a number of different \nareas we have worked through over the period of these past days. We \nwill propose a managers' package and we will make the final judgments \nabout the determination of this legislation on Monday next.\n  Again, we thank all of our colleagues who have worked with us on the \nlegislation. Very quickly, to say again why this legislation is \nimportant, and that is because, as we know, the FDA effectively \nprotects the prescription drug supply and our pharmaceutical supplies, \nmedical devices, vaccines, food supply and cosmetics; about 25, almost \n30 percent of all of the consumer products. So, it is enormously \nimportant that we have the FDA be the gold standard to protect American \nfamilies, particularly with regard to prescription drugs and with \nregard to food and other items as well.\n  So very quickly, and finally, to review exactly what this legislation \ndoes and why it is so important, why it is so urgent, why it is so \nnecessary--and this legislation falls in that category--that is why we \nare urging that we reach conclusion on Monday next.\n  One of the notorious recent examples of fear that took place in many \nhouseholds this past year, over the period of the last year, was the \nVioxx scare, the whole issue and question about those whose lives may \nvery well have been shortened because of Vioxx.\n  The best way to illustrate what we are talking about in terms of \npatient safety is how this legislation would deal with a future kind of \na Vioxx that might endanger the health of our fellow citizens.\n  First, can the FDA quickly detect a safety problem with a drug? With \nthe Vioxx situation, the answer was no. Now we have a completely new \nsystem, a sort of an information technology system with regard to post-\nmarketing surveillance. We draw on all of the public as well as private \nsystems--the Mayo system, the veterans system, the myriad different \nsystems that will be collecting information. It will be collected in \none central place--the FDA--so the Food and Drug Administration can \ndemonstrate that there is a safety problem. There will be notice for \nthe Agency.\n  Can the FDA require the label changes to warn of safety problems? \nUnder the existing circumstances, there was a negotiation for some 14 \nmonths before they were able to resolve that issue. Finally, the drug \nwas withdrawn by the company. If the company doesn't deal with the \nAgency, the Food and Drug Administration has the authority and power to \nwithdraw the approval and effectively repeal the drug. But that has \nvery important safety considerations because there may be certain \npopulations where this particular drug may be suitable. That is \nprobably true with Vioxx. It is not suitable for the general population \nbut suitable for a particular population. What this does is give the \nFDA the kind of opportunity for labeling changes to warn of safety \nproblems. It has other alternatives which I will refer to lower in the \nchart.\n  Are companies stopped from hiding safety problems? It is extremely \ndifficult because we include the publication of clinical trials so they \nwill be available to the public. This transparency included in this \nlegislation is enormously important. The value of clinical trials is \nnot only important from a safety point of view but also for individuals \nwho are affected by disease and illness. They may make a judgment that \nthey want to enroll in a particular clinical trial and try to remedy \ntheir particular health challenge. There will be the registry and the \nopportunity for them to do that. That has not existed in the way we \nhave done this. That opens up enormous kinds of opportunities for many \npeople who have many of the illnesses and sicknesses we know affect so \nmany of our families. So, we have the safety provision and also the \nopportunity for people who have those illnesses and diseases to take \nadvantage of this program.\n  Does the FDA have flexible tools to enforce safety decisions? The \nanswer is yes. This was described well by my friend from Wyoming, \nSenator Enzi. He talked about the toolbox available to the FDA. It can \nbe included in labeling. It can be included in terms of training of \nvarious personnel to administer the drug. It can be included in terms \nof specialized targeting, particularly groups in the medical profession \nwho have the skills to dispense those drugs. There are a variety of \ndifferent tools that are in there that do not exist today.\n  Finally, is the FDA the gold standard for protecting the public \nhealth and assuring access? We believe the answer is yes. These are \npractical examples of how we protect families.\n  We have another chart which makes this point as well. We had an \nexcellent study done by the Institute of Medicine, an extraordinary \ngroup of individuals who reviewed the powers of the FDA and made \nrecommendations. This chart shows we have incorporated in this \nlegislation, by and large, the recommendations made by the Institute of \nMedicine, with respect to drug safety. We built in the epidemiology and \nthe informatics capacity to improve post-\n\n[[Page S5553]]\n\nmarketing assessment, using information technology; to make public the \nresults of the post-clinical trial; to regularly analyze post-market \nstudy results; to give FDA clear authority to require post-marketing \nrisk assessment and management. If there are additional kinds of \nrequirements in terms of the drug itself, the FDA will have that \nauthority and give better enforcement tools. We also include some civil \npenalties to make sure this is going to be enforced--that is \nimportant--and conduct regular evaluation of a new drug's safety \nprofile. We will continue with post-marketing surveillance. This will \nbe a continuing process to protect the American consumer. It is an \nenormously important concept to implement this. We will also increase \ndrug safety resources available to the FDA. We have done all of these \nin this legislation.\n  We have enhanced the Office of Science, and we have improved \nsignificantly the conflict of interest and other provisions.\n  This gives you some idea. We have an excellent statement from groups \nwho represent 30 million patients: This legislation gives the FDA the \nability to continue to study the safety of drugs after approval, \nflexible enforcement tools necessary to ensure compliance with these \nnew safety protections, and additional funding to support these new \nactivities. Allowing the Agency to act on clear safety signals could \nactually allow the FDA to approve drugs more quickly, knowing it will \nhave the ability to respond on behalf of patients if safety concerns \nappear post-market.\n  That is important. With breakthroughs in the life sciences and \ndifferent opportunities that are now available, the Agency will feel \nmore comfortable in approving drugs which they may have a speck of \ndoubt about, but they will know that with the kind of review processes \nwe have insisted on in this legislation, they can get on the market \nquicker and that it can improve the quality of health and safe lives. \nThis is very important: ``knowing it will have the ability to respond \non behalf of patients if safety concerns appear post-market.''\n  This is from the Alliance for Drug Safety that represents 30 million \npatients, a very solid endorsement of what this legislation is all \nabout.\n  We have done a similar protocol with regard to food safety as well, \nof the importance of surveillance. As we would with some bioterrorist \nthreat, it is enormously important that we understand what is happening \nin a number of these countries around the world, early survey labs, and \nthe follow-on provisions that we have included.\n  A final point, we have had a debate with regard to the differential \nthat has taken place in the different countries. The presentation has \nbeen made. There has now been the pending Dorgan amendment which \nrecognizes this disparity to make some adjustments on this issue in \nterms of the medicines.\n  We will move ahead on this. We have other items which have been \nproposed by our colleagues and on which we are prepared to make some \nrecommendations. We have worked very closely during the evening, early \nmorning with Senator Enzi and our colleagues. We are hopeful we will be \nable to see a conclusion of this legislation, which is so vitally \nimportant to the American people during the early part of next week.\n  Again, we are enormously thankful to all and extremely grateful to my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Enzi. We look forward to a good \ndiscussion and debate and continued progress on this very important \nbill at the beginning of the week.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Peace in Sudan\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to once again address the \nongoing violence in Darfur, Sudan.\n  Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in that terrible \ngenocide, and millions have been driven from their homes.\n  This week, the International Criminal Court has issued its first \narrest warrants for these murderous crimes. The ICC issued warrants for \nthe arrest of Sudan's so-called Humanitarian Affairs Minister Ahmed \nHaroun and against a jingaweit militia leader known as Ali Kushayb. \nSudan says there is no need for such a trial and that its own courts \nare capable of prosecution. This is the very same Government that has \nhelped orchestrate this campaign of violence, a government wheree \ncourts are more likely to prosecute rape victims than the men who \nattack them. That is why we need international action in response to \nthese crimes against humanity.\n  Mr. Haroun, who today serves as Sudan's Minister for Humanitarian \nAffairs, was in charge of Darfur in 2003 and 2004, at the height of the \nkilling.\n  The jingaweit commander, who is the second man named in the warrant, \ncommanded thousands of militia members and is accused of promoting rape \nand torture as part of his war strategy. The Sudanese Government claims \nhe is in custody, but witnesses have told reporters that in reality he \nhas been traveling in Darfur under police protection.\n  These arrest warrants are a significant, if small, step toward \njustice, but there is so much more the world must do to bring peace, \njustice, and security to the people of Darfur.\n  Recently, President Bush delivered a speech at the Holocaust Museum, \npromising that unless Sudan agreed to a full-scale peacekeeping mission \nand took other steps, then the United States would expand unilateral \nsanctions against the Sudanese--in the President's words--``within a \nshort period of time.'' The President also stated he would press for \nmultilateral sanctions through the United Nations. Both are important \nsteps. I wish they had been taken far earlier, but they are still \nwelcome steps.\n  Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte recently returned from \nSudan. The report on his trip was not encouraging. He told us that \nSudan's President Bashir continues to stand in the way of a full-scale \nU.N. mission. He also said Bashir is not taking steps to disarm the \nmilitia that have terrorized villages in Darfur, with the Khartoum \nGovernment's tacit, if not open, support.\n  I know President Bush had planned to announce new sanctions at his \nspeech at the Holocaust Museum. He agreed to delay implementing further \nmeasures in response to a strong personal request from the Secretary \nGeneral of the United Nations.\n  We cannot solve Darfur alone. It will take many nations. I understand \nwhy President Bush felt compelled to give the United Nations an \nopportunity. But the world cannot wait long, and the people in Darfur \ncertainly cannot be asked to wait any longer. The violence there is \nentering its fifth year.\n  A new report by the International Crisis Group, a nongovernmental \norganization working to prevent conflict across the world, spells out \nthe urgency. This report states that combat in Darfur is rising, and \nthe Sudanese Government continues to rely on aerial bombardment and \nraids by the jingaweit militia as its tactics of choice against its own \npeople.\n  The Crisis Group report also spells out the complexity of what is \nhappening there. The report states:\n\n       Darfur is the epicenter of three overlapping circles of \n     conflict.\n       First and foremost, there is the four-year-old war between \n     the Darfur rebel movements and the government, which is part \n     of the breakdown between Sudan's centre--the National \n     Congress Party in Khartoum, which controls wealth and \n     political power--and the marginalized peripheries.\n       Secondly, the Darfur conflict has triggered a proxy war \n     that Chad and Sudan are fighting by hosting and supporting \n     the other's rebel groups.\n       Finally, there are localized conflicts, primarily centered \n     on land tensions between sedentary and nomadic tribes.\n       The regime has manipulated these to win Arab support for \n     its war against the mostly non-Arab rebels.\n       International interests, not least the priority the U.S. \n     has placed on regime assistance in its ``war on terrorism'' \n     and China's investment in Sudan's oil sector, have added to \n     the difficulty in resolving the conflict.\n\n  This report calls for implementation of a full-scale peacekeeping \nmission and the need to revitalize the peace process itself. \nPeacekeeping troops can help keep civilians protected. International \nmediators from the African\n\n[[Page S5554]]\n\nUnion and the United Nations must also help the rebel groups and the \nSudanese Government reach a more broad-based peace agreement. The first \nrequirement, however, is getting peacekeepers into Darfur. Conflict is \nrising. The humanitarian space is shrinking. It is becoming harder and \nharder for many relief groups to reach those in need.\n  In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April \n11, Special Envoy to Sudan Andrew Natsios stated that Secretary General \nBan Ki-moon had requested a 2- to 4-week window in order to pursue \ndiplomatic negotiations with Khartoum before any additional measures \nwere taken. May 11, just a few days away, will mark a full month since \nMr. Natsios's testimony. On that date, if Khartoum has not acted to \ntake the necessary steps toward peace, I hope President Bush will \nlaunch expanded, hard-hitting U.S. sanctions and seek to pass a United \nNations Security Council resolution with meaningful multilateral \nsanctions.\n  We need to strike out economically where it will hurt--against \nSudan's oil industry. And I hope that China, which sits as a permanent \nmember of the Security Council and represents Sudan's biggest oil \ncustomer, will join in our efforts. China buys 70 percent of Sudan's \noil, and reportedly the Khartoum Government spends 60 to 80 percent of \nits oil revenue on its military. The Sudanese Government uses that \nmilitary against its own people, especially in Darfur.\n  As a rising power, as the host of the next Olympics, and as a member \nof the Security Council, it really is China's responsibility to use its \ninfluence to convince Sudan to accept the full-scale peacekeeping \nmission that is really needed. China has helped convince Sudan to say \nit will accept 3,000 U.N. peacekeepers, but far more than that is \nneeded, and Beijing can play a pivotal role in bringing peace to \nDarfur. The statement made by the Chinese Government a few days ago was \nencouraging, but it was a very modest statement when you consider the \nmagnitude of this genocide.\n\n  Today, there are fewer than 7,000 underequipped African Union \npeacekeepers spread across Darfur--an area the size of Texas but Texas \nwithout roads or infrastructure.\n  The cause of Darfur has captured the hearts of millions of Americans. \nThis past weekend, in Chicago and in cities across the Nation and \naround the world, thousands of people gathered in support of the people \nof Darfur and in support of efforts to divest from companies that \ninvest in Sudan.\n  I should also mention that this same weekend, at Soldier Field in \nChicago, thousands of young people gathered in support of the \n``Invisible Children'' of Uganda. These children have also been \nvictimized by years of war, and indeed the conflicts in Northen Uganda \nand Sudan are intertwined.\n  For years, the Sudanese Government has supported and assisted the \nLord's Resistance Army, which has terrorized northern Uganda.\n  One of the focal points of the Sudan rally last weekend was to \nsupport legislation introduced by my friend, State Senator Jackie \nCollins of Chicago. She is a wonderful leader on this issue. She has \nshown such persistence and courage, pushing for divestment so that \nIllinois, my home State, can have maximum impact to end this genocide. \nHer bill would divest State pension funds and other investments that \nadd to the coffers of the Sudan Government.\n  At the rally, participants also supported efforts here in Congress, \nwhich Senator John Cornyn and I have introduced, to express Federal \nsupport for States, universities, and others that choose to divest.\n  This movement is expanding, not just here at home but abroad as well. \nRolls-Royce has announced it is withdrawing from Sudan. According to \nmedia accounts, including the Associated Press, the Ford Motor Company, \nwhich produces Land Rovers, will no longer sell Land Rovers in Sudan. \nAccording to these press accounts, Ford made this decision after the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission sent the company an inquiry asking \nabout reports that some Land Rovers may have been used by military or \nparamilitary organizations.\n  This Saturday, Berkshire Hathaway, one of the largest and most \nrespected investment firms in the country, will convene a shareholder \nmeeting. Warren Buffett, who runs Berkshire Hathaway, has agreed to put \nthe divestment question on the agenda.\n  The divestment movement was launched on college campuses. It is now \nreaching the boardrooms of major corporations and the agenda of \nshareholder meetings. Divestment is one tool among many, along with \nU.S. and U.N. sanctions, increased penalties for violations of U.S. \nlaw, stepped up engagement by China, and a commitment to reengage the \npeace process itself.\n  I have made these points before, but we must not let the Sudanese \nGovernment think that the often limited American attention span will \nwander away from Darfur. We will not blind ourselves to genocide, and \nwe will not grow fatigued by more news stories of suffering in this \ndistant place. We must do, in every way possible, what we can do as \nindividuals, as Members of Congress, and as Americans who care, \nAmericans who have said when it comes to a genocide: Never again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much Senator Durbin's \nwords on Darfur and how he continues to keep that issue in front of the \nAmerican public, and how important it is that the assistant majority \nleader do that.\n  I rise to speak on behalf of the Dorgan amendment, the reimportation \namendment, which will mean major cost savings to Americans when they \nbuy prescription drugs. Several times over the last decade as a Member \nof the House of Representatives from a district in northeast Ohio, \nincluding Lorraine, Akron, and Medina, I took busloads of senior \ncitizens to Windsor, Ontario to buy prescription drugs--a rather \npeculiar thing perhaps for a Federal official to do, to take people to \nanother country to buy a consumer good. But what all of us know in this \nChamber and most of the American people who have paid attention to this \nand understand, is that the same drug, the same dosage, the same \nmanufacturer, often the same packaging--that those prescription drugs \ncost one-half, one-third, and sometimes as little as one-fourth in \nCanada what they cost in the United States. So we would take busloads \nof mostly seniors across I90 on the turnpike, up through Toledo, into \nWindsor, Ontario to buy prescription drugs and save seniors several \nhundred dollars, sometimes several thousand dollars a trip for each of \nthem.\n  The opponents of the Dorgan amendment, the opponents of \nreimportation, for years--and when I was in the House they used these \nsame arguments--have continued to use the issue of safety, as if the \ndrugs you buy at Hunter's Pharmacy in Windsor, Ontario are any less \nsafe than the drugs you buy 3 miles away across the bridge in Detroit, \nMI, or 50 miles down the road or 60 miles down the road in Toledo, OH. \nThe fact is that issue is a smokescreen. We know that drugs sold in \nCanada often are drugs that are made in the United States. Lipitor is a \ndrug made in Ireland. It is sent to Canada or it is sent to \nSteubenville, OH. It is the same drug, the same packaging, the same \ndosage, the same manufacturer, and it is every bit as safe in \nSteubenville, OH, as it is in Windsor, Canada, or just as safe in \nWindsor as it is in Steubenville.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the whole issue of the safety of these \ndrugs. Importation, I believe, as Senator Dorgan does and as do so many \nin this Chamber, as do I believe 62 Senators who voted for cloture, \nimportation is safe for drugs and for other sensitive commodities. In \nthe year 2000, for example, the Pentagon imported Anthrax vaccine from \nCanada for U.S. troops. There was no question as to whether it was \nsafe. Of course it was safe, and it mattered, and it protected our \ntroops. The U.S. imports guns and explosive chemicals, uranium, food, \npacemakers, heart valves, and other medical devices safely. Again, we \nare able to make sure these drugs are safe.\n  If the Federal Government can put a man on the Moon, they can \ncertainly ensure the safety of imported prescription drugs. The Federal \nGovernment that says it can build a nationwide missile shield with \nthousands of precisely coordinated weapons and sensors can ensure the \nsafety of imported prescription drugs. The Federal Government that says \nit can develop hydrogen-powered cars within 15 years can\n\n[[Page S5555]]\n\nsurely ensure the safety of imported prescription drugs. A Federal \nGovernment that says it can safely ship and store thousands of tons of \nnuclear waste can surely ensure the safety of imported prescription \ndrugs.\n  What is the real safety issue? The real safety issue is not whether a \nconsumer from Ohio, from Ashtabula, driving up to Canada, driving \nthrough Erie, PA, into Buffalo and across the river into Ontario, can't \nbuy the same safe drug with the same safe drug regimen in Ontario as \nthat consumer does in Ashtabula. The issue about drug safety is that, \nfrankly, unaffordable drug prices are what compromise the safety of \nthese drugs.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. The drug companies' pricing \npolicies compromise the health and safety of U.S. patients in this way: \nA study completed last year found that seniors who can't pay what the \ndrug companies demand fill fewer of their prescriptions. That means the \ndoctor is telling the patient that the patient should take this drug \nthe doctor prescribed and the patient is not fully filling the \nprescription, so the patient is compromising his or her safety. Another \nstudy found that thousands of seniors with serious health problems \nreported they skipped doses to make prescriptions last longer. My wife \nlast year was in a Shaker Heights drugstore--a generally affluent \nsuburb west of Cleveland--and standing in line behind a patient who was \ntrying to negotiate the price with the pharmacist. The patient asked if \nthere was any way she could get the drug less expensively. The \npharmacist said: This is the only price I am able to charge. The \nelderly woman said: How about if I just skip today and take the drug \nevery other day, and the pharmacist said: You can't do that. It would \ncompromise your health. The lady said: How about if I cut the pill in \nhalf and take a half a pill every day, and the pharmacist cautioned \nagainst that. When she walked away, my wife said: Does that happen \noften? The pharmacist said that happens every day, all day.\n  A 2001 study determined that patients were choosing less effective \nalternative medicines instead--pill-splitting, for instance. Patients \nwill sometimes buy doses larger than appropriate for their condition in \norder to save money, and then divide the pills with a knife. That kind \nof pill-splitting is on the rise. Some health insurers actually require \ntheir enrollees to do it. The VA encourages it. Florida's Medicaid \nProgram requires its beneficiaries to split their antidepressant \nmedication that way. This controversial practice raises important \nsafety concerns, all because of cost. It is why Medicaid, why the VA, \nand why health insurers require their enrollees to do it. The American \nMedical Association, the American Pharmaceutical Association, the \nAmerican Society of Consultant Pharmacists, all oppose this pill-\nsplitting.\n  The Miami Herald last year reported that a recent study of 11 \ncommonly split tablets found that eight of them, after splitting, no \nlonger met industry guidelines.\n  A spokesman for the drugmaker Pfizer told the Washington Post:\n\n       We don't recommend it for patients. Splitting can lead \n     patients to receive too much or too little medicine.\n\n  All of this happens because of the pricing of prescription drugs.\n  So when the opponents of the Dorgan amendment say we can't guarantee \nthe safety of these prescriptions we get from Canada, that Drug Mart or \nCVS might buy wholesale from Canada, that these can't be guaranteed \nsafe--they can be guaranteed safe just as well as CVS or Drug Mart \ngoing to an American wholesaler the FDA has approved. The real safety \nissues are when patients cannot afford the high cost of these drugs and \neither don't fill the prescription or take the drug every other day or \ncut the pill in half so their prescription lasts twice as long for the \nsame costs. Those are the real problems.\n\n  Only the Dorgan amendment will save money. When you think about what \nhas happened with drug costs in this country, the Alliance for Retired \nAmericans issued a comparison this year of United States and Canadian \nretail prices for 20 popular medicines. Compared to Canadian citizens, \nUnited States customers pay 20 percent more, for instance, for their \nhigh blood pressure medicine Norvasc, 60 percent more for their \ncholesterol medicine Pravachol, 100 percent more, twice as much, for \nthe heartburn drug Prilosec, 200 percent more, 3 times as much, for the \nheart medicine Toprol XL, and 750 percent more for the breast cancer \nmedicine Tamoxifen--750 percent more.\n  Many of these drugs were developed by U.S. taxpayers through National \nInstitutes of Health grants. Yet the drug companies thank American \ntaxpayers for doing all this research by charging Americans 750 percent \nmore for Tamoxifen that will save the lives of women who have breast \ncancer, and by charging 3 times more for heart medicine, and by \ncharging 3 times more for another drug or 60 percent more for \ncholesterol medicine. The fact is, again, that safety is compromised \nbecause of the high price of these drugs.\n  In 2001, U.S. consumers filled 24 million prescriptions for the \narthritis medicine Celebrex and another 23 million prescriptions for \nthe arthritis medicine Vioxx. Using the ARA price differential of about \n$41 for Celebrex and $46 for Vioxx, U.S. consumers spent almost $1 \nbillion more for Celebrex in 2001 than Canadian consumers, and over $1 \nbillion more for Vioxx than did Canadian consumers.\n  No wonder so much is at stake in the Dorgan amendment. It saves \nconsumers billions--$50 billion is I think the number he used on the \nfloor yesterday--$50 billion. This saves American consumers billions of \ndollars. That means individual seniors out of pocket, it means \ninsurance companies, it means taxpayers, it means the VA, it means all \nof us would save significant amounts of money. But we know what is at \nstake because the drug companies are going to make that much more money \nas a result.\n  That is what this is all about. It is all about drug companies \nprotecting their profits, increasing their profits. We all know the \ndrug industry--and this amendment is not against the drug industry. It \nis for consumers. It is for taxpayers. It is for small businesses. It \nis for insurers. It is for the payers, people who are paying for these \nexpensive drugs. But we know that in this institution, in the Senate \nand down the hall in the House of Representatives, it is all about drug \ncompany lobbyists, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of drug company \nlobbyists fighting to keep their profits, to expand their profits. It \nis an industry that over the last 20 years has been the most profitable \nindustry in America, year in and year out, exceeded only a couple of \nyears by the oil industry. But typically, in a normal year, the drug \nindustry's return on investment, return on equity, return on sales is \nfar and away the most profitable industry in this country.\n  The U.S. market accounted for 60 cents of every dollar in revenue for \nthe 10 biggest drugmakers. The 10 biggest drugmakers in 2001, for \ninstance, their revenue was $217 billion more than the gross domestic \nproduct of Austria. They had profits of $37 billion--more than the \nGovernment spent on VA health care, more than the entire budget that \nyear for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; profit \nmargins of over 18 percent, 3 times the average of other Fortune 500 \ncompanies. These companies charge too much. They get much of their \nresearch done by the U.S. Government, and then they are charging these \nkinds of prices, which compromises the safety of seniors who struggle \nto pay for these prescriptions that their doctors have ordered.\n  In addition, when you think about what these skyrocketing drug prices \nmean--health care overall, and especially skyrocketing drug prices--\njust for American families, not just for seniors but for taxpayers and \nfor small businesses--prescription drug costs increased almost 19 \npercent in 2002. Medicaid prescription drug costs increased a similar \namount in 2001. Private health insurance premiums grew 15 percent and \nare projected to grow another 14 percent this year. Small employers saw \nHMO premiums increase 25 percent. This is consistently, 25 percent, 15 \npercent, 10 percent, year to year to year. What that means is because \nof the high cost of drugs, it is not just compromising the safety of \nour seniors, it is also hurting our small businesses. It also means \nthat in too many cases, American companies simply have difficulty \ninternationally competing with other countries, because they want to \ntake care of their\n\n[[Page S5556]]\n\nown employees and provide prescription drug coverage for them.\n  The Dorgan amendment makes sense for small business. It makes sense \nfor taxpayers. It makes sense especially for seniors who are taking \nthese prescription drugs. Pure and simple, it makes sense for our \ncountry. If we care about the safety of seniors and the safety of \ndrugs, don't buy the argument that these drugs are contaminated or \nadulterated or not safe. The fact is we know the drugs that are sold in \npharmacies in Canada or Great Britain or by pharmacists in those \ncountries or pharmacies in Japan or Israel and Germany are safe. They \nhave a regimen like FDA to protect the safety of their drugs. The issue \nhere is whose side are you on? Are you on the side of seniors, on the \nside of taxpayers, on the side of small business, or are you going to \nside with the drug companies? It is pretty clear where people line up \nin this institution.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to support the Dorgan amendment \nwhen it comes to a vote next week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to support the Dorgan \namendment of which I am a cosponsor. Senior citizens in Florida in the \nyear 2007 should not be in a position, as some are, of having to make a \nchoice between buying groceries or buying their medicine. \nUnfortunately, there are some seniors who have to make that choice. \nUltimately, once we get the Medicare prescription drug law changed that \nwill ultimately bring down the cost of those prescriptions, that will \nsolve the problem.\n  I might say that the private marketplace is starting to have an \neffect. It was some several months ago that Wal-Mart announced it was \ngoing to start selling, for $4 per prescription for a 30-day supply, \ngeneric drugs from a compendium of over some 200 drugs. That program \nhas been successful. And, of course, others, such as Target, have \npicked up and started that program as well. So we are seeing that the \nmarketplace is starting to have some say in this.\n  But with regard to the delivery of these drugs, senior citizens are \nhaving difficulty, even under what is supplied by Medicare right now. \nUntil we have, eventually, the ability of Medicare to use its bulk \npurchasing power in order to negotiate prices of drugs--something the \nVeterans' Administration has been doing for years--until that occurs, \nalong with the effects of the marketplace, along with the entry of \ngeneric drugs--until all of that happens, we are not going to see the \ncost of these drugs brought down to where in America today we do not \nhave a senior citizen making a choice between buying groceries or \nbuying their prescription medicines. In the meantime, there is \nsomething we can do about it; that is, we can allow senior citizens to \npurchase drugs from Canada, where often the price is one-half of what \nthey get those drugs retail here.\n  This Senator has been involved in this because, naturally, my State \nhas the highest percentage of the population that is 65 and older. \nNaturally, when their shipments of drugs coming from Canada are \ninterdicted, as they have been by Customs over the last several years, \nguess who they are going to call. I get involved in this, and then I \nhave to get ahold of the Customs Department to find out why they are \ndoing this. I have to get ahold of the FDA, and I get conflicting \nmessages.\n  A couple years ago, I spoke to the acting head of the FDA. He said \nthat, as a policy, we do not have any objection to a limited supply--\nand he named that as 90 days or less--for personal use. Naturally, the \nFDA has to be concerned about the safety of large quantities of \ncounterfeit drugs. That is what we want to protect. That is what we \nwant Customs to be going after.\n  He pointed out that all of the counterfeits we have to go after--it \nis not the individual senior citizen wanting a limited supply, 90 days \nor less, for personal use coming from a Canadian pharmacy; that is not \na threat to the health of our people.\n  Last year on the floor, Senator Vitter of Louisiana and I coauthored \nand offered an amendment, and it passed. It would have allowed what I \njust described. That bill went to the House in a conference committee \nand, because of the power of the pharmaceutical industry, they watered \nit down so that instead of the senior citizen being able to order by \nmail, by Internet, or by telephone, what became law was that they could \nbring it personally across the border. Well, that may do somebody good \nin Michigan or in North Dakota, but it is obviously not going to do \nsenior citizens in other parts of the country, including Florida, any \ngood.\n  Thus, until we can get this equilibrium of the marketplace by bulk \npurchases, by additional generics--all the time--and there is an \ninterest, I agree, of the pharmaceutical industry, protecting them with \nthose patents so they can recoup research and development costs but not \nto keep extending that patent after the life of the patent so that the \ngeneric can never get to the marketplace--until we can get all of those \nthings straightened out, we simply have to bring some relief to our \npeople. Albeit this is just one small way of doing it, it is an \nimportant step to allow the purchase from Canadian pharmacies. It is \nthe same drug, made in the same pharmaceutical facility, that we get \nhere. Indeed, it is even the same packaging, except it is sold through \na Canadian pharmacy at half the price.\n  I am as reasonable as any Senator in trying to work out an \naccommodation with certain interests that want to protect their turf, \nbut this has simply gone too far. As the Senator from Ohio has just \ngiven a number of examples his wife was observing at the counter of the \npharmacy, so too have I witnessed this among seniors.\n  A lot of the seniors today came out of the ``greatest generation.'' \nWe have an obligation to them, and no senior citizen should not be \nable, either through a Government program such as Medicare or a \nGovernment-subsidized program, through Medicaid--if they don't get \ntheir pharmaceuticals from one of those, they simply should not be in a \nposition where they have to cut those pills in half or take them every \nother day or not be able to take those pills at all.\n  When Medicare was set up back in the mid sixties, we didn't have the \nmiracles of modern-day drugs; there wasn't a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit back then. Now, thanks to--kudos ought to go to the \npharmaceutical industry, and the money we vote here for the research \nthat goes through a lot of our scientific and medical institutions, \nfederally funded money that goes to that research, the commendations \nought to be all the way around the block, including the pharmaceutical \ncompanies. But we have to take the view that we cannot keep looking out \nfor our own selfish interests all the time. We have to look to the \ngreater good. When there is a part of America that is hurting, we have \nto address it.\n  It is for those reasons that I am a cosponsor of this amendment. I \nwas quite heartened when, earlier today, we got the necessary 60 votes \nin order to break the filibuster and proceed with the amendment. I hope \nthat once we pass it here in this Chamber, it will not be stripped off \nwhen it gets to the other Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida).

Dorgan, Kent Conrad, Dick Durbin, Jack \n           Reed.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two amendments \nthat I have filed to this bill, Nos. 1027 and 1023. I do not intend to \noffer them at this time, but they raise important issues that I would \nlike to highlight.\n  I want to begin by thanking the chairman, Senator Kennedy, and \nranking member, Senator Enzi, for their hard work on this bill. \nTogether, we made significant progress yesterday by adopting an \nambitious amendment to improve our food safety system for both humans \nand pets.\n  I also want to thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi for agreeing to work \non a comprehensive food safety package. That commitment is not taken \nlightly, and I look forward to working with them on this comprehensive \npackage.\n  Although we took great strides yesterday with respect to food safety, \nthere are two important areas where the FDA is limited in its ability \nto protect our food supply. These weaknesses have been exposed in \nrecent recalls: the E. coli spinach contamination; the peanut butter \nrecall; and, most recently, the expanding pet food recall that has \nentered, or at least come very close to entering, the human food \nsupply.\n  The first weakness is that the FDA lacks the authority to issue a \nrecall or pull defective products from shelves to protect consumers.\n  This is surprising to many people, but here is a quote from the FDA \nwebsite, summarizing its recall authorities:\n\n       The manufacturers or distributors of the product carry out \n     most recalls of products regulated by FDA voluntarily. In \n     some instances, a company discovers that one of its products \n     is defective and recalls it entirely on its own. In others, \n     FDA informs a company of findings that one of its products is \n     defective and suggests or requests a recall. Usually, the \n     company will comply.\n\n  This is true. Most often, companies comply, and there are penalties \nfor failing to recall.\n  However, sometimes companies recognize that they have a problem but \nchoose not to recall a product because they are afraid of upsetting \nconsumer confidence or losing market share. The FDA has reported \nmultiple instances of firms failing to recall or recall in a timely \nfashion.\n  In the pet food recall, companies have time and time again expanded \ntheir recalls, and the process has lasted more than 6 weeks. Just \nyesterday Menu Foods, the first company to recall on March 16, 2007, \nexpanded its recall yet again. This recall was for products made during \nthe same period of time as the other recalled products announced on \nMarch 16. Menu Foods has also announced an expanding date range of \ncontaminated product.\n  This same weakness was on display in 2002 in the ConAgra beef recall.\n  Unfortunately, without the power of mandatory recall, the FDA is in a \nweaker position to force companies to announce recalls quickly or to \nthoroughly study the extent of a recall. The result is slow, uneven, \nvoluntary recalls that leave consumers at risk.\n  The Consumer Protection Safety Commission, the EPA, and even the FDA \nwith respect to infant formula have recall authority. Why, then, does \nthe FDA not have that authority for the other foods it regulates?\n  This authority would expedite the speed and thoroughness of voluntary \nrecalls, protect consumers, and protect industries against bad actions \nthat threaten consumer confidence.\n  A revision of recall authority is very much overdue, and my amendment \nwould provide that. I hope that this issue will be seriously considered \nin the broader package of food safety reform.\n  The second area I would like to raise is the lack of resources for \nthe FDA's food safety efforts.\n  One of the most significant aspects of the pet food recall and other \nfood contaminations we have observed in recent years is that the FDA is \nstruggling with its increasing responsibilities and its current level \nof resources.\n  If we look at the increasing volume of food that the United States \nimports each year, it is clear why this is a problem. In 2003, the \nUnited States imported $45.6 billion of agricultural products. Today, \nthat number is $64 billion. Agricultural imports from China alone have \nnearly doubled from $1.2 billion to $2.1 billion.\n  Much of the responsibility for overseeing and inspecting the safety \nof these imports rests with the FDA. However, due to fairly flat \nbudgets, the overall number of inspectors looking at these shipments \nand at domestic food processors actually has decreased from 2003 to the \npresent from a level of more than 3,000 inspectors to about 2,700 \ninspectors today.\n  Less than 1.5 percent of these imports are inspected by the FDA, and \nthe FDA lacks the resources and authorities to certify the standards of \nour trading partners.\n  This situation presents an economic, public health, and bioterrorism \nrisk to the United States. The CDC estimates that 76 million Americans \nbecome sick from food borne illnesses each year. More than 300,000 are \nhospitalized and 5,000 die each year.\n  We clearly need to review the FDA's funding to ensure it has the \nresources necessary to safeguard the 80 percent of our food supply that \nit is responsible for regulating.\n  The FDA office that is responsible for food imports, the Center for \nFood Safety and Nutrition, is also responsible for regulating $417 \nbillion of domestic food and $59 billion of cosmetics. This includes \npoints of entry into the United States, approximately 300,000 food \nestablishments, and 3,500 cosmetic firms. President Bush has requested \nonly $467 million for fiscal year 2008 for this department to regulate \nall of this activity, and only $312 million of that amount would be for \ninspectors.\n  Therefore, I am pursuing two tracks in this area. Last week, I sent a \nletter to Chairman Kohl and Senator Bennett of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee, which funds the FDA, asking for a \nsignificant increase in the level of funding for the FDA Foods Program. \nI hope my colleagues will join me in this effort.\n  Secondly, the amendment I have filed to this bill would direct the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to study the feasibility of a \nuser fee program for foods that would incorporate lessons learned from \nthe prescription drug user fee program. This study would present \nvarious options on creating a user fee program for foods that could \nincrease the resources and capabilities of the FDA in this area. \nSpecifically, it calls for legislative recommendations that analyze the \nexpected revenues for the FDA, as well as the costs to industry by \nsector.\n  For the sake of improving food safety, I think it is vital that we \nexplore the various options for providing the FDA with adequate \nresources.\n  Again, I will not offer this amendment at this time, but I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting such a study in the future as \nCongress deals with broad food safety reform.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, a number of questions have been raised \nabout how the Durbin amendment on food safety, adopted yesterday by a \nunanimous vote, would affect regulation of dietary supplements.\n  I wanted to take this opportunity to clarify the record.\n  First, let me indicate my support for the efforts of the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin. The recent misfortunes\n\n[[Page S5558]]\n\nwith peanut butter, spinach, and pet food show me that our Nation's \nfood safety policies are pitifully lacking. Therefore, I am supportive \nof Senator Durbin's work and also the considerable work of Senator Enzi \nand his staff to resolve problems that were found with the draft \namendment.\n  For the edification of my colleagues, section 201ff of the Federal \nFood, Drug and Cosmetic Act, FFDCA, contains the definition of dietary \nsupplements. That definition includes a proviso that supplements are to \nbe considered foods, except in the instance when a product makes a drug \nclaim. In other words, by Federal law, dietary supplements are \ngenerally considered to be foods.\n  It is for this reason that the language of the original Durbin \namendment establishing a new adulterated food registry could have been \nread to apply to dietary supplements.\n  This raised problems for me, and indeed for our colleague Senator \nHarkin, since we had spent more than 2 years working with Senators \nDurbin, Kennedy, and Enzi to draft, pass and enact the Dietary \nSupplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, Public Law \n109-462. That law authorizes a new program so that reports of serious \nadverse events related to the use of a dietary supplement or over-the-\ncounter drug would be reported to the Food and Drug Administration, \nFDA, on a priority basis.\n  As I said, the Durbin amendment contemplates a new adulterated food \nregistry. Under the provisions establishing that registry, reports of \nadulterated foods would be made by many, if not all, of the same \nparties who are required to file reports of serious adverse events \nassociated with the use of dietary supplements under Public Law 109-\n462. And so passage of the Durbin amendment could be seen to supersede \nthe law we enacted last year for supplements, which I am relieved to \nhear was not the intent of our colleague, Senator Durbin.\n  Consequently, the amendment we adopted yesterday contains language \nthat Senator Harkin and I suggested to make certain that dietary \nsupplements would not be covered by the new food safety language and \nthus last year's law would not be superseded. To reassure those who are \ninterested in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, DSHEA, I \nwanted to take a moment to outline those changes.\n  First, there is new language in the section establishing the \nadulterated food registry to express the sense of the Senate that: (1) \nDSHEA has established the legal framework to ensure that dietary \nsupplements are safe and properly labeled foods; (2) the Dietary \nSupplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act has \nestablished a mandatory reporting system of serious adverse events for \nnonprescription drugs and dietary supplements sold and consumed in the \nUnited States; and (3) the adverse events reporting system under that \nact will serve as the early warning system for any potential public \nhealth issues associated with the use of these food products.\n  In addition, language contained in the Durbin amendment modifies the \ndefinition of supplement contained in 201ff of the FFDCA so that \nsupplements will not be considered foods for the purpose of the new \nadulterated foods registry. This in no way would alter the time-honored \nconclusion of the Congress that supplements are to be considered foods. \nOn the contrary, all it would do is exempt supplements from the \nregistry.\n  These changes, all contained in the amendment which was approved \nyesterday, make clear that there are no new dietary supplement \nrequirements in the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act. It \nis my hope this will reassure the many who have expressed concern that \nCongress was inadvertently repealing Public Law 109-462.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to make a correction to the record. \nEarlier today, I erroneously named Senator Leahy as a cosponsor of my \namendment No. 991. Senator Leahy is not a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I thank the chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/03/senate-section/article/S5558-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Joint Committee on \nthe Library, I want to take this opportunity to recognize the symbolic \nhandover of the historic 1507 Martin Waldseemiller Map from German \nChancellor Angela Merkel to the American people. This event took place \nMonday at the Library of Congress.\n  The map is often referred to as ``America's birth certificate.'' It \nwas designed and printed by Martin Waldseemiller, a 16th century \nscholar and cartographer who worked in France. This mapmaker departed \nfrom accepted knowledge of the world at that time. He portrayed, in \nremarkably accurate fashion, the Western Hemisphere separating two huge \nand separate bodies of water, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n  There were 1,000 copies of the map printed from woodcuts, but only a \nsingle surviving copy exists today. The Library of Congress worked for \ndecades to acquire this map from its owners. The map was housed for \nmore than 350 years in the 16th century castle belonging to the family \nof Prince Johannes Waldburg-Wolfegg in southern Germany. The map was \nlong thought lost, but it was rediscovered in storage in the castle in \n1901.\n  In 1992, knowing of the Library's great interest in acquiring the \nmap, Prince Waldburg-Wolfegg notified the Library that the German \nnational government and the Baden-Wurttemberg state government had \ngranted an export license. This license permitted the map, which is \nconsidered a German national treasure, to come to the Library of \nCongress.\n  The purchase of the map was accomplished through a combination of \nappropriated funds and matching private funds. Congress has played an \nimportant role in making this acquisition possible, as it has \nthroughout the Library's history. Congress's first major purchase was \nThomas Jefferson's library, which is the seed of the vast collections \nthe Library holds today. Another once-in-a-lifetime purchase made \npossible by congressional support is the Gutenberg Bible, which is on \ndisplay in the Jefferson Building.\n  The Library will begin displaying the map to the public in the Thomas \nJefferson Building later this year. The map will be part of the \nLibrary's new visitor's experience. As an important acquisition to the \nLibrary's treasures, the map will be on view for limited periods of \ntime as preservation standards permit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/03/senate-section/article/S5558-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5558-S5559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICA COMPETES ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a brief moment \nabout recent Senate approval of the America COMPETES Act.\n  This legislation is the product of several years of work by many \nindividuals here in the Senate and it was immensely gratifying to see \nthis bill pass the Senate. For the last 3 years Senators from numerous \ncommittees, Republicans and Democrats, have worked together on this \nlegislation. They saw America falling behind the rest of the world in \nmath and science and realized the need to do something. Well I believe \nthis bill is going to do that something. It will double spending on \nphysical science research, provide money to recruit 10,000 new math and \nscience teachers and retrain hundreds of thousands of our existing \nones. This bill is a huge step in the right direction for our country, \na step that could not have been taken by just one Senator or one party. \nIn these often partisan times, the America COMPETES Act is a fine \nexample of what this body can accomplish when it works together in a \nbipartisan manner.\n  I am very proud of the work my colleague from New Mexico Senator \nBingaman, Senator Alexander and I put into this legislation. I am proud \nthat the members of our committee, Energy and Natural Resources, \ncontinue to work in this bipartisan way.\n  Additionally, I ask unanimous consent that two articles concerning \nthe America COMPETES Act, one from the\n\n[[Page S5559]]\n\nSanta Fe New Mexican, the West's oldest newspaper, and one by David \nBroder of the Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Santa Fe New Mexican, May 3, 2007]\n\n           Jeff, Pete Provide Boost For Scientific Resurgence\n\n       David Broder's right: Senate approval of the America \n     COMPETES Act, he notes in today's column, is big news. This \n     nation lurched from lethargy to the moon during the dozen \n     exciting years that followed Russia's launch of a man-made \n     earth satellite--then most of us went back to our beer and \n     barbecues, leaving all too few dedicated individuals fighting \n     to keep us in the big leagues of pure science and high \n     technology. Thus this act.\n       It might have gotten short shrift from the national press, \n     but the importance of this bill wasn't lost on The New \n     Mexican's Andy Lenderman: He reported, on the front page of \n     our local news section Saturday that this was overdue action \n     on the math-and-science front.\n       The measure, the full name of which is America Creating \n     Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Education \n     and Science Act of 2007--an aggravating cuteness whose \n     creator should be banished to Madison Avenue--features a \n     four-year, $16-billion authorization of new money to invest \n     heavily in physical-sciences research, recruitment of new \n     math and science teachers nationwide, while updating those in \n     the field. It would be part of a $60 billion campaign to put \n     America back--and in some areas keep it--at the cutting edge \n     of theoretical and applied science.\n       Lenderman noticed that the bill, with Majority Leader Harry \n     Reid's sponsorship, was approved by an 88-8 tally. But at \n     least as important as the political weight was the groundwork \n     laid by New Mexico's senators:\n       Jeff Bingaman, who has spent so much of his Capitol Hill \n     career urging his colleagues to support the sciences and \n     academics in general, sponsored a 2005 study--the report of \n     which carried a title both ominous and promising: ``Rising \n     Above the Gathering Storm.'' It told our nation of the \n     challenge from China, India and other nations in science and \n     technology--which could cost our country its competitiveness \n     in world markets.\n       If evidence were needed to support that concern, we need \n     only look at our schools: Only 29 percent of eighth-graders \n     nationwide tested proficient in science. In New Mexico, only \n     18 percent did.\n       This isn't a Sputnik situation of 50 years ago, where \n     within four months America had its own satellite in orbit \n     while back on earth science fairs were the rage; this is a \n     case of math-dedicated cultures creeping past one of B.A. \n     generalists dedicated to fun, comfort and prestige predicated \n     on material goods.\n       It'll take more than money to rebuild momentum: Some of \n     America's many Renaissance-person scientists must be \n     persuaded to sing the glories of research--or at least the \n     joys and rewards of what sometimes results from it. Computers \n     as tools and toys, too, should help.\n       What's great is that Bingaman and fellow Sen. Pete \n     Domenici, so often teammates in bipartisan congressional \n     initiatives, have put their skills and influence together for \n     this push. They're their parties' highest-ranking members of \n     the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Domenici \n     still is influential on the budget and appropriations \n     committees.\n       New Mexico, with its national scientific laboratories, \n     stands to benefit from this initiative--which comes, we hope, \n     en buena hora for the people of our region: Just last week, \n     contractors at Los Alamos National Laboratory laid off scores \n     more of the workforce.\n       The construction and maintenance people there have always \n     been at the mercy of LANL's whims, and those of its academic \n     and technical allies. But some of their children are seeing \n     the need for higher education to provide them more steady \n     work. The America COMPETES Act could raise awareness of, and \n     provide support for, generations of homegrown scientific and \n     technical people.\n       The bill still must make it through the House of \n     Representatives--and as Broder implies, our nation's news \n     media could and should help the effort along.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                 COMPETES Act Is Real Boost, Real News\n\n                           (By David Broder)\n\n       On Monday, with few of his colleagues present and the \n     Senate press galleries largely unoccupied, Sen. Lamar \n     Alexander of Tennessee took the floor to make one of those \n     personal statements that fill the Congressional Record, but \n     rarely go any further.\n       ``Last week,'' he said, ``while the media covered Iraq and \n     U.S. attorneys, the Senate spent three days debating and \n     passing perhaps the most important piece of legislation of \n     this two-year session. Almost no one noticed.''\n       Alexander has a point. The bill, boldly named ``the America \n     COMPETES Act,'' authorized an additional $16 billion over \n     four years as part of a $60 billion effort to ``double \n     spending for physical sciences research, recruit 10,000 new \n     math and science teachers and retrain 250,000 more, provide \n     grants to researchers and invest more in high-risk, high-\n     payoff research.''\n       As Alexander noted, ``these were recommendations of a \n     National Academy of Sciences task force'' that he and others \n     had asked to tell Congress the 10 things it most urgently \n     needs to do ``to help America keep its brainpower advantage \n     so we can keep our jobs from going to China and India.''\n       Back in December 2005, I wrote about the report that \n     Alexander, and Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici, both of \n     New Mexico, had requested--and about the bipartisan support \n     that seemed to be available for this ``competitiveness'' \n     agenda. I even suggested that it was a natural topic for \n     President Bush's 2006 State of the Union address, if he \n     wanted to break through the growing partisan roadblocks on \n     Capitol Hill.\n       The President included these ideas in his message, but did \n     little to build public support or press Congress for action. \n     Nonetheless, major elements of the bill passed the Senate \n     last year, only to bog down in the bitterly divided House.\n       But persistence paid off. As Alexander said, ``Senators and \n     their staffs worked across party lines for two years. Senior \n     committee members, chairmen and ranking members, waived \n     jurisdictional prerogatives. The administration participated \n     in extensive `homework sessions' with senators and outside \n     experts. The effort was so bipartisan that when the Senate \n     shifted to the Democrats in January, the new majority leader \n     and minority leader introduced the same bill their \n     predecessors had in the last Congress. Seventy senators co-\n     sponsored the legislation. . . . The final vote was 88-8.''\n       The fight is far from over.\n       The House has yet to act on most of the provisions, and \n     finding the money to carry it out will not be easy. Alexander \n     and Bingaman added an amendment to the budget resolution, \n     allowing $1 billion of extra spending for the first-year \n     costs of the program.\n       Domenici and other appropriators will try to steer funds in \n     that direction, Alexander said.\n       The Tennessee Republican's larger point is that this is the \n     model that Congress and the president need to follow--if any \n     of the major challenges facing the country are to be met.\n       ``There are issues that are too big for either party to \n     solve by itself,'' Alexander told me. ``Globalization and \n     competitiveness are two of them. Immigration is the next one \n     on the agenda. And then there is health care.''\n       He pointed out that the bipartisan breakfast sessions he \n     and Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut have been hosting \n     regularly this year have included discussions of health \n     policy.\n       As a byproduct of the breakfasts, ``10 of us, five \n     Republicans and five Democrats, have written the President \n     saying that we are ready to work with him on a bill that has \n     two principles--universal coverage and private markets. We \n     hope he responds.''\n       Iraq looms as the supreme test, of course, and Alexander, a \n     Bush supporter, nonetheless says ``it was a mistake'' for the \n     president not to seize on the Baker-Hamilton commission \n     recommendations as the basis for a bipartisan answer to the \n     dilemma of the war.\n       ``It's still sitting there on the shelf,'' he said, \n     implying that Bush will have to come back to Baker-Hamilton \n     at some point.\n       Meantime, Alexander has a gentle reminder for the press \n     that our mind-set means that ``unfortunately, bipartisan \n     success, even on the biggest, most complex issues, has an \n     excellent chance of remaining a secret.\n       ``Despite the size of the accomplishment, the passage of \n     the 208-page America COMPETES Act was barely noticed by the \n     major media.\n       This is not a complaint, merely an observation. More than \n     ever, the media, outside interest groups, and party \n     structures reward conflict and the taking of irreconcilable \n     positions. There is little reward for reconciling principled \n     positions into legislation.''\n       Sadly, I think he is right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/03/senate-section/article/S5559-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5559-S5560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     CONGRATULATING UNITED PARCEL SERVICE ON ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate the United Parcel Service on its 100th anniversary. In \nthese 100 years, many of us have grown to see UPS's ubiquitous brown \nvans as symbols of reliability and to know and trust the remarkable \npeople who drive them. As UPS has evolved to become the largest package \ndelivery company in the world, it has become a cornerstone of commerce \nin America and a vital part of my State's economy.\n  When James E. Casey founded UPS in 1907 with a $100 loan from a \nfriend, surely it would have been beyond even his wildest dreams that \nthe company would grow to deliver 15.6 million documents and packages \nevery day, to employ 360,600 employees here in the United States, and \nto make deliveries to over 200 countries and territories throughout the \nworld. By constantly innovating and improving service and\n\n[[Page S5560]]\n\nthrough the dedication of its employees, UPS has reached the pinnacle \nof its industry and has set the standard by which its competitors must \nfollow.\n  I am proud to say that since opening their first facility in Newark, \nNJ, in 1928, UPS has maintained a significant presence in my home State \nof New Jersey. It employs more than 18,000 people statewide, making it \none of the 10 largest employers in our State. I recently had the \nprivilege and opportunity to visit a UPS hub in Edison to help \ncommemorate UPS's 100th anniversary. At the Edison facility, 3,000 \ndedicated employees process and sort packages originating from and \ndestined for points all over our State. Individuals and businesses \nacross New Jersey rely on their efforts every day, and the intricate \nand sophisticated processes used by these employees ensure that \nimportant packages and documents are delivered on time.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in congratulating UPS on 100 \nyears in business. I personally extend my best wishes to the company \nand its employees in New Jersey and across the world for many more \nyears of success and prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/03/senate-section/article/S5560-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO WALTER M. ``WALLY'' SCHIRRA\n\n Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I want to commend a great \nAmerican, Astronaut Walter M. ``Wally'' Schirra, who passed away today. \nCaptain Schirra leaves behind a praiseworthy legacy as a Navy veteran, \na pioneer for NASA and of outer-space exploration, a television \ncommentator, and a devoted husband and father.\n  Captain Schirra began his distinguished career in the U.S. Navy when \nhe arrived in Annapolis in the early days of World War II; he graduated \nfrom the U.S. Naval Academy in 1945 and soon became a pilot through \nNaval Flight Training in Pensacola, FL. Through an exchange program \nwith the Air Force during the Korean war, he proudly served our Nation \nas a pilot of F-86 Sabres.\n  He carried this dedicated service to America into the stratosphere \nand beyond, making history as one of the ``Original Seven'' astronauts \nnamed by NASA to the Mercury program. On October 3, 1962, Captain \nSchirra became the first person ever to orbit the Earth 6 times. He is \nunique in that he is the only astronaut to have flown in NASA's first 3 \nspace programs: Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. After retiring from NASA, \nhe later served with distinction as a widely known television \ncommentator for CBS.\n  The passion that Wally Schirra had for space exploration and his \naccomplishments as a pioneer astronaut underscore the importance of our \ncontinuing to strengthen the NASA space program. The Apollo 7 mission--\nunder the command of Schirra--proved to those at NASA that they had the \nability to send a spacecraft into orbit around the moon. Since then, \nNASA has taken many giant leaps. We must continue the exploration, \nresearch, and discovery that have all constituted NASA's trademark for \ndecades.\n  Exploration into outer space helps us to better understand the world \nin which we live. NASA understood this well when they sent Captain \nWally Schirra into outers pace nearly 45 years ago; I am hopeful that \nthis vision and reach will only continue to grow with time.\n  On behalf of Florida and the people of the United States, I thank \nCaptain Schirra for his service to country and the science he helped to \nadvance. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/03/senate-section/article/S5560-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING MAINELY TRUSSES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize, for the \nweek of April 29, an exceptional entrepreneur from my home State who \nhas been awarded the Maine 2007 Small Business Person of the Year, \nMichael Boulet. Mike is truly one of our Nation's shining small \nbusiness success stories. His company--Mainely Trusses--exemplifies the \nheart and soul of the American dream becoming reality.\n  Last March, I had the privilege to witness first hand the products \nand services that Mike's company provides when he was awarded an \nintermediary relending program loan from Kennebec Valley Council of \nGovernments.\n  Mike's investment in his company through the Small Business \nAdministrations' Maine Small Business Development Center and Costal \nEnterprises, Inc., has paid tremendous dividends for the future of \nMainely Trusses--with a state-of-the-art facility, new technologies, a \ndedication to customer service, and full benefits for his employees. In \nfact, Mainely Trusses is so advanced that they use all laser beams to \nconstruct the trusses which is completely driven by computer software \nand highly skilled employees.\n  Since Mike has been president, Mainely Trusses has shown no signs of \nslowing down, growing from 3 to 50 employees over the last 15 years--a \ntremendous achievement for any business. Think about it--that is a \n1,600-percent increase. Just imagine if we had that kind of explosive \nprogress in the U.S. Congress, then we would really be onto something.\n  And what is all the more remarkable is Mike's courage to take on the \nfamily business after his father, John Boulet, passed away in a work-\nrelated accident. But Mike doesn't just reserve his considerable \ntalents and energy for his business--he also exhibits those traits \nthrough his tireless leadership within the community whether serving as \na member of the Maine Merchants Association Workers Compensation Trust \nFund Broad of Trustees, chairing the board for the Central Maine Youth \nHockey Association, supporting Habitat for Humanity, or his involvement \nwith Vietnamese orphanages and children's center.\n  The fact is small businesses are the critical element in our efforts \nto strengthen and bolster the Nation's economy. It used to be said, \n``What's good for General Motors is good for the Nation.'' Now, it is \nwhat is good for small business is best for the Nation and job growth.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am reminded daily of the immense--and often \noverlooked--contributions that risk-takers and dreamers like Mike and \ncountless Americans make. They are the unsung heroes of our Nation's \neconomy, creating two-thirds of all new jobs throughout our country.\n  That is why I appreciate SBA's commitment to providing our Nation's \nsmall businesses, as they have helped Mike, with the financial and \nbusiness development tools to help them grow and excel. With more than \n5.3 million jobs created or retained since 1999, this is proof-positive \nthat our investment in the SBA is paying tremendous dividends to the \nNation's economy.\n  We understand that Maine is a veritable ``hotbed'' for small business \nand a small business laboratory for the country. This year, at the \nvanguard of Maine entrepreneurs stands Mike Boulet. Once again, I would \nlike congratulate Mike for being an exceptional model for Maine and the \nNation. We here in the Senate wish Mike all the best for many more \nsuccessful years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/03/senate-section/article/S5560-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5560-S5561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO VINCENZO ANTONIO MANNO\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I honor the musical genius \nof fellow Ohioan Vincenzo Antonio Manno, a renowned opera singer and \ndevoted professor of music.\n  Mr. Manno was born and raised in my great hometown of Cleveland, OH. \nIn fact, he grew up right down the street from my family in the \nCollinwood neighborhood--the same neighborhood I live in still today. \nBut his musical gift eventually took him far beyond Collinwood to some \nof the finest music institutions in Europe.\n  Cleveland's rich cultural environment and outstanding music tradition \nprepared Mr. Manno for his world-renowned career. Before completing his \nstudies at Oberlin College under the tutelage of Professor Richard \nMill, Mr. Manno was trained at the Cleveland Music School Settlement \nunder Burton Garlinghouse and John Shurtleff; at summer sessions in \nChautauqua, NY, under Josephine Antoine; and at the Cleveland Institute \nof Music under Eleonor Steber.\n  After receiving his degree from Oberlin, Mr. Manno continued his \nstudies on a Fulbright Fellowship in Italy at Santa Ceclia in Rome with \nEttore Campogalliani. His private studies in Milan continued with Dr. \nOtto Mueller, who was affiliated for years with the Metropolitan Opera \nHouse of New York.\n\n[[Page S5561]]\n\n  After Dr. Mueller's death, Mr. Manno was accepted into the \nprestigious private singing school directed by Professor Dennis Hall in \nBern, Switzerland. As a result of his studies with Professor Hall, Mr. \nManno was encouraged to open a voice studio in Milan, which has become \na mecca for singers from around the world.\n  Mr. Manno's singing career embraces a wide repertory--from the \nbaroque to the modern--and he has sung with opera companies around the \nworld. His radio performances within Europe have been admired by the \npublic and critics alike. And, he is currently a permanent member of \nthe Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Italy.\n  Not all accomplished musicians make good teachers, but Mr. Manno's \nteaching career has taken great strides in the past 10 years. He has \nbeen recognized for teaching and helping emerging singers on many \ncontinents. He also holds seminars and master classes on singing style.\n  Mr. Manno is regularly invited to teach singing technique at the \nworld-renowned Accademia dei Giovani Cantanti--Academy of Young \nSingers--under the artistic direction of Leyla Gencer, affiliated with \nthe Teotro alla Scala and the Accademia Internazionale della Musica--\nInternational Music Academy--in Milan. The students of Vincenzo Manno \ncan be heard regularly around the world in opera houses, recording \nstudios, concerts halls, and radio and television stations.\n  Mr. Manno also lends his expertise in pop music, broadway and \noperetta. He has guided many Italian pop singers through recording \nsessions and is regularly contacted by Italian television to help \narrange songs for singers and give advice on new compositions.\n  For all he has accomplished, Mr. Manno has received several awards. \nHe received the ``Grand Prix du Disque'' for baroque music recorded \nwith the great Swiss conductor Edwin Loehrer, and the ``Best Recording \nof the Year'' from Gramophone Magazine for his second CD solo recording \nof tenor music of the 17th century, ``Strana Armonia d'Amore'' with \nRoberto Gini.\n  Mr. President, on the 40th anniversary of his career, it is my \npleasure to honor Vincenzo Antonio Manno for his great success and \nsignificant contributions to the world of music.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/03/senate-section/article/S5561-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/03/senate-section/article/S5561-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, a withdrawal and a treaty which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/03/senate-section/article/S5561-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 1301.

A bill to establish a grant program to facilitate the \ncreation of methamphetamine precursor electronic logbook systems, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the bipartisan \nMethamphetamine Production Prevention Act of 2007. I am pleased to have \nthe support and cosponsorship of Senator Grassley for this important \nlegislation, and I look forward to working closely with Chairman Leahy \nand Ranking Member Specter to advance the bill through the judiciary \nCommittee and to secure its enactment into law.\n  The Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act will take the next step \ntoward wiping out the domestic production of methamphetamine, or \n``meth.'' The bill will make it easier to use electronic logbook \nsystems in order to monitor sales of meth precursor drugs and notify \nenforcement agencies when individuals illegally stockpile these \nprecursors by traveling from pharmacy to pharmacy.\n  This legislation is endorsed by the National Alliance of State Drug \nEnforcement Agencies, the National Narcotics Officers' Associations' \nCoalition, the National Criminal Justice Association, the National \nSheriffs' Association, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the \nNational Troopers Coalition, the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, the National Association of Counties, and the Community \nAnti-Drug Coalitions of America. I also want to commend and thank \nIllinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan and her staff for their \nassistance in preparing this legislation.\n  For years, the manufacture and use of methamphetamine have plagued \ncommunities in Illinois and throughout the Nation. Meth is unique among \nillegal drugs in that its harms stem not only from its distribution and \nuse, but also from the clandestine manufacturing labs that meth \n``cooks'' use to make meth. These labs pose serious dangers to those \nwho live nearby and to the surrounding environment. Law enforcement \nagencies in Illinois and elsewhere are forced to devote a significant \npercentage of their time to locating, busting, and cleaning up meth \nlabs.\n  The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, ``Combat Meth Act,'' enacted \nin 2006, took several important steps to reduce domestic meth \nmanufacturing. These steps included limiting the amount of meth \nprecursor drug products that a purchaser can buy, such as \npseudoephedrine, and requiring pharmacies to keep written or electronic \nlogbooks recording each precursor purchase. The Combat Meth Act has led \nto a drop in the number of meth labs discovered in many States.\n  However, domestic meth cooks have begun adapting to the Combat Meth \nAct. They have figured out how to circumvent the act's restrictions by \n``smurfing,'' or purchasing illegal amounts of meth precursor drugs by \ntraveling to multiple pharmacies that keep written logbooks and buying \nlegal quantities at each one. According to Illinois law enforcement \nauthorities, smurfing now accounts for at least 90 percent of the \npseudoephedrine used to make meth in Illinois.\n  The next step in combating domestic meth production is to promote the \nuse of effective electronic logbook systems. Law enforcement experts \nagree that if pharmacies maintain electronic logbook information and \nshare that information with appropriate law enforcement and regulatory \nagencies, this information can be used to prevent the sale of meth \nprecursor drugs in excess of legal limits, and to identify and \nprosecute ``smurfs'' and meth cooks.\n  This legislation, the Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act, \nfacilitates and encourages the use of meth precursor electronic logbook \nsystems in several ways.\n  First, the bill revises the technical logbook requirements in the \nCombat Meth Act. While the Combat Meth Act provides for the use of \nelectronic logbook systems, several of the act's requirements are not \ntailored for logbooks kept in electronic form. For example, under the \nact, a prospective purchaser must ``enter[] into the logbook his or her \nname, address, and the date and time of the sale.'' This requirement is \nunwieldy for retailers who use electronic logbook systems, because many \npurchasers cannot type quickly or accurately. The Methamphetamine \nProduction Prevention Act would permit retailers' employees to type the \nname and address of a purchaser into an electronic logbook system, and \nwould allow retailers to use software programs that automatically \nrecord the date and time of each sale. Under the bill, a retail \nemployee would have to ensure that the name the employee types into the \nsystem matches the name on the ID that the purchaser is currently \nrequired to present.\n  Also, the Combat Meth Act requires purchasers to sign a logbook at \nthe time of sale, regardless of whether the seller uses a paper or \nelectronic logbook. Collecting and retaining electronic signatures \nrequires a large amount of computer memory, and the transmission of \nthese electronic signature files to law enforcement agencies does not \nprovide a significant law enforcement benefit. Sellers who use \nelectronic logbook systems should be given the option of collecting \nsignatures on paper, as long as those signatures are stored for the \nrequisite 2-year retention period, and as long as the signatures are \nclearly linked to the electronically-captured sale information.\n  The Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act would permit a seller \nwho uses an electronic logbook to collect purchaser signatures through \nany of three different methods: (1) having the purchaser sign an \nelectronic signature device; (2) having the purchaser sigh a bound \npaper book in which the signature is placed adjacent to a unique \nidentifier number, or a printed sticker that clearly links the \nsignature to the purchaser's logbook information; or (3) having the \npurchaser sign a document that the seller prints out at the time of \nsale that displays the required logbook information and contains a \nsignature line. These options ensure that each purchaser's signature \nwill be collected, but they give sellers flexibility in developing \ncost-effective electronic logbook systems.\n  The Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act would also create a \nsmall but important Federal grant program to help States plan, create \nor enhance electronic logbook systems. Several States, including \nOklahoma, Arkansas, West Virginia and Kentucky, have already begun \ndeveloping electronic logbook systems, and many other States \nare considering them. The Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act \nauthorizes $3 million in grants\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\nto States and localities, with grants capped at a maximum of $300,000. \nThe bill imposes a 25-percent State matching requirement, to ensure \nthat States have, invested in their logbook systems and have a stake in \nensuring the successful operation of these systems.\n\n  Instead of mandating how States design their electronic logbook \nsystems, the bill provides incentives for States to design effective \nlogbook systems. Because meth smurfs frequently travel across State \nlines to stockpile meth precursors, State efforts to develop electronic \nlogbook systems will be more successful if those efforts are \ncoordinated with the activities of other states. The bill would \ntherefore give priority to grant applicants whose logbook systems are \ndeveloped in consultation with a working group of key Federal, State \nand private stakeholders spearheaded by the National Alliance for Model \nState Drug Laws. This working group will advise States on best \npractices in developing logbook systems and will help States develop \nlogbook systems that are compatible and interoperable with other \nsystems across the country.\n  The bill also gives a grantmaking preference to applicants whose \nlogbook systems are statewide, are capable of sharing information in \nreal time, and are designed to share information across jurisdictional \nboundaries. At the same time, the bill preserves the privacy safeguards \ncurrently established under the Combat Meth Act and State law. To \npromote accountability, the bill requires the Attorney General to \nprovide an annual report to Congress that evaluates the grant program \nand its effectiveness in curtailing meth production.\n  The Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act does not mandate the \nuse of electronic logbook systems, nor does it mandate the features \nthat an electronic logbook system must possess. The bill respects the \nfact that States have enacted various types of anti-meth restrictions \nabove the Federal Combat Meth Act baseline, and that pharmacies and \nretailers in different States have different capabilities with regard \nto electronic tracking. At the same time, we want to encourage States \nto coordinate their development of methamphetamine precursor electronic \nlogbook systems so that smurfs will not be able to supply their meth \nlabs by hopping across State lines. Our bill aims to strike a balance \nby coordinating the various State efforts, while still allowing States \nthe flexibility to innovate and to respond to their specific State \nneeds.\n  There are many actions besides promoting electronic logbook systems \nthat we must take to address the scourge of methamphetamine. For \nexample, we must provide for the prevention and treatment of meth use, \nand we must also prevent the illegal distribution of meth and its \nprecursors over the Internet and from other countries. However, law \nenforcement experts agree that electronic logbook systems are an \nimportant tool in our effort to combat meth, particularly domestic meth \nlabs. We can, and should, do more to help make these logbook systems \nwork.\n  By facilitating and encouraging the use of electronic logbook \nsystems, the Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act will help wipe \nout domestic meth labs and the environmental and social harms they \ncause. The bill will also help free up law enforcement resources from \nmeth lab busts and cleanup, allowing our law enforcement agencies to \nfocus on other crime prevention and enforcement efforts. The production \nof methamphetamine has plagued our communities for far too long, and \nthis legislation takes a critical step to stop it. I urge the Senate to \npass this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1276\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Methamphetamine Production \n     Prevention Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the manufacture, distribution and use of \n     methamphetamine have inflicted damages on individuals, \n     families, communities, businesses, the economy, and the \n     environment throughout the United States;\n       (2) methamphetamine is unique among illicit drugs in that \n     the harms relating to methamphetamine stem not only from its \n     distribution and use, but also from the manufacture of the \n     drug by ``cooks'' in clandestine labs throughout the United \n     States;\n       (3) Federal and State restrictions limiting the sale of \n     legal drug products that contain methamphetamine precursors \n     have reduced the number and size of domestic methamphetamine \n     labs;\n       (4) domestic methamphetamine cooks have managed to \n     circumvent restrictions on the sale of methamphetamine \n     precursors by ``smurfing'', or purchasing impermissibly large \n     cumulative amounts of precursor products by traveling from \n     retailer to retailer and buying permissible quantities at \n     each retailer;\n       (5) although Federal and State laws require retailers of \n     methamphetamine precursor products to keep written or \n     electronic logbooks recording sales of precursor products, \n     retailers are not always required to transmit this logbook \n     information to appropriate law enforcement and regulatory \n     agencies, except upon request;\n       (6) when retailers' logbook information regarding sales of \n     methamphetamine precursor products is kept in a database in \n     an electronic format and transmitted between retailers and \n     appropriate law enforcement and regulatory agencies, such \n     information can be used to further reduce the number of \n     domestic methamphetamine labs by preventing the sale of \n     methamphetamine precursors in excess of legal limits, and by \n     identifying and prosecuting ``smurfs'' and others involved in \n     methamphetamine manufacturing;\n       (7) States and local governments are already beginning to \n     develop such electronic logbook database systems, but they \n     are hindered by a lack of resources;\n       (8) efforts by States and local governments to develop such \n     electronic logbook database systems may also be hindered by \n     logbook recordkeeping requirements contained in section \n     310(e) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 830(e)) \n     that are tailored to written logbooks and not to electronic \n     logbooks; and\n       (9) providing resources to States and localities and making \n     technical corrections to the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic \n     Act of 2005 will allow more rapid and widespread development \n     of such electronic logbook systems, thereby reducing the \n     domestic manufacture of methamphetamine and its associated \n     harms.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Durbin, in introducing the Methamphetamine Production \nPrevention Act of 2007. Together we offer this important legislation in \nan effort to strengthen existing law by providing some necessary \nchanges and updates.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have come to the floor many times to \nspeak about methamphetamine and how it has destroyed individuals, \nfamilies, and\n\n[[Page S5568]]\n\ncommunities across the country. The Midwest was hit especially hard by \nmeth and the impacts of this drug were devastating to rural areas. As \nopposed to other illegal drugs, meth is often times home cooked and \nmade in rural areas using ingredients that are largely available over \nthe counter. I am proud to say that Congress has taken action to attack \nthis problem head on by working to cut off access to these over the \ncounter products that form the basis of the drug.\n  Legislation such as the Combat Methamphetamine Act of 2005, Combat \nMeth Act of 2005, which was included into the USA Patriot Act \nReauthorization in 2005 immediately impacted the production of home \ncooked meth. Just a week ago when I joined with Senator Feinstein in \nintroducing two other separate bills, the Saving Kids from Dangerous \nDrugs Act and the Drug Endangered Children Act, I noted that because of \nthe efforts of Congress in passing the Combat Meth Act, the number of \nclandestine meth lab seizures has dropped across the country.\n  The Combat Meth Act was a tremendous step in the right direction \nlimiting access to psuedoephedrine, PSE, the main ingredient in \nmethamphetamine. The Combat Meth Act required this product to be \nremoved from store shelves and placed behind the counter at pharmacies \nacross the country. It also limited the number of products containing \nPSE a person could buy at once. Further, it required a logbook system \nbe kept by pharmacies containing information regarding the individuals \nthat purchased products containing PSE.\n  Despite these successes, ever determined meth cooks and users have \nlearned how to game this system and continue to produce home grown \nmeth.\n  The preferred method of these meth cooks is to ``smurf'' between \ndifferent pharmacies for PSE products. Smurfing occurs when a person \nvisits a number of different locations buying the legal maximum amount \nof PSE product at each site. The result is an amount of PSE sufficient \nto produce home cooked meth. Smurfing occurs because the Combat Meth \nAct only required that retailers keep a logbook which could be kept on \npaper or electronically. It did not require interoperability or \nelectronic transmission of data. As a result, these unscrupulous \nindividuals have learned that if they provide false information or \nvisit multiple stores, tracking and arresting these individuals is more \ndifficult and time consuming for law enforcement. This is especially \ntrue in metropolitan communities that share a common border, one such \nexample is the Quad Cities on the Iowa/Illinois border.\n\n  Recently, the Quad City Times highlighted the successes of the Combat \nMeth Act in an article titled, The Next Step in Meth War. This article \ndetailed the efforts of a Scott County Deputy and his dedication in \nfighting the meth war. One noteworthy portion of this article raised a \nquestion about the lengths that were required for this deputy to do his \njob in combating mom and pop meth labs. The article stated, ``Now we're \nstuck with this image of a detective in each Iowa county sorting \nthrough thousands of paper forms.'' It read further, ``He must call \ncounty to county to find out if those purchasing the limit in Scott \nCounty might be doing so elsewhere as well.'' This statement gets right \nto the heart of our bill. We can't effectively combat meth if we don't \nclose the smurfing loophole.\n  To address this loophole, Senator Durbin and I have introduced the \nMethamphetamine Production Prevention Act of 2007. This legislation \nwould revise the technical requirements of the Combat Meth Act to allow \nfor electronic logbook systems. The bill would also create a Federal \ngrant program for states looking to create or enhance existing \nelectronic logbook systems. Finally, this bill would prioritize these \nFederal grants to states that design and implement the most effective \nsystems for sharing information via an electronic logbook system.\n  This legislation will take a big step forward in closing this \nloophole that home grown meth cooks abuse. Additionally, it does so \nwithout creating burdensome mandates upon states to meet requirements. \nThis bill facilitates innovation and growth by offering financial \nassistance to states looking to create an electronic logbook system. By \navoiding mandates, this legislation seeks to promote innovation and \ngrowth of electronic logbook systems.\n  This bill has broad support from the law enforcement community and \nhas been endorsed by the National Sheriffs' Association, the National \nNarcotics Officers' Associations' Coalition, National Alliance of State \nDrug Enforcement Agencies, the National Criminal Justice Association, \nthe National Troopers Coalition, the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, the National Association of Counties, and the Community \nAnti-Drug Coalitions of America among others.\n  As you can see, this legislation has a broad base of support. Working \ntogether, state and local governments can use this legislation and \ngrant program to create interoperable networks that will reduce the \nillegal smurfing of PSE products and lead us to the goal of ending \ndomestic production of meth. I urge my colleagues, join us in support \nof this important legislation and pass the Methamphetamine Production \nPrevention Act of 2007 and help wipe out domestic production of meth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Quad-City Times]\n\n                       The Next Step in Meth War\n\n       Scott County Deputy Robert Jackson figures he searched \n     through 12,000 cold medicine receipts to find three possible \n     meth-making offenders. Needles have better odds in haystacks.\n       His diligent work has nailed at least three alleged meth \n     makers who tried to skirt Iowa law restricting purchase of \n     pseudoephedrine, a key ingredient in making the recreational \n     poison.\n       When Iowa lawmakers began talking about toughening meth \n     laws in 2005, we were among those cautious about what that \n     would mean to the privacy and convenience of the 99.9 percent \n     of Iowans who bought cold medicine for their colds. But the \n     scourge that is meth convinced us the intrusion was minor and \n     the impact could be major. We joined those supporting the \n     bill, which became law.\n       Jackson's success in tracking down offenders affirms the \n     intent was correct. ``When I first started doing it, I'd find \n     12 offenders at a time,'' Jackson says of his paper-trail \n     detective work. Meth makers, indeed, were driving from store \n     to store to buy enough of the key ingredient to make enough \n     meth to sell.\n       Now he says the pickings are slimmer. And, he says, the \n     county's biggest pharmacies are talking among themselves, \n     inquiring about people who are trying to buck the limit of \n     7,500 milligrams of pseudoephedrine per month. That's \n     eliminated the high volume meth makers.\n       What's left, Jackson surmises, are personal meth-using \n     addicts who cook smaller amounts for themselves and a little \n     to deal. Jackson warns that meth use still rages, fueled by \n     drugs shipped from southern states. But the dangerous labs, \n     set up in hotels, cars, even public parks, have diminished \n     considerably, thanks to laws restricting access to \n     ingredients.\n       Now we're stuck with this image of a detective in each Iowa \n     county sorting through thousands of paper forms. Although the \n     record-keeping is required, Jackson must get a court order to \n     view the records. He must call county to county to find out \n     if those purchasing the limit in Scott County might be doing \n     so elsewhere as well.\n       We're wondering if a central registry of some sort might \n     help enforcement statewide, alerting authorities to \n     individuals making purchases in multiple counties. Compiling \n     the information electronically at the site of purchase \n     certainly would add costs and require careful planning to \n     assure privacy for the 99 percent of law-abiding \n     psuedoephedrine buyers. But it would trim significant \n     enforcement cost by eliminating the hours that officers like \n     Det. Jackson spend combing paper records. And it would detect \n     meth-makers skirting the law by spreading out their purchases \n     over several counties.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1282. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the exclusion from gross income of certain wages of a certified \nmaster teacher, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as you know, teachers are the most \nvaluable resource when it comes to educating our Nation's children. \nUnder the No Child Left Behind Act, (NCLB), States are required to \nrecruit highly qualified teachers, yet schools in rural or high poverty \nareas have trouble attracting and retaining these teachers. It is for \nthis reason that Senator Snowe and I have joined together to introduce \nThe Master Teacher Act of 2007.\n  We have an education problem in America. The schools that most need\n\n[[Page S5569]]\n\nexperienced educators simply do not have the resources to attract and \nkeep the best teachers. We must give our schools the tools they need to \nprepare our students to succeed.\n  As currently designated by NCLB, 100 percent of our Nation's schools \nmust meet Adequate Yearly Progress, AYP, in reading/language arts and \nmathematics by the 2013/2014 school year. To date, almost 26 percent of \nschools in the U.S. are not making the grade. According to a report \nreleased by the National Education Association last year, fewer schools \nmet AYP in the 2004/2005 school year than the prior school year. In my \nhome State of Maryland, 311 out of 1,429 schools, or almost 22 percent, \ndid not make Adequate Yearly Progress, as defined by the No Child Left \nBehind Act and the State targets. During the 2005-2006 school year, 79 \nschools, or about 6 percent of Maryland's elementary and secondary \nschools had missed Adequate Yearly Progress toward State achievement \ntargets for 5 or more consecutive years. As a result they were placed \nin restructuring and were subject to a variety of major school-wide \nreform strategies. A large majority of these restructuring schools are \nurban schools, and more than half are in the Baltimore City Public \nSchool System.\n\n  According to research, teacher quality is the schooling factor with \nthe most profound effect on student achievement. Good teachers can make \nup to a full year's difference in learning growth for students and \noverwhelm the impact of any other educational investment, including \nsmaller class sizes.\n  Unfortunately, our educational system pairs the children most behind \nwith teachers who, on average, have less experience, less education, \nand less skill than those who teach other children. Certainly, there \nare exceptions, excellent and experienced teachers who have devoted \ntheir lives to at-risk students. But the overall patterns are clear.\n  Despite evidence that teachers become more effective after several \nyears experience, students in high-poverty and high-minority schools \nare assigned to novice teachers almost twice as often as children in \nlow-poverty schools. Classes in high-poverty and high-minority schools \nare much more likely to be taught by teachers without a major or minor \nin the subject they teach. Certainly, there are excellent first-year \nteachers and ineffective veterans. Indeed, mastery of a subject matter \ndoes not necessarily translate into effective teaching. But these \nproxies for teacher effectiveness are backed by substantial bodies of \nresearch. Studies of effective teachers reveal they are distributed \namong our Nation's schools in a manner that actually enlarges \nachievement gaps.\n  We will only close student achievement gaps when we improve teacher \nquality and experience. We must make obtaining advanced training and \nexperience in teaching more accessible and teaching at-risk students \nmore desirable. In short, we must establish a class of ``master \nteachers'' with extensive experience and training who are willing to \nteach for an extended period of time in the schools that need them the \nmost.\n  Fortunately, research also shows even modest monetary incentives \nlower teacher attrition, especially in high-risk school districts. Our \nlegislation will reward master teachers with a 25 percent Federal tax \nexemption on their salary for four years if they agree to teach in a \nschool that is not meeting AYP. A master teacher is a teacher that has \nat least 5 years of teaching experience in a public elementary or \nsecondary school, holds a master's degree, meets the definition of \nhighly qualified as defined by the NCLB, and has obtained advanced \ncertification in their state licensing system. Each State would have a \ncap of 10 percent of public school teachers eligible to receive master \nteacher tax treatment at a time. This program would go into effect in \n2007 and end with the 2013/2014 school year, when NCLB requires that \n100 percent of students perform at the proficient level.\n  Good teachers are essential to a successful education system; they \nare the profession charged with educating our future work force. The \nMaster Teacher Act of 2007 will provide our children access to the best \npossible teachers and our teachers much needed financial support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1282\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve the \nmanagement of medical care, personnel actions, and quality of life \nissues for members of the Armed Forces who are receiving medical care \nin an outpatient status, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague and \nmy good friend, the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Pryor, in introducing \nlegislation to ensure that the medical needs of wounded service men and \nwomen are properly met and that the military bureaucracy does not \ninterfere with their recovery progress.\n  We have watched with embarrassment and compassion as the unacceptable \nconditions of some of our military medical care facilities and housing \nfacilities were revealed and shown to the public. Clearly, we owe our \nwounded military personnel the best treatment and care that can be \noffered. This bill we are introducing today will help provide that.\n  Let me say, first of all, I have recently had the opportunity to \nvisit the Eisenhower Medical Center at Fort Gordon, GA, as well as the \nmedical facility at Fort Benning, GA, and I am reminded once again that \nmedical care given to our military men and women is truly second to \nnone. Are there exceptions? Sure. There are problems that arise from \ntime to time in the delivery of health care services to our military \nmen and women. Our purpose today is to try to make some of the \nbureaucracy go away and to try to help make sure our medical suppliers \nat all of our military facilities around the country and around the \nworld have the ability to deliver the very best medical care to our men \nand women.\n  Our bill, S. 1283, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007, will \nimprove the access to and quality of the health care our military \npersonnel receive by requiring that case managers for personnel in \nmedical holdover status handle no more than 17 cases and review each \ncase once a week.\n  Our bill will also create a system of patient advocates who can help \npersonnel navigate the cumbersome medical board and review process, as \nwell as add necessary funding to hire additional physicians.\n  Our bill increases training for health care professionals, medical \ncase managers, and patient advocates, with an emphasis on identifying \nand treating difficult-to-diagnose and complex conditions, such as \npost-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury.\n  Our bill establishes a toll-free hotline for patients and their \nfamilies to report problems with medical facilities or patient care and \ncreates an independent advocate to counsel servicemembers appearing \nbefore medical evaluation boards.\n  Our bill creates a wounded warrior battalion, which will be an Army \npilot program to improve the transition from military to civilian life \nfor wounded combat veterans, as well as track and assist members of the \nArmed Forces who are in outpatient status and in need of medical \ntreatment. More than 24,900 soldiers have been wounded in Iraq. We owe \nit to them and their loved ones to have a responsive health care system \nin place, in addition to the very best medical care available.\n  This legislation increases the resources available to our veterans in \norder to allow them to focus on their recovery rather than redtape. \nHeroes such as these need and deserve the best medical care and \nattention we can offer them, and this bill will help provide that. They \ndo not need to be disadvantaged by an outdated, bureaucratic process \nthat adds more stress to their recovery process.\n  Our legislation is a step in the right direction to reform and \nmodernize the outpatient treatment process and will increase the morale \nand welfare of our recovering servicemembers. They deserve our fullest \nsupport, and we are committed to meeting their needs.\n  This bill mirrors H.R. 1538, which was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 426 to 0 on March 28 of this year.\n  I thank Senator Pryor for the chance to work together with him on \nthis important legislation. He and I have had the opportunity to work \non any number of measures during our now going on 5 years in the \nSenate. He is a true champion of not just our wounded but all of our \nmilitary personnel, and it has been a pleasure to work with him.\n  I commend this bill to all of my colleagues. I hope we can move to a \nswift passage of the bill so we can present it to the President for his \nsignature. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \nkind remarks. Of course, everybody in the Senate knows what a friend to \nthe men and women in uniform Senator Chambliss has been since he has \nbeen in the Senate. I am sure that also relates back to his House days. \nHe has really been a fabulous leader for our soldiers, and it is an \nhonor for me to ask him to join me in the Wounded Warrior Act.\n  Last Friday, I had the chance to go to Walter Reed and see three \nArkansans who were injured in various ways in Iraq. It is always a \nsobering experience to go see our soldiers whom we are so proud of. We \nare proud of the people who put on the uniform and put their lives in \njeopardy for the principles of this country. And we have other \nfacilities, not just Walter Reed. I know that is the one that gets the \nmost publicity nationally. Obviously, every State or region has a lot \nof facilities. In Little Rock, there is the John McClellan Veterans \nHospital, which I visited not too long ago, and we have at least a \ncouple of other very good facilities in our State. They offer, \ngenerally speaking, great care. We know that sometimes people fall \nthrough the cracks, but we are very proud of our VA presence in the \nState of Arkansas.\n  I must say that in my office in Little Rock--and the one here, for \nthat matter--we have people on staff who deal and work with soldiers \nvirtually on a daily basis--people who are in the VA system who, for \nsome reason, have run into some bureaucratic roadblock or a file gets \nlost or a record gets lost or some box doesn't get checked or whatever \nthe case may be. We, more or less, like many colleagues here, have \nfull-time staff who do that on virtually a full-time basis. We are \nhonored to help the citizens of our State in any way we can, but we \nalso would like to say that we can help the VA system run better and \nprovide better health care with less bureaucracy.\n  Arkansas has had about 40 soldiers killed in Iraq. It has been a very \nhard circumstance for our State to go through. It impacts every \ncommunity in the State and almost every family in the State. In \naddition to those 40, which obviously are going to get more notice and \npublicity and discussion, as they should, there are 369 Arkansans who \nhave been injured in Iraq. Those numbers track fairly well what the \nnational numbers are.\n  Across this Nation, there have been 11,215 soldiers, at last count, \nwho have been wounded in Iraq so severely that they have not been able \nto return to duty. So it is critical that we have legislation such as \nthe Wounded Warrior Assistance Act. It will require case managers for \noutpatients to handle no more than 17 cases. They will have to review \neach case weekly. It creates a system of patient advocates within our \nhealth care system. It increases training for health care \nprofessionals, medical case managers, and patient advocates, with an \nemphasis on identifying and treating post-traumatic stress disorder and \ntraumatic brain injuries. It establishes a toll-free hotline for \npatients and families to report problems with medical facilities or \npatient care. It creates an independent advocate to counsel \nservicemembers appearing before medical evaluation boards. We think all \nof those are healthy, positive, and constructive reforms. We think the \ntime has come for this to happen.\n  Senator Chambliss, a few moments ago, mentioned that the House passed \nthis legislation 426 to 0. They did that late last month. It is the \nSenate's turn to weigh in and be on record for helping our wounded \nwarriors.\n  The Wounded Warrior Assistance Act allows them to focus on healing \nand not be frustrated by redtape. It improves the access and quality of \ncare our veterans receive. It puts an advocate on their side. We know \nthat with any large organization, there will be\n\n[[Page S5571]]\n\nsome bureaucracy and files will be lost and information gets misplaced. \nWe understand that. But, hopefully, what this will do is streamline the \nprocess and make the system work a lot better for those who have been \nwilling to make the sacrifice for this country.\n  Mr. President, I think this is important legislation because it does \ngood things, but it is also symbolic legislation. It shows our members \nof the military that we are willing--their Government and the people of \nthis country--to stand behind them during and after their Active-Duty \nservice.\n  I ask that my colleagues give this legislation their strong \nconsideration. The House passed it overwhelmingly. I hope we will have \nbroad-based, bipartisan support in this body. It is an honor for me to \noffer it with my lead cosponsor, Senator Chambliss of Georgia.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Durbin, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 1284. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the taxation of income of controlled foreign corporations \nattributable to imported property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Mikulski, \nDurbin, Stabenow, Rockefeller, Levin, Feinstein, Johnson, Harkin, \nFeingold, Leahy, Kohl, and Kennedy in introducing legislation to close \nan insidious loophole in the U.S. Tax Code that actually rewards U.S. \ncompanies that move American manufacturing jobs overseas. Some may \nthink this is a belated April Fools' Day joke; regrettably, it is not. \nLet me explain how this perverse tax break for these companies works.\n  When a U.S. company closes down a U.S. manufacturing plant, fires its \nAmerican workers, and moves those good-paying jobs to China or other \nlocations abroad, U.S. tax laws allow these firms to defer paying any \nU.S. income taxes on the earnings from those now foreign-manufactured \nproducts until those profits are returned, if ever, to this country. \nThis tax break is not available to American companies that make the \nvery same products here on American soil. So the U.S. company that \ndecides to stay at home suffers a competitive disadvantage, a \ndisadvantage that our tax laws have helped to create. Multinational \ncompanies ought to pay the same taxes that domestic companies pay. At a \nminimum, U.S. companies that keep their jobs here should not be put at \na competitive disadvantage by Federal tax policy.\n  The notion that granting large tax breaks to companies that move \ntheir manufacturing operations offshore is good for this country is \nutter nonsense. Among other things, those who support this half-cocked \nfiscal policy claim that shutting down U.S. manufacturing operations \nand moving them abroad will result in more U.S. jobs and increase our \nexports.\n  However, this assertion is not supported by the facts. According to \nthe latest available data, the number of foreign manufacturing \naffiliates has grown from 7,420 to 8,490, up some 14 percent since \n1993. From 1993 though 2004, U.S. companies moved 1 million \nmanufacturing jobs offshore to their foreign affiliates.\n  Throughout this entire period, this perverse deferral break has been \nin effect. Has it resulted in new U.S. manufacturing jobs? No. We have \nlost some 3.2 million U.S. manufacturing jobs since 2000 alone. Has \nthis misguided tax subsidy resulted in higher exports from U.S. \ncompanies to their foreign affiliates as the proponents of this tax \nsubsidy suggest? No. In fact, imports into the United States from the \nforeign subsidiaries of U.S. companies more than doubled from $92 \nbillion in 1993 to $203 billion in 2004. And the balance of trade with \nforeign affiliates of U.S. firms plummeted to a $72 billion deficit in \n2004 as compared to $3.4 billion in 1997.\n  I have been working to end this wrong-headed Federal tax break for \nmany years. Senator Mikulski and I have forced the Senate to vote to \nrepeal this tax subsidy several times. I have described stories on the \nSenate floor about a number of American companies that have moved \nproduction overseas, companies like Huffy bicycles and Radio Flyer \nlittle red wagons to China; Samsonite, which went to Mexico and then \nChina; Levi's, which are now made all over the world, everywhere except \nin the very country that invented them; Maytag, which now makes \nappliances in Mexico and Korea; and Fruit of the Loom, which moved to \nMexico. And I would point out, once again, that this tax deferral break \ngiven to companies like Radio Flyer or formerly to Huffy bicycles is \nnot available to American companies that make the very same products on \nU.S. main streets.\n  But we have run into stiff opposition from many U.S. multinational \ncompanies, their lobbyists, and some policymakers who claim our \nproposal would impede the ability of U.S. firms to compete and grow in \nthe global economy. That is hogwash. This proposal does nothing to \nhinder U.S. multinationals that produce abroad from competing with \nforeign firms in foreign markets. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday is carefully targeted; it ends the deferral tax break only where \nU.S. multinationals produce goods abroad and ship those products back \nto the U.S. market. In more technical language, this legislation would \nend tax deferral for the ``imported property'' income of controlled \nforeign corporations. The proposal also adds a new separate foreign tax \ncredit basket for imported property income. The separate foreign tax \ncredit basket is an anti-abuse provision that will stop U.S. \nmultinational companies from using the foreign tax credit to shelter \nprofits generated in a tax haven country by preventing the cross-\ncrediting of high foreign taxes on general income against the U.S. tax \non imported property income that is subject to low foreign taxes.\n  The tax experts with the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that \nthis pernicious tax break will costs U.S. taxpayers some $15.5 billion \nover the next decade. It is no wonder that the powerful lobby for the \nlargest U.S. multinational firms has fought to keep this tax loophole \nfully intact. But as I have told my colleagues on the Senate floor a \nnumber of times, I intend to offer this proposal again and again until \nthis tax subsidy is finally repealed.\n  I understand that some U.S. companies will still choose, with or \nwithout this tax subsidy, to dislocate thousands of workers in America \nin search of cheaper labor, lax regulation, and greater profits abroad \nat whatever the cost. They will be free to do so. But at least U.S. \ntaxpayers will not be asked to provide billions of dollars in tax \nsubsidies for those who do.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans \nalike, to take a fresh look at this issue and help us do what Congress \nshould have done many years ago; that is, repeal this ill-conceived tax \nbreak once and for all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \n        Obama):\n  S. 1285.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       (a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From \n     Private Sources.--The Senate finds and declares that the \n     current system of privately financed campaigns for election \n     to the United States Senate has the capacity, and is often \n     perceived by the public, to undermine democracy in the United \n     States by--\n       (1) creating a conflict of interest, perceived or real, by \n     encouraging Senators to accept large campaign contributions \n     from private interests that are directly affected by Federal \n     legislation;\n       (2) diminishing or giving the appearance of diminishing a \n     Senator's accountability to constituents by compelling \n     legislators to be accountable to the major contributors who \n     finance their election campaigns;\n       (3) violating the democratic principle of ``one person, one \n     vote'' and diminishing the meaning of the right to vote by \n     allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and \n     unfair influence within the political process;\n       (4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through \n     legislative and regulatory outcomes shaped by unequal access \n     to lawmakers for campaign contributors;\n       (5) driving up the cost of election campaigns, making it \n     difficult for qualified candidates without personal wealth or \n     access to campaign contributions from monied individuals and \n     interest groups to mount competitive Senate election \n     campaigns;\n       (6) disadvantaging challengers, because large campaign \n     contributors tend to donate their money to incumbent \n     Senators, thus causing Senate elections to be less \n     competitive; and\n       (7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with \n     fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry \n     out their public responsibilities.\n       (b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Allocations From \n     the Senate Fair Elections Fund.--The Senate finds and \n     declares that providing the option of the replacement of \n     private campaign contributions with allocations from the \n     Senate Fair Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and \n     general elections to the Senate would enhance American \n     democracy by--\n       (1) eliminating the potentially inherent conflict of \n     interest created by the private financing of the election \n     campaigns of public officials, thus restoring public \n     confidence in the integrity and fairness of the electoral and \n     legislative processes;\n       (2) increasing the public's confidence in the \n     accountability of Senators to the constituents who elect \n     them;\n       (3) helping to eliminate access to wealth as a determinant \n     of a citizen's influence within the political process and to \n     restore meaning to the principle of ``one person, one vote'';\n       (4) reversing the escalating cost of elections and saving \n     taxpayers billions of dollars that are (or that are perceived \n     to be) currently allocated based upon legislative and \n     regulatory agendas skewed by the influence of campaign \n     contributions;\n       (5) creating a more level playing field for incumbents and \n     challengers by creating genuine opportunities for all \n     Americans to run for the Senate and by encouraging more \n     competitive elections; and\n       (6) freeing Senators from the incessant preoccupation with \n     raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their \n     public responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to increase the \nretirement security of women and small business owners, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Women's \nRetirement Security Act of 2007. This measure has the potential to make \na significantly positive impact on the ability of Americans to save for \ntheir retirement years. This is a truly bi-partisan bill and I am \npleased to be joined today in introducing this important legislation \nwith Senators Conrad, Kerry, Bingaman and Snowe.\n  Preparing for retirement and achieving financial security are \ndaunting tasks for all Americans; however, women face many unique \nchallenges. Women are more likely to work part-time or work in \nindustries where employers are less likely to offer retirement \nbenefits. And many women have significant gaps in their work histories \ndue to caring for children or elderly parents.\n  As a result, women receive substantially less income during \nretirement than men. What makes this trend even more disturbing is the \nfact that women generally live longer. So if anything, women should be \nentering retirement with more income.\n  The Women's Retirement Security Act of 2007 works to narrow the \nretirement income gap between men and women. For example, because women \nare more likely than men to work part-time, the bill will require \nemployers to allow long-term, part-time employees to make elective \ndeferrals to their 40l(k) plans. In addition, the bill expands the \nSaver's Credit, which is a tax credit for certain low and moderate-\nincome individuals, so that more Americans will benefit.\n  The bill also creates automatic IRAs. Over 75 million Americans work \nfor an employer that does not sponsor a retirement plan. This is almost \nhalf of all working Americans. The Women's Retirement Security Act will \nallow those employees not covered by a qualified retirement plan to \nsave for retirement through automatic payroll deposits to IRAs. Under \nthe bill, employers with more than 10 employees that don't sponsor a \nretirement plan would be required to offer an option for their \nemployees to make regular payroll deposits to IRAs. This concept is \nvery similar to direct deposit of paychecks to employees' bank \naccounts, which many employers already do.\n  Another key component provides incentives for lifetime payments. \nSince women generally live longer than men, they must be particularly \nconcerned with protecting against the risk of exhausting their \nretirement income. Life annuities help ensure that older Americans will \nnot outlive their retirement savings, adding stability and security in \nretirement years. The Women's Retirement Security Act encourages \nannuitization by allowing individuals to exclude from taxation a \nportion of payments from qualified or nonqualified annuities that last \na lifetime.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to narrow the pension \ngap between men and women by enacting the important reforms in this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this legislation be printed in \nthe Record. I also ask unanimous consent that my statement be included \nin the Record next to the bill.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators \nSmith, Conrad, Snowe, and Bingaman in introducing the Women's \nRetirement Security Act of 2007. This legislation comes on the heels of \nthe passage of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which makes \nimprovements to the defined benefit pension plan system.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today builds upon that \nlegislation and focuses on defined contribution plans. Our pension \nsystem has shifted away from defined benefit plans to defined \ncontribution plans. We should make it easier for employers to offer \ndefined contribution plans and for individuals to participate in these \nplans.\n  At a time when we have a negative savings rate that is the lowest \nsince the Great Depression, we should provide appropriate incentives to \nhelp individuals save for retirement. In an effort to achieve this, the \nWomen's Retirement Security Act of 2007 focuses on increasing \nretirement savings, the preservation of income, equity in divorce, \nimproving financial literacy, and encouraging small businesses to enter \nand remain in the employer retirement plan system.\n  This legislation increases savings by allowing employees to \ncontribute a portion of their paycheck to an individual retirement \naccount (IRA) if their employer does not offer a pension plan. \nAutomatic IRAs will help the 71 million workers that do not have \nemployer-sponsored plans. It is a low-cost, sensible solution that \nprovides a stepping stone toward employer-sponsored retirement plans. \nMore workers are likely to contribute to an IRA if the contribution is \ndeducted from their payroll. Automatic IRAs will help combat the \ninertia that is a factor in our low savings rate. The bill also \nprovides a tax credit to help small businesses with the cost of \nimplementation.\n  The Pension Protection Act of 2006 increase made the tax credit for \ncontributions to qualified pension plans permanent, commonly referred \nto as the saver's credit, permanent. Our legislation builds upon this \nprovision by making this credit refundable and making it 50 percent of \nthe contribution for all eligible taxpayers. The annual contribution \neligible for this credit is $2,000. In 2005, five million households \nbenefited from this provision. These changes will help many more \nbenefit from this important credit. Making the credit refundable will \nhelp those who are struggling and do not have enough income to save.\n  Women are often placed at a disadvantage in our retirement system \nbecause they cycle in and out of the work force. The Women's Retirement \nSecurity Act of 2007 addresses this issue by requiring employers that \noffer defined contribution plans to cover part-time employees that meet \nspecific requirements.\n  Pension coverage needs to improve, particularly for small businesses. \nIn\n\n[[Page S5581]]\n\n2004, only 26 percent of workers at firms with fewer than 25 employees \nparticipated in pension plans. Progress has been made on providing \ncoverage to small businesses. Currently, more than 19 million workers \nare covered by small business retirement plans, but more than 36 \nmillion Americans work for firms with less than 25 employees.\n  The Women's Retirement Security Act of 2007 provides a start-up \ncredit for new small business retirement contributions. In addition, it \nremoves rules that discourage small employers from adopting deferral \nonly plans.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to help \nimprove the retirement of mothers, sisters, daughters, and wives. We \nshould work together to provide incentives that encourage participation \nin retirement plans and remove barriers preventing employers from \noffering them.\n  Thank you.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1289. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to modify the \nsalary and terms of judges of the United States Court of Appeals for \nVeterans Claims, to modify authorities for the recall of retired judges \nof such court, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to comment \non a bill I am introducing to help ensure the long-term ability of the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims to promptly dispense \njustice in all veterans cases.\n  In 1988, Congress created this court to hear appeals from decisions \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs, most commonly on veterans' \nclaims for disability compensation based on injuries or diseases they \nsuffered during service. As was discussed at a hearing I called last \nyear while serving as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nthe CAVC is facing some serious challenges, which may impede its \nability to consistently provide timely decisions to our Nation's \nveterans.\n  In fact, between 2004 and 2006 the court experienced something akin \nto a ``perfect storm.'' The last four of the original judges, who were \nappointed when the court was created, all retired, taking 60 years of \nexperience with them; the court's incoming caseload experienced a \ndramatic 67-percent increase; and the court was left with a single \njudge who had at least 2 years of experience deciding these often \ncomplex cases. As a consequence, the court received 30 percent more \ncases than it decided during that time and the number of pending cases \ndoubled in less than 2 years. With over 6,000 cases still pending, \nalmost 4,000 more than a decade ago, and with the court continuing to \nreceive record levels of incoming cases, veterans seeking justice from \nthe court may feel the effects of this ``perfect storm'' for many years \nto come, as the court struggles to eliminate the existing backlog and \nto keep up with new appeals.\n  For the men and women who have served, sacrificed, and suffered for \nour Nation, I believe we must take steps to ensure that they will \nreceive timely decisions on their appeals, not just today but for many \nyears to come. That is why I am introducing this bill to help the court \ndeal with its existing caseload and to help ensure that, in the long \nterm, the court will not face such a devastating combination of events.\n  As one means of helping with the current caseload, the bill would \nmodify the rules that govern the recall of retired judges. Under \ncurrent law, a retiring judge may opt to be recall eligible, which \nmeans the judge may be involuntarily called back to work for up to 90 \ndays per year when needed and may voluntarily serve up to 180 days per \nyear. For this court, like other Federal courts, the option of \nreceiving help from retired judges can be an extremely important \nresource. In fact, last year, after the court began recalling retired \njudges to help with its caseload, the court's productivity rose over 19 \npercent in 3 months.\n  In view of the obvious value of having experienced retired judges \ncontinue to decide veterans' cases and the fact that they currently \nreceive the same salary as active judges regardless of how much, if \nany, service they provide in a year, it would be a win-win situation \nfor veterans, the court, and taxpayers if a retired judge opted to \nreturn to the bench more frequently or for longer periods than current \nlaw permits. To allow for that possibility, the bill would eliminate \nthe 180-day cap and permit a retired judge to voluntarily serve in \nrecall status as many days during a year as he or she wishes.\n  Also, because the court may need an unprecedented level of service \nfrom retired judges in the next several years to help deal with its \ncaseload, the bill would provide an incentive for the current \ncomplement of recall-eligible judges to provide as much service as \npractical during that time. Specifically, the bill would provide that, \nonce a recall-eligible judge has served an aggregate of 5 years of \nrecall service, the judge will no longer be subject to involuntarily \nrecall and will continue to receive the same salary, that of an active \njudge.\n  To put that into perspective, if a retired judge were to be recalled \nfor 90 days each year, as current law permits, it would take 20 years \nto provide the equivalent of 5 years of recall service. In addition to \nallowing judges to accelerate their service into fewer years, at a time \nwhen it may be most beneficial to veterans, this change may also \nencourage retired judges to serve in recall status for longer periods \nof time. This should help minimize concerns expressed by the Chief \nJudge in recent years about how much retired judges would be able to \naccomplish in the limited 90 day recall period. With these changes, the \ncourt should have the judicial resources it needs to handle its \ncaseload in the near term.\n  In addition, this bill would take steps to ensure that the court, in \nthe long run, is not faced with a difficult transition like the one it \nexperienced in recent years. By way of background, the original judges, \nexcept for one who died, all retired between 2000 and 2005, with four \nof those retirements occurring within a single 12-month period. Given \nthe delays inherent in the appointment and confirmation process, this \nleft the CAVC without a full complement of active judges for much of \nthat 5-year period. As the Chief Judge testified in 2006, functioning \nwith less than seven judges ``led to a backlog'' of cases at the court.\n  Perhaps more significantly, this cluster of retirements meant that, \nas of August 2005, the court had only one judge, the new Chief Judge, \nwho had at least 2 years of experience on the bench. In the words of \nthat Chief Judge, ``no other Federal court would be faced with the \ntransition that we were faced with as of August 2005. Where else in the \nFederal judiciary system could I, the junior judge . . . suddenly \nbecome the senior judge, and have all of the experience of the court \ndeparting?'' The Chief Judge also opined that ``[t]his turnover on the \nCourt has had great significance, particularly in the short term, on \nthe Court's case management.''\n  The effects of this turnover may have been magnified by the fact that \nthis court deals with a very specialized area of law, which by all \naccounts has become increasingly complex in recent years. In fact, the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States recently described \nveterans' law as ``a complex thicket of court decisions and statutory \nrequirements.''\n  To further complicate the situation, the court experienced a dramatic \nrise in the number of incoming cases in recent years. In fact, in 2005 \nthe court received 37 percent more cases than it had received in any \nprior year and, then, in 2006 the court received an even higher level \nof incoming cases. As I indicated earlier, the combined effect of these \nfactors led the court to be ``in the red'' for several years, taking in \nalmost 3,000 more cases than it decided.\n  Although some factors that have contributed to the court's challenges \ncannot be controlled, it seems clear that multiple retirements of \nexperienced judges within a relatively short period of time can have a \nprofound impact on the court's ability to decide veterans' cases. It is \nworth noting that Congress previously attempted to stagger the \nretirement dates of the judges by temporarily expanding the size of the \ncourt and by shortening the length of two judges' terms. Despite those \nefforts, it is possible that 6 of the 7 judges now on the bench will \nretire within a 4-year window, an even shorter period than the \ndisruptive turnover between 2000 and 2005.\n  That is why I believe we need to try a completely new approach to \nhelp ensure that experienced judges will stay\n\n[[Page S5582]]\n\non the bench for as long as practicable and will not retire in \nclusters as their terms expire. To that end, this bill would eliminate \nthe term limits for any new judges appointed to the court and would \nprovide those judges with full pay-of-the-office only when serving as \nan active judge or when providing service as a recalled retired judge. \nThe combined effect of those provisions should encourage judges to stay \non the bench longer before they retire and to regularly volunteer for \nrecall service after they retire.\n\n  Yes, this represents a significant departure from the traditional \nmodel for article I courts. But as experience has shown, the current \nmodel is not adequate to consistently provide veterans with timely \ndecisions on their claims and we simply cannot allow further \ndisruptions in service to our Nation's heroes each time the court turns \nover. Once judges gain years of valuable experience in this complex, \nspecialized area of law, we should not force them, and their \nexperience, into retirement. Rather, we should take steps, as this bill \nwould do, to permit veterans and the court to receive the maximum \npossible benefit from their years on the bench.\n  To avoid ``changing the rules'' on those judges who have already been \nappointed and confirmed, these changes would be prospective, applying \nonly to judges appointed to the court on or after the date of enactment \nof this bill. In the meantime, I hope the changes to the current recall \nprovisions that I mentioned earlier will help avoid a difficult \ntransition when the current sitting judges retire.\n  In addition to these changes to the term limits and recall rules, the \nbill would require the Chief Judge, in conjunction with the court's \nstakeholders, to set guidelines for when recall would be appropriate, \ntaking into account such factors as the number of active judges, \ntemporary or prolonged increases or decreases in caseload, and the \ncomplexity of the caseload. It would also require the court to submit \nannual performance reports to Congress including information on the \ncourt's workload during the prior year, as well as an analysis of \nwhether the standards for recalling judges were met and what service, \nif any, was performed by retired judges. Such guidelines should aid the \ncourt, retired judges, and Congress in planning for periods when recall \nwill likely be used and when it will not.\n  More importantly, the number of recall-eligible judges and their \nlevel of activity are important factors that must be considered in \ndetermining whether the court has sufficient judicial resources. If \ncurrent caseload trends continue and the court, even fully utilizing \nthe services of recalled judges, is unable to provide veterans with the \nlevel of service they deserve, the addition of judgeships may need to \nbe considered. These guidelines and reports will allow Congress to \nclosely monitor that situation to ensure that the court has the \nnecessary capacity.\n  Finally, the bill would recognize the critical and increasingly \ndemanding role of the Chief Judge by allowing the salary of the Chief \nJudge to be increased by $7,000 per year, and the bill would direct the \nGeneral Services Administration to provide Congress with a report as to \nthe feasibility and desirability of converting the court's current \nlocation into a dedicated Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center.\n  It is my sincere hope that the fundamental changes in this bill will \nhelp ensure that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is able to \nconsistently provide veterans with timely decisions, now and for many \nyears to come. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1289\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \nadditional discretion to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in \ncontracting with State approving agencies, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to comment \non a bill I am introducing to ensure that veterans and their families \nhave access to educational assistance benefits unimpeded by layers of \nbureaucracy and inflexible legal requirements.\n  Each year, the Department of Veterans Affairs provides educational \nassistance benefits to veterans, servicemembers, reservists, and their \nfamilies to pursue a wide array of educational opportunities, including \ntraditional college degrees, vocational training, apprenticeships, and \non-the-job training programs. VA contracts with entities called ``State \napproving agencies,'' SAAs, to assess whether schools and training \nprograms are of sufficient quality for individuals to receive VA \neducation benefits while pursuing their programs. That SAA approval \nprocess was originally instituted after World War II to help stem \nabuses of veterans' education benefits, such as scam vocational and \nbusiness schools profiting from those education benefits and then not \nproviding veterans with an education of any value.\n  Today, unlike 60 years ago, schools and educational programs of all \ntypes may be scrutinized by a number of different entities, including \nthe Department of Education, the Department of Labor, various national \nand regional accrediting bodies, and state licensing agencies. In fact, \nin 1995 the Government Accountability Office found that a substantial \nportion of the approval activities performed by SAAs overlapped with \nwork done by others. Several years later, the Commission on \nServicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance concluded that \nveterans should be ``the primary judge of the appropriateness of \naccredited courses to their plans for the future'' and that \n``[a]pproval of institutions accredited by accrediting bodies \nrecognized by the Department of Education should suffice for veterans' \ntraining approval.''\n  In the years since those findings, Congress has altered the \nresponsibilities of SAAs by requiring them to perform additional \nfunctions, such as promoting the development of apprenticeships and on-\nthe-job training programs, conducting outreach services, and approving \nlicensing tests. However, the traditional approval functions performed \nby SAAs, which are specifically required by statute, have not been \nsignificantly modified.\n  Last year, in order to assess whether veterans face unnecessary or \ninefficient barriers in accessing VA education benefits under the \ncurrent system, I asked GAO to evaluate the extent to which SAA \napproval activities currently overlap with functions performed by the \nDepartments of Labor and Education and what value is added by the \nservices performed by SAAs. Let me give you a few examples of GAO's \nrecent findings:\n\n       Many education and training programs approved by SAAs have \n     also been approved by the Departments of Education or Labor \n     and VA and SAAs have taken few steps to coordinate approval \n     activities with those Departments.\n       To streamline approval processes, VA should collaborate \n     with other agencies but, according to VA, that may be \n     difficult because of the specific approval requirements in \n     law.\n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\n       VA does not require SAAs to track the amount of resources \n     they spend on specific duties and functions, including those \n     that may be performed by other agencies, and thus does not \n     have all relevant information to make resource allocation \n     decisions or to determine whether it is spending federal \n     funds efficiently and effectively.\n       It is difficult to assess the effectiveness and progress of \n     SAAs because VA does not have outcome-oriented performance \n     measures in place to fully evaluate their performance.\n\n  Although I have no doubts about the dedication and sincerity of SAA \npersonnel in the field, I believe GAO's findings demonstrate that we do \nnot have a systematic or objective way to determine whether the current \nmix of services provided by SAAs, which are mandated by statute, are \neither necessary or beneficial to the veterans and their families who \nparticipate in VA's education programs. That is why I believe we should \noverhaul the entire statutory scheme regarding SAAs, as this bill would \ndo, to help eliminate redundant administrative procedures, increase \nVA's flexibility in determining the nature and extent of services that \nshould be performed by SAAs, and improve accountability for any \nactivities they undertake.\n  Specifically, this bill would strike statutory provisions that \nmandate what activities SAAs must perform, how those functions must be \ncarried out, and how VA must pay for them. Instead, VA would have \nauthority to contract with SAAs for services that it deems valuable and \nto determine how those services should be performed, evaluated, and \ncompensated. The bill would also require VA to coordinate approval \nactivities performed by State approving agencies, the Department of \nLabor, the Department of Education, and other entities to reduce \noverlapping and unnecessary layers of bureaucracy. To ensure that VA, \nCongress, and other stakeholders will be able to objectively assess the \neffectiveness of any functions performed by SAAs, VA would be required \nto establish outcome-oriented performance measures and SAAs would be \nrequired to track and report information on the resources expended on \nall activities they perform.\n  Finally, the bill includes a provision, similar to legislation that \nthe Senate passed last year, that would provide a $19 million spending \nauthorization for SAAs effective at the start of the upcoming fiscal \nyear and would allow, for the first time, SAA funding to be drawn from \nboth mandatory spending accounts and discretionary accounts. By way of \nbackground, since 1988 VA payment for the services of SAAs has been \nmade only out of funds available for ``readjustment benefits'', a VA \naccount funded through mandatory appropriations, and has been subject \nto annual funding caps.\n  For the current fiscal year, SAA funding from this entitlement \naccount is capped at $19 million, but under current law there will be a \n$6 million reduction in authorized spending, to $13 million, for every \nfiscal year thereafter. Although the provisions of this bill would \nmaintain a $19 million funding level in future years, it is important \nto note that that level is a ceiling, not a floor. As with any private-\nsector business or good-government business model, budgeting and \nfunding decisions should be linked to performance and VA should \ncontract only for those services that are necessary and valuable.\n  In sum, this bill would provide VA with the flexibility to streamline \napproval processes, eliminate redundant bureaucratic procedures, focus \nresources on services that will meet the current needs of education \nprogram participants, and ensure that veterans and their families will \nnot confront layers of bureaucracy and inflexible legal requirements in \naccessing their educational assistance benefits.

A bill to amend titles 10 and 38, United States Code, to \nimprove educational assistance for members and former members of the \nArmed Forces, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to comment \non a bill I am introducing to enhance educational assistance benefits \nprovided to active duty servicemembers, veterans, members of the Guard \nand Reserve, and their survivors and dependents by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, VA, and the Department of Defense.\n  In recent years, many veterans' organizations, members of Congress, \nand others have highlighted the need to modernize these education \nprograms to support emerging and alternative education opportunities \nand to recognize that the role of Guard and Reserve members has been \ntransformed since September 11, 2001. This bill would take significant \nsteps in that direction by providing greater flexibility in the use of \nthese education benefits, revising eligibility criteria to reflect \ncurrent mobilization strategies for Guard and Reserve units, and \nenhancing the education program for our ``citizen soldiers'' who have \nbeen called up to serve in the war on terror.\n  First, this bill would provide veterans, Guard and Reserve members, \nand their spouses and dependents with additional flexibility in using \nexisting education benefits. Traditionally, educational assistance \nbenefits have been paid in equal monthly allotments throughout a \nsemester or term. For veterans, the maximum basic rate is now $1,075 \nper month, which means a veteran may receive at least $9,675 over the \ncourse of an average school year and almost $39,000 during a 4-year \ncollege program.\n  This system works well for veterans attending a traditional four-year \ncollege. But, as the Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans \nTransition Assistance reported in 1999, the existing payment structure \n``constrains veterans and servicemembers desiring to enroll in short-\nterm career-focused technical courses,'' a problem that is ``especially \nacute if the cost of the course dramatically exceeds the benefits \npayable for the few months' duration of the course.''\n  That is why in 2001 I cosponsored legislation to establish an \n``accelerated'' payment option for veterans' education benefits. With \nthat program now in place, a veteran may receive an up-front, lump-sum \npayment of up to 60 percent of the cost of certain high-tech, high-cost \nprograms. Since that option was made available, many veterans have used \nthat additional flexibility to train for jobs in high technology \nsectors of the economy, such as the computer and telecommunications \nindustry, the aerospace industry, and the electronics industry.\n  Then last year, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I \nsupported legislation that would have expanded this option to allow \naccelerated payments for short-term, high-cost education programs \nleading to jobs in any high growth sectors of the economy. Although VA \nalso supported that legislation, VA testified that ``implementation \nwould be challenging'' and that ``[i]t would be cleaner and more direct \nif the bill simply stated that all high-cost short-term courses were \neligible for accelerated payments.''\n  Having taken those concerns into account, this bill would allow \nveterans to receive accelerated payments for any short-term, high-cost \neducation programs, and it would authorize VA to spend up to $3 million \nfor those payments in each fiscal year from 2009 to 2012. Not only \nwould this provide veterans with the flexibility to pursue \nnontraditional or technical educational opportunities, but it may help \nveterans quickly obtain job skills that currently are in high demand.\n  For example, the trucking industry is now experiencing a critical \nshortage of trained drivers, but the GI Bill, as currently structured, \nmay pay only a fraction of the cost for a veteran to take the 6 to 8 \nweek training course, about $2,000 of a total $6,000 bill. With the \navailability of accelerated payments for those and other short-term, \nhigh-cost training programs, veterans may be able to obtain the skills \nneeded\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\nto thrive in sectors of the economy that, today, are growing rapidly \nand can provide them with lucrative, rewarding career opportunities.\n  In addition, the bill would, for the first time, provide Guard and \nReserve members with the option of receiving accelerated payment of \ntheir education benefits. They, too, would be eligible to receive up-\nfront, lump-sum payments of up to 60 percent of the cost of any short-\nterm, high-cost education program. For fiscal years 2009 to 2012, the \nbill would authorize $2 million per year for the Montgomery GI bill, \nSelected Reserve program and $1 million per year for the smaller \nReserve Educational Assistance Program to make these payments.\n  To ensure that the families of veterans also have flexibility in the \nuse of their education benefits, the bill would extend the same \naccelerated payment option to participants in the Survivors' and \nDependents' Educational Assistance program. It would authorize VA to \nspend up to $1 million per year for those payments in fiscal years 2009 \nto 2012.\n  The second principal goal of the bill is to update and enhance the \neducation program for members of the Guard and Reserve who are called \nto active duty. In 2004, recognizing the increased sacrifices being \nmade by our ``citizen soldiers'' who are fighting in the War on Terror, \nCongress created the Reserve Educational Assistance Program for Guard \nand Reserve members who are activated for at least 90 days after \nSeptember 11, 2001. This program was a significant step in the right \ndirection, providing a maximum benefit of $860 per month for 36 months, \na total possible benefit of over $30,000.\n  However, the maximum monthly benefit requires a deployment of 2 \ncontinuous years or more of active duty, and the Secretary of Defense \nhas recently announced that ``from this point forward, members of the \nReserves will be involuntarily mobilized for a maximum of one year at \nany one time, in contrast to the current practice of sixteen to twenty-\nfour months.'' To bring those eligibility criteria in line with current \npractice, this bill would allow members of the Guard or Reserve to \nreceive the maximum benefits if they are deployed for an aggregate \nperiod of 3 or more years.\n  Finally, the bill would provide these ``citizen soldiers'' with \naccess to a valuable option now available only under the Montgomery GI \nbill program for active duty servicemembers. Specifically, it would \nallow members of the Guard or Reserve to contribute up to $600 in order \nto receive an additional $150 per month in education benefits, which \namounts to an additional $5,400 in benefits over the course of 36 \nmonths. Under this bill, Guard and Reserve members would, for the first \ntime, have access to this valuable opportunity.\n  With these modifications, we can take significant strides towards \nensuring that current education programs are up-to-date and flexible \nand that they provide members of the Guard and Reserve with benefits \ncommensurate with the level of service they are now performing on \nbehalf of the entire Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to strengthen national security by encouraging and \nassisting in the expansion and improvement of educational programs in \norder to meet critical needs at the elementary, secondary, and higher \neducation levels, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nHomeland Security Education Act. This bill encourages initiatives to \nincrease the number of Americans trained in science, technology, \nengineering, math, and foreign languages.\n  More than a century ago, Henry Ford revolutionized transportation and \nindustry with the creation of the Model T. This car and the process \ndesigned to create it were so innovative that it was copied by every \nother company. The Model T became the base model for all cars that \nfollowed. This is a classic American story. Some of the most important \nscientific breakthroughs in modern history have occurred in the labs, \nworkshops, and classrooms of America. We take pride in our Nation's \nability to meet any challenge and solve any problem with innovation and \ndiscovery. But we are falling behind. Today's innovations in the auto \nindustry come not from Detroit but from Japan. Engineers in Asia are \ndesigning tomorrow's hybrid car while Henry Ford's company and other \nAmerican companies are just trying to keep up.\n  America's colleges and universities can play an important role in \nreversing the decline in American innovation. The United States \ngraduates some of the world's best engineers, scientists, and \nmathematicians, but a far higher proportion of the students in China, \nIndia, South Korea, and Japan are focusing on these fields. The \nNational Academies of Science reports that in 2004, only 32 percent of \nthe undergraduate degrees awarded in the United States were in science \nor engineering compared to 59 percent in China and 66 percent in Japan. \nIf we do not address this crisis soon, China, India, and Japan will \nbecome the new centers for scientific and technological innovation, \nwhile American workers scramble to keep up. We must act now to ensure \nthat America remains the world's economic, scientific, and \ntechnological leader.\n  American workers are also increasingly finding themselves at a \ndisadvantage in a multilingual global community. In our increasingly \nglobal economy and with a heightened concern for security in the post-\n911 world, we need Americans who can speak a foreign language. Only 9 \npercent of American students enroll in a foreign language course in \ncollege. We especially need to focus on less commonly taught languages, \nincluding Arabic, Farsi, Chinese, and Korean, and other languages that \nare of particular value in the world today.\n  The best place to address both of these concerns is in the classroom. \nWe must adapt our educational system by providing the teachers and \nresources needed to encourage students to study science, technology, \nengineering, mathematics, and foreign languages. The Homeland Security \nEducation Act is an important step in the right direction.\n  This bill would encourage students to pursue math, science, \ntechnology, engineering, and critical foreign languages by providing \nthem with $5,000 scholarships. Scientists, engineers, technology \nprofessionals, and those fluent in foreign languages would be \nencouraged to return to the classroom and use their career experiences \nto inspire students in high-need or low-income schools. New grant \nprograms would encourage educational institutions, public entities, and \nbusinesses to enter into partnerships that improve math and science \ncurricula, establish programs that promote students' foreign language \nproficiency along with their science and technological knowledge, and \ncreate and establish foreign language pathways from elementary school \nthrough college. Finally, the bill would fund a student loan repayment \nprogram for qualified individuals trained in science, technology, \nengineering, math, and foreign languages who join the Federal \nworkforce.\n  Our country is quickly approaching a crisis of competitiveness. To \navoid falling behind our international competitors in science and \ninnovation, we must confront this problem immediately in our schools. \nWe need to strengthen our students' proficiency in science, technology, \nengineering, math, and foreign languages and provide them with the \nincentives necessary to pursue careers in those fields. Today's \nstudents are tomorrow's innovators, scientists, and technology leaders, \nand we can't afford not to invest in them. I encourage my colleagues to \njoin me in cosponsoring the Homeland Security Education Act.\n\n[[Page S5589]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1294\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Education \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Investing in science, technology, engineering, \n     mathematics, and foreign language education is essential to \n     maintaining the competitive advantage and national security \n     of the United States. Significant improvements in the \n     quantity and quality of science, technology, engineering, \n     mathematics, and foreign language instruction offered in \n     United States elementary schools and secondary schools are \n     necessary.\n       (2) For the past 3 decades, about one-third of the \n     baccalaureate degrees awarded in the United States have been \n     granted in science and engineering, compared to 59 percent in \n     China and 66 percent in Japan.\n       (3) The United States is behind its European counterparts \n     in foreign language skills, in that one-half of European \n     citizens speak a second language while only 9 percent of \n     Americans speak another language.\n       (4) Elementary schools and secondary schools in the United \n     States need more qualified teachers, equipment, and resources \n     to improve education in mathematics, science, and foreign \n     languages.\n       (5) The optimum time to begin learning a second language is \n     in elementary school, when children have the ability to learn \n     and excel in several foreign language acquisition skills, \n     including pronunciation.\n       (6) Foreign language study can increase children's capacity \n     for critical and creative thinking skills, and children who \n     study a second language show greater cognitive development in \n     areas such as mental flexibility, creativity, tolerance, and \n     higher order thinking skills.\n       (7) All people of the United States should strive to have a \n     global perspective. To understand the world around us, we \n     must acquaint ourselves with the languages, cultures, and \n     history of other nations.\n       (8) Federal agencies have reported shortfalls in language \n     capability that is integral to, or directly supports, every \n     discipline and is an essential factor in national security \n     readiness, disaster response, law enforcement, information \n     superiority, and coalition peacekeeping or warfighting \n     missions.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure the \n     national security and the competitiveness of the United \n     States through increasing the quantity, diversity, and \n     quality of the teaching and learning of subjects in the \n     fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and \n     foreign language.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Pilot program for student loan repayment for Federal \n              employees with critical science, technology, engineering, \n              mathematics, and foreign language skills.''.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my friends \nSenators Durbin and Cochran, to reintroduce legislation that will \nprovide students much needed educational opportunities in foreign \nlanguages and science, technology engineering and mathematics, STEM.\n  The future economic health and security of our Nation depends on \nprograms such as those called for in our legislation. This country's \nnational security depends upon having a workforce with the necessary \nscience, technology, engineering, math, and foreign language skills to \nrapidly and efficiently adapt to the challenges of globalization. Yet, \nwe are falling behind.\n  According to a study conducted by the Committee on Economic \nDevelopment, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other Federal \nGovernment agencies do not have a sufficient number of personnel \ntrained in critical languages to translate intelligence information in \na timely manner. Similarly, a GAO report issued August 4, 2006, GAO-06-\n894 noted that the State Department was still suffering from gaps in \nlanguage proficiency which could adversely impact its ability to \ncommunicate with foreign audiences and execute critical duties.\n  We all know that we live in a global marketplace. The United States, \nwhich has the world's largest economy, is the engine for global \neconomic growth. However, this also means that American workers must \ncompete with others in the global market for skilled labor. The signs \nhave long been clear that we are failing to develop the next generation \nof workers. As a recent study by the National Center for Public Policy \nand Higher Education observes, in the United States ``about one-quarter \nof 15-year-olds fall into the lowest proficiency level on assessments \nof skills and knowledge.'' The United States ranks 16th among 27 \ncountries in the number of students who earn a college degree or \ncertificate. We can delay no longer in taking the steps to train \nstudents to compete and thrive in a multi-lingual and technologically \ncomplex environment.\n  Our bill the Homeland Security Education Act, provides schools with \nthe framework they need to prepare our Nation's youth for the future. \nIts enactment is a critical step in reenergizing and reinvigorating our \neducation system to meet the needs of our Nation. It will increase \nstudents' proficiency in foreign languages and encourage them to become \nscientists and engineers.\n  The Homeland Security Education Act provides schools with the \nequipment and materials necessary to teach STEM and foreign language \ncourses by encouraging public private partnerships to improve science \nand math curricular--upgrade laboratory facilities; provide \nscholarships for students to study math, science, or engineering at the \nuniversity level; and Establish internship and mentoring opportunities \nfor students in grades K-12; developing cultural awareness and \nimmersion programs in colleges and universities that combine science, \ntechnology, and engineering instruction with foreign language to expand \ninternational understanding and scientific collaboration; and creating \nlanguage learning pathways to facilitate proficiency in critical \nforeign languages from kindergarten through graduate school.\n  In addition, this act addresses the shortage of STEM and foreign \nlanguage teachers. Our Nation needs mathematicians, scientists, and \nlinguists in order to compete in a global mart. Accordingly, our bill \nawards scholarships in the amount of $15,000 to language proficient \nindividuals and to practicing scientists and engineers to encourage \nthem to become certified to teach these critical skills to students in \nhigh-need, low-income schools. The bill would also allow National \nSecurity Education Program scholarship and fellowship recipients to \nmeet their service requirements by teaching in critical areas if they \ncannot find a national security position in the Federal service. In \naddition, a key provision awards grants to build professional \ndevelopment programs, summer workshops or institutes, and foreign \nlanguage distance learning programs for elementary and secondary school \nteachers in order to facilitate partnerships between 12 schools and \ninstitutions of higher education.\n  Not only do we need to encourage individuals and professionals to \nbecome teachers in these critical need areas, we also need to encourage \nstudents to study languages, science, technology, engineering, and math \nby underscoring the importance of these subjects to our country's \nsecurity and economic well-being. As Secretary of Education Margaret \nSpellings noted in January 2006, only 44 percent of this country's high \nschool students are studying any foreign language, while learning a \nsecond or even a third language is compulsory for students in the \nEuropean Union, China, Thailand, and many other nations. Only 32 \npercent of undergraduates in the United States receive their degrees in \nscience and engineering compared to 59 percent in China and 66 percent \nin Japan. Our children deserve better opportunities to become math, \nscience, and language proficient. The Homeland Security Education Act \nhelps correct this growing skill gap between students in the United \nStates and students across the globe by providing scholarships for \nstudents to earn their degrees in STEM or a foreign language.\n  Mr. President, education is the foundation of our Nation's long-term \nsecurity. In order to fulfill our role as a world leader, this Nation \nneeds Americans who are well educated and can communicate and compete \nin a global environment. The bill we are introducing today will help us \nmeet this essential goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 1298. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to establish a \nFederal Reinsurance Program for Catastrophic Health Care Costs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, States like my home state of Massachusetts \nare setting an example for the rest of the country by taking bold steps \nto provide quality health coverage for everyone. Now it is time for \nWashington to do the same by bringing meaningful, affordable healthcare \nto the uninsured, in Massachusetts and across America.\n  In Massachusetts there is still a major obstacle in the overall goal \nof universal coverage: cost. The fact is the problem of the uninsured \ncan't be solved unless the issue of skyrocketing health costs to \nfamilies and businesses is also tackled. And fully reforming the \nhealthcare system will require that the Federal Government begin \nshouldering some of the burden to help alleviate costs.\n  Healthcare costs are highly concentrated in this country. The very \nfew who suffer from catastrophic illness or injury drive costs up for \neveryone. One percent of patients account for 25 percent of healthcare \ncosts, and 20 percent of patients account for 80 percent of costs. To \nmake healthcare more affordable, we must find a better way to share the \nimmense burden of insuring the chronically ill and seriously injured.\n  Part of the reason that businesses and health plans today fail to \ncover\n\n[[Page S5594]]\n\ntheir workers is an aversion to risk, a fear that they will be saddled \nwith a sick employee whose high premiums will bankrupt them. And \npatients who are catastrophically ill or injured often face the tragic \ncombination of failing health and financial peril. But there's a way to \ncombat these costs.\n  Congress should make employers and healthcare plans an offer they \ncan't refuse. It's called ``reinsurance.'' Reinsurance provides a \nbackstop for the high costs of healthcare. The Federal Government will \nreimburse a percentage of the highest cost cases if employers agree to \noffer a substantive insurance benefit to all full time employees, \nincluding preventative care and health promotion benefits that are \nproven to make care affordable. This means lower costs and lower \npremiums for both employers and employees. If the Federal Government \ncan help small and large businesses bear the burden of cost in the most \nexpensive cases, we'll dramatically improve the health of everyone.\n  Today I am introducing the Healthy Businesses, Healthy Workers \nReinsurance Act, a bill that will make Government a partner in helping \nbusinesses with the heavy financial burden of those catastrophic cases: \nthose that use over $50,000 in a single year in healthcare costs. \nHealthy Businesses, Healthy Workers will protect business owners from \nskyrocketing premiums, and provide more working families affordable, \nquality healthcare. With reinsurance, health insurance premiums for all \nof us will go down, by up to 10 percent under this plan. This plan does \nhave a cost associated with it, but the benefits will outweigh the \ncosts. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year on \ninefficient and wasteful health expenditures. We need to make sure that \nthese funds are being spent wisely to ensure that we can lower health \ncare costs and improve coverage.\n  I believe that even in today's sharply divided Washington, this plan \nis feasible. There is a growing bipartisan consensus that the Federal \nGovernment has a responsibility to help the catastrophically ill. \nConsider the Medicare prescription drug program: Despite its flaws, the \nbill did cover 95 percent of the cost of prescription drugs once \nseniors passed through the disastrous ``doughnut hole'' in their \ncoverage. The same approach has been used to protect the insurance \nmarket from going under in case of another catastrophic act of \nterrorism.\n  As we take the next steps toward alleviating our Nation's healthcare \ncrisis, a commonsense partnership between employers, families, and the \ngovernment to share the costs of the sickest among us will lay the \ngroundwork for achieving our ultimate goal: healthcare coverage for \nevery single American.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1298\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Businesses, Healthy \n     Workers Reinsurance Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The cost of health insurance premiums for families has \n     risen 87 percent since 2000, nearly 4 times the growth in \n     overall inflation and workers earnings.\n       (2) Health insurance premium increases have resulted in a \n     nearly 10 percentage point drop in the number of firms \n     choosing to offer coverage to their workers over that time \n     period.\n       (3) Today, just 48 percent of firms with between 3 and 9 \n     employees offer health insurance benefits, down from 58 \n     percent in 2001.\n       (4) The decline in employer-sponsored coverage has added to \n     the growing problem of the uninsured. An additional 4 million \n     Americans have been added to the ranks of the uninsured since \n     2001.\n       (5) Health care costs are highly concentrated. Twenty \n     percent of the population that is catastrophically or \n     chronically ill accounts for 80 percent of the health care \n     spending, with just 1 percent driving a full 22 percent of \n     health care costs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Kerry, in \nintroducing the Reinsure America's Businesses Act of 2007. This \nlegislation represents a critical step forward in bringing affordable \nhealth care to the uninsured and lowering the ever increasing costs of \nhealth care for families and businesses.\n  The bill that we are introducing today proposes that the Federal \nGovernment assume responsibility for the most burdensome risk for \nemployers, and in doing so helps to provide greater access to lower \npriced health care. Under our legislation, the Federal Government will \nreimburse employers for a significant portion of the costs of their \nmost ill employees--75 percent of medical bills in excess of $50,000. \nIn exchange, employers agree to offer all of their workers preventative \ncare and quality coverage.\n  At the heart of this bill lies the fact that 1 percent of patients \naccount for 25 percent of health care costs, and 20 percent of the \npopulation that is catastrophically ill accounts for 80 percent of the \ncosts. Planning for the unfortunate chance that one falls into one of \nthese categories is precisely why individuals have health insurance. \nYet it is also the primary reason why many employers, particularly \nsmall businesses where one critically ill individual can have a \ntremendous influence on the\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\noverall cost, do not offer their employees health insurance. Through \nreinsurance, the Federal Government has an opportunity to absorb a \nlarge portion of this risk and encourage more affordable and meaningful \nemployer sponsored health coverage. This legislation also eases the \nburden on health insurance companies by making rate determinations more \npredictable.\n  Federal reinsurance is an efficient use of Federal dollars because it \nspreads the burden across employers, the Federal Government, and \nemployees, thereby lowering costs and increasing access to quality \nhealth care. Reinsurance reduces health insurance premiums for \neveryone; some estimates suggest as much as 10 percent. Actions to \ndecrease the cost of health care and improve access to care are crucial \nif we are to combat ever-rising health care costs in this country. In \nRhode Island, from 2000 to 2006, premiums increased 75 percent while \nmedian earnings went up only 23 percent. Uninsured rates have also \ngrown in Rhode Island with more than 13 percent of residents under age \n65 with no health insurance, up from 8.1 percent in 1999. Rhode Island \nis not unique; the entire country bears the burden of high health care \ncosts and increasingly declining access. This legislation lays the \ngroundwork for achieving our goal of making health care more affordable \nand more accessible to every American.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleague in introducing this important \ninitiative and hope the Senate will give it prompt consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1302. A bill to amend title V of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 to encourage and support parent, family, and \ncommunity involvement in schools, to provide needed integrated services \nand comprehensive supports to children, and to ensure that schools are \ncenters of communities, for the ultimate goal of assisting students to \nstay in school, become successful learners, and improve academic \nachievement; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nKeeping Parents and Communities Engaged or Keeping PACE Act, to foster \ngreater involvement of parents in their children's education, engage \ncommunity partners in supporting the comprehensive learning needs of \nstudents in school, as well as to address our Nation's high dropout \nrate.\n  It is clear that engaged parents can make a positive difference in \nstudents' achievement. Parents are their children's first teachers, and \nthey have immense influence over their children's attitudes, focus, \npriorities and goals. Well-informed parents are more likely to be \ninvolved, to ask questions, to suggest constructive changes and to make \na difference in their child's education. They deserve to know what \ntheir children are learning and being tested on, what their children's \ngrades and assessment scores mean, and how assessment data may be used \nfor improvement. Informed and engaged parents can help turn around \nstruggling schools.\n  We crafted the No Child Left Behind Act to recognize parents as full \npartners in their children's education. The Act includes essential \nrequirements to develop parent involvement policies and programs, \ndevelop and release school report cards, and to establish a team of \nparents and community representatives to construct a plan to improve \nschools if they are identified as struggling. We should build on these \nimportant reforms. But in the upcoming reauthorization of the law, we \nmust also explore new and innovative strategies to engage parents and \ncommunities in helping kids succeed in school.\n  Better coordination among parents, schools, and the community can \nalso help create a network that enables and empowers students to take \nadvantage of every opportunity to learn. That's particularly important \nfor students needing the greatest help and attention in their learning \nand those who need more challenging schoolwork to keep them engaged and \nprogressing, as well as students at risk of dropping out of school. \nToday, more than one million students who enter the ninth grade fail to \nreceive a high school diploma 4 years later and approximately 7,000 \nstudents drop out of school every day. We've made great advances in \nrecent years to improve the education of every student, but it remains \nclear that more must be done to respond to this challenge.\n  We must support and strengthen our elementary and secondary schools \nand do more to attend to the learning and nonacademic needs of our most \nat-risk students, which make such a difference in how well they master \ntheir subjects. That means support for community programs to meet \nchildren's social, intellectual, emotional, and physical needs. It \nmeans making parent involvement a top priority, and offering support to \nschools to involve parents and families more effectively in their \nchildren's education, including postsecondary education planning.\n  The Keeping PACE Act will address these fundamental issues. This bill \namends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to encourage \nand support parent, family, and community involvement in schools, to \nprovide needed supports and services to children, and to ensure that \nschools are centers of communities.\n  Educators recognize, on the basis of abundant research and common \nexperience, that parental involvement is a critical element in \nchildren's academic and social development. Unfortunately, as noted in \na recent report by Appleseed, too often, schools and districts continue \nto face challenges that impede efforts to effectively advance parental \ninvolvement. My bill enables States to award grants to local education \nagencies to assist schools in hiring and maintaining Parent and \nCommunity Outreach Coordinators. These coordinators will build critical \npartnerships among families, schools, and the community. They'll work \nwith school principals, teachers, and staff to encourage parents to \nbecome more involved in their child's education and give them the tools \nnecessary to become successful advocates for their children.\n  Last year, a Massachusetts pilot initiative placed 17 full-time \nFamily and Community Outreach Coordinators in Boston Public Schools. \nThe Coordinators were responsible for supporting families, teachers, \nand the community in a common effort to help students excel \nacademically and socially.\n  Their efforts have worked. The Family and Community Outreach \nCoordinator at the Condon School in Boston, Massachusetts, has offered \nworkshops for parents on middle school transition and math curriculum; \ncoordinated parent participation on the School Climate Committee, an \nanti-bullying initiative at the school; helped teachers and parents \nmake connections for parent-teacher conferences; and brought in over \n200 parents to participate in the fall open house, where some teachers \nreported having contact with over 80 percent of their students' \nfamilies. The Coordinator has also leveraged donations to the school \nthrough the generosity of local businesses.\n  The success of the coordinators led the Boston School Committee to \napprove its budget for the next school year with the addition of 14 \nmore full-time Family and Community Outreach Coordinators. All together \nthis means that almost 22 percent of Boston Public Schools will have a \ncoordinator by September 2007-2008.\n  The director of the Harvard Family Research Project notes that many \nyears of research confirm that ``now is the time . . . for action. The \nquestion we must ask is, in addition to quality schools, what non-\nschool learning resources should we invest in and scale up to improve \neducational outcomes, narrow achievement gaps, and equip our children \nwith the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in the complex and \nglobal 21st century.''\n\n  The bill answers that question and responds directly to these needs \nby creating new grants for community-based organizations to work in \npartnership with schools to bring essential comprehensive and \nintegrated services to children in need. These support services may \ninclude health care, counseling, social services, enrichment, \nmentorship, and tutoring, services that can often spell the difference \nbetween a dropout and a graduate.\n  Rather than giving teachers, counselors, and principals more to do as \nthey address the non-classroom needs\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nof students, every school should have a resource they can turn to for \nhelp with identifying student needs and leveraging community services \nto help all students succeed. We know that comprehensive, integrated \nsupportive services increase graduation rates and improve student \nachievement. In one national report: 82 percent of tracked students \nimproved their attendance in school; 86 percent of tracked students had \nfewer behavior incidents; 89 percent of tracked students had fewer \nsuspensions. In addition, 98 percent of tracked students stayed in \nschool and 85 percent of eligible seniors graduated. Students who are \nidentified as needing these services, but do not receive them are more \nlikely to drop out of school.\n  The Lucy Stone School in Boston, Massachusetts, demonstrates the \neffectiveness of student supports on learning. The once failing school \ntook action and focused on improving core learning skills, a broad \narray of enrichment activities and health and social supports. Lucy \nStone is making strong progress. Students in Grades 3 and 4 are passing \nthe literacy MCAS at rates well above the Boston Public School average \npercentages, and are approaching State averages. Grade 4 math MCAS \npassing rates are approaching Boston and State averages as well.\n  In other communities, diverse community partners have played an \nimportant role in providing accelerated learning and mentoring \nopportunities that have made all the difference for students.\n  For example, a comprehensive evaluation of nine schools in New \nEngland found that classroom participation in community service outdoor \nlearning projects increased student engagement and retention of science \nknowledge. And the ``Being Enthusiastic about Math and Science'' \n(BEAMS) enrichment program at the Jefferson National Lab in Virginia, \nwhich serves 1,800 inner-city students and their teachers, has resulted \nin increased achievement and attendance rates, and a better \nunderstanding of academic subjects, careers and applications among \nparticipating students.\n  The National Commission on Service Learning found that mentorships \nand internships with caring adults in a workplace resulted in higher \ngrade point averages and better attendance than for students who spend \nless time with adult mentors.\n  There is one particular organization that has a demonstrated track \nrecord in helping leverage the integrated services and supports that \nstudents need to succeed in school. Communities in Schools (CIS) is the \nNation's largest dropout prevention organization, and has a nearly 30-\nyear track record of helping connect students, families and schools \nwith supportive services to help them graduate and prepare for life. \nWith affiliates operating in 27 States and the District of Columbia, \nCommunities in Schools helps about 2 million students every year.\n  Community involvement means real help for children in need, and the \nevidence shows. For instance:\n  In Georgia, CIS currently supports graduation coaches directly \nserving approximately 37,000 high school students who are at risk of \ndropping out.\n  In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, CIS stepped in to provide morning \nclasses and afternoon activities for students whose parents had lost \ntheir social support systems after they were forced to relocate to \nHouston, Texas.\n  There are also countless individual stories of community-based \nintegrated services making a difference. In Texas, CIS helped 14-year-\nold Yeana Carbajal, who was born with cerebral palsy, to obtain proper \nmedical attention and social services, enabling her to return to school \nafter hip surgery when her doctors had told her that would be \nimpossible. Yeana is now back in school and thriving academically and \nsocially.\n  Another student, who at 14 became the primary caregiver of a mother \nwho eventually died with AIDS, overcame homelessness and became the \nfirst in her family to graduate high school. A turning point for her \ncame when she participated in a career exploration program coordinated \nthrough the community-based program office at her school. She \ndiscovered her special talents in the culinary arts, and is now an \nhonor student at Johnson and Wales University.\n  Finally, a growing body of educational research suggests that student \nachievement improves in environments where learning is a community \nvalue, and where schools have the ability to address a broad range of \neducational needs. Many school districts have gone even further to \nrespond to this research, by establishing full-service community \nschools that directly involve parents, families, and the entire \ncommunity in education.\n  The Keeping PACE Act also responds to this research by providing new \navenues to establish and support full-service community schools. These \nefforts have wide-ranging positive impacts, including ``better family \nfunctioning and parental involvement, healthy youth development and \nimproved social behavior, improved academic achievement and learning \noutcomes, and enhanced community life.'' Two prominent researchers in \nthe field further note, ``In community schools . . . schools are \ntransformed into much more than just a portfolio of programs and \nservices. They become a powerful agent for change in the lives of young \npeople and their families and improve the climate of the entire \nschool.''\n  This bill enables States to provide incentives to local education \nagencies that coordinate with mayors, community-based organizations, \nfor-profit organizations and other community partners to re-design and \nmodernize their current school plans and facilities to better link \nstudents with community resources. School districts across the country \nare beginning to recognize the benefits of planning a school not only \nas an academic center for students, but also as a neighborhood center \nthat serves the entire community. Designing schools from the onset to \nleverage integrated services to students helps meet multiple local \nneeds such as educational, health, social service, and recreational \nneeds.\n  It's time for America to make a real commitment, and give real \nopportunity and real fairness to address the comprehensive learning \nneeds of children and families, guarantee a place for parents and \nfamilies in schools, and provide real hope to our students most at-risk \nof dropping out. Engaging parents and communities in the success of \nstudents enrolled in our public schools is critical to the future and \nprosperity of our entire Nation.\n  This bill is supported by 15 organizations representing education \ncommunities. I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Communities in Schools,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 16, 2007.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of Communities In Schools--\n     our national offices and our network of local affiliates in \n     27 states and District of Columbia--I would like to \n     congratulate you on the introduction of the Keeping Parents \n     and Communities Engaged (Keeping PACE) Act. For 30 years \n     Communities In Schools has been working to connect existing \n     community resources with schools to improve student \n     achievement. This legislation provides much needed structure, \n     funding, and support at the federal level for critical \n     community engagement activities in our nation's public \n     schools. The Keeping PACE Act's provisions are research-\n     based, effective, and fiscally responsible. Communities In \n     Schools strongly supports this legislation.\n       While much of the rhetoric in education is about the \n     problems in the system, the Keeping PACE Act offers a real \n     solution to help to lower the high school dropout rate and \n     raise the achievement level of students in need. Too often, \n     students at risk of dropping out or not achieving \n     academically have the talent, intelligence, and potential to \n     achieve, but they need assistance to address challenges that \n     may block their way. The Keeping PACE Act's three components \n     provide a strong foundation to help students--particularly \n     those at risk of dropping out of school--with their \n     challenges by supporting: grants to states to support parent \n     and community outreach coordinators in schools; grants to \n     community-based organizations to engage schools and provide \n     integrated services; and grants to help make schools the \n     centers of their communities.\n       Communities In Schools is particularly pleased that the \n     Keeping PACE Act provides support for community-based \n     organizations that provide integrated student services. \n     Community-based, integrated student services are \n     interventions that improve student achievement by connecting \n     community resources--such as mentoring, service-learning, and \n     afterschool programs--with both the academic and social \n     service needs of students. Programs focus energy, resources, \n     and time on shared school and student goals. The core \n     strategy of community-based, integrated student services is \n     to leverage existing community resources and effectively\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\n     link these resources with students in need in order to \n     address whatever barriers the students may face. This \n     leverages a greater return on federal, state, and local \n     investments that are already being made in education. Without \n     coordination, however, many students cannot benefit from \n     these programs. The Keeping PACE Act supports funding for \n     this critical coordination and effectively leverages current \n     federal, state, and local investments in education.\n       Importantly, research and experience establish that the \n     model supported by the Keeping PACE Act works in all types of \n     schools across the country--urban, rural, and suburban. By \n     supporting community-based, integrated student services and \n     parental involvement, the Keeping PACE Act provides strong \n     support for a very effective strategy to address our nation's \n     dropout rate and the achievement gap in communities across \n     the country.\n       Thank you again for your leadership the Keeping PACE Act. \n     This very important bill will go along way toward supporting \n     the services that young people need and will make a huge \n     difference in lowering the dropout rate and closing the \n     achievement gap.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Daniel J. Cardinali,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Center for American\n\n\n                                         Progress Action Fund,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: This letter is written to express the \n     support of the Center for American Progress Action Fund for \n     your PACE Act of 2007. The PACE Act takes great strides \n     towards facilitating community support for low-income \n     schools, a crucial step towards closing the achievement gap \n     and providing all American children with equal educational \n     opportunity.\n       Schools, families, communities, and children themselves all \n     play important roles in promoting student learning. Children \n     are more likely to do their best when all these players work \n     together to ensure that challenges students face outside the \n     classroom are addressed, rather than remaining as ongoing \n     barriers to student learning and achievement.\n       Community schools reshape the structure of traditional \n     schools and recast their roles in the community by explicitly \n     positioning schools, families and communities as vital \n     partners in fostering the health, well-being and academic \n     growth of children. These schools help address the out-of-\n     school needs of students and their families so that young \n     people can focus on learning when they are in the classroom, \n     and also take advantage of nurturing opportunities outside of \n     the classroom.\n       Providing supplemental support services to students and \n     their families has been shown to lead to real improvements in \n     their well-being. Researchers have documented that students \n     in community schools demonstrate positive outcomes, including \n     higher test scores, fewer disciplinary problems, improved \n     attendance and graduation rates, and diminished incidence of \n     self-destructive behaviors.\n       We are pleased that the report by the Renewing Our Schools, \n     Securing Our Future National Task Force on Public Education, \n     issued by our sister organization, the Center for American \n     Progress, has influenced the drafting of this legislation, \n     and that the PACE Act reflects the community schools \n     recommendations in that report. It is our hope that Congress \n     and the nation as a whole will embrace the ideas in this \n     important piece of legislation.\n           Best Regards,\n                                                     John Podesta,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Citizen Schools,\n\n                                       Boston, MA, April 13, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing in support of the \n     Keeping Parents and Communities Engaged (Keeping PACE) Act of \n     2007. The Keeping PACE Act proposes a promising set of \n     initiatives to strengthen two areas that are key to student \n     success: parental involvement and coordinated community \n     support.\n       At Citizen Schools, we see the importance of parental \n     engagement and integrated student support systems every day. \n     Citizen Schools operates a national network of after-school \n     programs that advance student achievement and mobilize adult \n     volunteers to teach hands-on apprenticeship courses. Our \n     programs blend real-world learning projects with rigorous \n     academic and leadership development activities, preparing \n     students in the middle grades for success in high school, \n     college, the workforce, and civic life. Citizen Schools \n     currently serves 3,000 students and engages 2,400 volunteers \n     in California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina and \n     Texas. In Massachusetts, our programs operate in Boston, \n     Lowell, Malden, New Bedford, Worcester, and Springfield.\n       Citizen Schools works intensively with low-income students, \n     most of whom are struggling academically. A rigorous \n     independent evaluation has reported that Citizen Schools' \n     students significantly outperformed a matched comparison \n     group on key metrics of school success and advancement, \n     including grades and standardized test scores. These \n     achievements would not be possible without the engagement and \n     support of students' families and communities.\n       Our program also brings together students and adult \n     volunteers, and we have seen the rewards that both groups \n     derive from this opportunity to interact. As such, Citizen \n     Schools wholeheartedly supports efforts that reduce the \n     barriers between schools and communities.\n       The Keeping PACE Act will produce positive outcomes for our \n     neediest students by facilitating parent involvement and \n     access to community resources. Thank you for your leadership \n     on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Eric Schwarz,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                          for Gifted Children,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: The National Association for Gifted \n     Children (NAGC), the largest organization devoted to meeting \n     the needs of the nation's more than three million gifted and \n     talented students, is writing to express its support of the \n     Keeping Parents and Communities Engaged (Keeping PACE) Act.\n       In high-poverty school districts, little attention is being \n     paid to finding and supporting the children who meet the \n     requirements of NCLB-mandated tests and are ready to move to \n     higher levels of achievement. Many low-income promising \n     students may be trapped in schools that do not acknowledge \n     the presence of gifted children, do not offer appropriate \n     level of intellectual stimulation, and do not provide the \n     services necessary to encourage talent development. This \n     failure to address the learning needs of high-ability \n     children is a tragedy for the children, their families, \n     communities, and the nation.\n       The Keeping PACE Act will be a catalyst for developing the \n     partnerships necessary to support bright children from \n     disadvantaged backgrounds. The Act establishes an integrated \n     service strategy for students and their families in several \n     key areas--including mentoring, tutoring, and enrichment--\n     which go a long to supporting the intellectual appetites of \n     students who are unchallenged in the classroom, who want to \n     explore in-depth learning on their own, or who need safe \n     haven from negative peer attitudes towards academic \n     achievement. We also applaud the Act's focus on assisting \n     students and parents in planning for post-secondary \n     educational opportunities. Many of these bright children will \n     be the first in their families to pursue post-secondary \n     options and they will need assistance to make appropriate \n     decisions and to understand the range of grant and other \n     funding opportunities available to high-achieving students.\n       NAGC is invested in building alliances with other national \n     organizations that serve low-income learners and has made a \n     strong commitment to enhancing the competency of teachers who \n     work with underserved populations of students. We look \n     forward to working with you and your office in support of \n     this legislation and to strengthen NCLB in other ways for \n     gifted and talented students.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Nancy Green,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Collaboration\n\n\n                                                    for Youth,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: The National Collaboration for Youth \n     is writing to express its support of the Keeping Parents and \n     Communities Engaged (Keeping PACE) Act.\n       The National Collaboration for Youth membership comprises \n     national youth-serving organizations that have a presence in \n     almost every community in the United States. The signers of \n     this letter include community-based organizations, and \n     organizations that conduct research, evaluation, and provide \n     technical assistance to communities and schools across the \n     country. As advocates striving to improve the conditions of \n     young people in America, we believe that student achievement \n     is enhanced when parents, caregivers and communities are \n     engaged in education.\n       Research and experience demonstrate that improving the \n     interaction between school and community, and providing \n     integrated services and supports for students and their \n     families in such areas as healthcare, employment, mentoring, \n     tutoring, enrichment and recreation, will help to serve the \n     intellectual, social, emotional, and physical well-being of \n     students. Access to these and other related non-academic \n     needs pave the way for the successful education of a young \n     person. By incorporating family and community engagement with \n     schools, the Keeping PACE Act will strengthen the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act, and will be an important tool in \n     reducing the school dropout rate and closing the achievement \n     gap.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you and your \n     office to strengthen the goals of this legislation, and move \n     it towards enactment. Please do not hesitate to contact us if \n     we can be of any assistance.\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\n       Thank you for your leadership and public service.\n           Sincerely,\n       America's Promise--The Alliance for Youth, Marguerite \n     Kondracke, President and CEO.\n       Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, Judy Vredenburgh, \n     President and CEO.\n       Camp Fire USA, Jill Pasewalk, National President and CEO.\n       Communities In Schools, Inc., Daniel Cardinali, President.\n       First Focus, Bruce Lesley, President.\n       Forum for Youth Investment, Karen J.

Edward Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: It is a pleasure to formally endorse the \n     Keeping Parents and Communities Engaged Act. This important \n     legislation recognizes the critical role played by families \n     and communities in improving the academic success of our \n     students. We applaud this bill and look forward to working \n     with you toward its enactment.\n       First Focus believes, and research demonstrates, that we \n     must meet the needs of students in and outside the classroom \n     in order to bolster their success in school. A study \n     commissioned by the America's Promise Alliance analyzed the \n     impact of having five key resources in children's lives: \n     caring adults, safe places, a healthy start, an effective \n     education, and opportunities to help others. Students with \n     four or five of these resources were twice as likely as their \n     peers with zero or one resource to get As in school, 40 \n     percent more likely to volunteer, and twice as likely to \n     avoid violence. The Keeping PACE Act is crucial because it \n     will help to connect young people to an array of services and \n     supports, thereby increasing their access to these and other \n     important resources.\n       The debate surrounding the reauthorization of the No Child \n     Left Behind Act will appropriately center on issues \n     surrounding accountability, teacher quality, national \n     standards and other important topics. We thank you for \n     raising the importance of parent and community engagement as \n     well. Every child can succeed, but we must provide them with \n     the tools to do so. By building stronger connections between \n     parents, schools, and communities, the Keeping PACE Act will \n     help the nation be stronger supporters of our students.\n       Chairman Kennedy, thank you for your leadership. We look \n     forward to working with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bruce Lesley,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 1304. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe Arizona National Scenic Trail; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nKyl in introducing the Arizona Trail Feasibility National Scenic Trail \nAct. This bill would designate the Arizona Trail as a National Scenic \nTrail. A similar bill is being introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congresswoman Giffords.\n  The Arizona Trail is a beautifully diverse stretch of public lands, \nmountains, canyons, deserts, forests, historic sites, and communities. \nThe Trail is approximately 807 miles long and begins at the Coronado \nNational Memorial on the U.S.-Mexico border and ends in the Bureau of \nLand Management's Arizona Strip District on the Utah border near the \nGrand Canyon. In between these two points, the trail winds through some \nof the most rugged, spectacular scenery in the Western United States. \nThe corridor for the Arizona Trail encompasses the wide range of \necological diversity in the State, and incorporates a host of existing \ntrails into one continuous trail. In fact, the trail route is so \ntopographically diverse that a person can hike from the Sonoran Desert \nto Alpine forests in 1 day.\n  For over a decade, more than 16 Federal, State, and local agencies, \nas well as community and business organizations, have partnered to \ncreate, develop, and manage the Arizona Trail. Through their combined \nefforts, these agencies and the members of the Arizona Trail \nAssociation have completed over 90 percent of the longest contiguous \nland-based trail in the State of Arizona. Designating the Arizona Trail \nas a National Scenic Trail would help streamline the management of the \nhigh-use trail to ensure that this pristine stretch of diverse land is \npreserved for future generations to enjoy.\n  Since 1968, when the National Trails System Act was established, \nCongress has designated over 20 National trails. Before a trail \nreceives a national designation, a Federal study is typically required \nto assess the feasibility of establishing a trail route. The Arizona \nTrail doesn't require a feasibility study because it's virtually \ncomplete with less than 60 miles left to build and sign. All but 1 \npercent of the trail resides on public land, and the unfinished \nsegments don't involve private property. The trail meets the criteria \nto be labeled a National Scenic Trail and already appears on all \nArizona State maps. Therefore, the Congress has reason to forego an \nunnecessary and costly feasibility study and proceed straight to \nNational Scenic Trail designation.\n  The Arizona Trail is known throughout the State as boon to outdoor \nenthusiasts. The Arizona State Parks recently released data showing \nthat two-thirds of Arizonans consider themselves trail users. Millions \nof visitors also use Arizona's trails each year. In one of the fastest-\ngrowing States in the U.S., the designation of the Arizona Trail as a \nNational Scenic Trail would ensure the preservation of a corridor of \nopen space for hikers, mountain bicyclists, cross country skiers, \nsnowshoers, eco-tourists, equestrians, and joggers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain in introducing the Arizona National Scenic Trail Act. This bill \nwould amend the National Trails System Act to designate the Arizona \nTrail as a national scenic trail. In 1968, Congress established the \nNational Trails System to promote the preservation of historical \nresources and outdoor areas. National scenic and historic trails may be \ndesignated only by an act of Congress.\n  This is not a new proposal. Senator McCain and I have been working on \nlegislation relating to the Arizona Trail since the 108th Congress. \nPast legislation focused on conducting a feasibility study to determine \nwhether the trail is physically possible and financially feasible. A \nfeasibility study is generally the first step toward national trail \ndesignation, but such legislation was not successfully enacted. In the \nmeantime the Arizona Trail Association and its State and Federal \npartners have continued to develop the trail with national designation \nin mind. Senator McCain and I believe a feasibility study is not \nnecessary. Let me explain: the Arizona Trail already exists. It extends \nover 800 continuous miles and is over 90 percent complete--clearly, it \nis physically possible. It is also financially feasible, as this trail \ndoes not require a single land acquisition, and commitments already \nexist to manage the trail and complete the remaining few miles of trail \nconstruction. This trail is ready for designation. In fact, the Arizona \nTrail is farther along than many national scenic trails that have \nalready been designated by Congress.\n  The Arizona Trail is highly deserving of national designation. The \ntrail is a roller coaster ride through the wide range of ecological \ndiversity in the State. The trail corridor begins at the Coronado \nNational Memorial on the U.S.-Mexico border and winds some 800 miles, \nending on the Bureau of Land Management's Arizona Strip District on the \nUtah border. Between these two points, it invites recreationists to \nexplore the State's most renowned mountains, canyons, deserts and \nforests, including the Grand Canyon and the Sonora Desert. This trail \nis unique in that it maximizes the incorporation of already existing \npublic trails into one continuous trail to showcase some of the most \nspectacular scenery in the West.\n  Over 16 Federal, State and local agencies, as well as numerous \ncommunity and business organizations and countless volunteers, have \ncooperated to develop and sustain the trail as a recreational resource \nfor future generations. Designating the Arizona Trail\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\nas a national scenic tail will help streamline its management, boost \ntourism and recreation, and preserve a magnificent natural, cultural, \nand historical experience of the American West. I urge my colleagues to \nenact this legislation at the earliest possible date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Levin, and Mrs. McCaskill):\n  S. 1307. A bill to Include Medicare provider payments in the Federal \nPayment Levy Program, to require the Department of Health and Human \nServices to offset Medicare provider payments by the amount of the \nprovider's delinquent Federal debt, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare Provider \nAccountability Act on behalf of myself, and my colleagues Senator Levin \nand Senator McCaskill. This bill is a direct result of the recent \nbipartisan investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations exposing Medicare physicians and related providers who \ncheat on their taxes. At our March 20 hearing, entitled ``Medicare \nDoctors Who Cheat On Their Taxes,'' the Subcommittee presented evidence \nthat more than 21,000 physicians and other providers received millions \nof dollars through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nunder Medicare Part B, even though they collectively owe more than $1.3 \nbillion in undisputed Federal taxes as of September 30, 2006.\n  I think it is important to note that the vast majority of physicians \nare working hard to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries. In \nfact, I know that many doctors struggle with on-going reductions in \npayments under the so-called Sustainable Growth Rate.\n  The focus of PSI's ongoing investigations has been tax fraud and \ngovernment contractors. CMS is the only Federal agency of considerable \nsize that has resisted participating in the Federal Payment Levy \nProgram that I will describe later. As we looked into CMS, we found \nthat there were physicians receiving payments from the government while \nthey simultaneously withheld money from the government by cheating on \ntaxes, and failing to pay child support or student loan debts. Through \ntheir actions, these ``bad apples'' are hurting efforts to promote the \nlongterm sustainability of the Medicare Program.\n  What is disturbing is that the delinquent doctors identified by our \ninvestigation were not hardship cases but rather folks living the \n``good life.'' This minority of physicians live in multi-million-dollar \nhomes, own luxury vehicles and pleasure boats, and gamble with millions \nof dollars, yet still cheat the government.\n  Some of the most egregious examples that GAO discovered include the \nfollowing:\n  An ambulance company received more than $1 million from Medicare in \njust the first 9 months of 2005, although it owed more than $11 million \nin back taxes.\n  One doctor has refused to pay Federal income taxes since the 1970s \nand now owes more than $3 million in unpaid Federal taxes, and more \nthan $1 million to another Federal agency. He was paid approximately \n$100,000 by Medicare in the first 9 months of 2005. He tried to hide \nhis assets by attempting to transfer property to his children.\n  Another physician who owes more than $1 million, primarily as payroll \ntaxes withheld from his employees, received more than $1 million from \nMedicare between January and September 2005. He was flaunting his \nillegally gained windfall with a million-dollar home, 58-foot yacht, \nand ownership of several night clubs. His recently reported income is \nhalf a million dollars, but the compromise offer he made to the IRS \nonly covers the penalty for nonpayment and not the overdue taxes \nthemselves.\n\n  Another physician whose medical license is on probation owes more \nthan $400,000 in unpaid Federal taxes. Despite this debt, he purchased \na luxury vehicle predominantly with cash, deposited tens of thousands \nof dollars in cash in such a way as to avoid mandatory reporting to the \nIRS, and gambled away millions of dollars. Although he did report more \nthan $600,000 in net profits for 2 recent years, he still managed to \nfall behind in his child support payments by tens of thousands of \ndollars and to default on his installment agreement with the IRS.\n  Unfortunately, the list goes on and on. Worse, as if failing to pay \ntheir taxes was not a sufficient insult to American taxpayers, Medicare \nproviders also owed $33 million in child support, $27 million in unpaid \nstudent loans, $114 million owed to other Federal agencies, and $22 \nmillion in unpaid state income taxes.\n  While these figures and case studies are obviously disturbing, the \ngood news is that the Federal Government has two marvelous programs for \nrecovering Federal debt from Federal payments, the Federal Payment Levy \nProgram, FPLP, for tax debt, and the Treasury Offset Program, TOP, for \nnon-tax debt, such as delinquent student loans, child support, and \nmoney owed Federal agencies. The Financial Management Service, FMS, \nhandles both of these programs and matches pending payments from the \nFederal Government against outstanding Federal tax debt in the case of \nFPLP, and against other outstanding federal debt in TOP. If such debt \nexists, a levy of 15 percent or more is imposed upon each payment made \nto the delinquent taxpayer until that debt is recovered. FMS currently \nscreens most Federal payments for unpaid taxes, including salaries and \npayments to contractors and vendors.\n  The Government Accountability Office specifically recommended that \nCMS confer with the IRS and FMS to figure out how to get Medicare \npayments into the levy program. That recommendation came in six years \nago, in 2001, so it is clear that CMS and the other agencies have been \n``on notice'' about this very issue for years. In fact, although CMS \nhas been sending information on payments to Medicare Part C and D \nproviders to FMS for matching in FPLP, it has failed to include the \nmore than $300 billion in payments to Part A and B providers.\n  As a result, the Federal Government has lost countless opportunities \nto levy Medicare payments made to tax-delinquent doctors and other \nsuppliers. The GAO estimated that, if CMS had participated in the levy \nprogram, the government could have recouped anywhere between $50 \nmillion and $140 million of unpaid Federal taxes from these Medicare \ntax-cheats in just the first nine months of 2005 alone. That does not \ninclude potential millions recouped for delinquent student loans, \nunpaid child support, and back-taxes owed to States.\n  But we are not in the blame business, we are in the problem-solving \nbusiness. So, the paramount question is how to fix this mess. Make no \nmistake: these are complex problems, but I am confident that we can fix \nthem. This legislation is a good start.\n  The bill, entitled the Medicare Provider Accountability Act, has \nthree prongs to assist the Federal government with the collection of \nthese outstanding debts. It establishes a timetable for CMS to join the \nFederal Payment Levy Program for all payments to Medicare providers, \nand expressly authorizes CMS to participate in the Treasury Offset \nProgram to collect nontax debt. Finally, it enables the IRS to begin \nlevying payments earlier in the notice process.\n  First, this bill sets a deadline by which CMS must fully participate \nin the FPLP. Fifty percent of the payments to Part A and B providers \nmust be sent to FMS for matching tax debt under FPLP within 1 year of \nenactment. Within 2 years of enactment, every Medicare provider \npayment, regardless of Part, will be checked by FMS under FPLP for \noutstanding Federal tax debt.\n  Second, this bill gives CMS the authority to submit payments to its \nproviders to TOP, which it had previously been unable to do. CMS and \nFMS testified at the hearing that CMS cannot legally participate in TOP \nas a Federal disbursing authority, and that to do so will require a \nLegislative fix. This bill explicitly includes payments to Medicare \nproviders as disbursements that can be offset, allowing for the \nrecovery of delinquent student loans, overdue child support, debts owed \nto other federal agencies and state taxes.\n  In addition, this legislation enables IRS to levy Federal payments to \nrecover delinquent tax debt earlier in the process. Currently, only \nabout half of the $140 billion in tax debt eligible for\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\nmatching is ``turned on'' to allow FMS to begin levying payments \nthrough FPLP. This is a result of IRS's current procedure, sending four \ncomputer-generated notices followed by a Collection Due Process, CDP, \nnotice. Although the delinquent taxpayer can enter a payment plan or \nchallenge the amount throughout the process, the formal appeals process \nbegins only after all of those notices are issued. This protracted \nprocess allows a delinquent taxpayer to drag out the process and \nprevent automatic levies anywhere from months to years. An additional \nproblem beyond the delay is that by the time the appeals process \nconcludes, the contractor may no longer be receiving Federal payments. \nThis provision of the bill accelerates the collection process, enabling \na postlevy appeals process, whereby the IRS can begin to levy Federal \npayments prior to the CDP notice. To be clear, this would permit the \nGovernment to begin levying payments earlier, while still preserving \nthe taxpayer's right to appeal. This will not affect levies on third \nparties.\n  Congress has spent much of this session focusing on health care. We \nall know that we have a crisis looming with Medicare. In order to \nensure the long term sustainability of the program, we need to be sure \nthat the money that is going out through this program is being spent \nefficiently and effectively. We also need to be sure that the money \nthat is coming into this program through our taxes is being collected \nefficiently and effectively. They are part and parcel of the same \nproblem. As we look for money to spend on programs to benefit our most \nvulnerable, this legislation can go a long way to identifying possible \nsources.\n  I would especially like to thank Chairman Levin for his ongoing \nsupport of our efforts to address those who receive Federal payments \nwithout paying their taxes. This is truly a bipartisan effort and a \nbipartisan bill in its writing and its sponsorship.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1307\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues, Senator \nColeman and Senator McCaskill, in introducing the Medicare Provider \nAccountability Act. This bill targets Medicare, a program which is \nindispensable to the health of our citizens, because some Medicare \nservice providers are profiting from the program while abusing the \nfederal tax system. The facts show that, while the vast majority of \nMedicare health care providers are honest, tax-paying citizens, others \nare getting paid with taxpayer dollars while, at the same time, failing \nto pay their taxes.\n  Legislation to stop this abuse is a product of the work of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which I serve as Chairman \nand Senator Coleman serves as the Ranking Member. On March 20, 2007, a \nSubcommittee hearing presented testimony from the Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) showing that about 21,000 Medicare Part B \nhealth care providers, including doctors, ambulance companies, and \nmedical laboratories, collectively owe more than $1 billion in \ndelinquent taxes. GAO also determined that, despite this pending tax \ndebt, during the first 9 months of 2005 alone, these health care \nproviders had received payments on Medicare claims totaling around $140 \nmillion. In other words, these providers were stuffing taxpayer dollars \nin their pockets at the same time they were stiffing Uncle Sam by not \npaying their taxes.\n  Federal programs exist to stop this type of abuse. One key program is \nthe Federal Payment Levy Program, which was established about ten years \nago to enable the Federal government to identify federal payments being \nmade to tax delinquents, and authorize the withholding of a portion of \nthose taxpayer dollars to apply to the person's tax debt. That program \nhas successfully collected taxes from federal payments made through the \nTreasury Department and by agencies like the Defense Department who \nscreen their own payments to contractors through Treasury's Financial \nManagement Service.\n  As our March hearing demonstrated, however, despite a legal \nrequirement to do so, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(CMS) have never participated in the tax levy program with respect to \nMedicare Part A and B payments. This failure means that, year after \nyear, as much as $300 billion in Federal Medicare payments have not \nbeen screened for unpaid taxes. The first substantive provision of our \nbill would redress this situation by mandating CMS to bring all \nMedicare part A and B payments into the Federal Payment Levy Program \nover the next two years.\n  The second part of our bill would enable CMS to participate in a \nsimilar automated program, known as the Treasury Offset Program, to \ncollect non-tax debt, such as unpaid student loans and child support. \nGAO has determined that certain Medicare health care providers \ncollectively owe hundreds of millions of dollars in student loans, \nchild support, and unpaid state taxes that could be collected through \nadministrative offsets.\n  The third and final part of our bill would eliminate a barrier to \nincluding a large part of IRS's uncollected tax assessments in the \nFederal Payment Levy Program for collection from Medicare provider \npayments, as well as other federal contractor payments. Right now, for \na variety of legal and technical reasons, only 45 percent of the tax \ndebt assessed but still uncollected in 2006 was actually made subject \nto levy under the federal program. In 2006, over half of this assessed \ntax debt--some $67 billion--was never ``turned on'' for actual \ncollection under the tax levy program. Now, $67 billion is a big \nnumber, even by Washington standards.\n  One key reason that this tax debt was not ``turned on'' for \ncollection by levy is that many of the accounts had not reached the \nstage in their processing where the required notice of intent to levy \nhad been sent to the taxpayer. Until that notice is sent and the \ntaxpayer has exhausted all rights of appeal available under the tax \nlaw, the\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\nIRS is currently barred from placing a tax levy on the taxpayer's \nproperty. In the case of Medicare providers and other federal \ncontractors, that means federal dollars continue to go into their \npockets, without any withholding, despite their unpaid taxes.\n  While it may be appropriate to delay tax levies on most types of \ntaxpayer property until a taxpayer's appeals are exhausted, it makes no \nsense to keep sending taxpayer dollars to a tax delinquent Medicare \nprovider or other federal contractor while they are appealing the tax \nassessment. Withholding should be allowed when it is taxpayer dollars \nthat are being paid to the tax delinquent. That's why our bill would \ncreate a special rule for federal payments, allowing a tax levy to be \ninitiated and continue in effect, while the taxpayer's appeal goes \nforward. The taxpayer would retain the same due process rights, but a \ntax levy would be allowed to begin earlier in the administrative \nprocess; it would no longer have to wait until all of the taxpayer's \nappeal rights were exhausted. For property other than federal payments, \nthe bill would maintain the current system, requiring a pre-levy notice \nand exhausted appeal rights before the property could be levied.\n  The vast majority of Medicare providers render valuable services to \ntheir patients, and they do so while paying their taxes. These honest \nhealth care providers are put at a competitive disadvantage by the \nMedicare tax cheats who reduce their operating costs by failing to pay \ntaxes. Besides hurting honest businesses, this type of tax dodging \nhurts our country by undermining the fairness of our tax system and by \nforcing honest taxpayers to make up the shortfall needed to pay for \nbasic federal protections--like health care. When these tax delinquents \nalso receive large payments of federal funds, it adds insult to injury. \nWe must force these tax dodgers to pay their tax debt, and a key tool \nis to subject any federal payments they receive to an effective tax \nlevy program.\n  The Medicare Providers Accountability Act would target those tax \ndodgers by strengthening the tax levy program and subjecting additional \nhundreds of billions of dollars in federal payments each year to \nscreening for unpaid taxes. An improved tax levy program would, in \nturn, strengthen federal tax enforcement, take a load off the shoulders \nof honest taxpayers, and reduce the tax gap. I urge my colleagues to \njoin us in supporting the bill's enactment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my remarks follow those of Senator \nColeman in today's Congressional Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1310. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for an extension of increased payments for ground ambulance \nservices under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators Lott and \nConrad, introduce the Medicare Ambulance Payment Extension Act. Without \nthis legislation, ambulance service providers stand to lose $306 \nmillion in Medicare reimbursement in 2008 and 2009 in addition to the \nnearly $150 million they will lose this year. Our legislation will \nrestore $341 million in Medicare reimbursement with a 5 percent \nincrease in payments for 2008 and 2009.\n  Ambulance services are a vital component of the health care and \nemergency response systems of our Nation. Unfortunately, ambulance \nservices providers are being significantly under-funded in providing \ntheir critical services to Medicare patients. We need to ensure that \nour ambulance service providers have the financial resources necessary \nto provide all Americans with high quality, life-saving services.\n  Fortunately, in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, MMA, Congress \nimplemented several provisions to provide temporary relief to help \nstruggling ambulance service providers. The MMA ambulance provisions \nprovided short-term relief through 1 percent urban and 2 percent rural \nincreases, a mileage rate increase for long trips, a payment boost for \nambulance transports in extremely rural areas, and a regional \nadjustment that helped a majority of providers depending on their \nstate. While the rural payment boost and long trip increase are \ntemporarily still intact, the 1 percent urban and 2 percent rural \nincreases expired at the end of last year and the regional adjustment \nhas dropped from 80 percent to only 20 percent of payments. If Congress \ndoes not act, ambulance service providers will lose over $450 million \nin relief from 2007 through 2009.\n  Ambulance service providers cannot afford to face decreased \nreimbursement in the coming years. Ambulances services respond to not \nonly 911 calls and nonemergency requests but also as first responders \nto natural disasters and acts of terrorism. Medicare patients account \nfor approximately 45 percent of the call volume of an ambulance \noperation. Ambulance service providers cannot afford to have half of \ntheir transports reimbursed at below the cost of providing services.\n  While all health care providers face reimbursement challenges, \nambulance service providers are required by law to respond to a plea \nfor emergency medical care, regardless of whether the provider will \nrecoup the full, if any, cost of the service. This additional \nresponsibility along with the requirement that ambulance service \nproviders accept the Medicare ambulance fee schedule rate as payment in \nfull has further deteriorated the financial stability of ambulance \noperations. With increased focus on ensuring that our first responders \nare prepared in the event of a terrorist attack or national disaster, \nwe should be bolstering, not deteriorating, this health care safety \nnet.\n  The Medicare Ambulance Payment Extension Act will ensure that \npatients across America will continue to have access to critical \nambulance services.

Res. 186\n\n       Whereas food insecurity and hunger are a fact of life for \n     millions of low-income citizens of the United States and can \n     produce physical, mental, and social impairments;\n       Whereas recent data published by the Department of \n     Agriculture show that almost 38,200,000 people in the United \n     States live in households experiencing hunger or food \n     insecurity;\n       Whereas the problem of hunger and food insecurity can be \n     found in rural, suburban, and urban portions of the United \n     States, touching nearly every community of the Nation;\n       Whereas, although substantial progress has been made in \n     reducing the incidence of hunger and food insecurity in the \n     United States, certain groups remain vulnerable to hunger and \n     the negative effects of food deprivation, including the \n     working poor, the elderly, homeless people, children, migrant \n     workers, and Native Americans;\n       Whereas the people of the United States have a long \n     tradition of providing food assistance to hungry people \n     through acts of private generosity and public support \n     programs;\n       Whereas the Federal Government provides essential \n     nutritional support to millions of low-income people through \n     numerous Federal food assistance programs, including--\n       (1) the Federal food stamp program, as established by the \n     Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.);\n       (2) the Richard B.

Res. 187\n\n       Whereas, on April 27, 2007, the Bronze Soldier Soviet \n     monument in central Tallinn was moved to a prominent location \n     in the Garrison Military Cemetery as a result of a decision \n     by the Government of Estonia;\n       Whereas the Government of Estonia communicated its reasons \n     for this decision to the Government of the Russian Federation \n     and offered to work with Russian officials during the \n     process, which the Russian officials declined to do;\n       Whereas, on April 27, 2007, a crowd of more than 1,000 \n     demonstrators gathered at the site of the memorial and riots \n     broke out across Tallinn;\n       Whereas more than 153 people were injured as a result of \n     the riots, and one died as a result of stabbing by another \n     rioter;\n       Whereas several stores in Tallinn and surrounding villages \n     were looted as a result of the riots, and a statue of an \n     Estonian general was set on fire;\n       Whereas, since April 27, 2007, the Government of Estonia \n     has reported several cyber-attacks on its official lines of \n     communication, including those of the Office of the \n     President;\n       Whereas, on April 28, 2007, and in days following, the \n     Embassy of Estonia in Moscow was surrounded by angry \n     protesters who demanded the resignation of the Government of \n     Estonia, tore down the flag of Estonia from the Embassy \n     building, and subjected Embassy officials inside the building \n     to violence and vandalism;\n       Whereas, on April 30, 2007, a delegation of the State Duma \n     of the Russian Federation visited Estonia and issued an \n     official statement at the Embassy of the Russian Federation \n     in Estonia that ``the government of Estonia must step down'';\n       Whereas, on May 2, 2007, the Ambassador of Estonia to the \n     Russian Federation was physically attacked by protesters and \n     members of youth groups during an official press conference;\n       Whereas, on May 2, 2007, the Swedish Ambassador to the \n     Russian Federation was attacked as he left the Embassy of \n     Estonia in Moscow, and his car was damaged by a crowd, \n     resulting in a formal protest to the Russian Federation by \n     the Swedish Foreign Ministry;\n       Whereas the Government of Estonia has reported other \n     coordinated attacks against Estonian embassies in Helsinki, \n     Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Riga, Prague, Kiev, and Minsk, \n     and the Estonian Consulate in St. Petersburg;\n       Whereas, on May 2, 2007, Prime Minister of Estonia Andrus \n     Ansip stated that a ``sovereign state is under a heavy \n     attack'' and that the events constitute ``a well-coordinated \n     and flagrant intervention with the internal affairs of \n     Estonia'';\n       Whereas, on May 2, 2007, the public prosecutor's office of \n     Estonia initiated an investigation into the cyber-attacks \n     against Internet servers in Estonia and requested cooperation \n     from the Russian Federation to identify the source of the \n     attacks;\n       Whereas, on May 2, 2007, the European Commission expressed \n     its solidarity with Estonia and urged Russia to respect its \n     obligations to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, \n     done at Vienna April 18, 1961, and end the blockade of the \n     Embassy of Estonia in Moscow;

which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 31\n\n       Whereas health is integral to social and economic \n     development and to building stable, independent, and \n     productive societies;\n       Whereas unnecessarily high levels of preventable death and \n     disability persist in developing nations, including over \n     10,000,000 child deaths every year--30,000 each day--a \n     majority of which are from easily preventable or treatable \n     causes, including pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, malnutrition, \n     measles, and complications immediately following birth; \n     40,000,000 people infected with HIV and 3,000,000 AIDS deaths \n     per year; 530,000 deaths of women every year from \n     complications related to pregnancy and childbirth and \n     millions of cases of trauma and disability caused by \n     obstetric fistula and other preventable injuries; an unmet \n     need for family planning among over 100,000,000 married \n     women; 1,000,000 deaths annually from malaria, most of which \n     are among young children and in sub-Saharan Africa; an \n     expanding threat from tuberculosis, which is a principal \n     cause of death among those infected with HIV and is evolving \n     into forms increasingly resistant to all known drugs;

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on May 3, 2007, by the President of \nthe United States:\n  Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks, Treaty Document No. 110-2.\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith for the Senate's advice and consent to \nratification the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks (the \n``Treaty'' or ``Singapore Treaty'') adopted and signed by the United \nStates at Singapore on March 28, 2006. I also transmit for the \ninformation of the Senate a report of the Department of State with \nrespect to the Treaty.\n  If ratified by the United States, the Treaty would offer significant \nbenefits to U.S. trademark owners and national trademark offices, \nincluding the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The beneficial \nfeatures of the Trademark Law Treaty of 1994 (the ``1994 TLT''), to \nwhich the United States is a party, are included in the Singapore \nTreaty, as well as the improvements to the 1994 TLT that the United \nStates Government sought to achieve through the revision effort. Key \nimprovements allow for national trademark offices to take advantage of \nelectronic communication systems as an efficient and cost-saving \nalternative to paper communications, at such time as the office is \nready to embrace the technology. The Treaty also includes trademark \nlicense recordation provisions that reduce the formalities that \ntrademark owners face when doing business in a country that is a \nContracting Party that requires trademark license recordation. The goal \nof these provisions is to reduce the damaging effects that can result \nfrom failure to record a license in those jurisdictions that require \nrecordation. These and other improvements create a more attractive \ntreaty for World Intellectual Property Organization Member States. \nConsequently, once the Treaty is in force, it is expected to increase \nthe efficiency of national trademark offices, which in turn is expected \nto create efficiencies and cost savings for U.S. trademark owners \nregistering and maintaining trademarks abroad.\n  Ratification of the Treaty is in the best interests of the United \nStates. I recommend, therefore, that the Senate give early and \nfavorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent \nto ratification.\n                                                      George W.

Res. 188\n\n       Whereas Israel has met the membership criteria for the \n     Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n     (OECD), and has actively sought membership in the body since \n     2000;\n       Whereas, in May 2006, the OECD adopted in full the Report \n     by the Working Party on the Implications of Future \n     Enlargement on OECD Governance, stating that expanding \n     membership is vital to the organization;\n       Whereas the OECD is expected to vote on enlargement and \n     consider new countries for membership at a ministerial \n     meeting in May 2007;\n       Whereas Israel is the most active nonmember country in the \n     OECD, is a member, observer, or ad hoc observer in 50 working \n     bodies, is party to various OECD declarations, and is already \n     in compliance with multiple OECD standards;\n       Whereas Israel made significant economic reforms in recent \n     years that grew the private sector and streamlined the public \n     sector, and the Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, stated \n     that OECD membership would anchor these reforms and allow \n     additional reforms;\n       Whereas membership in the OECD would strengthen the \n     position of Israel in the global economy, solidify Israel's \n     transition from an emerging market to an advanced economy, \n     and encourage increased foreign domestic investment in \n     Israel;\n       Whereas the inclusion of Israel in the OECD would \n     strengthen the OECD because of Israel's high living standard, \n     liberal and stable markets, and commitment to democratic \n     values;\n       Whereas Israel is a world leader in science and technology \n     and is home to the most high-technology start-up companies, \n     scientific publications, and research and development \n     spending, per capita;\n       Whereas, in 2006, the World Economic Forum ranked Israel as \n     the world's 15th most competitive economy;\n       Whereas the accession of Israel to the Convention on the \n     OECD would benefit other OECD member countries because of \n     Israel's leadership in high-technology companies and research \n     and development; and\n       Whereas Israel is a strong ally of the United States and \n     supports the United States in international organizations \n     more consistently than any other country: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Israel shares the commitment of the United States to, \n     and the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development \n     (OECD) foundational principles of, good government, free \n     markets, and democratic values;\n       (2) Israel meets the OECD membership criteria, and is well \n     deserving of membership;\n       (3) it is in the interest of the United States to strongly \n     support the accession of Israel to the Convention on the \n     OECD; and\n       (4) the United States should strongly advocate for Israel's \n     accession to the Convention on the OECD before and during the \n     OECD ministerial meeting in May 2007 and use all necessary \n     and available means to secure Israel's membership in the \n     OECD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/03/senate-section/article/S5610-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL HUNGER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 186\n\n       Whereas food insecurity and hunger are a fact of life for \n     millions of low-income citizens of the United States and can \n     produce physical, mental, and social impairments;\n       Whereas recent data published by the Department of \n     Agriculture show that almost 38,200,000 people in the United \n     States live in households experiencing hunger or food \n     insecurity;\n       Whereas the problem of hunger and food insecurity can be \n     found in rural, suburban, and urban portions of the United \n     States, touching nearly every community of the Nation;\n       Whereas, although substantial progress has been made in \n     reducing the incidence of hunger and food insecurity in the \n     United States, certain groups remain vulnerable to hunger and \n     the negative effects of food deprivation, including the \n     working poor, the elderly, homeless people, children, migrant \n     workers, and Native Americans;\n       Whereas the people of the United States have a long \n     tradition of providing food assistance to hungry people \n     through acts of private generosity and public support \n     programs;\n       Whereas the Federal Government provides essential \n     nutritional support to millions of low-income people through \n     numerous Federal food assistance programs, including--\n       (1) the Federal food stamp program, as established by the \n     Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.);\n       (2) the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1751 et seq.), the special supplemental program for \n     women, infants, and children (WIC) established under section \n     17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786), and \n     other child nutrition programs; and\n       (3) food donation programs;\n       Whereas there is a growing awareness of the important \n     public and private partnership role that community-based \n     organizations, institutions of faith, and charities provide \n     in assisting hungry and food-insecure people;\n       Whereas more than 50,000 local community-based \n     organizations rely on the support and efforts of more than \n     1,000,000 volunteers to provide food assistance and services \n     to millions of vulnerable people;\n       Whereas all citizens of the United States can help \n     participate in hunger relief efforts in their communities \n     by--\n       (1) donating food and money to such efforts;\n       (2) volunteering for such efforts; and\n       (3) supporting public policies aimed at reducing hunger: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 5, 2007, as ``National Hunger Awareness \n     Day'';\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     National Hunger Awareness Day--\n       (A) with appropriate ceremonies, volunteer activities, and \n     other support for local anti-hunger advocacy efforts and \n     hunger relief charities, including food banks, food rescue \n     organizations, food pantries, soup kitchens, and emergency \n     shelters; and\n       (B) by continuing to support programs and public policies \n     that reduce hunger and food insecurity in the United States; \n     and\n       (3) authorizes the offices of Senators Gordon H.
