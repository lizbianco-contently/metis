The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that at the hour of 10:30 we \nwill be having the cloture vote on the immigration legislation. Am I \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The vote may actually be at 10:50.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this has been a long journey to try and bring our \nbroken immigration system and our broken borders to the place where \nthis Senate can take action. Today's action is going to be absolutely \nkey to whether we will be able to continue and finalize this \nlegislation at the end of the week. So today's vote is a critical vote, \nkey vote, perhaps the most important vote we have had here on this \nissue over the period of the last 3 years.\n  Our Judiciary Committee has been working on this legislation. Senator \nSpecter has been a key part of this whole effort. It has been a \nbipartisan effort. Our quest has been a bipartisan effort here on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Those of us who are committed to this issue believe we have an \nimportant responsibility to try to achieve something. We believe the \nreason for us being here, whether it is from Massachusetts or \nPennsylvania or from other States, is to deal with the public's \nbusiness, the Nation's business. This is the Nation's business. I think \noutside of the issue of the war in Iraq, this is front and center for \nour country.\n  People in my State are concerned and affected by it, and they are in \nother parts of the country as well. We have 900,000 nonnative-born \nindividuals in my State of Massachusetts. Of those 900,000, 200,000 are \nundocumented. We have more than 3,000--in the city of Boston--more than \n3,000 small businesses directly responsible for 34,000 jobs, more than \nhalf a billion dollars in pay and sales taxes in my State by those who \nare born in other countries. They represent probably less than 10 \npercent of the State's population, and 17 percent of the job market. \nThe workers in our State, 17 percent are nonnative born, a \ndemonstration that those individuals who have come here to the United \nStates want to work. They want to work. They also are men and women of \nfaith. They are men and women who care about their families, by the \nfact that more than $48 billion is returned every single year to the \ncountries in Central and South America.\n  They care about their families. They want to work. More likely than \nnot, they are all men and women of deep faith and religious belief. \nThat is reflected in many of our communities in my State and in travels \naround the country. You see that day in and day out.\n  Also they want to be a part of the American dream. We have seen that \nreflected in the total numbers of individuals who have served in the \nArmed Forces of our country. Some 70,000 have served in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and many have lost their lives. But in a number of \ninstances, individuals, the undocumented, have crossed the line in \nterms of immigration, drawn here by the great economic magnet, the \neconomic magnet that is on this side of the border that says: Look, we \nneed you over here to make the American economy work. We want to pay \nyou over here when you are unemployed over here. We will provide you \nthe resources so you can look after your family. People have been \nattracted to that magnet. We have them here.\n  For those toward the end of this discussion and debate, as we have \nheard on the floor, we know what they are against. We do not know what \nthey are for. Time and time again they tell us: We do not like this \nprovision; we do not like that provision; we do not want that part of \nit. They ought to be able to explain to the American people what they \nare for. What are they going to do with the 12\\1/2\\ million who are \nundocumented here? Send them back? Send them back to countries around \nthe world, more than $250 billion; buses that would go from Los Angeles \nto New York and back again? Try and find them? Develop a type of \nGestapo here to seek out these people who are in the shadows? That is \ntheir alternative? That is their alternative?\n  This country and this Senate is better. We have a process that said: \nLook, okay, you are here and undocumented. You are going to have to pay \na price. We are going to take people who are in the line who have said \nthey want to play by the rules. They go and they wait, and you wait and \nyou wait and you wait. You pay and pay, and you pay and you pay. You \npay your fees, you pay your processing fees, your adjustment fees. You \npay not only for yourself but the other members of the family. You \ndemonstrate you are going to learn English, you demonstrate you worked \nhere, that you are a good citizen, that you have not had any run-in \nwith crime, and then maybe you get on that pathway with a green card, \nand, perhaps, in 15, 18 years you will be able to raise your hand and \nbe a citizen here in the United States. This is the issue. Are we going \nto have a constructive and positive resolution of this issue, or are we \ngoing to be naysayers, bumper sticker sloganeers who say: We are \nagainst amnesty, or, we are against this bill?\n  America deserves better. The issue is too important. Now is the time, \nthis is the place. The Senate is the forum where we have to take this \naction.\n  I am hopeful that America is watching this and will understand what \nis at stake here. This is an issue and this is a vote of enormous \nimportance. We talk of votes here. Some are more important than others. \nA few are of enormous significance and consequence. A few of them are \ngoing to have a defining impact about what kind of society we are going \nto be in, how we are going to treat each other, whether we have a \nrespect for our fellow human beings and our fellow individuals who are \nhere in this country, and whether we believe that our greatest days are \nyet to come.\n  Are we going to respond to the voices of fear? And that is the issue. \nAre we going to have a positive resolution, a constructive resolution, \nthat is going to continue to be shaped as it goes to the House of \nRepresentatives, shaped there as well by different responsible figures? \nIt may have somewhat of a different view. Or are we going to say no, \nno, we have listened to those voices of fear who say: Absolutely not. \nWe are going to take the status quo. Every person who votes ``no'' is \ngoing to know that this situation is going to get worse and worse and \nworse.\n  We are going to say that: Oh, yes, sure, we will do something down on \nthe border. But you are never going to have the kind of workforce \nenforcement, you are never going to have the kind of absolutely \nessential identification system that any responsible immigration system \nis absolutely required to have.\n\n  This is a vital vote about the future of our country or the past. \nThat is going to be the issue in question when the time comes to vote.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The legislation now pending is the very best that can be done by very \nextensive work on the immigration problems in the United States.\n  Last year in the 109th Congress, the Judiciary Committee, which I \nchaired, produced a bill. This year we went to a little different \nprocedure and we have structured a bill which is the best that can be \ndone as of this moment. It may yet be improved in the balance of the \namendments yet to be voted upon, if cloture is invoked on this vote \nthis morning, a 60-vote tally, obviously very difficult to get to.\n  Had I written the bill, it would have been substantially different. I \nwould have agreed with Senator Menendez that there ought to be more \nconsideration to families. I would have agreed with Senator Dodd that \nwe ought to have more parents coming into this country. I would have \nagreed with those who oppose the touchback, which I think is punitive \nand formalistic and not related to anything, necessarily.\n  But this is an accommodation. The art of politics is to compromise \nand to accommodate. We have constantly said to the opponents: If you \nhave something better, tell us what it is.\n  Not only have the opponents not told us what they have in mind for \nsomething better, but they have refused to come forward and offer any \namendments and have used Senate procedure to stop others from offering \namendments. So for hours I sat here as manager of the bill doing \nnothing. That is why we have utilized the unusual procedure we have \ntoday. Some are complaining that they have not had an opportunity to \noffer amendments but,\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\ncandidly, it is their own fault. When they had a chance to do so, they \ndidn't. Beyond that, they stopped others from offering amendments.\n  We have the advocates for the immigrants. They have a very strong \ncase. What this bill started out to do was to deal with the 12 million \npeople who are so-called ``living in the shadows'' in fear. This bill \ndoes deal with that issue.\n  Those who say it doesn't go far enough have a point, but I think they \nlose sight of the core reason the bill is structured, as it is for the \n12 million. It accommodates them in a realistic way and puts them on \nthe path to citizenship. That has led many to cry ``amnesty.'' I don't \nthink it is amnesty for the reasons that have been enumerated many \ntimes. But amnesty, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. These \n12 million are going to be here whether we legislate or not. So if it \nis amnesty, to do nothing is to have silent amnesty. They are going to \nstay here. To do nothing is to perpetuate anarchy.\n  Those who have argued strenuously and cogently to have border \nprotection and employer verification to eliminate the magnet and to \nreimpose the rule of law are right. But they are not going to get the \ncore of what they want if no bill is passed. So we ought to come to \ngrips with the basic reality that the fundamentals on both sides have \nbeen realized, not the periphery and not the fringes, but the \nfundamentals.\n  We have had some votes which really defy the tradition of the Senate. \nWe had the Dorgan amendment early on where many voted against their \npreferences, their policy judgments, to kill the bill. They had a \nposition as to what they thought was right. They had expressed it. We \nknew what their policy position was. They voted the other way to kill \nthe bill.\n  Yesterday, on the Baucus amendment, it was really extraordinary. I \nhave been here a while. Twenty-three Senators changed their votes. You \ncan tell on the cards, there is a check one way and a cross-off and a \ncheck the other way. Twenty-three Senators changed their votes. We talk \nabout profiles in courage, this is a profile in cynicism. Votes were \nchanged in order to defeat the bill, not because they expressed the \npreferences of the Senators. There were colleagues who said how they \nwould vote, and then they didn't vote the way they said they were going \nto. I am not going to call them commitments which were breached, but \nthat term might be used. It is a little strong to say that a Senator \nbroke his word and breached a commitment. Let me simply say that some \nsaid how they would vote and then didn't. That is an unusual occurrence \nin the Senate.\n  It has been a common practice for Senators to vote in favor of \ncloture and then to vote against the bill. That expresses a middle \nground that the Senator doesn't think there ought to have to be a \nsupermajority that is, 60 votes--to carry the bill. But the Senator \ndoesn't want to vote for the bill and so expresses himself or herself \nby voting for cloture so the bill can go forward but then votes against \nthe bill on the merits. Those who vote against cloture will be \nresponsible for killing the bill. They can then vote against the bill \nso that they won't be responsible for passing the bill. Around here, we \nlike to avoid being responsible for one thing or another, but if we do \nnot have cloture on this bill, the bill is dead. If we have cloture, \nthen Senators are not responsible for its passage when they vote \nagainst it.\n  I urge my colleagues to bear that in mind. We pride ourselves in the \nSenate on being courageous. President Kennedy's book as a Senator was \ntitled ``Profiles in Courage.'' We have one illustration of that in the \nsenior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, who is on the front page of \nthe Washington Post today with the reports about his courageous stand \non immigration costing him votes, perhaps costing him the Republican \nnomination. No one knows for sure, but it isn't helping him any.\n  It would be my hope that the Senate would rise to the occasion and \nwould not kill this bill because if it is done, it is finished for the \nyear. Next year is a Presidential/congressional election. We are off to \n2009 and beyond. Then it will only be worse.\n  I leave my colleagues with the essential point that a responsible \nposition would be to let the bill go forward. There is another 60-vote \nmargin coming on the issue of a budget point of order. Don't be \nresponsible for killing the bill by voting against cloture. Then you \ndon't have to be responsible for the bill when voting no, and let the \nmajority rule but not call for a supermajority on this very critical \nissue.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is really a very difficult time \nbecause probably in the 14 years I have been here, there is no more \nimportant bill than this one. There is no more difficult bill. There is \nno bill that calls upon the courage of every single Senator more than \nthis bill. I know what has been happening out there. I know the calls \nthat have been made. I know some of the threats that have been made. \nYet we have a chance in this bill to do the right thing.\n  Many people don't understand the bill. They don't understand the \nlarge amount of the bill that is dedicated to enforcing our borders. \nThey don't understand the money that the fees and fines put into the \nprocess to be able to do what we need to do with respect to \nimmigration. They don't understand the reforms that are made in \nemployment verification. They also don't understand the threat to our \nnational security--that having so many people in this country and not \nknowing who they are, having more people coming into this country every \nday and not knowing who they are--the threat this presents to the \nsecurity of every man, woman, and child.\n  This bill is aimed to fix what is broken in our system. I have had \nindividual Senators say to me: Well, if the bill was just this part, I \nwould vote for it; if the bill was just that part, I would vote for it. \nThe point is, this part or that part won't get 60 votes. Only a \ncombination of parts to accomplish a broad fix of broken borders, \nbroken identification, a totally broken system will get enough votes.\n  We are very close to the votes required. I don't know what to say to \nMembers who are not yet decided to bring them on board. I agree with \nwhat Senator Kennedy and Senator Specter have said: If we miss this \nopportunity, there is not likely to be another one in the next few \nyears to fix the system. What will that mean? That will mean every year \n700,000 to 800,000 more people will come across our borders unobserved, \nunknown. They will disappear into the shadows. If there is period of \n``do nothing'' for the next 10 years, that will be 7 to 8 million more \npeople illegally in the country. If we don't fix our visa overstay \nsystem, which is in this bill--40 percent of the illegal population are \nvisas overstay; many of them don't go home--that will remain unfixed. \nIf we don't come up with fraud-proof identification cards, employers \nwill never really be able to know whom they employ and whether that \nindividual is a legal person. This is an opportunity to fix all of \nthat.\n  The fixes may not be to everyone's liking, but they are positive. It \nis the most positive immigration bill we have considered yet.\n  Additionally, never before in the history of the country is more \nbeing done to fix our broken borders, to fix interior enforcement, to \nfix employer sanctions. One thing is happening that has turned this \nbill by talk show hosts into something it is not, and that is for those \npeople who are opposed, this is an amnesty bill. I don't know how we \ncould say more strongly that it is not. I don't know how we could say \nmore strongly that what is out there now is a silent amnesty. People \nare here 15, 20, 25 years. They are working, owning property. They now \nhave a state of amnesty. This bill reconciles that. This bill changes \nthat. This bill prevents it from happening in the future. It is hard \nfor me to understand why that doesn't measure big-time with many of our \ncolleagues. Apparently, it does not.\n  I can only come to the floor to plead: Let us finish this bill. If \nyou are concerned about enforcement, Senator Graham's amendment coming \ndown the pike next has many very interesting improvements. Give him a \nchance to offer that amendment, then vote no. But I think to cut this \nbill off now is a huge mistake. We are so close. There are still a \nseries of amendments to be passed. Please, give them an opportunity \npostcloture. Please vote for cloture.\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in my last election my constituents sent me a \ncouple of clear messages, one of which was do something about illegal \nimmigration. In my State, we have a majority of people who are entering \nthe country illegally coming across the border from Mexico, creating \nhuge environmental problems, law enforcement problems, people \nvictimized on both sides, costs to the State, lawlessness literally on \nstreet corners. The people of my State are saying: What is happening to \nour country when we can't enforce the laws at the border? Are we not a \nsovereign country? They have a point.\n  We understand politically that in order for us to enforce the law, we \nhave to have an enforceable law. As a result, this bill we have put \ntogether for the first time creates a strong bipartisan consensus for \nall of the things that are needed to control our border. But it does \nmore in two key ways. The reason these other two things are important \nis because a lot of my constituents have said: Why should we believe \nthat a new law is going to be enforced when the existing law isn't \nenforced? That is a very good question. Presidents, both this \nadministration and the previous administration, and Congresses have not \ndone an adequate job of enforcing the law. But it is also true that we \nhave two laws that are not very enforceable. We know that 40 percent of \nthe people who are here illegally have overstayed visas. They didn't \ncross the border illegally. It is very hard to enforce the visa \noverstay laws because they are not adequate. We don't have adequate \nresources, either.\n  Secondly, the employee verification system in place today is a joke. \nEveryone knows that. One can use counterfeit driver's licenses and \nSocial Security cards, and we all know there are millions of people \nworking here illegally though they presented documents to an employer. \nThe 1986 bill wrote a very bad provision for employment verification. \nIt doesn't work.\n  So for those who say, ``Well, let's enforce the law, and then there \nwill be the attrition of illegal immigrants and we will get back to a \ngood situation,'' the answer is, of course, if you do not have a good \nlaw to enforce, you cannot work that strategy. The law has to be \nchanged. It is very clear that in order to change the law so it can be \nenforceable--both with respect to visa overstayers and at places of \nemployment--we are going to have to have a group of people get \ntogether, Democrats and Republicans, willing to support some things \nthat each other wants in order to pass such a law. That is the genesis \nof the bill that is before us.\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize that doing nothing is not \nacceptable. It is pretty clear, when we come down to this cloture vote, \nthat is going to be very close, that 40 Senators might be able to stop \nthe Senate dead in its tracks here, thwarting the will of the majority. \nThose 40 Senators would be people on one side who want it all their way \nand on the other side who want it all their way, thwarting the will of \nthe majority, which recognizes that neither side can have it all their \nway but that doing nothing is not acceptable. That will be the result \nif cloture is not invoked.\n  The final point I would like to make is there are several amendments \nwe should be voting on to improve this legislation. Only by moving \nforward with the cloture vote will we be able to vote on those \namendments. One of those is an important amendment, a very large \namendment, which was put together by Senator Graham and myself and \nSenator Martinez and several others which really tries to fill in all \nof the gaps in enforcement, some of which have been pointed out to us \nby our constituents, by critics of the bill, by folks on the talk \nshows, by people who oppose the bill. We have taken a lot of those \nsuggestions--many of them are great ideas--and put them into this \nenforcement amendment. It will, for example, make it very difficult for \na visa overstayer to be able to be here illegally in the future. We are \ngoing to know when they overstay their visa. We are going to detain \nthem until they can be removed from the country. That is just one \nexample. So in order to be able to vote on those strong and \nstrengthening amendments, we have to invoke cloture, we have to be able \nto proceed.\n  There are still two more opportunities for those who want to express \ntheir opposition to the bill to do so. There will be a budget point of \norder, and there will be the vote on final passage. But surely our \ncolleagues would, I hope, respect the will of the majority, which is to \nkeep moving to make this bill as good as we possibly can, and then \neverybody has the ability to vote however they want to at the end of \nthe day. I hope my colleagues will agree that doing nothing is not an \noption and that we can continue to move the bill forward by supporting \ncloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have 5 allotted minutes for Senator \nSessions, and I see he is on the floor.\n  I ask the Senator, would you like to take that time now, Senator \nSessions?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understood it was 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, you have 5 minutes \nfrom each side. You have 5 from me and 5 from Senator Kennedy.\n  I say to the Senator, I was going to yield you 5 minutes now.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would be pleased to use 5 minutes now. \nI believe some of the other Members I wanted to share time with are \navailable and can speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will be pleased to yield 2 minutes to \nthe Senator from North Carolina, Mrs. Dole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator Sessions, \nSenator DeMint, and Senator Vitter for their hard work on this matter, \nand other Senators as well.\n  Certainly, there is one area in which we have much agreement; that \nis, securing our borders. Clearly, the American people do not have any \nconfidence at all in the promises this will be done when there is track \nrecord of total failure. In 1986, there were 3 million illegal aliens, \nand today, of course, there are 12 million or more. The Government does \nnot seem to know how many.\n  I have an op-ed piece from the Charlotte Observer. Just quoting from \n1986: This bill will help us provide the immediate relief on the border \nthat we need. In my view, it is a good bill. We should all support it, \nbe glad that this long controversy has finally been put to rest.\n  Well, Chuck Grassley made it very clear in strong points that he was \nwrong in the 1986 vote, that this did not provide the security at the \nborder we have been promised again today.\n  In 2006, we had the Secure Fence Act, 700 miles of fencing to be \nbuilt. Only 2 miles have been built.\n  So my view, my strong view, is it is not just promises, it is proof \npeople want. The American people want to see results, control of our \nborders. We need to establish standards or metrics and then show they \nhave been achieved--for example, having a significant decrease in the \nnumber of illegal aliens who cross our border, having a significant \ndecrease in those who overstay their visas, a high rate of deporting \nthose where courts have said a person needs to be removed from this \ncountry and deal with contentious provisions at a later date. But these \nare the key issues people are concerned about.\n  The first order of business must be that we ensure that the mess we \nare faced with now never, ever occurs again. We should be laser-focused \non our resources, our energy, and ensuring our borders are secure.\n  My staff and I have been meeting with sheriffs across our State. \nSection 287(g), which is law now, provides that these local officials \ncan be deputized to enhance the ICE agents. This is very important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dole and yield 2 minutes \nto the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \nyielding me time.\n  I just wish to say I appreciate the efforts of all involved in what \nhas happened over the last month. I really do. I have voted three times \nagainst cloture and will vote for a fourth time today against cloture. \nBut at the same time, I really have tried to play a constructive role \nin voting on each amendment based on the merits of that amendment.\n  This bill is about a lot of things. Certainly, people have put a lot \nof effort into it--based on compassion, based on trying to solve a \nproblem. It also, no doubt, has some more sinister components. I hate \nto say it: cheap labor, party politics, who is going to gain the \nmajority. So there are a lot of different things at play here. I think \nwe all understand that. But I really do appreciate the efforts of all \ninvolved.\n  Today, this is going to get down to four or five Senators. I \nencourage them to vote against cloture, for this reason: I think this \nbill is not good for America because I believe America has lost faith \nin our Government's ability to do the things it says it will do. We \nhave had intelligence gaffs. We have had evolving reasons as to why we \nare involved in military conflicts. We have seen what has happened at \nthe local, State, and Federal level on things such as Katrina. We have \nministers who want to go on mission trips today but who cannot get \npassports renewed. This is about competence. It is about credibility. I \nthink Americans feel they are losing their country. They are not losing \nit to people who speak differently or talk differently or are from \ndifferent backgrounds; they are losing it to a government that has \nseemed to not have the competence or the ability to carry out what it \nsays it will do.\n  I believe this bill is going to fail. What I would urge people to do \nis not what they have said today--and that is, to let it pass--but to \nmove, meaning to pass into another time, but approaching it on a more \nmodest basis, where we do the things we say we will do and build a \nfoundation that will cause the American people to actually have faith \nin this Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee and \nwould recognize the Senator from South Carolina, thanking him for his \nleadership. As the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, said, this \nhas been a tough battle. I thank Senator DeMint for his courage. I \nyield him 1 minute, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  Mr. President, this immigration bill has become a war between the \nAmerican people and their Government. The issue now transcends anything \nrelated to immigration. It is a crisis of confidence between what the \nAmerican people believe our Government is and should be, what it is to \nthem now, and what they perceive it to be.\n  This vote today is really not about immigration. It is about whether \nwe are going to listen to the American people and realize we need to \nproceed more carefully, in a more sensitive manner, and appear to be \nlistening to the concerns of the American people.\n  The allocation of time, as we approach this vote, is very symbolic of \nwhere we stand. The supporters of this bill, out of an hour's time, \nhave allocated 10 minutes to the opinion of the American people. I \nthink we should listen to the American people. I hope all of my \ncolleagues will decide not to move ahead with this bill and vote \nagainst cloture today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I reserve my 5 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask Senator Specter, may I be \nrecognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  To my colleagues who have participated in this debate, I think it has \nbeen a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I hope for all of us, because if \nwe did this every week, the Senate would fall apart because this is \ntough politics, there is no question about it.\n  I do not pretend to know that I am on the wrong side or the right \nside of the American people. I can tell you what polls say--that once \nyou tell people what is in this bill, about border enforcement, \nemployer verification, merit-based immigration, the temporary worker \nprogram, it is 2 to 1 in about every poll I have seen. I guess you can \nget the poll to respond to the way you ask the question.\n  What I am trying to do is provide a solution to a problem that \naffects the American people. Here is the formula for this problem to be \nsolved: bipartisanship.\n  To my friends on this side, if you think you can ignore Democrats, \ngood luck. They exist. There are a bunch of them over there. Yes, raise \nyour hand if you are a Democrat. Why don't you all leave? Well, they \nare not going away. Now, there are a bunch of us over here. Good luck \nignoring us.\n  I would like to secure the border. How many Democrats would? \nEverybody raises their hand, right? Wouldn't you like to have an \nemployer verification system where an employer would know the \ndifference between somebody who is illegal and legal?\n  Enforce the current law. To my friends who call me endlessly and say, \n``Just enforce the current law, Lindsey,'' well, here is Lindsey's \nresponse: I have looked at it. It is unenforceable. You can get a job \nin America based on a driver's license and a Social Security card being \npresented. What did all the hijackers on 9/11 have in common? They all \nhad fake ID cards. They all had fake driver's licenses. I can get you a \nSocial Security card. To my good friend from South Carolina, Jim \nDeMint, we can go to the Jockey Lot in Anderson, and I can get both of \nus a Social Security card by midnight with whatever name you want, \nwhatever number you want.\n  Until we address that problem, we are never going to solve illegal \nimmigration because it is about jobs. Current law is a failure. The \npublic should be cynical. Are we helping them when we fail? We are at \n20 percent approval, and we deserve it. We do not deserve our pay \nraise. But who are the 20 percent? What do you like about this \nCongress? I cannot believe there are 20 percent of the American people \nwho like what we are doing up here because we are doing nothing but \ntalking about what we will not do, and we are playing a game that the \nAmerican people do not understand, like the other side does not exist.\n  You are never going to deal with this issue until you embrace the 12 \nmillion. No Democrat is going to let you build a fence and do all the \nthings we want to do without addressing the 12 million. That is never \ngoing to happen.\n  I want to address the 12 million. The reason I want to address the 12 \nmillion, it bothers me there are 12 million people here that we do not \nknow who they are and what they are up to. I wish they would go away, \nbut they are not. It is a problem America has to deal with, and we want \nsomeone else to do it because we are afraid if we do a plea bargain it \nis amnesty. We are afraid that the people who don't want to deal with \nthe 12 million will come and take our jobs away. This is about our \njobs.\n\n  Well, this is bigger than my job. The 12 million will be dealt with. \nThey are not going to be ignored. They will be dealt with firmly and \nfairly eventually. They are not going to be deported. They are not \ngoing to jail. They can't be wished away. So we need to come together \nin a bipartisan manner and have principled compromise where we deal \nwith the 12 million, we deal with broken borders, we get a temporary \nworker program.\n  To my Republican friends, remember this day if you vote no. You will \nnever, ever have this deal again. There will never be a merit-based \nimmigration system such as we have negotiated because President Bush \nhas helped us. To my friends on this side who say President Bush would \nsign anything, you don't understand what is going on here. President \nBush has given us as Republicans things we will never get without\n\n[[Page S8646]]\n\nhim being President. We have lost the majority, but we have a good deal \nbecause we have hung together. A temporary worker program and a merit-\nbased immigration system is a good deal for this country. If we say no \ntoday, good luck of ever getting it again.\n  The 12 million stay here on our terms. They have to learn English. \nThey have to pay fines. They can't be citizens unless they go back and \nstart over. This is as good as it is going to get.\n  Now, if we lived in a perfect world where the Republicans could write \nthis bill, it would be different, and I can assure you, my Democratic \nfriends would have written a different bill. All I can tell you is, the \nAmerican people have a low opinion of us because we can't seem to do \nthe things we need to do----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Because we are too worried about us and not them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have 11\\1/2\\ minutes; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Colorado and the \nremaining time between the Senator from Illinois and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to urge \nmy colleagues to vote yes on cloture as we bring this debate to a very \npivotal point.\n  As I come to the floor this morning, I am reminded of the millions of \nphone calls and letters that everybody has received in this Chamber. \nMany of those phone calls and those letters, those demonstrations have \nbeen filled with hate and with venom. They have been filled with hate \nand with venom.\n  We are the United States of America because we are able to bring our \nGovernment together to function on behalf of the people of this \ncountry. So for all of those who have sent arrows in the direction of \nthe profiles in courage who have been working on this issue for the \nlast 2 years, I say to them: Remember the prayer of Cesar Chaves of the \nUnited Farm Workers in which he said: Help us love even those who hate \nus. Help us love even those who hate us so that we can change the \nworld--so that we can change the world.\n  Much of the venom we have seen around this issue has to do with the \nfact that people are afraid. People are afraid. I ask my colleagues to \njoin us in looking forward and not being afraid because what makes \npeople afraid today is that we have a system of chaos, a system of \nbroken borders, a system of victimization.\n  So how do we move forward to create a system of law and order of \nwhich we in the United States of America can be proud? How do we do \nthat? Well, we have done our best. We have put forward a proposal that \nsays the porous borders we have in America are not good for America. \nThe national security of the United States of America demands--\ndemands--that we move forward and secure those borders. So we have done \nit in this legislation, and we have included the funding to be able to \nsecure those borders.\n  Second of all, for more than the last 20, 25 years, what has happened \nis that the United States of America has looked the other way as our \nimmigration laws have been broken time after time. So for the first \ntime, what we have done with this legislation is we have said we are \ngoing to enforce the laws. We are going to have tough employer \nsanctions against employers who hire those who are unauthorized to work \nin our country. We are even going to criminalize their conduct. So we \nwill enforce the laws of our Nation.\n  Thirdly, we take the 12 million undocumented workers who are here in \nAmerica, and we say: You are going to pay a fine. You are going to be \npunished. You are going to learn English. You are going to have to go \nto the back of the line, and then after some time on the average of 11, \n12 years, between 8 and 13 years, if you do all the things we require \nof you, including paying these very high fines and paying all of the \nprocessing fees required, then at that point in time, you will have an \nopportunity to become a citizen if you so choose.\n  To me, that is a commonsense solution to the national security issue \nwhich is at stake in this debate. It also is a commonsense solution for \na nation that prides itself in enforcing our laws. We are not like \nother countries around the world that don't enforce our laws, but we \nwill be.\n  So I say this to my colleagues on the other side: I respect you. I \nrespect you for what you do here and for how you bring a civil debate \nto the issues that we deal with every day. But at the end of the day, \nif we don't get this done today with this cloture vote, it is going to \nmean the national security of the United States of America will \ncontinue to be compromised into the future for who knows how long. It \nwill mean we will continue to be a nation that does not enforce our \nlaws on immigration within this country, and it will mean we will have \nfailed to develop a realistic and honest solution to the 12 million \nundocumented workers who labor in America every day.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this cloture motion that \nwe have coming up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe there is 5 minutes on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know good people have worked on this \nbill, and they are promoting it as a good step forward on immigration. \nBut our own Congressional Budget Office has answered that question. \nThey have said if this bill becomes law, we will see only a 13-percent \nreduction in illegal immigration into America, and in the next 20 years \nwe will have another 8.7 million illegals in our country. How can that \nbe reformed? I submit this would be a disaster.\n  The American people, I do not believe, desire to double illegal \nimmigration. That is what this bill--legal immigration. That is what \nthis bill does.\n  Mr. President, I ask that I be notified after I have spoken for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The bill is promoted as providing security, but the \nBorder Patrol Association, the former Border Patrol Officers \nAssociation, two former chairmen, chiefs of Border Patrol of the United \nStates, former Assistant Attorney General in charge of immigration and \nsecurity say it will not work, and they are scathing in their criticism \nand steadfastly reject this bill. I believe it will further diminish, \ntherefore, the rule of law.\n  The procedure used to get us to this point is unprecedented in the \nhistory of the Senate. It allows the leadership to approve every single \namendment that gets voted on and gives us only 10 minutes in opposition \nthis morning, while the masters of the universe get over 40 minutes, 50 \nminutes to promote their side. It is typical of the way this debate has \ngone, and it will breed more cynicism by the public.\n  I have just seen a notice this morning from the Sergeant at Arms to \ntell us that the telephone systems here have shut down because of the \nmass phone calls Congress is receiving. A decent respect for the views \nof the American people says let's stop here now. Let's go back to the \ndrawing board and come up with a bill that will work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2 minutes. He has 3 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Louisiana who has been effective and courageous in his advocacy on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if the Chair could inform me when I have \nused 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, we all stand here on the floor of the Senate and \nregularly acknowledge and even praise the common sense and the wisdom \nof the American people. Well, this vote this morning for each of us is \nabout whether you really believe that or whether it is just a cheap \npolitical line to use.\n  The American people get it, and they do have common sense and wisdom \non this issue. They know repeating the fundamental mistakes of the 1986 \nbill, joining a big amnesty with inadequate enforcement, will cause the \nproblem to grow and not diminish. They know promising enforcement after \n30 years of broken promises isn't good enough. They know the so-called \ntrigger is a\n\n[[Page S8647]]\n\njoke because if the trigger is never pulled, the Z visas, the amnesty \nhappens forever. They know groups like the Congressional Budget Office \nhave estimated that this bill, so big on enforcement, will only \ndecrease illegal immigration 13 percent and will have another 8.7 \nmillion illegal aliens coming into the country. They know that. They do \nhave wisdom and common sense.\n  The question is: Do we or do we decide that Washington knows best? \nThis isn't just a vote about immigration. This is a vote about whether \nthis body is out of touch, whether this body is arrogant, or whether it \nwill respect the true wisdom and common sense of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, one of the most encouraging parts about \nthis debate--there is a silver lining--is it has reengaged the American \npeople and shown us that we are truly a government of the people. They \nhave spoken and they have spoken loudly. Our phones have been ringing \noff the hooks. We have received e-mails and letters. People are trying \nto get in touch with us. Even now, they are calling in such numbers \nthat it has crashed the telephone system in the Senate.\n  My question to the Senate today is: What part of ``no'' don't we \nunderstand? We need to vote no against cloture and stop this process \nthat is alienating the American people from what we do, and then \nenforce the laws that are on the books and prove we are a nation of \nlaws and that we will enforce the laws that have been passed by this \nCongress.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish we had been given more than 10 \nminutes, while the other side has been given 40 or 50. I thank the \nChair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand we have 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in our Nation's history, this Nation of \nimmigrants, we have always struggled with this issue. As soon as people \narrive on this shore, there is a question about how many more can we \ntake? What does it mean for our Nation if more people come from strange \nlands who don't speak our language? Yet this diversity has made America \nwhat it is today. We have sustained this great Nation because we are \ndifferent and because we are accepting and because the people who \nstruggle to come to these shores--my mother and her family, the \nfamilies of all of us--brought with them a special quality: a \ndetermination for a better life and a willingness to take a risk to \ncome to America. They brought a willingness to take the hardest, \ntoughest jobs to prove the American dream and hope that their children \nwill have better. Multiply that by millions and you have the story of \nthis great Nation.\n  Throughout our history, we have always debated how many more we can \ntake. That debate comes to a head this morning in just a few minutes. \nWe will have a chance on the Senate floor to decide whether we step \nforward.\n  I have heard the voices against this saying: Not this bill. We can \nsurely do better. We have worked hard on this bill. We have made \ncompromises. There are parts of it which I detest and parts which I \nembrace, and that is the nature of compromise and cooperation. I thank \nall of those who have crafted it and put it together.\n  But I want to tell my colleagues what is at stake is very basic and \nfundamental as to who we are as a nation. Outside this Chamber, outside \nthis congressional debate, you have heard the voices. Some of them are \ndark and ugly. They are not the voices of America, a hopeful nation \nthat understands we can be a nation of laws, and with diversity we can \ngrow in this world in the 21st century. No, these are voices of \nexclusion, people who want to keep those people out, people who want \nthose people to go away. That is not America. That isn't what we are \nabout as a nation. That isn't what distinguished us in the world. What \ndistinguished us is we can stand up--Black, White, and brown, from all \nacross this world--and make a nation. We have done it for over 200 \nyears. We can do it again. Those who argue this diversity will destroy \nus don't understand the core values of this country.\n  I beg my colleagues this morning, even if you disagree with this \nbill, don't end this debate. Give us a chance to continue this debate \nand bring this to a conclusion and a vote. Give us this procedural vote \nthat is coming up so we can continue this debate. If at the end of the \nday we step back and say we are surrendering to these negative voices \nacross America, the Senate can't rise to the occasion with an important \nbill, it won't speak well of the Senate. There are those of us \nentrusted with the responsibility to serve in this place.\n  Let us say to people across America that we are going to have strong \nborders, we are going to enforce the law in the workplace, we are going \nto have rules that say to those who are here illegally you can only \nstay if you meet the strictest requirements. I think that is a \nreasonable standard, a reasonable compromise in the greatest tradition \nof America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask to be notified when I have 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  We are called today by the ancients, the Founders of this Republic. \nAre we going to form a more perfect union? It was in this Chamber a \nnumber of years ago that we knocked down the great walls of \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, that we knocked down the walls of \ndiscrimination on the basis of religion. We knocked them down regarding \nnational origin, we knocked them down with regard to gender, we knocked \nthem down with regard to disability. Here in this Senate we were part \nof the march for progress.\n  Today, we are called on again in that exact same way. This issue is \nof the historical and momentous importance that those judgments and \nthose decisions were. When the Senate was called upon, it brought out \nits best instincts, values, and its best traditions. We saw this Nation \nmove forward. Who among us would retreat on any of those commitments? \nWho among us would say no to that great march for progress that we had \nin this Nation?\n  The question is: Is it alive? Is it continuing? Is it ongoing? Those \nwho vote ``aye'' say it is ongoing, that we are continuing that march \ntoward progress.\n  Year after year, we have had broken borders. Year after year, we have \nthe exploitation of workers. Year after year, we see people who live in \nfear within our own borders of the United States of America. This is \nthe opportunity to change it. Now is the time. Now is the time to \nsecure our borders. Now is the time to deal with the national security \nissue. Now is the time to resume our commitment to family values, to \npeople who want to work hard, men and women of faith, people who care \nabout this country and want to be part of the American dream, who have \nseen their sons and daughters, in many instances, fight and lose their \nlives in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is the challenge.\n  Now is the time. This is the place. This bill is strong. It is fair \nand practical. Today, my friends, we have the choice: Are we going to \nvote for our hopes, or are we going to vote for our fears? Are we going \nto vote for our future, or are we going to vote for our past?\n  This is the place. Now is the time. This is the vote. Vote ``aye'' \nfor America's future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, let me first compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I have been involved deeply in this \ndebate that we have had over a couple of\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\nyears. It comes to a close in the next day or so in the Senate. We have \nan opportunity to move forward, to move the debate on, and to have an \nopportunity for the House of Representatives to then add their measure \nof influence upon what this bill should be about. We should not simply \nsay the bill isn't good enough so we are going to do nothing.\n  For those who find criticism with the bill, it is much easier to tear \ndown than it is to build. We have crafted a bill over months of \ndiscussions and negotiations, which does a tremendous amount to end the \nillegality, secure the border, to ensure that we have the mechanisms to \nenforce an employment verification system so we don't have any more \nillegal workers. We do a measure of justice to those who have been here \nand worked and made this country their home for, in many instances, two \ndecades.\n  The fact is, for those who simply say do nothing, they have a measure \nof responsibility to what comes next. What comes next is a continuation \nof the illegal system. To say simply ``enforce the law,'' well, the \ncurrent laws aren't good enough to be enforced. They do not have the \nenforcement mechanisms necessary to ensure that we do have workplace \nenforcement, which at the end of the day is the most important measure \nwe can have.\n  A lot has been said about the cost to our society of illegal \nimmigrants being legalized. The CBO, which we trust on these issues, \nhas said--this is the nonpartisan congressional budget office--they \nfind that the new Federal revenue from taxes, penalties, and fees under \nthis bipartisan immigration bill will more than offset the cost of \nsetting up the new immigration system and the cost of any Federal \nbenefit temporary workers, Z visa holders, and future legal immigrants \nunder the bill would receive.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me some time. I simply say that it \nhas been a pleasure to work with those who have committed themselves to \ndo something about the problem, and not simply say what is imperfect \nabout the solution but to find a solution to this difficult problem.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida has such a \nbackground, being an immigrant himself, and I think our cause would be \nwell served if he took another 3 minutes.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I thank the Senator.\n  Let me touch on that issue. As an immigrant to America, I understand \nwhat it means to live the American dream. I had the opportunity to come \nto this country as a 15-year-old child, not speaking the language or \nunderstanding this culture; yet the embrace that America gives those of \nus who are fortunate enough to come to these shores and make America \nour home made me an American.\n  Many out there today fear that immigrants don't want to assimilate. \nThe fact is--and I have said this before--immigrants come to America \nnot to change this country but to be changed by this country. That was \nmy experience. I think it is the experience that has been repeated to \nthe over 200-year history of this Nation as immigrants have come to \nthese shores, and America has had the magic that it performs on those \nof us who come here to become Americans to then make a contribution, as \nI hope I am making today by serving in the Senate.\n\n  The fact is, this is a divisive issue, but I believe it will bind and \nheal our country if we deal with it. Unfortunately, to do nothing will \ncontinue this festering debate in our country that is so divisive and, \nat times, so ugly. Our country is better than that. I think our country \nhas the resourcefulness and the strength of culture to ensure that we \nnot fear they want to change America, but that we change them to be the \nAmericans that we hope all of us are and can be.\n  I thank the Senator for the additional time. This is something in \nwhich I have invested my heart and soul because I believe it to be so \nright for our country. This isn't about the 12 million immigrants. This \nis about what that will do to ensure that America continues to be the \nplace it has been for more than 200 years, as a beacon of liberty, the \n``shining city on a hill'' that President Ronald Reagan spoke of. We \nhave to continue that tradition and welcome more people into that \ntradition by allowing them to be legal citizens, legalize their status, \nwhile we make it clear that the game is up, and from now on immigration \ninto America will only be legal and not illegal, as it has been for \nmore than two decades.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Florida for \nhis statements. Had we more time, all of us could tell our own stories. \nMine involves two immigrant parents. My father came here at 18, in \n1911, and contributed to this country. My mother came with her family \nat the age of 6, in 1906, and contributed to this country. I thank the \nSenator from Florida, Senator Martinez, who has a special story to tell \nbecause he himself is an immigrant and is a great testament to what we \nare trying to accomplish with this bill.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Arizona, who has made such a \nunique contribution to this bill, coming from a border State and facing \nirate calls, not that they are necessarily representative of all of \nArizona. He said he learned some new words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania doesn't have 3 \nminutes. He has 30 seconds. The Senator from Massachusetts has 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield that time to the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have 10 minutes 30 seconds because I have been \nallotted the leader time. I yield him 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I can say this in about 90 seconds. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania made the point. It is a sad commentary in \nAmerica today that many Americans have lost faith in their Government. \nThe only group that has poll numbers less than the President these days \nis the Congress. Americans don't believe their Government is \nrepresenting them and acting on their behalf. The polls show it.\n  On one of the most critical issues of our day, we will not restore \nthat confidence if we fail to act again. The only way we can restore \nthat confidence is by acting. Skepticism is not a reason for inaction. \nFor those who say, well, let's enforce our laws, I remind them that \nsome of our laws are unenforceable. My conservative friends are the \nfirst to point out that the 1986 law is not an effective law. It is \nunenforceable. Until we change it, we are not going to be able to \nenforce the law. That is why it is time for us to return to the rule of \nlaw in America. By returning to the rule of law, we can restore that \nconfidence that is so critical for the American people to have in their \nGovernment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have heard from the objectors what the \nAmerican people think. I am not sure they have standing to represent \nthe American people. We heard the junior Senator from South Carolina \nspeak as to his interpretation of what the American people think. But \nwe heard the senior Senator from South Carolina stand in firm support \nof this legislation--the Senator representing South Carolina, as well \nas the other Senator from South Carolina.\n  We know as a matter of practice that the callers and the e-mailers \nare characteristically naysayers. You hear a lot more from people who \nobject than you do from people who are in favor. We know that the \nmajority of America is the silent majority. From my own soundings, what \nI hear on the train when I come back and forth from Pennsylvania, what \nI hear in the restaurants, on the streets, and in the fitness club is \nto proceed, try to find a way to improve a very serious situation in \nimmigration.\n  No one of us is able to speak for the American people. We hear \ndifferent voices at different times. I know one thing with relative \ncertainty, and that is you cannot tell what the American people think \nsimply by those who object and those who call. We do not run America in \na representative democracy, in a republic, by public opinion polls. If \nwe did, we would take the public opinion poll and we could dispense \nwith all of the fat salaries that Members of Congress get. We could \ndispense with paying 535 people and take a public opinion poll and sign \nit into law.\n  I think the most erudite statement on this particular issue was \nuttered by\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\na distinguished British philosopher politician, named Edmund Burke, in \na speech to the electorate of Bristol on November 3, 1774, when he made \nthis famous statement:\n\n       Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but \n     his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he \n     sacrifices it to your opinion.\n\n  Now, that is not to say in a representative democracy we ought to not \nconsider the opinions of our constituents, but I think Edmund Burke was \nright more than 200 years ago when he talked about our duty in owing \nour constituents our best judgment.\n  What is our best judgment and how have we come to it? We have been \nworking on immigration a long time, and we saw the failures of the 1986 \nlegislation. Because the 1986 legislation failed doesn't mean we cannot \ncorrect the problem. Things are very different today than they were in \n1986. For one thing, we now have a foolproof method of determining \nwhether an individual is legal or illegal. So now we can hold employers \nresponsible not to hire illegal immigrants. We can take away the magnet \nof work in this country for those who are not here legally.\n  We have lost sight I think, of the very fundamental purpose as to \nwhat we are trying to accomplish through legislation to reform \nimmigration.\n  We are trying to secure our borders. This bill goes a long way to \nsecuring the borders with fencing, with automobile blocks, with more \nBorder Patrol. The entire 2,000-mile plus of the border will be more \nsecure. It can't be perfectly secured, and that is why we have employer \nverification which, as I say, is now foolproof. Then when we deal with \nthe immigrants, we are trying to deal with the 12 million undocumented \nimmigrants. Those who would like more--I said earlier that if I had my \nchoice, I would agree with Senator Menendez, that I would have more \nfamily unification. I would agree with Senator Dodd that I would have \nmore visas for parents. But this legislation is crafted by compromise, \nand that is the art of politics--the compromise. So it is the best bill \nthat we can structure and come forward with.\n  If we do not legislate now, we will not legislate later this year \nwhen our calendar is crowded with Iraq and appropriations bills and \npatent reform, et cetera. We are then into 2008 and an election year \nfor President and Congress, and it will be pushed over to 2009. \nCircumstances will not be better then, they will be worse.\n  We have a very frequent practice, as we all know, for Senators to \nvote in favor of cloture, and then to vote against the bill. That is an \nexpression of policy judgment not to hold a piece of legislation to a \n60-vote supermajority level. We do not have an issue of freedom of \nreligion. We do not have an issue of freedom of speech. We have a \npublic policy question where in good conscience Senators can say: I am \nopposed to the legislation, but I do not think it ought to be held to a \n60-vote supermajority.\n  If we do not invoke cloture, this bill is dead. A vote against \ncloture is a vote to kill the bill. A Senator may vote for cloture and \nthen express himself in opposition to the bill by voting against the \nbill.\n  For those who did not hear an earlier statement I made, I repeat, we \nhad the unusual situation on the Dorgan amendment where Senators did \nnot vote their judgment on public policy but voted against their own \njudgment to kill the legislation.\n  We have a tally sheet, those of us who work in the Senate, showing \nhow Senators voted. And on the Baucus amendment yesterday, we had the \nextraordinary situation of 23 vote changes. You can tell the vote \nchange because there is a mark on one side, it is crossed off, and the \nmark then appears on the other side.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that we had more cynical maneuvering on \nthe Baucus vote, which is characteristic of the maneuvering throughout \nthe text of this legislation, and that what this body ought to do is \ntake the famous words of President John F. Kennedy when he served in \nthis body, to exercise a little courage, a profile in courage as \nopposed to what appears to be a profile in cynicism.\n  The essence of it is, Senators can vote for cloture not to kill the \nbill, and then vote against the bill and exercise their right to do \nthat and still allow this bill to go forward where it may yet be \nimproved.\n  Mr. President, I see my time is just about to expire. How much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is immigration a problem? Of course, it is. \nBut is immigration a problem that is limited to Texas, Arizona, \nCalifornia, the border States? No. Is immigration a problem only for \nbig cities, such as San Antonio, New York, Chicago, L.A.? No. \nImmigration is a problem all over America.\n  As people know, I am from Searchlight, NV, a little town I was born \nin and the town where I lived. It is 60 miles southeast of Las Vegas in \nthe southern tip of the State. Is immigration something people talk \nabout in Searchlight? Of course, it is.\n  Take yesterday. I got back to my office, and there was a call from \nTommy. I am not going to give his last name for fear somebody will look \nhim up. Tommy called me--and I do have his last name--and he said: I \nhave a friend here who is from Mexico, has been here quite a long time. \nWhat is this immigration bill you are working on going to do for him? \nShould I be in favor of it?\n  Yes, Tommy, you should be because your friend will no longer have to \nbe afraid of being arrested and deported. This bill will allow him to \ncome out of the shadows.\n  The same day, yesterday, I received my mail from Searchlight. \nSomebody sends me my mail that comes addressed to me in Searchlight. A \nletter was addressed to me and said, among other things: You probably \nshould go under the witness protection program because of your work on \nthis immigration issue.\n\n  That is from Searchlight, NV. This doesn't take into consideration \nthe letters and the calls my offices in Reno, Las Vegas, and here in \nWashington get filled with hate. I have, of course, turned the letter \nthat I got from Searchlight over to the Capitol Police.\n  This situation is a problem not just in the border States and big \ncities, it is a problem all over America.\n  We are said to be the greatest deliberative body in the world. \nShouldn't we do something positive regarding an issue that affects \neverybody in America, immigration? Some say it is the country's biggest \nproblem. While that may be debatable, it is a significant problem, one \nof the top two or three problems facing us, and the problem is not \ngoing to go away. Is it right to wait until there is a new President? \nShould we wait until we get a new Congress? Of course not. Talk radio \nhas had a field day, these generators of simplicity.\n  I want everyone to know, and I want the record spread, I do not \nbelieve anyone who is a Senator who votes against this motion to \nproceed is filled with prejudice, with hatred, with venom, as we get in \nour phone calls and our mail. I don't believe that. But I do believe we \nhave an issue before us that we must resolve.\n  My family has been enriched by immigration. My father-in-law, Earl \nGould, came to America from Russia when he was a little boy. When he \ncame here his name was Israel Goldfarb. He assumed the name Earl Gould. \nWhen I met my wife, her name was Landra Gould.\n  I had the opportunity to talk with my father-in-law many times. Every \none of his siblings who came to America had a different name. They all \nchanged their name in this great melting pot.\n  My father-in-law died as a young man--he was 52 years old--from \nleukemia. I think of him often. My wife is an only child. I think of \nhim often for the kindness that he showed me. This ring I wear he gave \nto me on his death bed. This watch that I wear he gave to me. When he \nwas sick and knew he was going to die, he and my mother-in-law took a \ntrip to the Middle East and brought me back this watch. They didn't \nhave money to buy watches for me, but they bought a watch for me. I \nstill wear the watch.\n  In this great melting pot we have called America, of which I am a \npart, my five children are eligible for Israeli citizenship because, \nwith the Jewish\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\ntradition, lineage is with the mother, not the father. My children \nproudly know this.\n  My family has been enriched as a result of immigration. I knew my \ngrandmother. I talked with her lots of times. As a boy, I listened to \nher stories. I talked with her. I can still hear her voice--oh, we had \na grand time. That is how she talked. She was born in Katherine's \nCross, England, and came over here as a girl, married my grandfather, \nhad eight children, all of them raised in Searchlight, NV.\n  Those are two examples of what immigration is all about, two examples \nof what it has done to Harry Reid.\n  My skin is real white. We have African Americans. The Presiding \nOfficer is of African-American ancestry. In the back of the room--we \ndon't even have to look at the back of the room--we have Hispanics. But \nmy skin is American skin, just as the Presiding Officer, just as \nSenator Salazar.\n  What is immigration all about? A number of years ago, one of \nAmerica's great journalists, James Fallows, wrote a book called ``More \nLike Us.'' The thesis in this book was that everyone was saying we \nshould be more like Japan.\n  Japan was at the zenith of its height and power, and we were in the \ndoldrums economically. Everyone said we should be more like Japan.\n  James Fallows wrote this book, ``More Like Us,'' and he said: No, we \nshould be more like us, like America, and the No. 1 issue he talked \nabout being different from Japan, our strength, is immigration. I \ntestify that is true; that is the strength of this great country.\n  Today in America we have a problem with immigration. We have porous \nborders that need to be fixed. We are Senators, I repeat, Members of \nthe greatest deliberative body in the history of the world. With the \nhonor of our office comes enormous responsibility. We must resist the \never-present temptation to do what is expedient at the expense of what \nis right. When short-term gain diverges from long-term good, we must \nchoose the good. This is our challenge today.\n  I ask every one of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, not to \nshrink from this issue, to support us moving forward on this \nlegislation for the good of our country, the greatness of our country.\n  There are 100 of us. If each one of us were given a few days to draft \nan immigration bill. We probably could do a better job than what has \nbeen done with this bill, in our own minds. But some of the greatest \nlegislative minds in this body have worked long and hard to come up \nwith this bill. Perfect? No. Good? Yes.\n  I hope we can do the right thing and move this legislation forward. I \nam not here to tell my colleagues this legislation is the greatest \nthing that ever came along, but it is something that is badly needed, \nand we need to continue this process.\n  Mr. President, there is $4.4 billion for border security. Is it going \nto help? Oh, it will help a lot. There are 370 miles of fencing, which \nwe authorized and, of course, have done nothing about; 300 miles of \nvehicle barriers; 20,000 new Border Patrol agents; more than 100 \nground-based radar and camera towers; and 31,500 detention beds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, under the UC, I think we are well passed \nthe time the leader had, and this side only received 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has the floor. The majority leader \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say this, 31,500 detention beds. One \nof the problems we have----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, point of order. The unanimous consent \ngave the leader 12 minutes. It is now about 12 or 15. Does that \noverride the leader's time?\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding in the order----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair always allows some latitude to the \ntwo leaders. He is currently 1 minute over time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding of the order of the \npresenters that Senator McConnell and I had 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. Ten minutes was given to the distinguished Republican \nmanager of the bill, and I now am using my leader's time that was not \nin the order.\n  I would also say to my friend from Alabama that I would never rudely \ninterrupt him whenever he is giving a speech. I would never do that, \nand I wish he hadn't done that, but I will continue.\n  Mr. President, 31,500 new detention beds. In Las Vegas, when someone \nis picked up on an immigration violation, there is no place to put \nthem. That is what this legislation does, actual money--not authorizing \nmoney but actual money. That is important.\n  It creates a mandatory employer verification system, which is so \nimportant, and a pathway to legalization for 12 million people, like my \nfriend Tommy from Searchlight, NV. What do they do? They work, they pay \ntaxes, they learn English, they stay out of trouble, and they pay fines \nand penalties. That is important.\n  AgJOBS. The DREAM Act. This legislation is important. It has come \nabout as a result of a lot of hard work. For example, we have had 36 \nhearings, 6 days of committee action, 59 committee amendments, 21 days \nof Senate debate, and 92 Senate floor amendments.\n  I know the vote for everyone here today is a difficult vote. For some \nof us, it may be the most difficult of our careers. There is no perfect \nanswer to this problem of immigration, but there are two paths. One \npath is diversion and negativity, while the other embraces hope. One \npath embraces exclusion, the other embraces the American dream. One \npath embraces the status quo, the other pragmatism. Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, let us keep hope alive, let us keep the American \ndream alive, let us keep pragmatism alive and well here in the Senate.\n  I ask you to join on the path of hope, a courageous path, a path that \nPresident Bush, Leader McConnell, and I have chosen, a bipartisan path \nto legislative hope. That is what this vote of cloture is all about. \nVoting for cloture on this imperfect bill will make our union a little \nmore perfect.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. \n     208, S. 1639, Immigration.\n\n         Ted Kennedy, Russell D.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on S. \n1639, the bill to provide for comprehensive immigration reform, and for \nother purposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote the yeas are 46, the nays are 53. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the vote has been cast. As I told a number \nof my Republican friends, even though the vote is disheartening to me \nin many ways, I think as a result of this legislative work we have done \nin the last several months on this legislation, there have been \nfriendships developed that were not there before, trust initiated that \ndid not exist before. I say to my friends, Democrats and Republicans, \nthis is a legislative issue. It will come back; it is only a question \nof when. We are only 6 months into this Congress. We have so much to \ndo.\n  Hopefully, this lesson we have all learned will be one where we \nrecognize we have to work more closely together. I hope we can do that. \nI say to all of you, thank you very much for your patience--the phone \ncalls I have made; if I twisted arms, it was not very often. I so \nappreciate--I think I speak for all of us--being able to be part of \nthis great Senate where we are able to participate in decisions such as \nthis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8651-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I feel compelled to address head on, I mean \nhead on, the news stories in recent weeks that have pointed out the \nshocking discovery, yes, shocking discovery, that I am growing older. \nDid you get that? Shocking discovery that I am growing older.\n  I find it no surprise, but then I have had some time to become \naccustomed to the increasing distance between the year of my birth and \nthe current date. I may not like it, but as Maurice Chevalier put it:\n\n       Old age is not so bad when you consider the alternative.\n\n  A recent Associated Press story ran in West Virginia's Charleston \nDaily Mail. The headline read: Dramatic change in signatures shows that \nage is catching up with Senator Byrd. The newspaper offered as proof \nthe signatures on my Senate financial disclosure forms from last year \nand this year. It is true that this year's signature looks like I \nsigned it in a moving car. Some days, the benign essential tremor that \nI have had for years now is worse than on other days, just as it is for \nthe approximately 5 million other people in the United States who \nsuffer from similar tremors. It is annoying, but it is hardly evidence \nthat I am at death's door.\n  Nor should it come as a surprise that I use canes to help me get \naround or that I am not always as fast as I once was. I am not aware of \nany requirement for physical dexterity in order to hold the office of \nU.S. Senator. The often grueling hours working in the Senate requires \nare tough on far junior Senators, and I am no longer one of the younger \nSenators.\n  But to worry in print that I have missed one vote this year? Really. \nOut of more than 18,000 votes in my career, to miss one vote or two \nvotes every now and then is surely excusable. Even old people can be \nallowed a sick day or two now and then, can't they?\n  That is really the crux of the matter. In this Internet-savvy, media-\ninfused culture, we have forgotten that people do get older, even, dare \nI say it, old, old. Television is full of pretty young people. The few \nwhite-haired heads that one sees on television are made up and \nglamorous. Off camera, though, most bear little resemblance to their TV \npersona.\n  In a culture of Botox, wrinkle cream, and hair dye, we cannot imagine \nthat becoming older is a good thing, an experience to look forward to, \na state worthy of respect. If I were 50 years old and used canes due to \nsome injury or had a disease-related tremor, the newsletter stories \nwould be about my carrying on despite my adversities. But my only \nadversity is age. Age.\n  In real life, the lucky ones among us do get old. We move down the \nsteep slope, to the far right of the bell curve of age. The really \nlucky ones, and I almost count myself among them, get to be aged, into \ntheir nineties or even older, a distinction that I think is naturally \npaired with the wisdom borne of experience. We do get white hair, yes. \nAnd we do get wrinkles. And we move more slowly. We worry about falling \ndown because we do not bounce up the way we used to.\n  Our brains are still sharp, but our tongues are slower. We have \nlearned, sometimes the hard way, to think before we speak. I hope, \nhowever, that what we have to say is worth the wait.\n  Many good things are worth the wait. Grandma Moses did not take up \npainting until the age of 75. She painted some 1,600 paintings, 250 of \nwhich she painted after her 100th birthday. Michelangelo was still \nworking on frescos and sculptures when he died at the age of 89.\n  Age is no barrier to accomplishment. When the spirit and the mind are \nwilling, the creative juices continue to flow. I like to think that I \nstill have a few things left on my to-do list. I also like to think \nthat someday our rapidly aging society will get over its fear and its \ndenial of aging. We had better get over it quickly because the \ndemographics tell us our senior population is rapidly growing.\n  If my colleagues still show deference to me, as the news article \nreported, I hope it is due to my experience, my position as chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, and my ability as a Senator. If they are \npatient with me as I turn the page, I hope that is an example of the \nGolden Rule; that they show patience with my minor adversities of age \nas they hope that someday others will show to them.\n  After all, the Senate is not exactly full of spring chickens. You \nbetter believe it. It is not supposed to be. The Senate was designed to \ngive age and experience a chance to flourish, and the rules give slower \nspeakers--the rules give slower speakers a chance to be heard.\n  Five percent of Senators date from the roaring 1920s. All of them \nserved in World War II. The Senate will truly lose a great generation \nwhen they decide, if ever, if ever, to retire.\n  Almost a quarter of Senators date from the 1930s, including many \nseasoned committee chairmen and ranking members. I am sure my younger \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee appreciate the opportunity \nto play a larger role as appropriations bills move through the Senate, \nas the recent articles reported.\n  As I have gotten older, I have learned to have great trust and great \nrespect for my colleagues, many of whom I have worked with for many \nyears. Why is that decried as a bad thing? Why should not these fine \nSenators, now in their fifties through their eighties, get to spread \ntheir wings while the old wise Byrd watches?\n  Abraham Lincoln once rightly observed:\n\n       In the end, it's not the years of your life that count. \n     It's the life in your years.\n\n  My only adversity--my only adversity is age. It is not a bar to my \nusefulness as a Senator. I still look out for West Virginia. I still \nzealously guard the welfare of this Nation and its Constitution. I \nstill work every day to move the business of this Nation forward, to \nend this reckless adventure in Iraq, and to protect, to preserve, and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States against all those who \nwould reshape it to suit partisan agenda. I will continue to do this \nwork until this old\n\n[[Page S8652]]\n\nbody just gives out and drops. Do not expect that to be anytime soon.\n  I believe all ages and all occupations should be part of a truly \nrepresentative body. I also believe society works best when the energy \nand idealism of youth, youth, youth, pairs with the experience and \nwisdom of age.\n  America is the land of opportunities. I don't think our some 36 \nmillion citizens over the age of 65 are disqualified from participating \nin the life of the country that we--we--helped to build. Our country \nrejected those kinds of arbitrary barriers long ago, and this Senator \nloudly and proudly rejects them now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8652-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BRIGADIER GENERAL KEN TAYLOR\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to BG Ken Taylor, who \nwill be buried at Arlington National Cemetery later this afternoon.\n  From his service as a pilot during World War II to his tenure as \nCommander of the Alaska Air National Guard, General Taylor was always a \nhero--in every sense of the word, and to all who knew and loved him.\n  As a young boy in Oklahoma, Ken set his sights on becoming a pilot. \nAfter completing high school and 2 years of college, Ken fulfilled his \ndream by joining the Army Air Corps.\n  In April 1941, newly commissioned as a second lieutenant, Ken \nreceived his first assignment. He was stationed at Wheeler Field, on \nthe Hawaiian island of Oahu, as a member of the 47th Pursuit Squadron. \nAnd it was there, during one of the darkest days in our Nation's \nhistory, that Ken's bravery shined brightest.\n  Early in the morning on December 7, 1941, after a long night of \npoker, dancing, and a little drinking at the officer's club, Ken awoke \nto the sound of low flying Japanese aircraft fighters and bombers on \ncourse to attack the Navy's Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor.\n  Ken and fellow pilot George Welch, who was staying in a neighboring \napartment, took immediate action. They called ahead to their air crew \nwith instructions to load their P-40s with fuel and ammunition.\n  Both pilots hurriedly pulled their evening wear back on, and sped off \nin Ken's new Buick toward Haleiwa Field. Dodging Japanese strafing runs \nand driving at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour, they soon \narrived at the airfield. The pair quickly strapped into their P-40 \nTomahawks, which were fully fueled but only partially armed.\n  Outnumbered, outgunned, and without orders, the two pilots taxied to \nthe runway intent on engaging the over 300 unchallenged Japanese \naircraft.\n  Once airborne, Ken and George immediately came under fire. Ken later \ndescribed the ensuing combat as ``shooting fish in a barrel''--a \ndefinite understatement, as the Japanese shot back at their pursuers. \nAt least one round hit Ken's cockpit, embedding shrapnel in his arm and \nleg.\n  Determined to stay in the air as long as possible, Ken and George \nattacked a group of bombers until they ran out of ammunition. The pair \nthen landed at Wheeler Field to resupply and refuel.\n  While an air crew rearmed their planes, the duo received a dressing \ndown from a superior officer for taking off without orders. The officer \nalso insisted they stay on the ground, but when another attack forced \nairfield personnel to scatter, Ken and George took the chance to get \nback into the fight.\n  With a fresh supply of .50 caliber ammunition, Ken positioned himself \non the runway to take off just as a group of dive bombers flew \noverhead. He described his second takeoff to Army Times as follows:\n\n       I took off right toward them, which gave me the ability to \n     shoot at them before I even left the ground. I got behind one \n     of them and started shooting again. The only thing I didn't \n     know at that time was that I got in the middle of the line \n     rather than the end. There was somebody on my tail. They put \n     a bullet right behind my head through the canopy and into the \n     trim tab inside. So I got a little bit of shrapnel in my leg \n     and through the arm. It was of no consequence; it just scared \n     the hell out of me for a minute.\n\n  Before the last fires were extinguished from the remains of the \nPacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Ken Taylor and George Welch had shot \ndown at least eight Japanese fighters. Many believe their decision to \ntake to the air prevented a full assault on Haleiwa, saving the field \nfrom sure destruction. By the end of the day, the two lieutenants had \nbecome America's first heroes of World War II--all while wearing tuxedo \npants and a Hawaiian flower-print shirt.\n  For his tremendous courage under fire, Ken received the Distinguished \nService Cross and a Purple Heart. But his service to this Nation was \nfar from finished. Ken went on to fight at Guadalcanal, where he was \ncredited with destroying another Japanese plane. After a broken leg \nended his combat career, Ken returned stateside and served for 27 more \nyears. He served in the Alaska Air National Guard.\n  In 1967, Ken became the Assistant Adjutant General for the Alaska Air \nNational Guard. Before retiring in 1971, he was promoted to Brigadier \nGeneral and served as the full Commander of the Air Guard.\n  In this capacity, Ken quickly distinguished himself as an able and \nrespected leader. He worked closely with MG C. F. Necrason, then the \nAdjutant General of the Alaska National Guard, to save the Air Guard \ncomponent in our State. Under Ken's direction, the reinvigorated Air \nGuard units provided rural Alaskans with access to health care, \nmedivacs, and disaster relief services.\n  As a Senator for Alaska, it was my privilege to work with Ken on many \noccasions during this period. My wife Catherine's father, Bill Bittner, \nSr., was a close friend of Ken's and his fishing partner. Bill and I \noften spent long summer days fishing with Ken and talking about World \nWar II.\n  To this day, Ken's family has strong ties to Alaska. Ken's son, Ken \nJr., followed in his father's footsteps and also became commander of \nthe Alaska Air National Guard. They remain the only father and son in \nour Nation's history to have achieved such an honor. Also, Ken Sr.'s \ngrandson, Eric Taylor, now serves in the Alaska Air National Guard with \ndistinction.\n  The remarkable story of Ken Taylor reminds me of a statement once \nmade by General George Marshall. Asked if America had a secret weapon \nto help win World War II, General Marshall replied in the affirmative. \nHe said we had ``the best darn kids in the world.''\n  One can't help but wonder if these words were partly inspired by Ken \nTaylor, who, at age 21, exemplified great courage and bravery during \nthe battle that drew America into World War II. For those who remember, \nhis was one of the two planes that took off in the movie entitled \n``Pearl Harbor.''\n  It gives me great pride to have known this man. On this solemn day \nwhen we put him to rest, let us all take a moment to reflect on the \nlife--and honor the memory--of this great American hero.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are times since I have been here \nthat I have been surprised and shocked. This week was one of them, when \nI saw the leader of my party rise to ask the body to send S. 1 to \nconference. Keep in mind what S. 1 is. S. 1 was the first piece of \nlegislation we passed in the Senate this year. That is why it is called \nS. 1. Keep in mind what the vote was. It was 96 to 2. There are not \ngoing to be very many times that we do anything 96 to 2. That was \nmonths ago.\n\n[[Page S8653]]\n\n  Now, all this time we have been waiting to send this bill to \nconference so we can move ahead and make it law. This is ethics reform. \nThis is the essence of what we should be about. We are here to do the \npeople's business, not big money's business. We are here to protect \naverage people in these United States, not the lobbyists in the \nhallway.\n  Ethics reform should be at the top of our list. What happened when \nour leader asked for this bill to go to conference? The Republican \nleader objected. What in the world is going on that we would pass a \nbill 96 to 2 and then the Republican leader would say, ``I object to it \ngoing to conference''?\n  The American people have been very engaged on the immigration issue \nfor weeks. That bill has come to its conclusion. I urge every American \nout there to use those same fingers and those same phones, to use those \nsame e-mails and those same letters, to immediately begin calling their \nSenator and say to them: Why in the world would you be blocking ethics \nreform in the Senate? There is no good excuse--except politics. If we \ncannot get beyond politics to reform ethics, then I think the people \nhave a right to give us an approval rating in the cellar.\n  So I call on the Republican leader, I call on our Republican \ncolleagues: Stop playing games with ethics reform. Let's move forward. \nLet's make this happen on behalf of the people we came here to \nrepresent. If we cannot do this, we ought to put our tail between our \nlegs, be ashamed, and go home.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for his \ninsight into the legislation we considered. I guess the Presiding \nOfficer understands, when you have completed a tough campaign and you \nhave talked to voters, you learn some things. Hopefully, our Senate has \nlearned some things: That the heart of the American people is good, \nthat they are not mean spirited, but they are concerned about a lawful \nsystem of immigration.\n  I was on an Alabama-based radio show ``Rick and Bubba.'' They are \nexpanding out around the country and do an excellent job and are very \nfair about immigration. One told me the other morning: Senator, let me \ntell you my philosophy. My philosophy is that if you have a broken pipe \nin your attic, and there is water on your floor, you don't go spend all \nyour time mopping up the floor, you fix the leaking pipe.\n  So I guess I would say the failure of the legislation today, despite \nthe good efforts of my esteemed colleagues who met together and wrote \nthis bill--and they did not want anybody to change a jot or tittle of \nit--despite all of that, despite their good efforts, it did not do the \njob. It did not shut off the water. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, it would only have reduced illegality by 13 percent, and \nin the next 20 years we would have another 8.7 million people here \nillegally.\n  I think our Senators--after hearing that and having it pounded in and \nseeing this is not an exaggeration but an objective report by the \nCongressional Budget Office, and then we heard the promises: The only \nway to get a lawful system in America is to vote for this bill--they \nwere not persuaded, especially because the American people saw through \nit.\n\n  Rightly, the American people have grown to be cynical about the words \nof Congress on immigration. They have grown to be cynical about that. \nFor 40 years, Presidents and Congresses have promised we are going to \nmake a lawful system: We are going to do this. Don't worry, I voted for \nthat bill last year. It was going to do this and do that, double Border \nPatrol--but nothing ever happens.\n  We arrested a million people trying to enter our country illegally \nlast year--a million people. Why do we have that many people arrested? \nOne reason is because the border is known, worldwide, to be insecure \nand that you have a very good chance of being able to enter the country \nillegally.\n  If we can change that and we create a clear message around the world \nthat our border is secure and if you come you are going to be \napprehended and you will be prosecuted if you come across the border \nillegally, we could see a dramatic dropoff in that and a dramatic \nincrease of people applying, waiting in line to come legally. That is \nwhat it is all about, and this bill did not do it.\n  Now, somebody was saying to me and asking me recently about President \nBush and his legacy. I have to tell you, I like President Bush. He is a \nfriend of mine. I believe his heart is good. I believe he wanted to do \nsomething good about immigration. I have the highest regard for him.\n  What I would ask President Bush to do with regard to his legacy on \nimmigration would be to carry on at a much more effective and \naggressive rate than he has with a movement toward enforcement. He has \ndone things in the last several years to improve immigration \nenforcement more than the previous four or five Presidents, but it has \nnot been enough.\n  So I would suggest to the President: Make it your legacy to leave a \nsecure border for America. Enforce our current laws. Utilize every \neffective and appropriate tool we now have, which would make a huge \ndifference. Ask the Congress for what additional tools you need. Let's \nbegin to create a lawful system at the border.\n  As the American people see that and gain confidence in us as a \ngovernment, then we begin to talk about some of the more difficult \nproblems: What do we do about 12 million people who are here illegally?\n  One of the things that very much concerned me in this bill--and it \nshows the mindset that seemed to be driving the legislation and was an \nindication there was no real commitment to enforcement--was moving the \ndate of the people who would be allowed to go on a path to legality and \neven citizenship to even if you came into our country last year.\n  Now, last year's bill, which I vigorously criticized, said you could \ntake advantage of the amnesty or legalization process if you came into \nAmerica before January 1, 2004. This bill said you could take advantage \nof the amnesty--you would not be asked to leave--and you could become \nan American citizen if you broke into our country before January 1, \n2007, this year.\n  So after the President has called out the National Guard, after we \nhave said the border is closed--and it has not been closed; we made \nsome improvement, but it has not at all closed the illegality at the \nborder--but if you could get past the National Guard last December 31 \nand get into this country, this bill would have put you onto a \ncitizenship path.\n  But that is not what our colleagues told us who supported the \nlegislation. They said it was going to help those people who have deep \nroots in America who have children here and ones we cannot ask to \nleave. I am sympathetic to that. I am prepared to work on something \nlike that. But the idea that some single person who broke across the \nborder last December, past the National Guard, is being given all the \nbenefits of citizenship, all the benefits we would give to somebody who \nwaits in line to come legally makes no sense to me and indicates the \nmindset we have here.\n  The mindset is confused is all I am saying. The President, the \nexecutive branch, and the Congress have not yet gotten the message. The \nmessage is: We don't want talk. We don't want promises. We want you to \nget busy and create a lawful system of immigration, and then we can \nbegin to talk about how to deal with people who are here illegally and \nwhat our future flow of immigration would be. They had some good ideas \nin the bill about how to improve the future process by which we select \nfor admission immigrants who desire to come. We know we can't accept \neverybody. Eleven million people applied for the 50,000 lottery slots \nwe had in the year 2000. It just indicates that the number of people \nwho would like to come here vastly exceeds our ability to admit them \nall, so we must select some way for those who come. I believe that a \ntouch, a bit, in this bill that tended toward a Canadian-type\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\nsystem was a great first step and should give us a model for future \nflow.\n\n  So to my colleagues and particularly to my friend, the President of \nthe United States, whom I respect so much, I would say let's make it a \nlegacy of this Congress and this President to do everything possible, \nbeginning today, to have a secure border in our country. I believe it \nwould be widely approved by the American people. I believe it would be \ngood for our country. It would be a true contribution to American \nsociety and put us on the road toward a step to adopting new and better \npolicies for immigration.\n  It is great to see my colleague, Senator Hutchison from Texas. I \nthank her for her insight and commitment to creating a good system. \nBeing from Texas and having lived with this issue for years and years, \nshe is sympathetic and compassionate to those who want to come to \nAmerica, but she also understands the need to create a system of laws \nwe can be proud of.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \nhis remarks.\n  This is a hard time. This has been a very difficult issue. There is \nno question that so many people put hours and hours in to try to \nproduce a piece of legislation that could get a majority or 60 votes to \nproceed. I think it is important for us to take a moment and say, yes, \nit was a disappointment, but we must go forward. This should not be the \nend of efforts to deal with one of the most important, if not the most \nimportant, domestic problem in our country today; that is, we are a \nsovereign nation which must have secure borders.\n  We know there are terrorists who are trying to enter our country to \nharm Americans. We would be naive to look the other way. We know there \nare drug cartels trying to enter our country with illegal drugs. We \nknow there are human traffickers who are bringing people into our \ncountry illegally and robbing these people of huge amounts of extorted \nmoney. We know we must stop that.\n  We also know there is a need in this country for work and jobs that \nare not being filled by Americans, and we must provide a legal way for \npeople to fill those jobs. We must not equate the people who have come \nhere for jobs, trying to feed their families--because they have little \nhope from their country of origin of being able to do that--with \nterrorists and drug dealers. They are two separate kinds of problems \nand separate kinds of people. We need to provide an avenue for those \nwho are trying to do better for themselves and their families to work \nin our country and to be in our country and, within the laws we have, \nto go into permanent residency and citizenship.\n  We do have a crisis, and it is our responsibility to meet it. Just \nbecause this effort failed does not mean we didn't make progress. I \nthink we did make progress. It was not enough to get the majority even \nof this Senate to agree that this not only took care of the problems of \ntoday but would provide a standard for tomorrow and 10 years from now \nso that everyone would know what the laws are and that the laws would \nbe enforced. So we have made progress.\n  I look at so many of our colleagues who worked so hard on this, along \nwith members of the President's Cabinet and the President himself, and \nI know how deeply disappointed they are that this was not successful. \nNevertheless, I believe we were in a much better place this year than \nwe were last year, and I believe, if we start fresh, we can come up \nwith a better approach to this problem.\n  What would a better approach be?\n  First, I think it is clear the American people do not believe there \nis a commitment to border security. I believe there is much more \nprogress in this area than is known. We know the catch-and-release \nprogram is virtually shut down. It used to be that an alien coming into \nour country illegally who was not from Mexico but was from farther down \nin Central or South America would not be able to be apprehended and \ndeported because there were no detention facilities that could hold \nthem, so they were caught and released. Today, that program has been \nvirtually shut off.\n  So we have made progress. Is it enough? Absolutely not. But we must \nhave a renewed commitment to border security, and I think it is clear \nthe American people believe we must show there is a commitment as a \nprerequisite to addressing the other problems.\n  Today, I suggest we might look at a fresh approach which has the \ncommitment that was made by the President 2 weeks ago to border \nsecurity, the money commitment for the barriers, and the commitment to \nfollowing through on those border security measures. That would be one \nstep we could take that I believe would have universal agreement. There \nis no one who has called me about this bill who has not said the \nabsolute first requirement is border security.\n\n  The second thing I think we should do as we are continuing this \ncommitment to border security is a guest worker program--a guest worker \nprogram going forward that is a workable way for people to come into \nthis country and have the ability to work out in the open, legally, to \nbe able to go back and forth from their home country without being \nafraid they could not get back in, and a tamperproof identification for \nemployers to easily be able to see that a person is legally in this \ncountry.\n  I met with my good friend Massey Villarreal yesterday, and he said: \nWhere is the help for the small businesses that may not even be \ncomputerized?\n  I said: I know the Department of Homeland Security, when the \nregulations are made, will have a provision for a business that has one \nemployee or two to be able to have a clear, easy way to verify with \nthis tamperproof ID. There would be a picture on it and a biometric \nindication.\n  So I think we need to work on the guest worker program immediately, \nalong with the border security program, so that the economy of this \ncountry and the people who are seeking to work in our country to \nprovide for their families wherever they may live would be able to be \nmatched. I think we should do those two things first. That would be my \nsuggestion of a new approach.\n  The problem we ran into with this bill and the bill we tried to pass \nlast year was that tough issue of, what you do with the people who are \nalready here illegally, because the enforcement was not done. A blind \neye was turned. Through many years, since 1986, there has not been that \nworkable guest worker program which would accommodate the economic \nneeds of our country and the economic needs of workers who cannot find \njobs in their own home countries. Dealing with that was the hangup on \nthis bill, make no mistake about it. It was the perception that people \nwould be able to come here, stay in our country illegally, and never \nhave to go home in order to become legally processed in our country. \nThe American people rose up and said no. My amendment which tried to \nfix that came very close--53 to 45.\n  I think that is a concept we should revisit but not until we have \naddressed border security and made a commitment and significant \nimprovements and a guest worker program established for people coming \nin legally. In my opinion, that would probably also cause some of the \npeople who are here illegally to see a clear path, a workable path, a \ndependable path to come into our country and begin to work legally if \nwe act now to set up that guest worker program. Then start the long and \narduous process of trying to handle responsibly the people who are here \nillegally, some of whom have homes, have American-born children, which \nwe must realistically address but maybe not all at once. That would be \nmy suggestion for those who are willing to say: Let's take a week, and \nlet's determine what the next course should be.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me end by saying I do believe we need to take \nsome time. We need to look at the consequences of doing nothing, which \nI do not think people focus on enough, and try to have a fresh \napproach, perhaps a more graduated approach, that would\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\nsecure our borders and would have a guest worker program going forward \nand then follow up by dealing with the illegals who are in our country \nnow. Perhaps there would even be a safe harbor--no commitments about \nwhat would happen but not to cause people to lose jobs that are not \nbeing filled.\n  Perhaps, there could be something along that line as we decide how to \ndeal with those people who are here. I do believe there will be more \nacceptance of a responsible, legalization process of people who are \nhere illegally if the American people see border security and a guest \nworker program that puts the people in the front of the line who have \ncome legally into our country to work.\n  Mr. President, it is so important that we not give up. It is so \nimportant that we not turn another blind eye to the problem facing this \ncountry of more and more illegal aliens coming in. We must secure our \nborders from terrorists, drug dealers, and human traffickers. But it is \nnot the same as people who are coming to our country for economic help \nfor themselves and their families. We must provide a way to attract \nthose people to jobs that are not being filled by Americans. So, yes, \nit is disappointing today.\n  I applaud the people who have worked so hard. I want to say that they \ndid make progress, and it is something from which we can all learn and \ndo better as we move forward. But, mostly, we cannot shirk the \nresponsibility of our United States Senate and our United States \nCongress, working with the President, to do the right thing for our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8655-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8655-S8657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is now clear that we are not going to \ncomplete our work on immigration reform. That is enormously \ndisappointing for Congress and for the country. But we will be back and \nwe will prevail. The American people sent us here to act on our most \nurgent problems, and they will not accept inaction.\n  I have seen this happen time and time again. America always finds a \nway to solve its problems, expand its frontiers, and move closer to its \nideals. It is not always easy, but it is the American way.\n  I learned this first as a child at my grandfather's knee. He taught \nme that in America progress is always possible. His generation moved \npast the cruel signs in the windows in Boston saying ``Irish Need Not \nApply'' and elected that son of an Irish immigrant as mayor of Boston.\n  I learned that lesson firsthand when I came to the Senate in 1962. \nOur Nation was finally recognizing that the work of civil rights had \nnot ended with the Emancipation Proclamation, nor with the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. It was up to Congress \nto take action.\n  The path forward has never been an easy one. There were filibusters \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. \nBut we didn't give up and we ultimately prevailed.\n  The same was true in our battles for fair housing and for an end to \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities. On immense issues \nsuch as these, a minority in the Senate was often able to create \nstalemate and delay for a time. But they had never been able to stop \nthe march of progress.\n  Throughout all of those battles, we faced critics who loudly warned \nthat we were changing America forever. In the end, they were right. Our \nhistory of civil rights legislation did change America forever. It made \nAmerica stronger, fairer, and a better nation.\n  Immigration is another issue like that. We know the high price of \ncontinuing inaction. Raids and other enforcement actions will escalate, \nterrorizing our communities and businesses.\n  The 12 million undocumented immigrants will soon be millions more. \nSweatshops will grow and undermine American workers and wages. State \nand local governments will take matters into their own hands and pass a \nmaze of conflicting laws that hurt our country. We will have the kind \nof open border that is unacceptable in our post-9/11 world.\n  Immigration reform is an opportunity to be true to our ideals as a \nnation. Our Declaration of Independence announces that all of us are \ncreated equal. Today, we failed to live up to that declaration for \nmillions of men and women who live, work, and worship beside us. But \nour ideals are too strong to be held back for long.\n  Martin Luther King had a dream that children would be judged solely \nby ``the content of their character.'' Today, we failed to make that \ndream come true for the children of immigrants. But that dream will \nnever die. It has the power to overcome the most bitter opposition.\n  I believe we will soon succeed where we failed today, and that we \nwill enact the kind of comprehensive reform that our ideals and \nnational security demand. Soon, word will echo across the country about \nthe consequences of today's vote. The American people will know that a \nminority of the Senate blocked a record investment in border security.\n  H.L. Mencken said that for every complex problem, there is a simple \nsolution--and it is wrong. A minority in the Senate has employed a \nsimple label against this bill--amnesty--and they were wrong, too.\n  A minority in the Senate rejected a stronger economy that is fairer \nto our taxpayers and our workers. A minority of the Senate rejected \nAmerica's own extraordinary immigrant history and ignored our Nation's \nmost urgent needs.\n  But we are in this struggle for the long haul. Today's defeat will \nnot stand. As we continue the battle, we will have ample inspiration in \nthe lives of the immigrants all around us.\n  From Jamestown, to the Pilgrims, to the Irish, to today's workers, \npeople have come to this country in search of opportunity. They have \nsought nothing more than a chance to work hard and bring a better life \nto themselves and their families. They come to our country with their \nhearts and minds full of hope.\n  We will endure today's loss and begin anew to build the kinds of \ntough, fair, and practical reform worthy of our shared history as \nimmigrants and as Americans.\n  Immigration reforms are always controversial. But Congress was \ncreated to muster political will to answer such challenges. Today we \ndidn't, but tomorrow we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I wanted to come to the floor to offer a \nfew thoughts and observations on the important vote we had earlier \ntoday on the immigration bill. I know many people are puzzled when they \nwatch us debate big and important issues such as this. What usually \nhappens is our views are reduced to a bumper sticker. Particularly on \ncomplex topics such as immigration, a bumper sticker doesn't tell the \nwhole story. So I wish to offer a few thoughts on the way forward on \nthis important issue.\n  I have not found an issue in my short time in the Senate, now about \n4\\1/2\\ years, which has been more closely followed and on which there \nhas been more passion than the subject we have been debating this week \nand which we voted on this morning.\n  Sometimes, as we all know, passion can produce more heat than light, \nbut what we need is some light and some clear thinking and some better \nsolutions to our broken borders and our broken immigration system than \nwe have had so far.\n  I don't say that with the intent to criticize the hard work that \npeople have put into this effort. I am proud of the fact that since I \nhave been in the Senate, I have tried to constructively contribute to a \nsolution to this problem. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand as a former chairman of the Immigration and Border Security \nSubcommittee of that Judiciary Committee, now as the ranking member, I \nhave tried my best to contribute\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\nto a solution. But I think the one message I would take away from what \nwe saw happen earlier today is the American people, my constituents in \nTexas, are profoundly skeptical of big Government solutions with a lot \nof moving parts based on big, grandiose promises, when our history has \nbeen one of not delivering consistent with what we promised. Let me \nmention what I mean by that.\n  In 1986, we had a big immigration bill, supposedly one to fix all the \nproblems. President Ronald Reagan signed that bill. I remember Ed \nMeese, his Attorney General, wrote a piece in I believe the New York \nTimes explaining what was going through President Reagan's mind as he \nsigned that amnesty for 3 million people. Ed Meese explained that \nPresident Reagan was told in 1986 that if you do this amnesty one time, \nthat will be the end of it; you will never have to do another one, as \nlong as we have enforcement of our laws that go hand in hand with that \ngrant of amnesty for 3 million people.\n  Part of the skepticism that I think the American people and certainly \nmy constituents in Texas have had about this bill is that they saw \ncoupled with a path to legalization and ultimately American citizenship \nfor roughly 12 million people that we mean it this time, we are going \nto get serious about border security, we are going to get serious about \neliminating the document fraud and identity theft that makes our \ncurrent worker verification system virtually unworkable, and they saw a \nrepetition of 1986.\n  There were components of this bill that I thought were actually \npretty good, that represented an improvement over the status quo. But I \nthink some of the debate got a little bit hard to believe such as when \npeople said the only way you are going to get border security is if you \nagree to a path to citizenship for 12 million people. The American \npeople are pretty smart. They can see through that, and they know there \nis no obvious linkage between border security and a path to citizenship \nfor 12 million people. They know if we were serious about border \nsecurity, we would have already done it.\n  So I think, at least the lesson I have learned from this vote this \nmorning is not that we can give up because the problem is not going to \ngo away. It may get caught up in Presidential election politics and \nmaybe part of what we need to do is continue this grand national \nconversation about how do we solve this problem because I don't believe \nthere is any problem that is too big for the American people to solve. \nCertainly, they are not waiting for some pronouncement from Mount \nOlympus in Washington, DC, about here is the answer and you have to \nswallow it. We work for the American people. We work for the \nconstituents who sent us here. The power we get to act on their behalf \ncomes from the bottom up; it doesn't come from the top down. I think \npart of the rejection that we saw of this particular bill was the sense \nthat Washington was trying to dictate a solution about which the \nAmerican people had a lot of questions and a lot of reservations.\n  I think we need to go back to basics. We need to go back and listen \nto our constituents. We need to talk to them and explain to them what \nthe problem is. We need to have a transparent process that is an \ninteractive process where we can listen to them and we can tell them \nwhat we have learned about this issue and about some of the problems \nand try to come up with a solution.\n  One of the lessons may be that big, multifaceted, complex programs \nsuch as this bill offered, particularly on something where the Federal \nGovernment doesn't have a whole lot of credibility when it comes to \nactually enforcing the law or securing the border, the American people \nare not going to accept it, and I think that was reflected in the vote \nwe had today.\n  That is not the same thing as saying give up, because we can't give \nup. This problem is not going away. As somebody who represents a border \nState with about 1,600 miles of common border with Mexico, I say we \nhave to find a rational solution to this problem.\n  I know that passions have run high, but I, for one, am very pleased \nwith the level of the debate in the Senate because, as we all know, \nsometimes this topic is susceptible to some pretty irresponsible \nlanguage and dialog.\n  This was not a rejection of our heritage as a nation of immigrants. \nWe are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. And I \nthink what the American people saw--certainly my constituents in Texas \nsaw--is the status quo of a kind of lawlessness and a lack of \ncommitment to simple law and order which they wanted to see restored. I \nthink if we demonstrate that we have heard the message they have sent \nus--if we demonstrate that, yes, we are serious about border security; \nyes, we are serious about enforcing the law--then I think we can \ncontinue that conversation and talk about the other aspects of this \nlegislation that we need to continue to work on.\n  What are the legitimate needs of American employers for legal \nworkers? Certainly, we would prefer that they get legal workers rather \nthan workers who are not respecting our laws. Certainly, we would all \nwant, I would think, to have a system whereby someone can show up at a \nworkplace and present a tamper-proof, secure identification card and \nvirtually guarantee that they are legally eligible to work in the \nUnited States as opposed to the kind of document fraud and identity \ntheft that now runs rampant and which makes it impossible even for good \nemployers trying to honor the law to know that the person standing \nbefore them can actually legally work in the United States.\n  We recently had an example of a company, a Swift meatpacking plant, \nwhich was the subject of a raid by the Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement Service in multiple States, including my State of Texas. \nWhat they found was this company was using the only Government \nprogram--the only Government program--known as Basic Pilot, to try to \nmatch up the identity of people who came to work there with a Social \nSecurity number. Basic Pilot confirmed that, yes, that is John Cornyn, \nand that is John Cornyn's Social Security number, but that is about all \nBasic Pilot could tell them. What they wouldn't tell them is if it was \nsomebody else masquerading as John Cornyn and claiming his Social \nSecurity number.\n  That company sustained a huge business loss because the Federal \nGovernment failed it by not providing it with a reliable means to \ndetermine whether people who claim to be American citizens and eligible \nto work were, in fact, eligible. So we have a lot of credibility we \nneed to restore at the Federal Government level when it comes to \nenforcing the law and securing our borders.\n  I think if we perhaps break down this big problem into smaller \nsolutions, step by step, and work our way through this, we can continue \nto find an opportunity to solve this problem bit by bit and piece by \npiece. What I saw rejected this morning were big, grandiose government \nsolutions where our credibility was seriously lacking because of a lack \nof followthrough on earlier promises, particularly when it comes to \nenforcing our laws and securing our borders.\n  I would just like to say to all my colleagues who have worked so hard \non this issue that you have my commitment that I will continue to work \nwith you in good faith to try to solve the problems. That is what I \nthought my constituents wanted me to do. That is what I know they want \nme to do. They do not want us pointing the finger of blame. They do not \nwant us calling each other names. And they do not want the sort of \n``hyperpartisanship'' that unfortunately too often characterizes our \nactivities in Washington. But they also don't want to be sold a bill of \ngoods. They do not want to be promised a lot when they know we are \ngoing to deliver little.\n  So this is a big issue, one that is worthy of the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world--the U.S. Senate--and it is an issue on \nwhich I assure each of my colleagues that I intend to do my part to try \nto solve.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8657]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8655-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8655-S8657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

It may get caught up in Presidential election politics and \nmaybe part of what we need to do is continue this grand national \nconversation about how do we solve this problem because I don't believe \nthere is any problem that is too big for the American people to solve. \nCertainly, they are not waiting for some pronouncement from Mount \nOlympus in Washington, DC, about here is the answer and you have to \nswallow it. We work for the American people. We work for the \nconstituents who sent us here. The power we get to act on their behalf \ncomes from the bottom up; it doesn't come from the top down. I think \npart of the rejection that we saw of this particular bill was the sense \nthat Washington was trying to dictate a solution about which the \nAmerican people had a lot of questions and a lot of reservations.\n  I think we need to go back to basics. We need to go back and listen \nto our constituents. We need to talk to them and explain to them what \nthe problem is. We need to have a transparent process that is an \ninteractive process where we can listen to them and we can tell them \nwhat we have learned about this issue and about some of the problems \nand try to come up with a solution.\n  One of the lessons may be that big, multifaceted, complex programs \nsuch as this bill offered, particularly on something where the Federal \nGovernment doesn't have a whole lot of credibility when it comes to \nactually enforcing the law or securing the border, the American people \nare not going to accept it, and I think that was reflected in the vote \nwe had today.\n  That is not the same thing as saying give up, because we can't give \nup. This problem is not going away. As somebody who represents a border \nState with about 1,600 miles of common border with Mexico, I say we \nhave to find a rational solution to this problem.\n  I know that passions have run high, but I, for one, am very pleased \nwith the level of the debate in the Senate because, as we all know, \nsometimes this topic is susceptible to some pretty irresponsible \nlanguage and dialog.\n  This was not a rejection of our heritage as a nation of immigrants. \nWe are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. And I \nthink what the American people saw--certainly my constituents in Texas \nsaw--is the status quo of a kind of lawlessness and a lack of \ncommitment to simple law and order which they wanted to see restored. I \nthink if we demonstrate that we have heard the message they have sent \nus--if we demonstrate that, yes, we are serious about border security; \nyes, we are serious about enforcing the law--then I think we can \ncontinue that conversation and talk about the other aspects of this \nlegislation that we need to continue to work on.\n  What are the legitimate needs of American employers for legal \nworkers? Certainly, we would prefer that they get legal workers rather \nthan workers who are not respecting our laws. Certainly, we would all \nwant, I would think, to have a system whereby someone can show up at a \nworkplace and present a tamper-proof, secure identification card and \nvirtually guarantee that they are legally eligible to work in the \nUnited States as opposed to the kind of document fraud and identity \ntheft that now runs rampant and which makes it impossible even for good \nemployers trying to honor the law to know that the person standing \nbefore them can actually legally work in the United States.\n  We recently had an example of a company, a Swift meatpacking plant, \nwhich was the subject of a raid by the Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement Service in multiple States, including my State of Texas. \nWhat they found was this company was using the only Government \nprogram--the only Government program--known as Basic Pilot, to try to \nmatch up the identity of people who came to work there with a Social \nSecurity number. Basic Pilot confirmed that, yes, that is John Cornyn, \nand that is John Cornyn's Social Security number, but that is about all \nBasic Pilot could tell them. What they wouldn't tell them is if it was \nsomebody else masquerading as John Cornyn and claiming his Social \nSecurity number.\n  That company sustained a huge business loss because the Federal \nGovernment failed it by not providing it with a reliable means to \ndetermine whether people who claim to be American citizens and eligible \nto work were, in fact, eligible. So we have a lot of credibility we \nneed to restore at the Federal Government level when it comes to \nenforcing the law and securing our borders.\n  I think if we perhaps break down this big problem into smaller \nsolutions, step by step, and work our way through this, we can continue \nto find an opportunity to solve this problem bit by bit and piece by \npiece. What I saw rejected this morning were big, grandiose government \nsolutions where our credibility was seriously lacking because of a lack \nof followthrough on earlier promises, particularly when it comes to \nenforcing our laws and securing our borders.\n  I would just like to say to all my colleagues who have worked so hard \non this issue that you have my commitment that I will continue to work \nwith you in good faith to try to solve the problems. That is what I \nthought my constituents wanted me to do. That is what I know they want \nme to do. They do not want us pointing the finger of blame. They do not \nwant us calling each other names. And they do not want the sort of \n``hyperpartisanship'' that unfortunately too often characterizes our \nactivities in Washington. But they also don't want to be sold a bill of \ngoods. They do not want to be promised a lot when they know we are \ngoing to deliver little.\n  So this is a big issue, one that is worthy of the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world--the U.S. Senate--and it is an issue on \nwhich I assure each of my colleagues that I intend to do my part to try \nto solve.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8657]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8657-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8657-S8659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF LESLIE SOUTHWICK\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as the discussion over immigration reform \ndemonstrates, this body confronts tough issues and can find itself \nembroiled in some contentious debates.\n  Over the years, it has not been uncommon to see judicial appointment \ndebates at the top of the list of contentious debates. And during those \ndebates, we have seen a lot of tactics and methods used.\n  But some tactics are simply wrong.\n  Some methods are simply inappropriate.\n  There are some means which no ends can justify. Some of these wrong \ntactics, inappropriate methods, and illegitimate means have been used \nto attack the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  If we care about the integrity of this body and the good of the \njudicial branch, if we really believe that there is something more \nimportant than raw ideological politics, we should reject this attack \non this good man and confirm his nomination.\n  Judge Southwick, who served for a dozen years on the Mississippi \nCourt of Appeals, has received a unanimous well qualified rating from \nthe American Bar Association.\n  He has the strong support of his home State Senators, both of whom \nare Senior Members.\n  He would fill a judicial emergency vacancy.\n  And though it has been obscured by all the hyperbolic, vitriolic, and \nover-the-top rhetoric now thrown about, the Judiciary Committee just \nmonths ago approved without objection Judge Southwick's nomination. \nNow, for whatever reason, the nomination is in limbo--first it is on \nthe committee agenda without action and now not on the committee agenda \nat all.\n  The committee looked at the same qualifications, the same record, the \nsame man with the same character, and found no objection whatsoever.\n  The only difference--which is really a distinction without a \ndifference--is that Judge Southwick was then nominated to the U.S. \nDistrict Court but now has been nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  The disturbing tactics being used against this nominee are certainly \nnot new, and they are no more legitimate or persuasive now than when \nthey have been used against other nominees in the past.\n  Frankly, I am amazed that anyone finds them credible, let alone \npersuasive.\n  Judge Southwick served on the Mississippi Court of Appeals for 12 \nyears.\n  It is not credible to focus only on a few cases among the 7,000 in \nwhich he participated and the nearly 1,000 opinions he wrote.\n  It is not credible to focus only on the results of those few cases, \nignoring the facts and the law.\n  It is not credible to demand that judges render decisions that serve \ncertain political interests, whether or not the law actually requires \nthat result.\n  It is not credible to attack Judge Southwick for phrases or language \nin opinions he did not write.\n  It is not credible to ignore the limitations imposed on appeals court \njudges by the standard of review they must follow.\n  It is not credible to say that a judicial ruling against a particular \nparty amounts to a judge's personal hostility against a group to which \nthat party might belong.\n  These are some of the misleading tactics that we have seen used \nagainst judicial nominees in the past and are being used against Judge \nSouthwick now.\n  These tactics are simply not credible, and I am amazed that my \nDemocratic colleagues seem to be going along with them.\n  One of the sure signs that such illegitimate tactics are in play is \nthat they result in a distorted, twisted caricature of a nominee that \nthose who have long known and worked with him simply do not recognize.\n  Richard Roberts, former president of the Mississippi bar, for \nexample, says that no other lawyer in the State is as qualified as \nJudge Southwick to serve on the Fifth Circuit.\n  According to Phillip McIntosh, associate dean at the Mississippi \nCollege School of Law where Judge Southwick now teaches, a politically \nand racially diverse faculty unanimously approved Judge Southwick for a \nfaculty position with no question about his integrity, fairness, or \nimpartiality.\n  A. La'Verne Edney, an African-American partner at Judge Southwick's \nformer law firm, clerked for him on the Mississippi Court of Appeals.\n  He says that Judge Southwick applied the law fairly without regard to \nthe parties' affiliation, color, or stature.\n  These and other colleagues and partners of Judge Southwick know him \nbest.\n  I can only imagine their shock and confusion over the wildly \nderogatory and extreme descriptions offered by Judge Southwick's \nWashington-based critics.\n  I can only imagine the reaction by those who know Judge Southwick \nwhen those who do not know him make such claims without knowing what \nthey are talking about.\n  I think my colleagues would agree that the American Bar Association \nhas never been accused of a conservative bias.\n  And I think we would all agree that the ABA conducts perhaps the most \nexhaustive and thorough evaluation of judicial nominees.\n  The ABA looks at the whole record; the ABA interviews dozens of \npeople in each case.\n  Let me remind everyone that the previous nominee to this very same \nFifth Circuit position ran into trouble when the ABA rated him not \nqualified.\n  My Democratic colleagues thought that was the most insightful, \nthorough, accurate, and definitive evaluation ever done on any nominee \nto any position anywhere.\n  The same ABA has unanimously given Judge Southwick its highest well \nqualified rating.\n  That means, according to the ABA's own description of its rating \ncriteria, that Judge Southwick gets the highest marks for such things \nas compassion, open-mindedness, freedom from bias and commitment to \nequal justice.\n  So here is the choice we face.\n  On the one side, critics who do not know and have not worked with \nJudge Southwick look only at the results of just a few cases and claim \nJudge Southwick has hostile views on issues such as race, when there is \nno indication by anybody in Mississippi or otherwise that he has any \nsuch hostility.\n  On the other side, the ABA and those who do know and have worked with \nJudge Southwick look at his entire record and gave him the highest \nmarks for compassion, open-mindedness, freedom from bias and commitment \nto equal justice under the law.\n  These two radically different pictures of this nominee cannot both be \ntrue.\n  I think the tactics and standards used by Judge Southwick's critics \nare wrong and illegitimate, and the conclusions about him based on \nthose tactics are simply not credible. I think they know that.\n  And they certainly do not justify doing an about-face and voting \nagainst a nominee who, just months ago, received the Judiciary \nCommittee's unanimous support.\n  Illegitimate tactics leading to less than credible conclusions do not \njustify disregarding the judgment of our colleagues, the Senators from \nMississippi, who are this nominee's home State Senators.\n  Let me close with one more point.\n  In their opposition letter, the Congressional Black Caucus says that \nwe ``should be impressed by the frequency with which Southwick's \nopinions and concurrences have been overruled.'' That is pure, \nunadulterated hogwash.\n  Judge Southwick authored 927 opinions and concurrences while on the \nMississippi Court of Appeals and only 21 of them have been either \nreversed or even criticized by the Mississippi Supreme Court in 12 \nyears. I don't know of many judges who have such an unblemished record.\n  I must say that I am indeed impressed by the frequency with which \nJudge Southwick's opinions and concurrences have been overruled.\n  I am very impressed with such a low reversal rate over such a long \nperiod of distinguished judicial service.\n  And I note that Kay Cobb, former presiding justice of the Mississippi \nSupreme Court, the court that reviewed Judge Southwick's decisions, has \nwritten with enthusiastic support of his nomination.\n\n[[Page S8658]]\n\n  Justice Cobb, unlike Judge Southwick's critics, has known him for \nmany years and highlights his attention to promoting fairness and \nequality.\n  Judge Southwick has served his community, volunteering with Habitat \nfor Humanity since 1993.\n  He volunteered to serve his country in the Mississippi National Guard \nand by joining a line combat unit that served in Iraq.\n  Only months ago, the Judiciary Committee found Judge Southwick's \nqualifications and character sufficient to report his district court \nnomination without a single objection.\n  Judge Southwick today is the same man with the same qualifications, \nthe same ability, the same character, and the same commitment to the \nrule of law.\n  He has the strong support of his home State Senators--both of whom \nare highly respected--and should be given the opportunity to serve on \nthe Fifth Circuit.\n  The Judiciary Committee should report his nomination, and the Senate \nshould confirm him, without delay, or a manifest injustice will have \noccurred and will led to even more antagonism between the two sides of \nthis body.\n  We have been used to some of these tactics in the last 2 months of a \nPresident's tenure, maybe even the last 6 months, but hardly ever \nagainst a person of this man's qualifications, and then we have usually \nknocked that type of criticism down, as decent, honorable Senators \nshould knock them down. Frankly, this President will serve for another \nyear and a half. He has appointed a sterling, good man who deserves to \nbe brought before the Senate and confirmed. I hope my colleagues will \nstop this tragedy and put this man on the court. He deserves it. He \nwill be great on the court. He will be a person who will be fair and \ndecent for everybody. I have every confidence in him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Law Offices of\n\n\n                                       Richard C.

Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: The issue of diversity seems to be \n     the current focal point in the nomination process for the \n     vacancy existing on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. As a \n     former President of the Mississippi Bar, I understand and \n     appreciate the desire and need to have females and African-\n     Americans serving in our federal judiciary, particularly when \n     the candidates are from Mississippi. I venture to say, \n     however, that no other lawyer in the State of Mississippi is \n     as qualified for the Fifth Circuit position by virtue of \n     education, experience, intellect, integrity and temperament \n     as the Honorable Leslie H. Southwick.\n       I have known Judge Southwick personally since 1977. I am \n     sure you are well aware of Judge Southwick's outstanding \n     legal career, and his exemplary service to our country in The \n     Department of Justice and as Staff Judge Advocate for the \n     155th Brigade Combat Team in Iraq. I would venture to guess \n     that his fellow judges have also expressed their written \n     support of his untiring efforts and abilities as a judge on \n     our Mississippi Court of Appeals.\n       The purpose of my letter, however, is to emphasize Judge \n     Southwick's personal virtues. He is simply one of the finest, \n     most decent, kind, humble, and fair-minded persons I have \n     ever known regardless of race or gender.\n       Judge Southwick reminds me in so many ways of Judge Charles \n     Clark, who served for many years as Chief Judge for the Fifth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, and for whom Judge Southwick \n     clerked before entering the private practice of law. When \n     Judge Clark served on the Court of Appeals, he had it all--\n     intellectual ability, superb personal and organizational \n     skills, work ethic, commitment, integrity, and a wonderful \n     sense of humor. I am sure you remember Judge Clark. Judge \n     Leslie Southwick is cut from the exact same cloth.\n       Seldom will the Judiciary Committee have the opportunity to \n     make an appointment which will have such a lasting effect on \n     the integrity of our federal judicial system in Mississippi \n     and the other states within the Fifth Circuit, and to \n     solidify the reputation it justifiably enjoys as the \n     protector of our rule of law, the civil rights of all \n     citizens. Please do not miss this opportunity to confirm the \n     nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick.\n       With highest regards, I am\n           Respectfully yours,\n     Richard C. Roberts, III.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Mississippi College,\n\n                                                     June 4, 2007.\n     Re The Honorable Leslie Southwick.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to you to express my \n     strong support for the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the \n     Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I have known Judge Southwick \n     for several years while he has been an adjunct professor and \n     vising professor at Mississippi College School of Law. As \n     Associate Dean, hiring of adjuncts comes under my \n     responsibilities for the law school. We have been honored to \n     have him on our faculty and look forward to a long and \n     beneficial relationship with him. Our students likewise hold \n     Judge Southwick in highest regard.\n       Judge Southwick is a man of highest integrity, honor and \n     intellect. As a judge on the Mississippi Court of Appeals he \n     scrupulously did his judicial duty in following the law in \n     his judicial opinions. I am greatly disappointed that some \n     have taken the opportunity to try to score political points \n     by characterizing Judge Southwick as intolerant or having \n     ``very fixed, right-wing world view,'' seeking to imply that \n     he would not be fair and impartial in applying the law. In my \n     personal and professional dealings with him, I can attest to \n     his fine character. I have not the slightest doubt regarding \n     his impartiality and commitment to fairness.\n       Judge Southwick would make an outstanding judge for the \n     Fifth Circuit. I know that he will uphold the law and apply \n     it regardless of his personal view on a particular subject. \n     He is a very thoughtful man, a true scholar. I also know that \n     he is not racist and does not hold racist views. Such an \n     allegation is ludicrous, insulting, and without foundation.\n       As an example of the regard with which Judge Southwick is \n     held by the law faculty at Mississippi College, he was \n     offered a position as a visiting faculty member following his \n     resignation as a judge for the Mississippi Court of Appeals \n     and pending the approval of his nomination to the Fifth \n     Circuit. The suggestion to make this offer was made by one of \n     our faculty members, and the recommendation was unanimously \n     approved by our faculty. We have a politically and racially \n     diverse faculty, but not one note of concern about Judge \n     Southwick's integrity, fairness, or impartiality was sounded. \n     His appointment to our faculty was strongly supported by all \n     of our faculty members. I might even mention that his \n     teaching partner for Trial Practice this past semester is an \n     African American attorney and former Mississippi Circuit \n     Court judge, and whom Judge Southwick personally recruited to \n     partner with him for the course.\n       I hope that you will support the nomination of this \n     outstanding man to the Fifth Circuit. He is an exceptional \n     candidate and deserving of confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Phillip L. McIntosh,\n     Associate Dean and Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Brunini, Attorneys at Law\n\n\n                                           Trustmark Building,\n\n                                        Jackson, MS, June 5, 2007.\n     Re Judge Leslie Southwick Nomination.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am an African-American partner at \n     the law firm of Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, PLLC, \n     where Judge Southwick was once a member. I believe in \n     fairness for all people and salute our leaders for giving \n     their lives to assure that fairness. While I share the \n     sentiments of other African-Americans that the federal \n     judiciary needs to be more diverse, I believe that Judge \n     Southwick is imminently qualified for the United States Fifth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals and write in support of his \n     nomination.\n       I met Judge Southwick during my third year of law school \n     when I interned with the Court of Appeals of Mississippi. \n     That internship allowed me an opportunity to work with most \n     of the Judges on the bench at that time. I was most impressed \n     with Judge Southwick because of his work ethic and his serene \n     personality. When I finished law school in 1996, I believed \n     that my chances for landing a clerkship were slim because \n     there was only one African-American Court of Appeals judge on \n     the bench at the time and there were very few Caucasian \n     judges during the history of the Mississippi Supreme Court or \n     the Court of Appeals (which was fairly new) who had ever \n     hired African-American law clerks. In spite of the odds, I \n     applied for a clerkship. Judge Southwick granted me an \n     interview and hired me that same day. While Judge Southwick \n     had many applicants to choose from, he saw that I was \n     qualified for the position and granted me the opportunity.\n       During my tenure as clerk with the Court, Judge Southwick \n     thought through every issue and took every case seriously. He \n     earned a reputation for his well thought out opinions and his \n     ability to produce the highest number of opinions in a term. \n     It did not matter the parties' affiliation, color, or \n     stature--what mattered was what the law said and Judge \n     Southwick worked very hard to apply it fairly. Judge \n     Southwick valued my opinions and included me in all of the \n     discussions of issues presented for decision. Having worked \n     closely with Judge Southwick, I have no doubt that he is \n     fair, impartial, and has all of the other qualities necessary \n     to be an\n\n[[Page S8659]]\n\n     excellent addition to the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Fifth Circuit.\n       In addition to serving our State, Judge Southwick has also \n     honorably served our country. During his mission to Iraq in \n     2005, Southwick found the time to write me often to let me \n     know about his experiences there. Upon his return to the \n     United States, Judge Southwick shared with others his \n     humbling experience serving our country. It is clear from his \n     writings and speaking that he served with pride and dignity.\n       Other the years, Judge Southwick has earned the reputation \n     of being a person of high morals, dignity, and fairness. It \n     is unfortunate that there are some who have made him the \n     chosen sacrifice to promote agendas and have set out to taint \n     all that Judge Southwick has worked so hard to accomplish. I \n     am prayerful that those efforts will not preclude Judge \n     Southwick from serving as our next Judge on the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       If additional information is needed, please feel free to \n     contact me.\n           Yours truly,\n     A. La'Verne Edney.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Supreme Court of Mississippi,\n\n                                        Jackson, MS, June 5, 2007.\n     Re Judge Leslie H. Southwick.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: This letter is enthusiastically \n     written to urge you and the Committee to confirm Leslie H. \n     Southwick to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     I've known him for many years and I'm honored to give him my \n     highest recommendation, without reservation. In every way he \n     is worthy to serve.\n       Judge Southwick's scholarship and character are stellar. \n     The opinions he wrote during his ten years on the Mississippi \n     Court of Appeals reflect his thoroughness and fairness, as \n     well as the depth of his knowledge and the quality and \n     clarity of his reasoning and writing.\n       In every aspect of his legal career and life in general, \n     Leslie Southwick has excelled. He has a long and consistent \n     record as a devoted family man, a courageous military leader, \n     an accomplished author, and an excellent appellate judge. His \n     awareness and attention to promoting fairness and equality \n     with regard to race and gender are exemplary.\n       Our country needs conscientious and independent judges of \n     impeccable integrity and I cannot think of anyone who better \n     qualifies for this appointment!\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Kay B.

Mr. President, from my State of New Jersey and that \npart of the State in which I live, we can almost touch Lady Liberty. \nShe is that close to us from a State park called Liberty State Park, an \narea I had the unique privilege of representing in the House of \nRepresentatives for 13 years and an area I still represent as the \njunior Senator from New Jersey, an area I have fond memories of because \nof the power of what it means. From that same park we can cross a \nbridge and go to Ellis Island, a place to which millions came to \nAmerica to start a journey, a journey that contributed enormously to \nits great promise, enormously to the great country that it is today.\n  I rise to discuss the recent cloture vote on immigration with that \ncontext in mind. The Senate had a historic opportunity to move forward \ntoday with comprehensive immigration reform that truly secured our \nborders, that realized the economic realities of our time and allowed \npeople the opportunity to come out of the shadows into the light to \nearn their legalization.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate decided to maintain the status quo, a \nstatus quo of broken borders, that does not meet our economic \nchallenges, and that permits human exploitation and trafficking to take \nplace.\n  As someone who was part of the early negotiations back in March of \nthis year on the question of immigration reform, I maintained then that \nthe administration had leaped away from the largely bipartisan bill of \nlast year that received 23 Republican votes and 39 Democratic votes to \na much more conservative, much more impractical, and a much more \npartisan proposal this year. I was unable to join several of my \ncolleagues in what has become known as the grand bargain. I acknowledge \nand appreciate several of those who advocated, because we were only on \nthe floor on immigration reform, truly a critical issue for this \ncountry, as a result of their leadership, colleagues such as Senators \nKennedy and Salazar and Graham, to name a few, who truly believed in \nthat opportunity; at the same time, because of the leadership of the \nmajority leader, who was willing to take on one of the most contentious \nissues, an issue that has been contentious throughout our country's \nhistory. I have often remarked on the floor how on the question of \nimmigration, it is interesting to have heard the language of those \ndebates at different times in our history.\n  Ben Franklin referred to no longer being able to accept those who \nwere coming to our shores in negative terms. He was talking then about \nthe Germans. The former Governor of Massachusetts, in the early 1900s, \nsaid that, in fact, they are sending the most illiterate of their \npeople to our shores. He was talking then about the Irish. In 1925, in \nan official report of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, they said: \nWe need the Mexicans because of their bending and crouching habits \nwhich the whites cannot attain themselves to in order to pick our \nproduce. We had the Chinese exclusionary provisions.\n  So while this has always been a welcoming country, the debate has not \nbeen as welcoming. On that day when the ``Grand Bargain'' was \nannounced, I came to this Chamber to express my opposition to the deal \nthat was announced because I believed it was deficient in some regard \nand to say that I would work to improve it. Looking back at what I said \nthen, in light of today's vote, it was strikingly clairvoyant to me, to \nsay the least.\n  I said on that day we must come together not as Democrats and \nRepublicans or liberals and conservatives but as statesmen and, in \ndoing so, honor the traditions of the Senate as a body that values \nreasoning, honest debate, and compromise over sound bites and talking \npoints but especially over the politics of fear.\n  Unfortunately, today, the voices that appealed to that fear and the \nlowest common denominator won out. Only 12 of our Republican colleagues \nwere willing to stand up and vote to invoke cloture, almost half of \nthose who voted for last year's bipartisan immigration bill.\n  Only 12 Republican colleagues were willing to move forward, at least \nfor the final essence of debates and amendments, and to a final vote, \nwhich is about half of those who voted last year for immigration \nreform.\n  Now, personally, I still had serious concerns about the direction of \nthe bill, but I voted to keep it alive because I wanted to work to make \nit better and because I believe in comprehensive immigration reform as \nsomething that is in the national interest and national security of the \nUnited States and because America's promise and its security should not \nhave been snuffed out by one single vote.\n  I said back on that day in May that I could not sign on to the \nagreement because it tore families apart, and it says to many they are \nonly good enough to work here and give their human capital and slave \nbut never good enough to stay here. But instead of responding to those \nerstwhile concerns from those of us willing to be supportive of \ncomprehensive immigration reform, the appeal was constantly made to the \nright of the spectrum, to those who actually achieved some of the \nthings they wanted in the bill but, obviously, never even intended to \nvote for comprehensive immigration reform--not even to vote to allow it \nto move forward. As it moved to the right, it got less and less support \nfrom the right.\n  Unfortunately, instead of working with those of us who were willing \nto not only work to improve this bill but also put our votes where our \nmouths were, they kept giving in to demand after demand from \nconservative Republicans, and in turn this bill moved further and \nfurther to the right.\n  In fact, at least two Members who were at the press conference on May \n17 and got things included in the bill voted against keeping this \nprocess moving forward by voting against cloture today.\n  Ultimately, in my mind, this came down to a President and a party who \nwas, once again, there for the photo\n\n[[Page S8660]]\n\nops and the press conferences but was not willing to roll up their \nsleeves and do the hard work to improve this bill and help it move \nforward for our Nation: a Republican Party that was not about progress \nbut about partisanship; a Republican Party that was not about solving \nour Nation's problems but seeking political gain by stopping progress \nof any sort in this Senate; the same President who used large amounts \nof political capital misleading our country into a disastrous war in \nIraq, with little political capital on truly improving our Nation's \nsecurity through tough yet practical and comprehensive immigration \nreform; a President who used political capital on tax cuts for the \nwealthiest in our country but not on truly meeting our Nation's \neconomic needs through fair and comprehensive immigration reform; and \nit is either a President who has no political capital or one who was \nnot willing to use it.\n  Finally, throughout my life, and most recently on the Senate floor, I \nhave heard the phrase ``those people''--``those people.'' Those who use \nthat phrase are the voices of division and discrimination. They are the \nxenophobes who exist today and have existed at different times in our \nNation's history but whose voices have ultimately been overcome to give \nway to the greatest successful experiment in the history of mankind--\nthe United States of America that we know today.\n  But the last phrase of Emma Lazarus's poem emblazed on the inner wall \nof the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty says:\n\n       I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\n\n  Maybe today that lamp is somewhat dimmer, but it will shine again. \nThe course of history is unalterable, the human spirit cannot be \nshackled forever, the drumbeat for security, economic vitality and, \nmost importantly, justice will only grow stronger.\n  Finally, to those who have often referred to ``those people'' in this \ndebate, let me say on behalf of ``those people,'' we have seen the \nlight, and we simply will not be thrust back into the darkness.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my vote against \ncloture on S. 1639, the border security and immigration reform bill \ndebated by the Senate this week.\n  I support some of the proposals behind S. 1639 because we must \naddress our border and immigration crisis. However, I was forced to \nvote no on the motion to invoke cloture on S. 1639 for several reasons.\n  The bill before us is neither workable nor realistic. Additionally, \nmany Senators do not even know what is in the latest version of the \nbill.\n  It is also pretty clear to this Senator that anything similar to S. \n1639 is dead on arrival in the House of Representatives. I question the \nrationale of passing a bill that has so many flaws when several Members \nof the House have said this bill will not even be considered by the \nHouse. Would it not be better for all of us to have a more open and \nfair debate on border security and immigration that is not subjected to \nunnecessary deadlines and closed-door decisionmaking?\n  In addition, as a border State Senator, I know first-hand the need to \nsecure our borders because every day my constituents tell me about the \nproblems they face because of illegal entries into our country. We have \na crisis on our borders that must be resolved.\n  However, instead of pursuing immediate emergency funding to help \nsecure our border, S. 1639 cobbles border security improvements and \nfunding with some concerning immigration reforms. While the bill also \nprovided $4.4 billion to fund these border security initiatives, that \nmoney was contingent upon final passage of the bill by Congress, \nsomething that appears to be less than a sure thing.\n  What is clear to me is that the American people want the measures in \nthe bill--like providing 20,000 Border Patrol agents, constructing 370 \nmiles of border fencing and 300 miles of border vehicle barriers, \nputting 105 radar and camera towers on the border, and using four \nunmanned aerial vehicles for border security--in place before we \naddress the millions of unauthorized aliens living and working in the \nUnited States. Therefore, I believe it would be more appropriate to \nprovide $4.4 billion in border security funding in a separate emergency \nspending bill to fund these border security initiatives.\n  Additionally, I remain concerned about the amendment process \nassociated with this bill. More than 300 amendments were filed to this \nbill's predecessor, S. 1348, and almost 150 amendments have been filed \nto S. 1639. However, we were only allowed to consider 26 amendments to \nS. 1639. Border security and immigration reform are the most important \ndomestic issues facing the United States today. Clearly the Senate, the \nmost deliberative body in the world, should be allowed to consider \nadditional amendments that could improve upon this bill. While one of \nmy amendments is part of the package of amendments that was allowed to \nbe considered to this bill, I had other good ideas to make this bill \nbetter for New Mexico, the southwest border, and the United States. \nMany of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle did too, and we \ndeserve an opportunity to consider those amendments.\n  Also, some of the provisions that I initially supported in this bill \nhave been amended to the point that the bill no longer has its initial \npurposes. For example, the temporary worker program that is critical to \nso many industries in my State does not meet those industries' needs.\n  Further, I am concerned by statements by members of the bipartisan \nborder and immigration working group that some issues of concern in S. \n1639 will be resolved in conference. The Senate should debate the \nissues of concern in this bill; we should not rely on a small group of \nour colleagues to resolve those issues in an unamendable conference \nreport.\n  Lastly, I have been told that this bill would have an interesting and \nunintended effect in my home State of New Mexico. As I understand it, \nNew Mexico State law would allow all Z visa holders under this bill to \nqualify for Medicaid. That matter needs to be reviewed and its impacts \nfully considered so that the Congress can avoid unintended effects of \nthis bill.\n  For all of these reasons, I decided to vote no on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on S. 1639. We need improved border security and \nimmigration reform.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last night there was a vote on a critical \namendment to the immigration bill, Senator Baucus' proposal to strip \nany reference to REAL ID in the underlying bill. This, truly, is a case \nof addition by subtraction.\n  REAL ID--astronomically expensive, personally intrusive, \ncontroversial, and unrealistic, passed by the last Congress without \nreal scrutiny--is precisely the kind of impractical trigger that could \nderail comprehensive immigration reform.\n  Unless we amend this bill, real reform will have to wait for REAL ID. \nConsider the groups lined up against it: not just the ACLU, but also \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures, and the National \nGovernors Association. Since REAL ID passed in the last Congress, 16 \nStates have enacted anti-Real ID bills or resolutions. Another 22 \nStates, including my own, have anti-Real ID bills and resolutions \npending in their State legislatures.\n  Why are they so opposed to REAL ID? They are opposed because it sets \nan unreachable standard and offers States almost no financial help in \nmeeting it. Conservative estimates State that it would cost $23 billion \nto fully implement REAL ID. This legislation only authorizes $1.5 \nbillion for States and the President didn't ask for a single dollar for \nREAL ID in his budget request. That means that States would have to \nshoulder a $21 billion burden. That is an enormous unfunded mandate.\n  This crushing financial burden on States is bad enough--but REAL ID \nposes a security risk as well. Its requirements expose people's \npersonal data to theft by creating a massive pool of highly sensitive \npersonal information such as Social Security numbers, birth \ncertificates and driving information.\n  Even if States could pay for this new program it would require a \ntremendous amount of personnel and work to get this done. The \nMassachusetts DMV has estimated it would take 10 years to reenroll \ncurrent citizens with licenses alone, which would place them beyond the \n2013 deadline in the bill.\n  REAL ID is profoundly flawed--That is why six States have passed laws \nthat prohibit it from being implemented at\n\n[[Page S8661]]\n\nall. These States will never be REAL ID compliant and that is why its \ninclusion in the immigration bill is so dangerous.\n  Immigration reform is difficult enough without conditioning it on an \nunfeasible, unfunded mandate that States are not only unwilling but in \nsome cases legally bound not to meet. Squaring that circle should not \nbe a precondition for a much larger need: providing real immigration \nreform for the American people.\n  I am proud to have supported the Baucus-Tester amendment to remove \nthis dangerous and nonsensical provision from the underlying bill. I \nhope that we will be able to move forward and create a fair, reasonable \nand comprehensive immigration bill that this country so desperately \nneeds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our immigration system is broken and needs \nreform. Undocumented immigrants flow through our porous borders. \nEmployers hire them with near impunity. Our Government lacks the \nability to adequately detect unauthorized employment, while employers \nin sectors such as agriculture, Michigan's second largest industry, \nfear that their crops will go unpicked for lack of legal, authorized \nworkers. The bipartisan compromise bill before the Senate was an \nopportunity to make progress on a very difficult problem.\n  The first step in immigration reform must be stronger border \nsecurity. Although there were some provisions in the bill before the \nSenate that I did not support, this legislation had strong border \nsecurity measures, even stronger than the ones we debated a few weeks \nago. In fact, it contained the funding for the enhanced border \nsecurity.\n  We need a more secure, more sensible, and fairer system of \nimmigration. Because of filibusters in the Senate we have been unable \nto fully consider and amend the bill. We do not know what the final \nlanguage might have been, and we were unable to vote on amendments \nwhich we favored. We should have finished the consideration of those \namendments to determine whether or not the final product was an \nimprovement on the status quo. To do that, cloture was required to end \nthe filibuster. I am disappointed that the Senate was thwarted in that \nendeavor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I opposed S. 1639, the immigration reform \nbill, and the motion to invoke cloture on this flawed piece of \nlegislation.\n  Our immigration system is complicated. Our borders remain open. We \ncannot have immigration reform without strengthening the security of \nour borders. This unsound bill circumvented our Senate process and \nattempted to buy off support by throwing in carrots for Senators in \nexchange for their support.\n  The American people understand what is going on here in the Senate \ndebate and they understand what cloture means. They are flooding our \noffices in Washington, DC, and our offices in our home States with \ncalls and e-mails so much so that our phone system cannot keep up. The \npeople of Wyoming have made it clear to me that they do not support \nthis legislation. They want something to be done to address our \nborders, but do not support the blanket amnesty of this bill.\n  The current situation of an open border and an overly complex hiring \nprocess encourages illegal immigration and the hiring of illegal \nworkers. Once we improve these situations, we can determine what steps \nmay be necessary for addressing the illegal immigrant population.\n  We should not, however, even be considering amnesty. Amnesty \nencourages illegal immigration. In 1986, 7 million immigrants were \ngranted amnesty. Today we are facing an illegal population of over 12 \nmillion. The 1986 amnesty did not stop illegal immigration. We should \nnot repeat this policy without ensuring that we are not making the same \nmistake.\n  This is a complicated issue that will directly impact businesses \nacross the United States. Improvements are needed in employer \nverification processes, but those improvements cannot be made in \nlegislation forced through the Senate by vote trading. People who break \nlaws should be held accountable for their actions. This means better \nenforcement of our current laws, both on the border and by employers. \nEmployers must be given the tools to verify legal workers and be held \naccountable when they knowingly hire illegal immigrants.\n  We in the U.S. Senate still have the opportunity to do some good. We \ncan go back to our committee process and draft legislation that could \nhelp our Border Patrol do their jobs. We can put together an employee \nverification system that actually works and does not run small \nbusinesses out of business through fines. There could be a lot of \nsolutions for securing our border and making sure that people who are \nhired are legal immigrants. We can improve the way that temporary \nseasonal worker visas and agricultural worker visas are processed.\n  Rewarding bad behavior only encourages more bad behavior. We will not \nencourage more bad legislative behavior by going forward with this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of my vote against \ncloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1639, the comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill. This issue continues to be a divisive one, \nboth in the halls of Congress and throughout our Nation. Indeed, many \npeople throughout the country have strongly held views when it comes to \nour Nation's immigration policy. In fact, over the past month, I have \nheard from countless Utahns who have contacted me with their views on \nimmigration reform. I expect that every Senator's office has been \noverwhelmed with calls, emails, and faxes from constituents expressing \ntheir concerns with various provisions of the bill.\n  While I commend the bipartisan panel of Senators that has worked \ntirelessly to negotiate this legislation, I must express my \ndisappointment in the manner in which the bill's proponents have sought \nto move this bill through the Senate.\n  I, for one, am supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and for \nmany of the approaches outlined in this bill. We simply cannot be asked \nto live with the status quo. However, once again, there are several \nhuge problems with this bill, and I believe that a more thorough \nvetting of this legislation through debate and amendment could have \nfixed those problems and ensured that it contained policy changes the \nAmerican people would support.\n  As many have observed throughout this debate, there are currently \nmillions of illegal immigrants residing within our Nation's borders. No \none knows exactly how many, only that they are here, they are working, \nand, in large part, they contribute to our economy.\n  We also have many businesses and industries that must have access to \nforeign labor, especially during this time when, while are seeing \nrecord lows in unemployment, we still have a shortage of workers.\n  Under the status quo, employers are too often forced to make a \ndecision between hiring illegal workers and wondering whether our \ninefficient and often arbitrary enforcement efforts will catch up with \nthem or abiding by the law and closing the doors of their businesses.\n  We need to find a fair, compassionate and lawful way to deal with the \nillegal immigrants already this country. We need to create a guest \nworker program for those businesses in need of foreign workers. And, we \nneed to improve the system by which we legally distribute visas and \ngreen cards to make it more fair and efficient.\n  The authors of this legislation have tried to address these issues in \nthe current bill, and I applaud them for their efforts. However, they \naddressed them in various ways that, in the minds of many, make this \nbill completely unworkable and ineffective. The policies proposed by \nlegislation are almost impossible to implement and even if they could \nbe implemented, there are so many loopholes and exclusions that almost \nevery solution in the bill can and will be bypassed by those who want \nto continue to exploit the system. I am convinced that many of my \ncolleagues understand these concerns and even agree with my assessment, \nbut they are so anxious to end this debate and reach a successful \nconclusion they compromised several core values that Americans hold \ndear and made damaging concessions.\n  The provisions of this bill were negotiated and vetted in secret. It \nwas then brought to the floor where the apparently shaky coalition that \ndrafted the\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\nlegislation have, throughout this process, voted as a block to prevent \nthe passage of any so-called ``deal-breaking'' amendments. At several \npoints during the debate, members of this coalition have admitted that \nthe amendments in question would, in their opinion, improve the overall \nbill. Yet, in an effort to preserve the coalition, they have worked \ntogether to prevent the passage of even some of the most reasonable, \ncommonsense amendments.\n  Then, after an initial attempt to end the debate failed, the majority \nleader agreed to let the debate go forward and to have votes on a \nnumber of amendments. Initially, this sounded good. However, it soon \nbecame clear that, in another effort preserve this shaky, flawed \ncompromise, the only amendments that would be voted on were those of \nthe majority leader's own choosing.\n  I don't believe that anyone should be criticized for their \nwillingness to compromise. Clearly, compromise is a vital part of what \nwe do in the Senate. However, we simply cannot value compromise for \ncompromise's own sake. Indeed, we should not push through such fatally \nflawed legislation simply because it is the product of compromise. \nCompromise--the means by which the Senate passes legislation that will \nbenefit our Nation--is not an end unto itself.\n  Yet, too many of my colleagues seem all too willing to simply push \nthis legislation through simply to preserve this great compromise. In \nfact, it almost appears as if some would consider our efforts \nsuccessful if we were simply able to bring this bill to passage, \nregardless of what the bill looked like and regardless of what its \neffect would be on our immigration system. However, I believe that if \nwe were to follow this course, we would be wasting an opportunity to \nprovide real reforms to our Nation's immigration policy and to provide \nreal solutions for our Nation's many immigration problems.\n  It is not a novel idea to suggest that there was a better way to \napproach this problem. That way, Mr. President, was the process by \nwhich we approach all issues of this magnitude. This bill was brought \nto the floor without having gone through the committee process. This is \nnever a good sign for any piece of legislation. Whenever you bypass the \nregular order of the Senate, there will undoubtedly be a significant \nportion of our constituents who feel as if their views don't count. The \nSenate has used and maintained the committee structure for over 200 \nyears, and it has served the American people well. In this case, \nrefusing to use the time-tested committee structure has been a recipe \nfor disaster.\n  The decision to bring this bill directly the floor robbed many \nSenators of an opportunity to examine the bill thoroughly and publicly \nexpress their concerns. In addition, it made certain that the bill \nwould come before the entire Senate without the benefit of Committee \nhearings, expert testimony, and a public markup.\n  Strangely enough, this is the precise criticism meted out by the \nDemocrats when they were in the minority last Congress. Now that \ncontrol of the Senate has changed hands, it seems the Democrat \nrequirement for regular order is not necessary anymore.\n  Mr. President, we have been told that this is our last chance to pass \nimmigration reform for several years. I disagree. Once again, there \nwere other approaches that could have been taken to pass this \nlegislation, and these options remain available. In addition, there are \nmany areas of agreement when it comes to immigration. Therefore, I \nbelieve that we can find a way to address our immigration problems that \nwill satisfy the American people.\n  But, to do that, we need a process that is fair and open. The process \nwe have followed in this case has been too limiting and, as a result, \nwe have a bill that the vast majority of Americans will not support. \nThat being the case, I oppose this effort to end debate and to push \nthis bill through.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8662-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8662-S8666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL DOUGLAS E. LUTE TO BE ASSISTANT TO THE \nPRESIDENT AND DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER FOR IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 165, the \nnomination of LTG Douglas Lute; that the time until 3 o'clock be for \ndebate on the nomination, equally divided between myself and Senator \nWarner or his designee; that at the conclusion or yielding back of \ntime, the nomination be laid aside and the Senate return to legislative \nsession in morning business; and that at 4 p.m., the Senate return to \nexecutive session and the vote on confirmation of the nomination of \nLieutenant General Lute.\n  I also am hopeful that there will be some votes on judicial nominees \nas well today, but that has not yet been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Douglas E. \nLute, Department of Defense, Army, to be Lieutenant General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  I support the nomination of LTG Doug Lute to be Assistant to the \nPresident and Deputy National Security Adviser for Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Lieutenant General Lute is an accomplished senior officer with a \ndistinguished record and great experience in both military tactics and \nnational security strategy and policy. Lieutenant General Lute has been \nserving as the Director of Operations, J-3, on the Joint Staff since \nSeptember of 2006. Immediately prior to this assignment, he served for \nmore than 2 years as the Director of Operations, J-3, at U.S. Central \nCommand, overseeing combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and other \noperations in the CENTCOM area of responsibility.\n  While I know of no concerns as to General Lute's qualifications for \nthe position to which he has been nominated by the President, there \nhave been some other concerns expressed about this nomination. The \nfirst concern questions the need for the position itself as well as the \npotential for confusion as to who is responsible for Iraq and \nAfghanistan policy. On the one hand, the position implies a direct and \nindependent relationship with the President as Assistant to the \nPresident, and on the other hand, as Deputy National Security Adviser \nfor Iraq and Afghanistan, the position implies subordination to the \nNational Security Adviser.\n  One can argue that the responsibility for Iraq and Afghanistan policy \nclearly belongs to the National Security Adviser, as well as the \nresponsibility for directly advising the President on those issues. \nCreating a position with ambiguous subordination to the National \nSecurity Adviser could needlessly complicate and confuse an already \nconfused policy process. I, too, have some concerns in this regard but \nnot to the extent that I will oppose the President's decision to create \nsuch a position.\n  The other concern which has been expressed is that appointing an \nActive-Duty military officer to such a political position is a practice \nwhich should be avoided in that for the officer in question, it \nneedlessly blurs the distinction between recommendations he might make \nbased on unbiased professional military judgment and those based upon \nor colored by political considerations. In a larger sense, it is \ncounter to the traditional American approach to civil-military \nrelations. For the individual officer, it may also create difficulties \nin subsequently returning from a political position to a uniformed, \napolitical, military position. I emphasize that General Lute will \nremain on active duty during this period.\n\n  However, this would not be the first time that uniformed military \nofficers, remaining on active duty, have served\n\n[[Page S8663]]\n\nin such positions, one of the most notable examples being Colin \nPowell's own service as, first, the deputy National Security Adviser, \nand then as the National Security Adviser, and subsequent outstanding \nservice as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. While I don't believe \nit should be the norm for a military officer to serve in these kinds of \npositions, I do not believe this should be a disqualifying concern in \nrare circumstances such as this, and therefore should not disqualify \nGeneral Lute from his nominated position.\n  I do believe, however, that General Lute has been nominated for an \nunenviable position. He will be responsible for bringing coherence to \nan incoherent policy--a policy that is still floundering after more \nthan 4 years of war in Iraq.\n  General Lute told the Armed Services Committee that ``the position is \nan advisor and coordinator, without directive authority beyond a small \nstaff.'' He further said that the ability to move policy forward had to \ndo more with such factors as ``Presidential direction and support, \nacceptance by other policy principals, broad commitment to a common \ncause, cultivated interpersonal relationships, personal integrity, and \nmeaningful results.''\n  Secretary Rice, described as a close personal friend of the \nPresident--indeed almost a family member--was either not able to get \nthat Presidential direction and support or not able to employ it to \nbring coherence to the President's policy. One must wonder how General \nLute can be expected to be more successful.\n  It is no secret that several retired four-star general officers were \noffered the position and turned it down. According to media reports, \none reason given by one of the generals was that the administration \nremains fundamentally divided on how to carry out the conflicts in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Retired Marine GEN Jack Sheehan, who declined to be \nconsidered for the position, said:\n\n       The very fundamental issue is, they [the administration] \n     don't know where the hell they're going.\n\n  General Sheehan reportedly expressed concern that the hawks within \nthe administration, including Vice President Cheney, remain more \npowerful than the pragmatists looking for an exit strategy in Iraq. \nThis does not bode well for General Lute.\n  It is no secret that General Lute himself questioned the so-called \nsurge strategy for Iraq before its announcement by President Bush last \nJanuary. Indeed, General Lute confirmed that doubt at his hearing.\n  The surge is now complete, and the results are not very promising. \nAmerican casualties are at some of the highest levels of the war, \nsectarian violence is rising again after a short reduction, and the \ninsurgency is as active as ever, especially in the use of mass \ncasualty-producing car bombs against Iraqi citizens and improvised \nexplosive devices against United States and Iraqi forces.\n  The stated principal purpose of the surge was to give space and time \nfor the Iraqi politicians to make progress on the critically important \npolitical reconciliation benchmarks, such as implementing legislation \nfor the equitable distribution of revenues from oil sales, de-\nBaathification, and constitutional amendments, that would lead to \nreconciliation among the three main Iraqi groups. Progress is not \napparent in those critically important political reconciliation areas--\nagain, the stated purpose of the surge.\n  I believe the only chance to get Iraqi politicians to stand up is \nwhen they know we are going to begin to stand down. Our soldiers risk \ntheir lives while Iraqi politicians refuse to take political risks and \nmake the necessary compromises to promote reconciliation. Those are the \ncompromises which everybody agrees must be made if there is going to be \nany hope to end the violence in Iraq. We cannot continue to have the \nlives of American servicemembers held hostage to Iraqi political \nintrigue and intransigence.\n  I hope once General Lute is confirmed, he will be willing and able to \nredirect Iraq policy to exert maximum pressure on Iraqi leaders to \nachieve political reconciliation. The beginning of that is a phased \nredeployment of United States troops from Iraq. That is the only \nleverage on those leaders with any hope of success, with them finally \nunderstanding that their future is in their hands and we cannot save \nthem from themselves.\n  But as for today's nomination, I support the confirmation of LTG \nDouglas Lute to be the special assistant to the President and the \nDeputy National Security Adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I note with great respect and approval the \nSenator's comments to support his nomination. The Senator and I have \ndiscussed this nomination, and I strongly endorse the President's \nnomination of General Lute and welcome the support of our distinguished \nchairman of the committee.\n  The Senator made reference to General Sheehan and others who \napparently had some contact with the White House personnel, and others, \nregarding possibly taking on this assignment. In no way can I believe \ntheir comments should be held against the distinguished nomination of \nGeneral Lute. They are part of the public records, but I think \nsometimes when the President speaks with individuals about the \npossibility of serving him, those matters are best left confidential--\nfor any President. I certainly treat them that way. I was somewhat \ntaken aback by the judgments of General Sheehan and others. No \ndisrespect to the chairman, but they are of no significance here.\n  This is a highly distinguished officer. He fought in the second \narmored cavalry regiment in Operation Desert Storm. He later commanded \nthe second armored cavalry regiment in 1998 to 2000, and the \nmultinational brigade east in Kosovo in 2002. In 2003, he was assigned \nas deputy director of operations in headquarters European command and, \nin that capacity, played an important role in responding to the \nimpending humanitarian crisis in Liberia. It was in that context that I \nfirst met this distinguished officer.\n  General Jones was, at that time, NATO commander. I talked with him \nabout the problems we were experiencing over the African coast at that \ntime. As you may recall, elements of the Marine Corps and other Naval \nunits were sent down there to try to--and indeed they did--succeed in \ncontributing to a cessation of a lot of the tensions which could have \nerupted into a civil war.\n  At that time, General Lute was director of operations for the U.S. \nCentral Command, where he served over 2 years. I was privileged to join \nhim off the coast aboard those naval vessels, and he accompanied me \nwhen I went in and worked with the Ambassador in the incipient days of \nthat potential conflict.\n  As a key member of the joint staff, I visited him many times in the \nDepartment of Defense and received excellent briefings from him about \nthe worldwide situation. I have witnessed firsthand the extraordinary, \nprofessional capabilities of this fine officer.\n  In the estimation of GEN David Petraeus:\n\n       Doug Lute knows Iraq. Doug Lute knows Iraq, the region, and \n     in Washington will be a great addition to the team that is \n     striving to achieve success in Iraq. He is also a doer.\n\n  Ambassador Crocker added:\n\n       General Lute's knowledge and experience will make him a \n     valuable partner to our efforts in Iraq. I look forward to \n     working closely with General Lute in the coming months.\n\n  There has also been some indication that people are concerned about \nthe precedents connected with this assignment. I will put into the \nRecord a list of individuals who have served Presidents in this \ncapacity over the past years. Notably among them were General Haig, \nmilitary assistant to the President for national security affairs; \nLieutenant General Scowcroft; Admiral Poindexter; GEN Colin Powell; \nGeneral Kerrick; GEN Michael Hayden, Director of Central Intelligence \nat the present time and on active duty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8664]]\n\n\n\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 Rank/Name                                 Position                    From             To\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGEN Alexander Haig.........................

I would also put this into the Record at this point. I \nsolicited the White House's views regarding any legalities of this \nnomination. I have the letter of Mr. Fielding, counsel to the \nPresident. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2007.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: This is in response to your inquiry as \n     to the constitutionality of the President of the United \n     States appointing an active duty military officer to serve in \n     the White House Office as Deputy National Security Advisor to \n     the President and Assistant to the President.\n       There is no constitutional issue arising by virtue of such \n     service. All military officers are part of the Executive \n     Branch of our government, and there is no break in their \n     chain of command, as the President's constitutional duties \n     include his role as Commander-in-Chief of the United States \n     Armed Forces. Likewise, such an appointment is consistent \n     with U.S. law. See 10 U.S.C. Sec. 601.\n       As you are aware, in the past our Nation has been served by \n     active duty military officers holding the same position; to \n     wit: General Brent Scrowcroft, Admiral John Poindexter, \n     General Colin Powell, General Donald Kerrick.\n       Thank you for your inquiry. I am pleased to be able to \n     respond.\n       With best regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Fred F. Fielding,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I feel that this gentleman, General Lute, \nis eminently qualified, as the President has indicated. It is the \npersonal prerogative of the President to select those who wish to \nadvise him in a confidential vein. General Lute will undertake that \nwith great distinction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators from Virginia and Michigan \ncontrol the time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will somebody yield me some time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nAlabama wishes to take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 7\\1/2\\ minutes. \nThe Senator from Virginia has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask to be notified after 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think Senator Levin and Senator Warner \nhave pointed out the fact that this is not an unprecedented appointment \nand that it is consistent with what has been done before. People have \ntheir own ideas about how the chain of command should work, but that is \nfundamentally the question to be answered.\n  Let me join with Senator Warner in saying how much I admire the \nrecord of General Lute. He is a three-star general. He was a director \nof operations at the operational section of Central Command for 2 \nyears. He is intimately familiar with the Middle East. He has \ndemonstrated in his positions with the Department of Defense in recent \nyears with the joint staff his willingness to question ideas that many \nconsider popular. In fact, it is reported that he asked a lot of tough \nquestions about the surge, and how that would go, and how it should be \nhandled if done. I think, if anything, we know for sure that he will do \nwhat he believes is in America's interests.\n  Let me tell you why I truly believe we need a position such as this \nand a man like General Lute. We have about 170,000-plus soldiers in \nIraq and Afghanistan. They are serving us in a dangerous area of the \nworld. We know and have had so many colleagues say--and Senator Levin \nis most articulate in saying this--it is more than just the military; \nthere is a political settlement, there is reconstruction, there are \neconomic issues involved, oil and gas, water, electricity, which are \nall key components of having a government effective in Iraq that serves \nthe people of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  This is important. The problem is we have all our agencies involved \nin Iraq, not just the military. We have the State Department involved \nin Iraq. The State Department is the one responsible for trying to move \nthe Government along in an effective way. They also have responsibility \nover the economy, trying to help Iraq have a good economy. They are \nresponsible for trying to negotiate safety agreements with its \nneighbors. They are responsible for infrastructure, actually. They are \nnot responsible for law and order, the court system, and the prison \nsystem, which has not gone well at all. I have been a major critic of \nthat situation. That is under the responsibility, not of the Department \nof Defense but the Department of Justice. If your court system is not \nworking, if you don't have an adequate jail system, if you can't get \nthe water turned on or the electricity turned on, our soldiers are at \nan increased risk to their safety.\n  So it is absolutely critical that all our agencies of Government work \ntogether, agree, work out differences, and create the greatest possible \nopportunity for those fabulous soldiers we have sent to be successful \nin helping to create a stable and decent government in Iraq. It is not \nat the level of cooperation we need. We have not gotten to that level.\n  I am telling my colleagues, I have seen it. The Department of Defense \nis here, the Department of Justice is here, the Department of State is \nhere. The Department of Defense--probably in frustration, I will say it \nthis way. I said we probably would have been better off just giving \neverything to the Department of Defense. They are pretty doggone \ncompetent in what they do. But the State Department has huge \nresponsibilities in Iraq. Therefore, the Defense Department steps back \nand they interface, but State has responsibilities, Justice has \nresponsibilities, and Interior has responsibilities in Iraq. Virtually \nevery department and agency does. They are not at the highest level of \neffectiveness, in my view.\n  It is not as important, I have to say, for Justice to get a court \nsystem up and running as it is for the Defense Department because it is \ntheir soldiers at risk if we don't create a good justice system in \nIraq.\n  I thought we needed somebody such as General Lute to go into Iraq, go \ninto Afghanistan, and find out what is going on and be able to tell the \nPresident where the problems are. When there is a dispute between \nagencies, one person can fix it, and that is the President of the \nUnited States. He can say: I want it done this way or your resignation \ntomorrow, Mr. Secretary. Or you and I have had a long friendship over \nthe years. I want this done, you don't want it done. I will get \nsomebody who will get it done.\n  But how can he know all these different problems that are occurring? \nHow can he personally be on top of it? Likewise for the Secretary of \nState. She is expected to be in China, to go to Brazil, Chile, \nIndonesia, Europe, Kosovo, South Korea, or Japan. The National Security \nAdviser has the whole world under his responsibility. He has to be \nmanaging all these issues\n\n[[Page S8665]]\n\nand personally advising the President. The Secretary of State has to \nmanage all the bureaucracy contained in the State Department.\n  I guess what I would say to my colleagues, it is obvious to me the \nNational Security Adviser cannot drop all of his or her \nresponsibilities and spend his or her time negotiating problems in \nIraq. The President is going to have to designate somebody to do that. \nHe has chosen General Lute who is a man, by all accounts, of \nextraordinary ability, proven experience in the region, a person who \nknows the difficulties so he can carefully and with good judgment \nanalyze the different disputes and try to get them settled so we can \nget on with producing more oil and gas, having water for the citizens, \nhaving the sewage system working, having the electricity on, and \nhelping to make sure we have a legal system with sufficient bed spaces \nto detain criminals.\n  I discovered that we have one-ninth as many bed spaces in Iraq as we \ndo in my State of Alabama. I saw a similar story for New York. There \nare not enough places to put the criminals, and we have to increase \nthose places. The bureaucracy is sitting around and not getting that \ndone.\n  If we catch and release terrorists, they are going to go out and kill \nagain. There have been several articles that have picked up on this \nsituation. I have to say, it has been a theme of mine for 3 years now, \nand we still haven't gotten the justice system up like we would like \nit.\n  I see the Presiding Officer, a former attorney general in his State, \nSenator Salazar. We were together in Iraq and talked about these \nissues. I know he shares a genuine concern that things are not being \naccomplished as fast as possible. So I think that operating in the name \nof the President to try and find out what difficulties are occurring in \nIraq, where the bottlenecks are, and being able to get the parties \ntogether in the name of the President--he has no direct authority to \norder the Department of Justice or the Department of Defense to do \nanything. But he has the authority given by the President. If they \ncan't agree, he can appeal to the President. He can say: Mr. President, \nthe Department of State wants to do this, the Department of Justice \nwants to do this, the Department of Defense wants to do this. My \nrecommendation is to do this, but you need to make this decision. Then \nthe President can help eliminate these problems.\n  The truth is, when somebody such as General Lute says we have a \ndisagreement between State and Justice and I am inclined to say this is \nthe way it ought to be settled, but the President told me, when I call \nhim tomorrow, to let me know if there are any difficulties, I am going \nto tell him that you two children cannot agree, usually they get \ntogether and settle it. They don't want to have the President come in \nand settle these disputes and get involved. They know he has a lot of \nissues on his plate.\n  That is the concept that I think can be helpful in making us more \neffective in creating the infrastructure, the civil justice system in \nIraq and Afghanistan, thereby enhancing the ability of those \ngovernments in those countries to be successful, therefore enhancing \ntheir ability to be effective against terrorists and violence, \ntherefore reducing the threat to our soldiers--that is the bottom \nline--and increasing their ability to be successful.\n  I am pleased to support this nomination. I think all the serious \nquestions that have been raised have been answered.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Virginia. He raises a good point \nabout this matter of a uniformed person being in the executive branch, \nthe political branch, I guess one can call it. We have done it before \nand, in this case, in my view, that concern, while a legitimate one, I \nbelieve is outweighed by the fact that we need help right now and \nGeneral Lute is the guy who can do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the 6\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Virginia. If he needs additional time, I ask unanimous consent \nthat he be given additional time, after the 6\\1/2\\ minutes. We will \nwait and see if that is the case.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I will do my best to finish within 6 \nminutes. I appreciate the chairman asking me to come to the floor.\n  This issue came up fairly quickly because of the vote this morning. I \nwas not able to be here when my friend and colleague, the senior \nSenator from Virginia, made his comments, but he did give me the letter \nthat had been provided to him by the counsel to the President which \naddresses the issue of the constitutionality of a uniformed officer \nserving as a direct policy adviser inside the administration.\n  Counsel Fielding points out in the letter that there is no \nconstitutional issue. He mentions Generals Scowcroft, Powell, Kerrick, \nand Admiral Poindexter as recent examples of active-duty military \nofficers holding this type of position.\n  I would have risen in opposition to all of these other individuals \nunder the circumstances that exist today, and I am going to try to \nclarify that.\n  I don't expect the opposition I have to General Lute's nomination is \ngoing to preclude him from being confirmed. I don't want the record to \nindicate that I have any question with respect to his competence, the \nway he has served the country over the past 30 years or so, but I do \nbelieve this is a very important issue, and it goes beyond the opinion \nthat was in Counsel Fielding's letter.\n  He addresses the direct constitutionality because the military is a \npart of the executive branch. My difficulty is that the military must \nin this country remain separate from politics. That doesn't mean the \nPresident cannot bring an active-duty military person on to his staff. \nAs Senator Warner said in another meeting, the President has the \nauthority to bring anyone of value to his administration he wants. The \nquestion becomes: Should that individual remain in uniform? And should \nthat individual be able to return to the active-duty military once his \nservice is done?\n  I asked General Lute during his confirmation hearings if he believed \nthat the advice he would be giving in this position would be political \nin nature, and it unavoidably is.\n  So we have a situation that is recent history. This type of situation \ndoes not go back long in American history where we have brought active-\nduty military people inside the political circle of an administration \nand then allowed them to return as active-duty members back to the \nmilitary. This has not happened with any frequency, other than in the \npast 20 years or so.\n  That individual returning to the military in a uniform unavoidably \ncauses questions inside the military about political alignments and \ntends to politicize the military. That is my problem. There is no way \nGeneral Lute can go to the morning meetings and give advice that is not \nsimply operational, but that is political in nature with respect to how \nan administration puts a policy into place, and then can return to the \nactive-duty military and be viewed as politically neutral. I say that \nagain with respect to the other individuals who were named in Fred \nFielding's letter.\n  It is my intention, during the time I am in the Senate, to ask any \nmilitary officer who is being put into a position of political \nsensitivity whether that individual intends to take the uniform off and \nkeep it off. Any individual who otherwise is qualified who intends to \nreturn to the active-duty military service, in my opinion, is violating \nthis very sensitive line with respect to the politicization of the \nmilitary, and I intend to oppose those nominations.\n  I thank the chairman for this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in keeping with my practice of deferring \nto Presidents when it comes to executive branch nominations, I voted to \nconfirm LTG Douglas Lute to serve as Assistant to the President and \nDeputy National Security Adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan. He is a \ncompetent officer with a history of service to this Nation. However, I \nam deeply concerned that rather than changing course in Iraq, the \nPresident is merely rearranging the bureaucracy in the White House.\n  The administration needs to better coordinate the U.S. Government's \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am\n\n[[Page S8666]]\n\npleased that Lieutenant General Lute has acknowledged that the U.S. \nmilitary alone cannot stabilize Iraq and that enhanced efforts by other \nagencies of the Federal Government are needed.\n  However, I am skeptical that this new position will have a \nsignificant impact given that the President still refuses to admit that \nthere is no military solution to the situation in Iraq. Until the \nPresident recognizes the need to redeploy our troops from Iraq and seek \ninternational assistance in promoting a political resolution, I am \nafraid that Lieutenant General Lute's efforts will simply contribute to \nmore of the same failed policy. I will continue working to redeploy our \ntroops from Iraq so that we can devote greater resources to our top \nnational security priority--going after the terrorists who attacked us \non 9/11 and their allies.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am voting present on the nomination of \nDouglas E. Lute to be Special Assistant to the President and Deputy \nNational Security Adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Although I respect General Lute's distinguished 30-plus year career \nin the U.S. Army, I view this position as rearranging the bureaucracy \nat the White House. The creation of a ``war czar'' will not hide the \nPresident's failed policies and is another way for him to duck \nresponsibility for the war in Iraq.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on May 15, 2007, President Bush nominated \nLTG Douglas Lute as Assistant to the President and Deputy National \nSecurity Adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan. In that position, Lieutenant \nGeneral Lute is to be charged with coordinating the efforts of the \nexecutive branch to support our commanders and senior diplomats on the \nground in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I am voting against the nomination of LTG Douglas Lute, not because \nhe is unqualified for the position but because the White House refuses \nto permit him to testify before those Members of Congress responsible \nfor the oversight and funding of these conflicts. Article 2, section II \nof the Constitution makes it clear that the power to appoint certain \nofficers involves the advice and consent of the Senate. I can imagine \nno circumstance where the President may require policy advice and \nguidance from an Active Duty military officer regarding ongoing \nconflicts and issues relevant to Congress's oversight responsibilities \nto which Congress should not be equally capable of hearing in either \npublic or closed forums as appropriate. To do otherwise may raise \npopular suspicion that all is not on the ``up and up'' with the way the \nPresident is conducting this war.\n  I am also concerned that putting a general in this position will \nleave the military open to inferences by the administration that it is \nthe military, rather than George W. Bush, who is responsible for the \nfailed policies in Iraq. After 5 years of conflict in Afghanistan and \nIraq, the President, his Cabinet, and his existing staff should have \nlong ago figured out how to coordinate executive branch support to our \ncommanders and senior diplomats in the field, without needing to put a \nmilitary officer in charge of coordinating the civilian arms of \ngovernment.\n  Repeatedly, the President has appointed a new military officer to a \nleadership position and Congress has allowed the nomination to proceed \nwithout objection. The White House then turns the cooperation of \nCongress into yet another sound bite to prolong the prosecution of the \nPresident's failed policy. How many times have we heard that General \nPetraeus was confirmed unanimously and that we ``just need to give him \ntime''? The President has had 4\\1/2\\ years to show progress. Instead, \nthe situation continues to worsen in Iraq.\n  I, for one, will not vote to give the President another military \nofficer to blame or another unanimous vote to exploit to delay bringing \nhome our troops. I will not accept the President's claim that a \nmilitary officer advising the President on two ongoing conflicts should \nnot be required to testify before Congress on the progress of this long \nand disastrous war.\n  I will, therefore, vote against the confirmation of Lieutenant \nGeneral Lute to this position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining to Senator Warner.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, apparently I have a minute and a half \nremaining. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Alabama, if he \nwould like the time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if we are waiting for the vote, I was \ngoing to quote a few items from General Lute's statement, but otherwise \nI don't need to do that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The vote will begin at 4. Under the order, there is \nanother speaker scheduled at 3 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 3 o'clock the Senate will return to morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if Senator Levin is comfortable with \nthis, I ask for 3 minutes. If someone comes to the Chamber at 3 and \nneeds to take the floor, I will yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Alabama be yielded 3 minutes, and then morning business start at \n3:03 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we had a hearing with General Lute. \nSenator Levin presided in his able way, as always. He gave us a short \nwritten statement of some of his principles. I thought the American \npeople might appreciate how he approaches this issue.\n  He spoke to people. He said this about this position:\n\n       To a person, those with whom I have spoken conveyed two \n     clear messages: first, a message of concern for the well-\n     being and safety of our men and women in harm's way; and \n     second, that we would all like to see us pursue a course \n     of action that makes our country safer while safeguarding \n     our national interests in the region. Surely, this is our \n     common ground.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       But the stakes for the United States are also high. This \n     region--where America has vital national interests--will not \n     succeed if Iraq and Afghanistan do not succeed, and the U.S. \n     plays a vital role in this cause.\n\n  He went on to say this:\n\n       No one is satisfied with the status quo: not the Iraqis, \n     not key regional partners, not the U.S. Government, and not \n     the American public. To change this, we are in the midst of \n     executing a shift in course as announced by the President in \n     January. Early results are mixed. Conditions on the ground \n     are deeply complex and are likely to continue to evolve--\n     meaning that we must constantly adapt. Often, measures that \n     fix one problem in as complex an environment as this reveal \n     challenges elsewhere.\n\n  That is certainly true. General Lute continued:\n\n       But one factor remains constant--the dedication and \n     sacrifice of our men and women, military and civilian, \n     serving in these combat zones. They are a continuing source \n     of inspiration to me and to my family.\n       The position for which I have been nominated is designed \n     for one fundamental purpose: to advise the President on how \n     to provide our troops and civilians in the field with \n     increased focused, full-time, real time, support here in \n     Washington.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The aim is to bring additional energy, discipline, and \n     sense of urgency to the process. Our troops deserve this \n     support.\n\n  I think that is a good statement, a sense of urgency for all our \nagencies and departments of Government, not just the military. He \nconcludes this way:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, I am a soldier; and our country is at war. It \n     is my privilege to serve. This position represents a major \n     personal challenge and I am humbled by the responsibility it \n     entails. If confirmed, I will give the President my \n     straightforward, candid, professional advice.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8666-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8666-S8667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Warner asked earlier today what \nwould happen with the next judge, which is a Virginia judge. It would \nbe my intent--I have to talk to Senator Leahy, and I have a meeting \nwith him this afternoon--that we do that on Monday, the day we get \nback. We will do the Virginia judge and the remaining district judges. \nSo there will be four votes on the Monday we get back on the district \ncourt judges.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if the leader will yield for a question, \nthose three additional judges you made reference to are the three \nMichigan district court judges?\n  Mr. REID. That is right. That is what we had left on the calendar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8667-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8667-S8670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2316\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 182, H.R. 2316, Lobbying Disclosure; that \nall after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of S. 1, as \npassed by the Senate on January 18, 2007, be inserted in lieu thereof; \nthat the bill be read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid on the table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate with a ratio of 4 to 3, with the above occurring without \nintervening action or debate.\n  I would say to my distinguished colleague--my counterpart, Senator \nMcConnell--that it is my intent not to appoint the conferees until we \nget back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving right to object, and I will not object, I \nwas not on the floor Tuesday when the majority leader first brought \nthis issue to the Senate floor. I was down at the White House. I am \npleased he is ready to go to conference on lobby reform, the first bill \nintroduced in this Congress, S. 1, and passed with a vote of 96 to 2 \nalmost 6 months ago, on January 18.\n  I am also encouraged the Democratic House finally decided to pass a \nbill after many months of stalling and excuses. However, before we \nagree to this unanimous consent request, I would like to engage my \ncolleague in a brief colloquy to ensure minority rights are not \ntrampled, as they were in the supplemental.\n  As the Senate will recall, the majority drafted that bill and \nincluded matters not related to troop funding and not part of either \nbill. This was designed, obviously, to get around 41 Republican \nSenators here in the Senate. Obviously, putting those items in a troop \nfunding bill made it very difficult to oppose the bill and we know how \nthat story ended.\n  In that vein, I ask my good friend, the majority leader, to commit \nthat, consistent with the provisions of S. 1--to commit not to drop \nextraneous provisions into this conference report not dealt with by \neither body. I think it is important that this very significant issue, \non which we have had extraordinary bipartisan cooperation, continue to \ndeal with the subject matter related to this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I don't wish to relegislate the \nsupplemental. I think it was one of the best things that has happened \nto the country in a long time. We were able to get some things in that \nbill, such as minimum wage, for the first time in 10 years; disaster \nrelief for farmers, first time in 3 years; the first time we got money \nover and above what the President wanted for homeland security; we were \nable to get $6.5 billion for Katrina.\n  Having said that, the distinguished Republican leader has my \nassurance this bill will deal with the subject matter that came out of \nthe Senate and out of the House. It will deal with ethics and lobbying \nreform.\n  I further say to my friend, and he and I have had long discussions on \nthis bill and I am sure we will continue to have some, this will be a \nreal conference, as we have had for many years--not recently, but this \nwill be a conference where there will be public debate on what we \nshould do and what we should not do.\n  We will schedule that the week we get back, schedule the conference \nas soon as we can when we appoint conferees. There has been a request \nwe not appoint them today. I accept that. We will do it when we get \nback. The minority need not worry. This legislation, when it comes \nback, will be perfect for the President to sign if, in fact, that is \nnecessary. In some instances, it is not necessary. But it will deal \nwith ethics and lobbying and nothing else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I have one phone call to my cloakroom \nI have to deal with. I respectfully request that we have a very short \nquorum call, so I can consult with one of my Members. If the majority \nleader will not object, I would like to have a very brief quorum call.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding there is a unanimous consent \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Is there objection to \nthe request?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Reserving the right to object, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, earlier this year, the Senate took a \nmajor step in being more transparent with the earmarking process. We \nworked together. We passed within the lobbying/ethics reform bill \ntransparency and rules that would keep us from adding secret earmarks \nwhen we go to conference. I have asked repeatedly on the Senate floor \nthat we accept that as a rule. I had asked the majority leader to amend \nhis unanimous consent request to go to conference to include Senate \nacceptance of the rules we have already passed. That way we would have \nthe comprehensive work we have all planned to have. I understand from \nthe majority leader they are not willing to accept that, and they want \nto go to conference where it is our belief it will be significantly \nchanged.\n  In light of our inability to come up with agreement that would \ninclude earmark disclosure, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Again, we have delay, delay, delay, on an issue of vital \nimportance. What we are asking is to go to conference. We have already \nacknowledged there will be nothing that will come out of conference \nother than what is in this bill. For us to do the conference out here \non the Senate floor is a little unusual proceeding. All the conference \ncommittees I have been involved in have been ones where the conferees \ndecide what should happen, and then they bring that matter back to the \nrespective bodies. Then there is a vote on it.\n  If my friend from South Carolina doesn't like what comes back, he has \nevery avenue within the rules at his disposal. No one is trying to take \nadvantage of him. I appreciate the work he has done on earmarks. A \nnumber of other people have worked on earmarks. It has been a \nprogressive step forward. But it would not say much about my leadership \nif we negotiated it out here\n\n[[Page S8668]]\n\non the floor of the Senate as to what was going to be in the conference \nreport. That is what the conferees are all about.\n  Again, we cannot go forward on the 47 different items that are in \nthis ethics and lobbying reform----\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. All of which are important. Earmarking is important to my \nfriend from South Carolina. Other Senators have other things of \nimportance in this lobbying/ethics reform. We debated this issue. We \ndebated it at some length. We accepted a lot of amendments. A number of \namendments were not in the final draft of what went to the House. They \nhave now completed their work. It is time we go to conference and work \nthis out. But we are not going to piecemeal this out here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the leader, and I appreciate his perseverance. I \nwould just like to ask why the part of this bill that applies only to \nthe Senate--it does not need to be conferenced with the House because \nit is our rule about how we deal with earmarks, how we deal with the \nconference of out-of-scope earmarks. Why can't we just accept that part \nhere and go to conference with all of these other provisions in which \nyou know our Members are interested?\n  I have no objection to going to conference, but there is no reason to \nconference with the House on rules that apply only to the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the House, of course, has issues that \naffect them only. Sometimes they affect what we do. So we can't do this \nin a vacuum. I have a suggestion. I think it is a valid, constructive \nsuggestion. I would say to my friend from South Carolina, what he \nshould do is see what he can do to get on the conference. That is what \nI would suggest. I would be happy to have you on the conference. I \ndon't select who the Republicans put on the conference, but that may be \nan answer to the problem. I would be happy to have you in the \nconference. I think it would be a good exercise for you to see what \ngoes on inside of a real conference.\n  Separate and apart from that, I have to simply say, this is, again, a \ndiversion, a distraction from doing the work of this country.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the majority leader if I understand \nwhat has happened here. We have adopted the language of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina in S. 1, 96 to 2. We sent it over to the House for \nconsideration. The Senator from South Carolina came to the floor while \nthe House was deliberating and insisted that we move forward. We said \nwe had to wait for House action, and House action has taken place, \nmoving us to a conference. Now the Senator from South Carolina is \nobjecting to going to a conference so that this could become the law of \nthe land and the rules applying to the Senate. Is that where we are \ntoday? The Republican Senate is objecting to going to conference on \nethics and lobbying reform?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Illinois has it down pat. We have worked \nwithin the confines of the rules that have been given us. We have \npassed a bill. They have passed one in the House. Now is the time to \nsee if we can make it into law.\n  There will be some things that will wind up being a Senate rule. Some \nthings will wind up being a House rule. That is part of what the \nconference is going to work out. No one is trying to detract from \nanything that the distinguished Senator from South Carolina wants. But \njust because you want something doesn't mean you are necessarily going \nto get it. I just think this is such a bad way to legislate. Here we \nwere within seconds of being able to go to conference. A phone call \ncame in to the cloakroom. I understand that. The Republican leader has \nan obligation to take care of his Members. But I think this is not a \ngood way to go.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. REID. The eyes of the American public are on us.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the majority leader, wasn't there a clear message \nfrom the last election that people wanted us to clean up the culture of \ncorruption in this town, that they wanted ethics and lobbying reform? \nIsn't that why the Democratic majority picked it as S. 1, the first \npiece of legislation we considered, made it a high priority, and passed \nit with a strong bipartisan vote? And isn't it a fact that because of \nthe objection from the Republican side of the aisle, we now run the \nrisk of having nothing, no change, no reform in lobbying or ethics, and \nthat the Senator from South Carolina has asked for you to guarantee a \nresult from a conference committee?\n\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate----\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, may I respond?\n  Mr. REID. For the first time in 131 years, someone was indicted \nworking in the White House. That man has now been convicted and is in \nprison. The President's appointee to handle Government contracting was \nled away in handcuffs from his office. He is now in prison. The \nmajority leader of the House of Representatives was convicted three \ntimes of ethics violations. He has now resigned in disgrace after \nhaving been indicted in Texas.\n  We have another Congressman, part of the whole Abramoff scandal, who \nis in prison. Many staff members have pled guilty to crimes, have quit. \nSome of them are giving State's evidence. The investigations are still \nongoing. A couple of days ago, Mr. Griles, second in command at the \nInterior Department, was sentenced to prison.\n  It is time that we got real and change this culture. That is what \nthis legislation is all about. It is time that we started doing things \nfor the American people. One of the things we can do is tell the \nAmerican people that we are distancing ourselves from this culture of \ncorruption.\n  That is what this legislation is all about. To not allow us to go to \nconference on some petty issue that my friend has raised is really bad, \nnot good for the American people. This is a bill loaded with good \nthings. We want to do some good things for the American people.\n  On some procedural suggestion that is not within the confines of \ncommon sense and good judgment, we have an objection. That is wrong. \nAll it does is focus more attention on the culture of corruption.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator allow a response?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair.\n  I am very surprised to hear earmark reform referred to as a trivial \nissue. More than anything else, the things that you were just talking \nabout, the corruption, are all earmark related, where Congressmen have \nsold earmarks for bribes. A big part of the corruption here is \nearmarks. To respond in a more detailed way, the House has passed its \nown rules package. It didn't relate to us. They did not send it to \nconference. They didn't need the Senate to advise. They adopted their \nown rules. We know, if I could speak through the Chair to Senator \nDurbin, that if we send this to conference, nothing will be done this \nyear. This conference will work for months. We will not have earmark \nreform during this year's appropriations process. That is exactly what \nthis is intended to do.\n  For that reason, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, again, \nthat the rules be discharged from further consideration and the Senate \nnow proceed to S. Res. 123 and S. Res. 260; that the resolution be \nagreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would assure my friend that I have \nspoken to the Speaker on more than one occasion. We have been trying to \nget to conference on this for quite some time now. They completed their \nwork. It has been about 3\\1/2\\ weeks. I believe without any stretch of \nthe imagination, we will finish this conference in a week. It might go \n10 days. But it will only be a question of scheduling. The conference \nwill go very quickly. It will be a public conference.\n  I would say to my friend--I say this respectfully--did you serve in \nthe House before you came here?\n\n[[Page S8669]]\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. REID. I thought so. So you are probably not familiar with \nconferences because under Republican leadership, they were eliminated. \nThere were no conferences. I have said we will hold public conferences. \nSo even though my friend is probably not familiar with a real \nconference, we will have one. It will not take all year. It will not \ntake all conference. We will finish it very quickly.\n  No one suggests that earmarking is trivial. I suggested that your \nobjection to this is trivial. I say that you shouldn't do this. It is \nwrong. It is only slowing up what you in your heart want. All you are \ndoing is slowing it up. There is no intent on my behalf to eliminate \nearmark reform. I think most everybody in this body lives by earmark \nreform. I think it would be very good that rather than some vacuous \nthing talking about earmarks, we have something here that we can look \nto that is either a part of a law or a rule. My friend should not worry \nabout this taking a long time. Once we get to conference, it will not \ntake long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I would like to address my comments to \nmy friend from South Carolina. The bottom line is very simple. We have \nconference committees to move things along, not to slow them down. My \ncolleague from South Carolina has concerns about earmarks. I understand \nthem. They are heartfelt. But it is clear that if we acceded to his \nrequest, any single Senator, because of any issue on any bill, could \nhold up progress completely--on ethics reform, on 9/11, on anything \nelse.\n  I will tell you my reading. I am from a different part of the country \nthan my colleague, but people want us to get some things done. They \ndon't want us to say: If I don't get it exactly my way on my provision, \nI am going to hold everything up. That is the consequence of what my \nfriend from South Carolina is saying.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I might feel that the worst part of what happened, the \nscandals we talked about, is the free trips. I might say: I don't want \nto trust anything to conference reports. Unless free trips are done \nexactly as we say here, I want to hold up the bill. One of my \ncolleagues might say that they think the worst thing is flying and the \nairplanes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will in a minute. We would be totally gridlocked. If \neach of us in this body of 100, each with strong opinions and great \ntalents, were to say: I am not going to let anything move forward \nunless I get my thing done, period, without change, without discussion, \nwithout modification, with the other body, we would be where the public \ndoesn't want us: gridlocked on ethics reform, gridlocked on 9/11, \ngridlocked on everything else.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator for the comment. You are exactly \nright. If this was just what I wanted, I would not hold up anything. \nThis is something you voted for. Every Senator voted for this earmark \nreform as a Senate rule, not as something we are going to debate with \nthe House but as our rule. All I am asking is that we adopt the rules \nfor the Senate that we have already passed. I do not want to hold up \nthis conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have a vote scheduled. I have just \nreceived word from the Appropriations Committee, bipartisan, they need \nanother 10 minutes. So I ask unanimous consent that they have 10 \nminutes; otherwise, I will just go into a quorum call.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. So the vote will take place at 10 after the hour.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, reclaiming my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I understand this passed by a whole lot \nof votes. That is not the point. There are lots of things that pass by \na lot of votes, and then they all have to be worked out in conference \ncommittees and in other ways. If each of us insists ``it is my way or I \nhold things up''--maybe there are ways to improve and strengthen the \nprovisions we pass; maybe there are things other people might add; \nmaybe there will be the kinds of legislative tradeoffs that will make a \nstronger ethics bill. We all have no way of knowing. But we do know one \nthing: If what the Senator from South Carolina is doing, by asserting \nhis prerogatives in the Senate, was done by everybody, or even five \nother Senators, we would absolutely have no ethics reform--no ethics \nreform--no ethics reform.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to my colleague from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I come from the House of \nRepresentatives, as my friend from New York and my friend from South \nCarolina. Over there, in that body, the Speaker decides how everything \nis going to go, whether the Speaker is a Republican or Democrat. Then \nsome people come over here from the House, and they decide they are \ngoing to use the rules of the Senate to call attention to what they \nthink is the issue of the day.\n  I want to thank my friend. My question to my friend is this: If you \nwent out and asked the average person on the street what they think \nabout the Congress and whether we need ethics reform and if we should \npass ethics reform, my friend, I think, would agree--and I will ask him \nthis--they would answer, yes.\n  Then, if you followed it up, I say to my friend, and said: Well, \nthere are one or two things missing from this bill; we took care of 12 \nthings, but it is tough because we have to work across party aisles. It \nis tough because everybody has his or her own idea. Do you think it is \ngood to get started with the package we have and get it done for the \nAmerican people?\n  What does my friend think the average person would say?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, the average person would say--because \nthe average American is practical--anyone who insists on only his way \nor her way is gumming up the works. To get 90 percent or 95 percent of \nwhat is a good package, most people would say, yes.\n  I will say another thing to my colleague.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, will my Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I will be happy to yield when I finish \nmy little colloquy with my friend from California.\n  My guess is, if you ask the person on the street what is the most \negregious abuse in terms of lobbyists and ethics, it is the trips. That \nis what caught the highlights. It was all the free gifts and all the \nemoluments and going to London and going here and going there. Most \npeople, if you asked them about earmarks, and they knew what the \nearmarks were--they would say the bridge from Alaska is a bad thing, \nand there are a few others that are a bad thing--but my guess is that \n95 percent of the people in this body--maybe 100 percent; maybe my \nfriend from South Carolina is proud of the earmarks they have put in \nand they should be made public early and there should be debate on \nthem--but they, in themselves, are not wrong as the free trips, in \nthemselves, are wrong.\n  So the bottom line is, if you ask the average citizen, my colleague \nfrom California is right, they would say: Move forward because there is \na lot in this bill that is important. In fact, the No. 1 abuse we read \nabout might have been trips or emoluments or something like that more \nthan earmarks.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator from New York yield for \na question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I am happy to yield to my colleague \nform Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, is the Senator aware that the bill just \nobjected to by the Republican Senator from South Carolina that we want \nto take to conference to make into law includes provisions that toughen \nthe rules concerning gifts and travel, banning gifts from registered \nlobbyists, requiring the market value be paid for tickets to events, \nprohibiting Senators from participating in events to honor them at a \nnational convention, extending the ban on travel paid for by lobbyists, \nrequiring Senators and staff to receive approval from the Ethics \nCommittee before accepting expenses for any trip paid for by private \nsources, requiring full disclosure of any travel on\n\n[[Page S8670]]\n\nnoncommercial airlines, requiring certifications and disclosures filed \nby Senators and staff available to the public for inspection?\n  Also, it includes slowing down the revolving door between Senators \nand staff, so those leaving the Senate are limited in the jobs they can \ntake; reducing and eliminating negotiations for another job by a \nsitting Senator in terms of where they might go when they leave the \nSenate; also, prohibiting staff contact with lobbyists who are family \nmembers of the Senator; also, voting to significantly expand lobbying \ndisclosure.\n  It goes on for lengthy paragraphs: voting to prohibit partisan \nefforts like the K Street Project, that notorious project involving \nlobbyists and Members of the Senate; voting to deny pensions to former \nMembers convicted of certain crimes; voting to protect the integrity of \nconference reports.\n  Does the Senator from New York not make this point, that when one \nSenator stands up and says: Well, I have one little section that I want \nto guarantee is going to be in the final conference report, that \nSenator is stopping us from considering all of these elements of ethics \nand lobbying reform, each of which points to some concern of Members of \nthe Senate where we want to change the ethics standards, clean up the \nculture of corruption?\n  So when the Republican Senator from South Carolina objects to going \nto conference, he stops us from considering any and all of the things I \njust read.\n  Is that the point the Senator from New York is making?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Illinois. \nThat is exactly the point I am making. I would say, the reason we have \na Senate, and not a body of one, is because there are different views. \nSome of the things that my colleague from Illinois read to me are the \nmost objectionable that are on the books now.\n\n  I would guess the public is probably closer to my view than the view \nof the Senator from South Carolina. I would guess what bothered them \nthe most with Abramoff, or with anything else, was all the trips and \nemoluments and the way the lobbyists sort of insinuated their way into \nthe whole process. There are hundreds of earmarks where there were no \nlobbyists involved. There were many more earmarks--most earmarks--where \nthe public debate would be supported by this body.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So I would say to my friend from Illinois that is \nexactly the point. If each of us insists that our little provision must \nbe passed on its own--no debate, no discussion, no moving forward with \nthe general process--we would have no ethics reform.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So despite the good intentions of my colleague from \nSouth Carolina, the effect of what he is doing is preventing good, \nstrong, tough ethics reform across the board on issues such as \nearmarks, but also on issues such as trips and the K Street Project, \nand everything else from moving forward.\n  So my colleague from Illinois makes a point that I think is----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I continue to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to ask my colleague from \nNew York, as to the notorious K Street Project, where lobbyists had \nregular meetings with Members of the Senate to discuss which \nlegislation would come up, which amendments would be considered, which \nprovisions in the Tax Code would be passed, and which would fail--all \nof these things are now prohibited under the bill that we want to send \nto conference. They do not relate directly to earmarks, which are \nappropriations measures, but everyone across America would concede \nthere were clear abuses when it came to this K Street Project.\n  So when the Republican Senator from South Carolina objects to taking \nthis bill to conference, he has gone beyond earmarks. He is not \nallowing us to consider the broader question about what we consider to \nbe unethical and illegal contacts between lobbyists and Members of the \nSenate. He is stopping us from passing new laws to bring some ethics \nreform to the Senate.\n  I ask the Senator from New York, the issue of earmarks was voted on \nwith an overwhelming vote in the Senate. The Appropriations Committee, \non which I serve, is moving forward with real earmarks reform. So it \nwould seem that the Senator from South Carolina is carping on a trifle \nhere. We have a huge number of important legislative items to consider \nin S. 1.\n  I ask the Senator from New York, in the time he has served in the \nHouse and the Senate, can he recall a time when a Senator or Member of \nCongress could receive a guarantee that a conference committee was \ngoing to produce exact language as each Member would like going into \nthe conference?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Well, Madam President, I have served in this body now \nfor 8 years. I had served in the House for 18 years. I cannot recall a \nsingle instance. We do have senses of the Senate; we had senses of the \nHouse, which are supposed to direct things. But we have never asked for \na guarantee. I, for one, cannot recall someone saying: I am holding up \neverything until I get my guarantee. That is wrong.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I will be happy to yield in a second.\n  I will tell you, I go to my State. It is a diverse State of 19 \nmillion people. It is not South Carolina. It is not Illinois. It is not \nNevada. It is not California. It is not Washington State. But I will \ntell you, the No. 1 thing I hear is: Can't you folks each give in a \nlittle bit? Can't you folks each work with one another and get \nsomething done?\n  That is what I hear. Yet the path my friend from South Carolina is \ntaking is exactly the opposite because we will get good earmark reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8670-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8670-S8672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL DOUGLAS E.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all votes be \n10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 10 minutes \nof debate preceding the votes.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we are going to have how many \nnominations?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam Presient, the Senate continues to make progress \ntoday with the confirmation of three more lifetime appointments to the \nFederal bench, Benjamin Hale Settle to the District Court for the \nWestern District of Washington, Richard Joseph Sullivan to the District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York, and Joseph S. Van Bokkelen \nto the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana. The \nnominations of Mr. Settle and Mr. Sullivan are for vacancies deemed by \nthe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to be judicial \nemergencies. All three nominees have the support of their home State \nSenators. I thank Senators Murray, Cantwell, Clinton, Schumer, Lugar, \nand Bayh for working with us and with the President on the nomination.\n  These 3 judges will bring this year's judicial confirmations total to \n21. It is before the Fourth of July recess, and we have already \nconfirmed many more judges than were confirmed during the entire 1996 \nsession when President Clinton's nominees were being reviewed by a \nRepublican Senate majority. That was the session in which not a single \ncircuit court nominee was confirmed. We have already confirmed three \ncircuit court judges in the early months of this session. As I have \npreviously noted, that also puts us well ahead of the pace established \nby the Republican majority in 1999.\n  As the Judiciary Committee chairman, I have always treated this \nPresident's judicial nominees more fairly than Republicans treated \nPresident Clinton's. With these confirmations, the Senate will have \nconfirmed 121 judges while I have served as Judiciary Chairman. It is a \nlittle known and wholly unappreciated fact that during the more than 6 \nyears of the Bush Presidency, more circuit court judges, more district \ncourt judges, and more total judges have been confirmed while I served \nas Judiciary chairman than during the longer tenures of either of the \ntwo Republican chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 48 judicial \nvacancies after these nominations are confirmed, yet the President has \nsent us only 26 nominations for these vacancies. Twenty two of these \nvacancies--almost half--have no nominee. Of the 15 vacancies deemed by \nthe Administrative Office to be judicial emergencies, the President has \nyet to send us nominees for 6 of them. That means more than a third of \nthe judicial emergency vacancies are without a nominee.\n  Of the 13 circuit court vacancies, more than half are without a \nnominee. If the President had worked with the Senators from Rhode \nIsland, New Jersey, Maryland, California, Michigan, and the other \nStates with the remaining circuit vacancies, we could be in position to \nmake even more progress.\n  As it is, we have cut the circuit vacancies in half, from 26 to 13. \nContrast that with the way the Republican-led Senate's lack of action \non President Clinton's moderate and qualified nominees resulted in \ncircuit court vacancies increasing from 17 to 26. During most of the \nClinton years, the Republican-led Senate engaged in strenuous efforts \nto keep circuit judgeships vacant in anticipation of a Republican \nPresident. To a great extent they succeeded.\n  The Judiciary Committee has been working hard to make progress on \nthose nominations the President has sent to us. Of course, when he \nsends us well-qualified, consensus nominees with the support of his \nhome-state Senators like those before us today, we can have success.\n  Mr. Settle is a partner and cofounder of the Shelton, WA, law firm of \nSettle & Johnson, PLLC, where he has worked for 30 years. He also \nserved 7 years as a prosecutor and defense counsel in the U.S. Army \nJudge Advocate General Corps.\n  Mr. Sullivan is general counsel to Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., \nwhere he has worked since 2005. Before that, he worked as a Federal \nprosecutor in the Southern District of New York and in private practice \nat the Wall Street law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, & Katz.\n  Mr. Van Bokkelen is the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of \nIndiana, where he has served since 2001. He has worked in private \npractice for the law firms of Goodman, Ball, Van Bokkelen & Leonard and \nWilson, Donnesberger, Van Bokkelen & Reid. He previously served as an \nassistant U.S. attorney and as an assistant attorney general in the \nIndiana Attorney General's office.\n  I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmation \ntoday.\n  Have the yeas and nays been asked for on the Benjamin Hale Settle \nnomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I seek recognition to speak on the \nnomination of Benjamin Settle to be a U.S. District Judge for the \nWestern District of Washington. Benjamin Hale Settle was nominated by \nPresident Bush on January 9, 2007. A hearing was held on his nomination \non March 13, and he was unanimously reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee on April 25.\n  Mr. Settle has an impressive resume and a record of service. He \nreceived his B.A. from Claremont McKenna College in 1969. Upon \ngraduating from college, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve and \nentered law school at Willamette University College of Law where he \nreceived his J.D. degree in 1972.\n  After graduating from law school he worked for Don Miles Attorneys as \nan associate until he was called up to serve full time in the Judge \nAdvocate General's Corps for the U.S. Army in 1973. Three years later, \nin 1976, Mr. Settle left full time Army service and rejoined the Don \nMiles where he practiced for one year, before opening a small \npartnership of his own. He has enjoyed a successful career as a general \npractitioner, working in a variety of small partnerships over the last \nthree decades.\n  Mr. Settle's broad practice has encompassed both litigation and \ntransactional matters. The nominee has also served as the general \ncounsel to several municipal and private corporate entities. In \naddition to his litigation and general counsel work, Mr. Settle has \nserved as judge pro tempore in Mason County Superior and District \nCourts where he has managed numerous matters for mediation and \narbitration.\n  The ABA has unanimously rated Mr. Settle ``Qualified.'' The vacancy \nto which Mr. Settle is nominated has been designated a ``judicial \nemergency'' by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the Courts. I \nhope my fellow Senators will support this nomination.\n  Madam President, I also seek recognition to discuss the nomination of \nRichard Sullivan to be a District Judge for the Southern District of \nNew York.\n  Richard J. Sullivan was nominated to be a U.S. District Court Judge \nfor the Southern District of New York on February 15, 2007. A hearing \nwas held on his nomination on April 11, 2007, and the Judiciary \nCommittee reported his nomination favorably on May 3, 2007.\n  He is a highly qualified nominee with a distinguished record both as \na prosecutor and in private practice. In 1986,\n\n[[Page S8672]]\n\nhe received his B.A. degree from the College of William and Mary, where \nhe was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. In 1990, he graduated from Yale Law \nSchool. Following law school, he served as a law clerk to Judge David \nM. Ebel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In \n1991, he joined Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz as a litigation associate.\n  In 1994, he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern \nDistrict of New York as an assistant U.S. attorney. During his tenure \nin the office, he served in a variety of leadership positions. In 1999, \nhe was put in charge of the Office's General Crimes Unit and later \nbecame chief of the Narcotics Unit. In 2002, he was named the founding \nchief of the newly created International Narcotics Trafficking Unit, \nwhich was dedicated to investigating and prosecuting the world's \nlargest narcotics trafficking and money-laundering organizations. From \n2002 to 2005, he also served as director of the New York/New Jersey \nOrganized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.\n  In 2005, Mr. Sullivan joined Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., as \ndeputy general counsel for litigation. He still works in that capacity, \nand since 2006 has also served as the general counsel of Marsh Inc., \nthe world's largest insurance broker and risk management firm. Marsh & \nMcLennan Companies is the parent company of Marsh Inc.\n  The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Mr. Sullivan \n``Well Qualified.'' The seat to which he is nominated has been \ndesignated a ``judicial emergency'' by the nonpartisan Administrative \nOffice of the Courts. I hope my fellow Senators will vote to confirm \nMr. Sullivan.\n  And finally, Madam President, I seek recognition to discuss the \nnomination of Joseph S. Van Bokkelen to be a District Judge for the \nNorthern District of Indiana.\n  President Bush nominated Mr. Van Bokkelen on January 9, 2007. A \nhearing was held on his nomination on April 11 and the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee reported his nomination favorably on May 3. He is a highly \nqualified nominee with extensive experience both as a prosecutor and in \nprivate practice.\n  In 1966, Mr. Van Bokkelen received his B.A. degree from Indiana \nUniversity. In 1969, he graduated from Indiana University School of \nLaw. After graduating law school, Mr. Van Bokkelen joined the Office of \nthe Indiana Attorney General, serving as deputy attorney general and \nsubsequently as assistant attorney general. In 1972, he became an \nassistant U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Indiana, where he \nserved until 1975.\n  Between 1975 and 2001, he worked in private practice as a partner--\nfirst at Wilson, Donnesberger, Van Bokkelen & Reid and then at Goodman, \nBall, Van Bokkelen & Leonard, P.C. His practice has focused on \nlitigation, both civil and criminal. Between 1983 and 1985, he served \nas a special prosecutor to investigate the murder of a prominent \npolitician and lawyer in Lake County, IN.\n  Since 2001, Mr. Van Bokkelen has served as U.S. Attorney for the \nNorthern District of Indiana. His courtroom experience is extensive. \nOver the course of his career, he has tried over 100 cases to verdict. \nThe American Bar Association has unanimously rated Mr. Van Bokkelen \n``Well Qualified.''\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support this nomination.\n  Madam President, I know everybody is anxious to conclude these \nmatters. They ought not be noncontroversial. Again, we have Benjamin \nHale Settle, for the Western District of Washington; Joseph S. Van \nBokkelen, for the Northern District of Indiana; Richard J. Sullivan, \nfor the Southern District of New York.\n  All have excellent academic records and professional records and \npassed through the Judiciary Committee. I recommend that my colleagues \nvote for them.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8672-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF BENJAMIN HALE SETTLE, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

VAN BOKKELEN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                  FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Joseph S. Van \nBokkelen, of Indiana, to be United States District Judge for the \nnorthern district of Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to support \nthe President's nomination of Joseph S. Van Bokkelen to serve as a U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Northern District of Indiana.\n  I would first like to thank Senate Judiciary chairman, Pat Leahy; \nranking member, Arlen Specter; and the respective leaders for their \nimportant work to facilitate timely consideration of this nomination.\n  In July of last year, Judge Rudy Lozano informed me of his decision \nto assume senior status after a distinguished career of public service. \nHe was a remarkable leader on the Federal bench, and I applaud his \nleadership to Indiana and to the legal community.\n  Given this upcoming vacancy and the need for strong leadership, I was \npleased to commend to President Bush Joe Van Bokkelen to serve on the \nFederal court in the Northern District of Indiana.\n  I have known Joe for many years, and I have always been impressed \nwith his high energy, resolute integrity, and remarkable dedication to \npublic service.\n  Joe Van Bokkelen attended Indiana University where he received both \nhis undergraduate and law degrees. He then served in the Indiana \nAttorney General's Office followed by his first experience in the \nUnited States Attorney's Office in the Northern District.\n  After many years of private practice, Joe assumed his current \nposition of United States Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana \non September 21, 2001. His performance in this position has been \nnothing short of remarkable. He has undertaken the most aggressive \npublic corruption initiative in the history of the office. Since 2002, \nover 30 public officials have been indicted and convicted. Joe has also \nused his office to target the use and possession of illegal firearms, \ncombat gang activity, implement drug demand reduction programs, and \ncultivate community partnerships.\n  Likewise, Joe has demonstrated leadership in the Justice Department \nwhere he serves on several of the Attorney General's advisory \ncommittees, including Violent and Organized Crime, White Collar Crime, \nSentencing Guidelines, and the Regional Information Sharing Working \nGroup.\n  Newspapers across northern Indiana contain articles and editorials \napplauding his determination to bring about effective law enforcement. \nThe Northwest Indiana Times recently commented that Joe Van Bokkelen \n``has an excellent track record for the five years he has led the U.S. \nAttorney's office in Northern Indiana.''\n  Joe has received a number of high performance ratings, including the \nA.V. rating from Martindale-Hubbell and the highest judicial rating \nfrom the American Bar Association.\n  Outside of his public service, Joe is involved with a number of \ncommunity activities and civic organizations.\n  I would again like to thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter \nfor their leadership in facilitating consideration of Joe Van \nBokkelen's nomination to serve as a Federal judge. I believe that he \nwill demonstrate remarkable leadership to northern Indiana and will \nappropriately uphold and defend our laws under the Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Joseph S. Van Bokkelen, of Indiana, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Northern District of Indiana.\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, motions to \nreconsider these votes are laid on the table. The President shall be \nnotified of the Senate's actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8673-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is a day of victory and defeat. \nSo many people have poured so much of themselves into this bill over \nthe last weeks and months, and every one of them deserves our thanks \nand our respect.\n  This bill tested the will, and the goodwill, of many people. But it \ntested some more than others. So first I want to thank those whose \nposition did not prevail.\n  Senator Specter's knowledge of this issue is matched only by his \nstamina. As the ranking member, he has our admiration and he deserves \nour thanks.\n  Senator Kyl inspired all of us, flying into his State and facing a \nlot of angry constituents, and the cameras week after week with \noptimism, patience and good cheer.\n  Senator Graham was one of the generals in this effort. He always does \nwhat he thinks is right, and Americans admire him for it.\n  Senator Martinez was another general. He brought intelligence and \ntenacity to this debate, and a story that never fails to inspire us.\n  Senator Lott's a great whip, and a good friend. He has been in this \nbuilding more than 3 decades, but he has the energy of a freshman. He \nhas been a leader and friend: I thank him for it.\n  Senator Salazar gave a lot of himself to this debate, a lot of time \nand no little criticism. Thank you.\n  And finally, it is a marvel of nature to see a man whose calling in \nlife is obvious to anyone who sees him at his job. Senator Kennedy is \nsuch a man. He loves his work, and his passion has inspired us.\n  Of course, behind all these Senators are a lot of terrific staff \nmembers who have worked incredibly hard on this bill. On the Judiciary \nCommittee, there was Michelle Grossman, Lauren Petron, Gavin Young, \nLauren Pastarnack, Lynn Feldman, Juria Jones, and most of all Mike \nO'Neill.\n  On Senator McCain's staff, Becky Jensen. On Senator Graham's staff \nthere was Matt Rimkunas and Jen Olson. On Senator Kyl's staff, \nElizabeth Maier and Michael Dougherty. On Senator Martinez's staff, \nBrian Walsh, Clay Deatherage, and Nilda Pedrosa.\n  Now I want to thank everyone who opposed the bill.\n  Senators Sessions, DeMint, and Vitter got us all to sit up and listen \nclosely to a lot of people who thought they had been shut out of this \ndebate. They put the rules of this body to work. And I would take any \none of them in a firefight.\n  Senator Cornyn, one of the original architects, deserves our thanks. \nHe has been committed to finding a solution to our Nation's immigration \nproblem for a long time. His contributions on the interior enforcement \npiece of this bill were a major part of the original compromise. But \nwhen he saw it was not a solution he could accept, he told us.\n  Senator Chambliss told us what the farmers needed, and we listened. \nWe thank him for his important contributions to the bill.\n  Senator Isakson was the author of the trigger concept, which every \none now agrees is a good idea.\n  To everyone involved in the crafting of this bill, I want to thank \nyou. This was a labor of uncommon intensity. It required will, energy, \nand patience. And while it strained a lot of bonds, it broke none of \nthem. As the majority leader said after the final vote, ``We're all \nstill friends here.''\n  As the elected leader of my conference, I stood here in January and \nopened this session with a pledge. I knew contentious issues always \nhave a better chance of being solved by divided governments, that \nimmigration reform was within our reach, and I said we should put it in \nour sights.\n  I also knew it was going to have to be bipartisan if we were going to \nget a bill at all. So everyone I have mentioned\n\n[[Page S8674]]\n\nrolled up their sleeves and got to work. And they put together a bill \nthat represented the best chance we had of getting to our goal.\n  But it touched a nerve, and the shock of it shot right through the \nSenate. It lit up the switchboards here for weeks, and ignited a debate \nthat strained our normal alliances here and at home in our States.\n  I heard from a lot of Kentuckians. Thousands of smart, well-informed \npeople called my offices to talk about this bill. They did not like the \nidea of someone being rewarded for a crime, or the impact that this \nwould have on a society whose first rule is the rule of law. They did \nnot trust the Government to suddenly get serious about border control \nafter neglecting it for 2 decades. And I do not blame them. I worried \nabout all that too. And to every one of them, I say today: Your voice \nwas heard.\n  A lot of good people came to my office. They argued for positions as \ndiverse as the country itself. They explained their views patiently and \nwith passion. I want to thank them too for informing my thinking and \nfor helping to shape this extraordinary debate.\n  My goal from the start has been to move the conference forward, to \nfacilitate debate, to ensure that the minority's voice was heard to the \nmaximum extent possible. I had hoped there would be a way forward. And \nas the divisions between supporters and opponents widened, the only way \nforward, to my mind, was to ensure a fair process. This was the only \nway to be sure we could improve the status quo, which all of us agreed \nwas indefensible. If every voice was heard, we could be confident our \nvotes reflected the best this body could do.\n  I had hoped for a bipartisan accomplishment, and what we got was a \nbipartisan defeat. The American people made their voices heard, the \nSenate worked its will, and in the end it was clear that the bill that \nwas crafted did not have the support of the people of Kentucky, it did \nnot have the support of most Americans, it did not have the support of \nmy conference, and it did not have enough support in the Democratic \nconference, a third of which opposed it.\n  This is not a day to celebrate. We do not celebrate when a pressing \nissue stays unresolved. But we can be confident that we will find a \nsolution to the problems that we have tried to address here. Many \npeople have made great personal sacrifices to work on a solution to our \nbroken immigration system. A lot of them exposed themselves to ridicule \nand contempt.\n  And so we can say with pride that the failure of this bill was not a \nfailure of will or hard work or good intentions. Martin Luther King \nonce said that ``human progress never rolls in on wheels of \ninevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men.'' And we \ncan be sure that many good people will step forward again to offer \ntheir intelligence, understanding, and their ``tireless efforts'' when \nthe time comes to face this issue again.\n  That time was not now. It was not the people's will. And they were \nheard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8674-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    STAFF SERGEANT THOMAS W. CLEMONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \nheroic soldier and a fellow Kentuckian, SSG Thomas W. Clemons. SSG \nClemons, born in Leitchfield, KY, proudly served in the Kentucky Army \nNational Guard from August 2000 until December 11, 2006, when he \ntragically lost his life while on his second tour of duty near \nDiwaniyah, Iraq. He was 37 years old.\n  Staff Sergeant Clemons earned numerous awards and medals throughout \nhis military career, including the Bronze Star Medal. A decorated \nsoldier, he will be remembered by those who knew him as a loving son \nand brother, a caring husband, a devoted father, a loyal friend and an \navid University of Kentucky Wildcats fan.\n  A true family man, Thomas cherished time with his wife, Sheila, his \nsons Tony and Ryan and his step-daughters Brittany and Amber. He was \nknown for saying that of all the blessings God had bestowed upon him, \nhis family was the greatest.\n  Like most soldiers, Thomas felt that being away from that family was \nthe hardest part of serving his country. But rather than focus on \nhimself, he sought to alleviate the loneliness of others. As a father \nto two teenage boys, Staff Sergeant Clemons recognized the difficulty \nthat long periods away from home created for the youngest soldiers in \nparticular.\n  He ``tried to be a daddy to everyone over there, especially the young \nones,'' says Thomas's mother, Patricia Frank. And along with the \ncomfort and nurturing Staff Sergeant Clemons gave to his troops, he \nprovided an equal amount of discipline and professionalism.\n  Clemons's company commander, CPT Ronald Ballard, said, ``Thomas was \nthe type of leader who delivered a one-two punch. First, he gave his \nguidance and standards, and then he led by example.''\n  Captain Ballard went on to add that Thomas ``understood he would not \nalways be here to lead his soldiers--that he had to get them ready to \nfill his boots.''\n  On one particularly tortuous day in Iraq, Staff Sergeant Clemons \nphoned his parents in Kentucky. One of his men had just died. Like any \nmother would, Patricia gently reminded her son that family was what was \nimportant, and that his family was alive and well--to which Thomas \nreplied, ``Over here, everyone is my family.''\n  Thomas embraced his duties as a Guardsman without hesitation. Before \nhis departure to Iraq, he told several friends and family members, ``a \nfew lives for a million--that's worth it.''\n  Staff Sergeant Clemons was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 123rd Armor \nRegiment in the Kentucky Guard. After serving his first year-long tour \nof duty, he volunteered for a second, and was redeployed to Iraq in \nMarch 2006.\n  His friend and fellow soldier SP Joshua White said that when he asked \nThomas why he offered to go back to Iraq, Thomas replied sincerely, ``I \ncannot sit back on my couch and watch one of my soldiers' names come \nacross that screen and live with myself.''\n  Thomas's unit provided force protection and ran security missions for \nthe Army. ``He was honored to be a soldier,'' Patricia says. ``That's \nwhat he wanted, and that's what he was.''\n  Staff Sergeant Clemons's funeral service was held in December 2006 in \nthe small Kentucky town of Caneyville, close to Leitchfield in Grayson \nCounty. So many people came to pay their respects to Thomas and his \nfamily that the funeral home could not hold them all. Many of Thomas's \nfriends told Patricia after the service that ``he helped me by just \ntalking to me.''\n  Staff Sergeant Clemons was a man people wanted to know, and he is \nmourned and missed by his beloved family and friends who had the honor \nto know him.\n  He is loved and remembered by his wife, Sheila, his mother and step-\nfather, Patricia and Jimmie Frank, his sons, Tony and Ryan, his step-\ndaughters, Brittany and Amber, his brothers, Tim Clemons, Chad Clemons \nand Shannon Frank, his sisters, Julie Johnson, Michelle Mudd and Pamela \nBowling, and many others.\n  Staff Sergeant Clemons was the type of man who, when asked by a local \nvolunteer group if they could send him anything while he was serving \nabroad, replied, ``pencils, for the little kids in Iraq.'' He was the \ntype to volunteer his free time to serve as a youth basketball and \nbaseball coach back home in Kentucky.\n  He was the family man who cherished time with his children, the \nfriend with a shoulder to lean on and the soldier who was willing to \nsacrifice his life ``to save a million,'' even a million people he had \nnever met.\n  And so although neither I nor my colleagues had the pleasure of \nmeeting him, I stand here today to say this Senate honors and salutes \nSSG Thomas W. Clemons for his service. We will hold his family in our \nthoughts and prayers. And the citizens of Kentucky and this grateful \nnation will always remember his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8674-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8674-S8675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

This was an historic day in the Senate. I was up after \nthe vote on immigration with Senator Kennedy. We had a little press \nconference to talk about what happened. We needed 60 votes to move the \nimmigration bill forward, for more amendments, to final passage.\n  When the roll call was taken, there were 46 votes; it was far short \nof what was needed. The average person might ask: ``Why would it take \n60 votes to pass something in the Senate? I thought it was by majority \nvote.'' Well, not in the Senate, it is not. If it is a complicated \nissue, and many are, it takes 60 votes. It is just the nature of this \nplace, the reason why the Senate was created. It is the reason why a \nSenator from a State such as Rhode Island would represent his State, \nalong with one other Senator, and a Senator from a State such as \nIllinois would have two Senators. It is the nature of the Senate.\n  It is a guarantee that the minority always has protection and a voice \nin this political process. It leads to a lot of frustrations, as you \ncan imagine, because bringing together 51 Senators ready to act and to \nsolve a problem is not enough; around here, it never has been. And it \nleads to a lot of criticism from the outside about how we spend so much \ntime talking and so little time doing. People look at us and say: ``You \nknow, how many years have you all been giving speeches about health \ncare in America? When are you going to do something about it?'' Well, \nthe honest answer is, that is good criticism. We have not come up with \na plan, nor have we had the political will to move a plan, and if we \ndid, it would face its biggest hurdle probably right here on the floor \nof the Senate. This is the place where things slow down. George \nWashington said of the Senate: ``This is the saucer that cools the \ntea.''\n  I was lucky to serve in the House for 14 years. It is a great place. \nI loved it. I loved all of the people I worked with. We ran every 2 \nyears. You had to be in touch with the folks in your district on a \nregular, constant basis. You reacted pretty quickly as things came \nalong. Bills passed, resolutions passed, you would sit there and shake \nyour head and say: ``All of the things we do just seem to die in the \nSenate.'' Well, it is the nature of the process. It is a narrowing \nbetween the two Chambers that makes it difficult to move things \nthrough.\n  Well, today was a classic example. We know--everyone knows--the \nimmigration system in America has failed. It has just plain failed. In \n1986, the last time we addressed this issue, 21 years ago, President \nReagan suggested an amnesty for those who were here illegally and that \nwe do things to stop more from coming. It did not work. The amnesty was \ngiven; the enforcement did not take place. On average, about 800,000 \nnew illegals came into the United States each year for 21 years; \n600,000 stayed.\n  We have a rough estimate that about 12 million undocumented and \nillegal people are here today. What are we going to do about it? Well, \nfirst and obviously, stop illegals from coming into the United States. \nIt won't be easy. Look at the risks people are willing to take to come \nto our country--walking across a desert knowing your life may be at \nstake, paying someone thousands of dollars to put you in the back of a \ntruck where you might be asphyxiated, jumping on a railroad train where \nyou could lose your life or a limb, just to get right here in our \ncountry. It is that desire to come to America that has been around for \nso long, and it is still there, and it will always be there.\n  But we know there are things we could do to make this border of ours \nbetter. We talked about things, sensible things--not a 2,000-mile wall \nor anything like that, but placing walls where they will help, placing \nfences where they will help, traffic barriers, new technology, more \nborder enforcement, training, trying to reach cooperative agreements \nwith the Mexicans and others--to slow illegal border crossings down. \nAll of those things represent a positive step forward. We committed $4 \nbillion to that effort. It should be done.\n  Then the workplace--that is what brings people here. Anyone who comes \nto America and thinks they can just park themselves and wait for a \ncomfortable life is wrong. They come to work. The jobs that immigrants \ntake, they are jobs that most of us do not want. If you went to a \nrestaurant in the great city of Chicago, which I am honored to \nrepresent today, and you took a look around at who took the plates off \nyour table, my guess is many of them may be undocumented people. You \ndon't see the folks back in the kitchen washing those dishes or those \non the loading dock or perhaps tonight the ones who will clean the \nbathrooms--likely to be, many of them, undocumented people who are here \ndoing those jobs every single day. They made your bed in the hotel room \nafter you left; they were with your mom in the nursing home bringing \nher water and changing her sheets; they are the people who, \nincidentally, make sure they trim the greens for you so this weekend \nthey will look picture perfect. Those are the folks out there every \nsingle day. They are in the packing houses, like the place where I used \nto work in college. That is no glamorous job. They took it because no \none else wants it. It is difficult, it is dirty, it is hot, it is a \nsweaty, nasty job, and they take it because they get paid to do it.\n  Most of them, when they get the paycheck, send half of it back home. \nThere are many parts of Central America and South America which subsist \nbecause of the transfer payments from people working in America who are \nillegal, sending their checks back home to their families. These \nworkers live in the barest of circumstances and try to get by in the \nhopes that some day, they will be Americans; some day, they will have \nfamily with kids who have a much better chance.\n\n  Their story is our story. It is a story of this Nation from its \nbeginning. Today, we had a chance to address this problem, to deal with \n12 million who are undocumented, to deal with border enforcement, \nworkplace enforcement, and to talk about how many more people we need \neach year.\n  We cannot open our borders to everyone who wants to come to America. \nWe cannot physically do it. It would not be good for our Nation, for \nthose who are here, or for our economy. But there are some we need.\n  As a Congressman who represents downstate Illinois, there were times \nwhen I desperately begged foreign physicians to come to small towns. \nThese towns did not have a doctor. They were going to lose their \nhospitals. Doctors came from India, from Pakistan, other places, from \nthe Philippines, and they were greeted with cheer by people who had \nnever been to their countries or knew anything about their land of \norigin. They came to the rescue. They opened that doctor's office. Many \nof the people in those small towns I represent in Illinois could not \neven pronounce that doctor's last name. He was ``Dr. K,'' they would \nsay, ``I just don't know how to pronounce his name. I am glad he is \nhere. Mom is feeling better, and we are glad he is here if we ever need \nhim.''\n  So we bring in folks each year, and we try in this bill to define how \nmany we are going to need. Well, you know what happened once debate \nstarted, Mr. President. There is a sentiment in America which is as \nhistoric as our country. I say jokingly, because I have no way of \nknowing, that in 1911, when my mother came off the boat in Baltimore, \nhaving arrived as a 2-year-old little girl from Lithuania, and came \ndown that ramp with my grandmother and her brother and sister, I am \nsure there were people looking up at this group coming in, saying: \nPlease, not more of those people.\n  That has been the nature of America. We know we are almost all \nimmigrants or the descendants of immigrants. Yet there is a resistance \nthat is built into our country to more coming in: They are different, \nthere may be too many of them, they may threaten our jobs--all of those \nthings. And we saw that sentiment, not on the floor of the Senate or \nthe House, but certainly we heard it on\n\n[[Page S8676]]\n\ntelevision, on radio. It is a sentiment that goes from being critical \nto being dark and ugly.\n  My wife called me this morning from our home in Illinois. She told me \nthe telephone calls that were overwhelming my office had reached our \nhome and people were calling her all through the night. They got our \nhome telephone number and decided to try to keep her awake all night. \nWell, that is part of this job. I am not asking for sympathy. I \nunderstand I am a public figure. I am sorry she had to put up with it. \nShe has put with it for a long time. But that sentiment got carried \naway in many respects. It went beyond criticizing a bill and went into \nsomething else that doesn't speak well of us as a Nation.\n  So tomorrow morning, across America, many people--some 12 million of \nthem--will get up and go to a job where they will work hard and they \nwill come home and not be sure about what tomorrow will bring. They do \nnot know if there will be a knock on the door and they will have to \nleave. They do not know if they will be separated from the family they \nlove, they do not know whether their children will have any future at \nall. That uncertainty is because of the fact that we did not have the \nvotes today in the Senate.\n  I think about some of them whom I know personally. I think about some \nof the characterizations of those people which I think are so unfair.\n  Last weekend, Pat Buchanan, who makes a living writing books and \nsaying things that are controversial, was on ``Meet the Press'' and \ncharacterized the 12 million people as criminals, welfare recipients, \ncalled them the mass invasion of the United States. Perhaps a few of \nthem might fit in that category, but not the ones I have met and know.\n  Among the people now whose lives are going to be left in uncertainty \nis a mother I know and know very well. Her husband was one of those \nlucky ones. He was a citizen from Mexico. In 1986, he was given amnesty \nby President Reagan. He works 14-hour days in a club in Chicago as a \nmaitre'd, greeting people, bringing them to their tables. He and his \nwife have four children who are all American citizens. They were all \nborn here. But his wife is undocumented. Several years ago, she was \ndeported, 3 days before Mother's Day, back to Mexico. She was pregnant \nat the time and wanted to stay in the United States with her doctor \nuntil the baby was born but wasn't allowed. Eventually, I called the \nState Department. They gave her a humanitarian visa to come back to the \nUnited States. Now once each year I make a phone call to ask if she can \nstay with her family for another year. Luckily, she has been able to \nstay on what they call a humanitarian waiver. But she and her children \nnever know from year to year whether mom is going to be deported to \nMexico. Will it make America better if she leaves? Will it make that \nfamily better? I don't think so. This is clearly a case where this \ngreat Nation can certainly absorb a loving mother who wants to make \nsure her kids have a good life.\n  There is another girl--she is now a young woman--I know from Chicago. \nShe is Korean. She was an amazing young lady who had great musical \ntalent. She was accepted at Juilliard School of Music, but when she \napplied she learned from her mother that when she was brought from \nKorea to the United States at the age of 2, no papers were filed. She \nhad no status. She wasn't a citizen of anyplace. She called our office \nand said: ``What should I do?'' We checked, and we were told she had to \ngo back to Korea. She had not been there since she was 2 years old. Her \nlife is a life of uncertainty now. Where is she going to go? This is \nthe only country she has ever known. She wants to use her musical \ntalents right here in America, a place she calls home.\n  Then there is an attorney in the Loop in Chicago, a nice, attractive, \nyoung woman who graduated from law school. I met her at a gathering. \nShe asked if I could talk to her afterward. She came up to me and said: \n``I have to talk to you in private. It is about my mom. My mom is \nPolish. She came to Chicago to visit some relatives years ago, \noverstayed her visa. She is not here legally. She got married, had a \nfamily. She lives in constant fear that she is going to be deported \naway from her children and grandchildren. What are we going to do, \nSenator?''\n  There will be no answer to these cases until we have a law that \ncreates a mechanism, a formula, and a process that is reasonable. We \ntried to do that today without success. We can't give up. We can't give \nup on these cases, and we can't give up on this issue.\n  We have to understand that this great Nation of immigrants has to \nhave laws. These laws have to be followed. There will be no more \namnesties. What we suggested today was that anyone who is here and \nwants to try to make it to the finish line of legalization has to \nunderstand how tough it will be over 8 to 13 years before you can reach \nthat goal. Go to the back of the line so everybody who applied legally \ncomes before you, learn English, have no criminal record, have a \nhistory of work, pay your taxes, pay your fines, check in every year. \nThen, at some point, go back outside this country and apply to come in \nagain. Those are not easy steps. Very few would have made it to the \nfinish line, but we gave them that chance. That is what America is \nabout, to give people a chance.\n  I hope we return to this issue. I doubt if it will be soon. But I \nhope we return because of the fact that we have left so many questions \nunresolved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8676-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8676-S8677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to \naddress an issue which I have addressed every week for several months \nnow. It is the ongoing genocide in Darfur. How long are we going to \nallow this genocide to continue? How long will we allow mass killings, \nrapes, torture and the torching of homes and entire villages? How long \nwill we tolerate 200,000, maybe 400,000 deaths? How long will we \ntolerate 2.5 million people displaced from their homes, a refugee \ncrisis in Chad and other nearby crises? How long will the global \ncommunity tolerate such brutality in today's world.\n  In May, more than 4 years after the crisis in Darfur began, President \nBush said:\n\n       For too long, the people of Darfur have suffered at the \n     hands of a government that is complicit in the bombing, \n     murder, and rape of innocent civilians. My administration has \n     called these actions by their rightful name: genocide. The \n     world has a responsibility to help put an end to it.\n\n  I agree with the President. I agree, and I call on the President to \nhelp America take action by use his upcoming visit with Russian \nPresident Vladimir Putin to demand a halt to Russian military sales to \nthe Sudanese Government, sales that fuel the violence and are in \nviolation of the U.N. arms embargo. My colleagues on both sides of the \naisle--Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas; Russ Feingold, \nDemocrat of Wisconsin; Gordon Smith, Republican of Oregon--have joined \nme in a bipartisan request. Together we wrote President Bush asking him \nto take action on this urgent issue when he meets with the President \nPutin. Russia can't claim to be a responsible leader in the global \ncommunity and at the same time flaunt United Nations sanctions \nestablished to help end this ongoing genocide. Mr. Putin cannot have it \nboth ways.\n  Amnesty International recently reported that Russia and China, two \npermanent members of the U.N. Security Council, are supplying the bulk \nof weapons to Sudan. That is right. Two permanent members of the U.N. \nSecurity Council are providing the weapons and ammunition being used by \nthe Sudanese Government to perpetuate the genocide, killing innocent \nlife. That is unacceptable. Mr. Putin must put an end to weapons sales. \nWeapons sold to the Sudanese Government contribute to the massive human \nmisery and violence in Darfur. As I speak today, human rights \nviolations, rapes, murders, attacks on humanitarian workers continue \nwithout end. The accounts are ongoing and widespread.\n\n  For example, the Associated Press recently reported a horrible story, \none that is sadly too common in Darfur. Seven women at a refugee camp \nin Kalma, Darfur, pooled their money to rent a donkey and a cart. They \nventured out of the camp to gather firewood, which they hoped they \nmight be able to sell and use the proceeds to feed their families. A \nfew hours away from the camp, they were attacked and robbed by the \nJanjaweed militia. They\n\n[[Page S8677]]\n\nwere gang raped and beaten. They had to flee naked back to the camp.\n  According to Amnesty International, in recent years, Russia exported \nto Sudan $21 million worth of aircraft and related equipment and more \nthan $13 million worth of helicopters. Witnesses have documented \nRussian attack helicopters used by the Sudanese Air Force during \nJanjaweed attacks. Russian-built Antonov aircraft have been seen \nbombing areas along the border with Chad.\n  I have photos I will share with those following the debate. This is \nan MI-24 attack helicopter at Nyala airport in Darfur, March 2007. It \nis a Russian helicopter. According to the United Nations, the sales of \nthis aircraft are prohibited. The Russians make these sales, and these \nhelicopters are used to kill innocent people. President Bush is meeting \nwith the President of Russia. I hope he will mention this attack \nhelicopter and how it is being misused in violation of U.N. \nresolutions.\n  Similarly, this is the Antonov-26 aircraft spotted in many places in \nDarfur between January and March 2007, parked here at Nyala airport in \nlate March 2007, another Russian aircraft sold in violation of U.N. \nresolutions that can be used, unfortunately, to sustain a government \nwhich is perpetuating a genocide. Russia should not be helping the \ngenocidal efforts of the Sudanese Government.\n  It has been 2\\1/2\\ years since President Bush decisively called the \ncrisis in Darfur a genocide. We have tightened sanctions and called for \ngreater action to stop it, and I applaud that. But we must do more. I \nhave appealed to the President personally and directly on three \ndifferent occasions. Last week, I appealed to Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice to seize every single opportunity to make the genocide \nin Darfur a big issue, an issue of diplomacy and for action.\n  I say to the President, we have many issues to discuss with our \nRussian partners, ranging from cooperation in preventing the spread of \nnuclear weapons and materials to reaffirming support for basic \ndemocratic principles and institutions in Russia. Our relationship with \nRussia is a very important one. But we can't look the other way when an \nally is aiding in a genocide. I hope President Bush will use his visit \nwith President Putin to help highlight an issue that requires immediate \nattention, helping to stem the crisis in Darfur. Put an end to this \ngenocide by putting an end to Russian weapons sales to the Sudanese \nGovernment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8677-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8677-S8680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nimmigration reform issue. Before my colleague from Illinois leaves the \nChamber, I wish to say that at the end of the day, there were some \nprofiles in courage, people of the heart but also people of the mind \nwho wanted to do what is right for America and for America's future. I \ncannot think of a better colleague than the senior Senator from \nIllinois, Dick Durbin, for his passion, for his wisdom, for his \ncourage, and for his leadership. I look forward to continuing our work \ntogether as we work on this and so many other issues that are so \nimportant, both to Illinois and to Colorado and to the Nation and to \nthe entire world. I thank my colleague from Illinois.\n  As I reflect on the occurrences of the last several years with \nrespect to immigration reform, I wish to comment on several things. The \nfirst of those is a long history related to an issue that is somehow \nintertwined with my own life. Four hundred nine years ago, my \nforefathers and foremothers came to the place we now call the State of \nNew Mexico, today known as the land of enchantment. It was in New \nMexico they decided to found what was the first settlement in the \nSouthwest and in that part of the State. They named that city the city \nof Santa Fe, the city of holy faith. Over the centuries following the \nfounding of the city of Santa Fe, for the next 250 years, my family \ncontinued to farm and ranch along the banks of the Rio Grande River, \nfrom Santa Fe up to the north through communities such as those named \nEspanola and Chama. Then in 1848, we didn't immigrate to this country, \nbut the border of the United States of America moved us over to the Rio \nGrande River to the south. It was in 1848, the Mexican-American war was \nended with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The signing \nof the treaty gave the people who lived in at that time the \nSouthwestern part of the United States the option of either becoming \ncitizens of these United States or going back not from where they had \ncome but back to the other side of what had been a new border that had \nbeen created in 1848.\n  My forefathers and foremothers at the time having had 250 years of \nhistory living in the Southwest, living in New Mexico, living in the \nsouthern part of Colorado, made the decision they were going to choose \nthe path of America, the path of the future, the path of what is now \nthe greatest country in the world. It was a good decision. As a result \nof that decision, we have been now in New Mexico and Colorado for a \nnumber of generations. I am a fifth generation Coloradan. My family \ngoes back in New Mexico for 12 generations.\n  Going back to that history, and recognizing for the first 250 years \nof my family's settlement of these United States they were part of the \nGovernment of Spain, subjects of the Government of Spain for most of \nthat time, and then for about 20 years a part of the Mexican Government \nwhen Mexico overthrew Spain in the War of Independence in 1821. So for \nus there is that history which ties us so much to the lands of the \nsouthwest.\n  Now, for me, when I think about that history, and when I see what \nAmerica has done for my family, I see very much an America that has \nbeen an America in progress.\n  I look to the Civil War, where there were over 600,000 people in \nAmerica who died, as Lincoln said in his Gettysburg Address, to give a \nnew birth of freedom to America. That was a statement by President \nLincoln in which he believed slavery and the separation and ownership \nof people based on their race was something which was absolutely wrong. \nHe was able to keep our Union together with the blood that was spilled \nboth in the South and in the North.\n  It was out of that great Civil War of our times that we ended up with \nwhat are now some of the more significant amendments of our Bill of \nRights. One thinks of the 13th and 14th and 15th amendments that \nabolished slavery, that created equal protection under the laws, that \nmade sure everybody--no matter who they are, no matter where they come \nfrom--had an opportunity in these United States.\n  But that was not the end of the march for progress because even with \nthe inclusion of those amendments, women were excluded and, in fact, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, in interpreting those amendments, made the \ndecision that the Jim Crow segregation laws of the United States of \nAmerica were just fine; that it was OK for the Government of America to \nsanction a place where you could have schools for Blacks, schools for \nWhites, schools for people who were Hispanic. It was OK, in those days, \nfor women, according to the laws of this country, not to be allowed to \nvote, to take a subservient and very secondary role in our society. \nThat was after a great civil war where over 600,000 people gave their \nlives on the soil of our America. But yet America marched forward on a \npath of progress. And we did, indeed, later on adopt the women's right \nof suffrage that allowed women to vote in our society.\n  Through the long civil rights movement, led by great leaders such as \nThurgood Marshall, we ended up with a courageous Supreme Court in a \nunanimous decision of those days where Justice Warren wrote the famous \nSupreme Court decision of Brown v. Board of Education. In that 1954 \ndecision by Justice Warren, what Justice Warren said in that decision \nis that the place of separate but equal had no place in our America. He \nsaid you cannot have a doctrine of separate but equal. That ends up \nbranding those who are of a different color with a sense of inferiority \nand, therefore, under the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment \nthere was no room for segregation in the United States of America. That \nwas a significant milestone in our march for progress in America.\n  We have made major steps since that point in time. The passage of the \nCivil\n\n[[Page S8678]]\n\nRights Act, signed by President Johnson in the 1960s, ushered in a \nwhole new era of civil rights in America. We have continued to march \nforward.\n  So, today, as we look at what happened with the end of the \nimmigration reform debate, I remain steadfastly confident and \noptimistic the tomorrows and the weeks ahead and the years ahead will \nbring about a resolution to this issue of immigration which we deal \nwith today, and in that resolution of how immigration legislation is \npassed, to fix a system which is in chaos and in disorder today, what \nwe will find is, as Dr. Martin Luther King said, change in our \nimmigration laws will bend toward the arc of moral justice; that \njustice is where that arc will lead us as we deal with the issue of \nimmigration reform.\n  I believe very strongly we had a good bill. It was not a perfect \nbill. It was a bill that, obviously, had its critics, both on the left \nand on the right. But I think it is important for us to step back and \nask ourselves what it is we were trying to do, those of us who worked \nso hard on this legislation.\n  I believe, first and foremost, what we were doing is trying to \naddress the national security issues of the United States. We were \ntrying to do that by strengthening our borders and making sure we had \nenough money to be able to hire the personnel and do the things we have \nto do to enforce our borders and also to enforce our laws within our \ncountry.\n  How can we sit here today in the United States of America and know \nthere are millions of people we do not know, or what their backgrounds \nare, who are here illegally, how can we be satisfied that our national \nsecurity is taken care of when the borders are as porous as they are \ntoday? This national security issue is an inescapable force that will \nultimately lead us to have the right resolution to dealing with the \nissue of our broken borders.\n  We also have a system of immigration which is simply broken. It is \nnot working. What ends up happening is people point a lot to the border \nto the south, Mexico, as though that is where the issue of immigration, \nwhich has become so contentious, is rooted. Yet in reality, when you \ntalk to the Irish who live in New York or in Chicago or other places, \nthere are many undocumented Irish who live in those communities.\n  There are undocumented people in this country who come from over 140 \ncountries all around the world. Indeed, no matter how big a wall we \nbuild, no matter how tall the wall, no matter whether that wall is as \nbig as the Wall of China, the fact is, we have a system inside of our \ncountry that is not working because about 40 percent of the people who \nare here in an undocumented status actually came into the country \nlegally, and they have overstayed their visas. So we have an \nimmigration system within our country that simply is not working.\n  Finally, there are the moral and human issues that are at stake, \nincluding the human and moral issues with the 12 million people who \nlive here in the shadows of our society. Our quest was to bring those \n12 million people out of the shadows of darkness and pain they \ncurrently live in, into the sunlight of our society.\n  We made it very clear in our statement that it was not a free ride. \nWe said to them in our legislation they would have to pay significant \nfines, they would have to pass a background check, they would have to \nlearn English, they would have to live through a time--to use a \nCatholic metaphor--a period of purgatory for up to 8 years before they \nwould be eligible to even become citizens. For most of them it would \nhave meant a period of up to 11 years.\n  So this was not the free ride that was characterized by some of the \nopponents of the legislation. This was, indeed, tough, fair, and \npractical legislation that we proposed. But that legislation will not \nbe heard on the Senate floor further for who knows how long. But at \nsome point in time those forces that drew us together are forces which \nare not going to go away.\n  We have to continue to figure out a way to fix our broken borders. We \nhave to have the courage to stand up and ensure that fix of a broken \nimmigration system. What we have to do is have the courage to say we \nare going to do something that is moral and just and humane with the 12 \nmillion undocumented workers who have toiled in our hotel rooms, in our \nfields, who work at construction sites, who work as chicken pluckers, \nas my good friend said in South Carolina, who work in those kinds of \nconditions every day.\n  So I leave the end of this day with a sense of hopefulness, a sense \nof optimism, and with a sense that these inescapable forces that impel \nus forward will now not allow us to fail. We will get this job done.\n  As we get this job done, it is also important to reflect on the fact \nthat there have been many people who have gotten us to the point where \nwe are today. There is a lot of work that has gone on on this issue of \nimmigration.\n  As Senator Reid, and I, and others have spoken about this issue of \nimmigration, we have reminded people that since 9/11 there have been 36 \nhearings on the issue of immigration. There have been 6 days of \ncommittee markup. There have been 59 committee amendments. There have \nbeen now probably 25 days of this Senate debating the issue of \nimmigration. And during that course, there have been almost 100 Senate \nfloor amendments that we have voted on as we have moved forward with \nimmigration reform.\n  We will get there. But through that whole effort, there have been \nsome tremendous people who have been profiles in courage. Some of them \nare newcomers to our Senate family. Some of them are Democrats who have \nbeen around a long time and who have inspired the people of America and \nthe people who work here every day--day after day after day. Some of \nthem are Republican. Some of them are Democrat. I want to say a word \nabout some of these individuals.\n  Senator Kennedy, yes, some people love him; some people hate him. But \nthere is no person who has more of a passion and a sense of justice in \nAmerica. When you think about the contributions the Kennedy family and \nSenator Kennedy have made to this Nation, they are one of those \nhistoric and heritage families of whom we can all truly be proud. It \nhas been an honor for me to work with him.\n  Senator Lindsey Graham did not have to get involved in the issue of \nimmigration. He is up for reelection. It is not a popular issue. He \ncomes from a tough State, South Carolina. Yet he worked every day and \ngave it everything he had, his whole heart and soul. He deserves a \nprofile in courage for what he did.\n  Senator Feinstein has labored so much because she cares about those \npeople working in the fields. She cares so much about making sure we \nhave a program that works for business and for agriculture. She is \nconcerned about the human and moral issues. She partnered up with our \ncolleague, Senator Larry Craig, to get 800 organizations behind the \nlegislation for AgJOBS. She did an incredible job in moving us forward, \nalong with Senator Larry Craig.\n  Senator Bob Menendez, we heard him speak earlier on the Senate floor. \nHe truly has added a tremendous dimension to this body, and his \nleadership will continue to bring us to a solution that is a fair and \nhumane and just solution to this issue of immigration about which he \ncares so much. When he talks about family reunification, for him, he \nknows what that means in the context of immigration in a personal \nsense. So we need to honor and respect his perspective, which I \nsupport.\n  Senator Reid, without his leadership, and without his bringing \n``Lazarus'' up to life again on the floor of the Senate on immigration, \nwe would not have gotten anywhere. So I thank our leader for having \ngiven us the opportunity and having stood with us on some very tough \ndebates. He is a tough guy. He is a boxer. He knows how to fight. That \nis the kind of leadership America needs.\n  Senator Leahy, as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who has \ndone such a great job in the functioning of that Judiciary Committee, \nhelped us move this legislation forward. I thank him for his \nleadership.\n  Senator Kyl, the chairman of the Republican Conference Committee--get \nthat--the chairman of the Republican Conference Committee, was in the \ntrenches. He was in the trenches, sleeves rolled up, trying to make \nthis thing happen; Jon Kyl from Arizona deserves one of those profiles \nin courage as well; Senator McCain and his leadership. He is running \nfor President. This is not a popular issue to take up.\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\nSome people are saying that perhaps this is an issue that might take \nhim to a lesser standing in the polls. But I will say this about \nSenator McCain: He is a hero of America, and he is a hero of America \nbecause he has the courage of his convictions to stand up for those \nthings he believes in. You think about those years he spent in \ncaptivity in Vietnam and what kind of courage was honed into his \nconsciousness and into his humanity. He truly is a person of great \nleadership.\n  Senator Specter, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, is a Republican who helped shepherd this legislation \nforward. Day after day he worked to make this happen because he knew of \nthe national imperative we were dealing with. He also is one of those \npeople with great courage.\n  My colleague from Florida, Senator Martinez, worked hard for a very \nlong time trying to get us across the finish line. For me, he is a \nbrother. For me, when he tells the story of being a Peter Pan child, he \nexemplifies the dream and hope of what America is. We very much look \nforward to continuing our working relationship together on issues that \naffect America.\n  I say to his colleague, the Presiding Officer, Senator Nelson from \nFlorida, I appreciate his great work and hanging with us, even on what \nwas a very tough vote at the end.\n  I also want to say a quick word about a couple of other people who \nare freshmen, about whom some might say: What were they doing involved \nin such a big issue? But then I guess they did it because they learned \nand because they were doing it for all of the right reasons. Sheldon \nWhitehouse, my colleague from Rhode Island, I called on him and said: \nYou need to be a part of this group. You need to be a part of it \nbecause, No. 1, you are on the Judiciary Committee; and No. 2, you were \na great attorney general of Rhode Island; and No. 3, you will learn so \nmuch in working with great names such as Kennedy and Specter, Leahy, \nand others. So he joined us, and day in and day out he was there, \nlaboring to get us across the finish line.\n  Amy Klobuchar, the new Senator from Minnesota, has a way of trying to \nbring people together. She has a way of trying to bring people \ntogether. She labored mightily to get us to where we ended up today, \nwith at least as many votes as we were able to get.\n  But it is not just those who work who have the title of Senator--and \nI might add Senator Trent Lott also did a Herculean job of trying to \nget us across the finish line, and I thank him for that.\n  But there are many people behind each of these Senators. We get the \nhonors, we get the label of Senator, but we couldn't do it without the \nwonderful floor staff we have, including the Parliamentarians and the \nclerks and others who help us every day, but also the staffs of each of \nour offices.\n  From Senator Kennedy's staff, I thank Ester Olavarria, Michael Myers, \nJanice Kaguyutan, Melissa Crow, Mary Giovagnoli, and Todd Kushner; for \nSenator Feinstein, Amy Pope and Jennifer Duck; for Senator Menendez, \nChris Schloesser; for Senator Reid, Serena Hoy, Marcela Urrutia, and \nRon Weich; for Senator Durbin, Joe Zogby; for Senator Leahy, Matt \nVirkstis and Ellen Gallagher; for Senator Graham, Jen Olson and Matt \nRimkunas; for Senator Kyl, Elizabeth Maier and Michael Dougherty; for \nSenator McCain, Becky Jensen; for Senator Specter, Michael O'Neill and \nJuria Jones; for Senator Martinez, Nilda Pedrosa and Clay Deatherage.\n  I thank all the staff who have made this possible.\n  In conclusion, let me say I have great hope. I have great hope and I \nam optimistic. I am optimistic we are going to be able to deal with the \ngreat issues of our time in the 21st century. We are going to be able \nto figure out a way to resolve the issues in Iraq and in the Middle \nEast, because the greatness of America depends upon us restoring the \ngreatness of America around the world. We will move forward with a \nclean energy future for the 21st century, which is what we worked so \nhard on and what we passed in this Chamber last week. We will work very \nhard to address the issues of health care which affect so many \nAmericans and their families and so many American businesses. Yes, we \nwill continue to work on the issue of immigration. It is an issue we \nmust resolve, and I am optimistic.\n  I am optimistic because when I think of that generation I come from, \nthat generation of World War II, the parents of the Presiding Officer \nand mine, people who lived through those very difficult times of the \nGreat Depression and the Dust Bowl, people who fought in World War II, \nveterans such as my father who went to war, my mother who served in the \nPentagon during World War II, that generation of World War II, where \nhalf a million Americans gave their lives in the name of preserving \ncivilization and freedom; if they could take on those challenges of \ntheir time, then there is no reason why we in the Congress cannot take \non the challenges of our time and restore the greatness of America and \nmake sure that the legacy they left to each and every one of us is not \na legacy we forget or that we do not pass on in an even better shape to \nour children. I do not want our generation to be the first generation \nin American history that passes on the baton to the next generation in \nworse condition than we inherited it from our parents.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, in my haste to thank everybody I forgot to say \nsomething about someone who has now been through three immigration \nbattles with me in my office, and that is Felicia Escobar. Felicia will \nbe going to law school soon. For the last 3 years she has labored \nmightily, putting in sometimes 100-hour work weeks to make sure we are \ndoing the right things on immigration, and I wanted to personally thank \nher on the floor for her great efforts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have had the privilege of \nlistening to the Presiding Officer in his role as the Senator from \nColorado give a very detailed and very comprehensive overview of a lot \nof the personalities and the intrigues, as well as the substance, that \nwent into this whole debate on immigration. It was interesting that \nwhen we failed to get the necessary 60 votes today to cut off debate on \na motion of cloture, all the Senators stayed on the floor and listened \nto the majority leader. I thought the tone that the majority leader, \nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, set was not one of bitterness; it was one \nexpressing a good deal of frustration in the fact that so much effort \nhad been made and we didn't get to the 60 votes. As a matter of fact, I \nthink we were some 11 or 12 votes short of the 60 votes.\n  He did not point fingers. He didn't say whose fault it was. He said \nthere will be another day, that this is one of the great issues of our \ntime, and that America was better off for having had the debate. Harry \nReid comported himself with great dignity and great leadership because \nthere will be another day. There has to be another day on the issue of \nimmigration, simply because what we have now on the books is a law this \nSenator voted for in 1986 as a Member of the House of Representatives; \na law that has never been enforced by the U.S. Government and never has \nbeen obeyed by the people who were supposed to obey the law. What was \nestimated back in 1986--21 years ago--to be 2 million, maybe 3 million \nillegal folks in this country, because the law was never obeyed, in \nmany cases by employers who were supposed to be the fulcrum of \nenforcing the law, that they would only hire legal entrants into this \ncountry, and on top of it was never enforced by the U.S. Government, \ncreated a condition that so many people have blasted the very \nlegislation we have been considering of amnesty.\n  What we have now is amnesty: That 2 million or 3 million 21 years ago \nwould grow to 12 million illegal aliens today. That is amnesty. Amnesty \nis what we have today because the law was never enforced or obeyed. \nThat is what we have to correct.\n  Now, sadly, because of the experiences we have had over the last 21\n\n[[Page S8680]]\n\nyears, not only on the question of immigration, but then from the \nlessons of September 11, 2001, we realize there is another reason we \nmust control our borders, so desperately necessary to the welfare and \nthe protection of this country, the protection of the homeland. Because \nof those two main reasons, we will live to see another day, and we will \npass an immigration law to bring us into order out of the chaos which \nis the current condition.\n  I commend the Senator from Colorado as he gave a personality profile \nof so many of these wonderful Senators here, and it is a Senate family. \nYou get to know each other on a personal basis, and you see how on \noccasion a Senator will rise to an occasion. All of the people whom the \nSenator from Colorado mentioned certainly merit that distinction. But \nwhat the Senator from Colorado didn't do is he didn't talk about \nhimself. The Senator from Colorado has done one of the most remarkable \njobs of acclimating to the Senate within a short period of time and \nbecoming so effective, and especially on an issue such as immigration, \nfor which he has great passion and compassion.\n\n  So I wanted to add my little comments to all of those the Senator \nmentioned who have so wonderfully stood tall under very difficult \ncircumstances. It is quite unusual when a subject will touch a nerve \nthat will create such passion on both sides--passion that gets so \nheated that the sides won't talk to each other. We cannot make law like \nthat because, as the Good Book says, you have to come and reason \ntogether. When the passion gets so hot that you cannot come and reason \ntogether, you cannot come together and build consensus, that is when \nthe legislative process in a democracy breaks down.\n  These Senators, in the midst of all of that passion, stood tall, \ncomporting themselves extremely well and serving in the best tradition \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8680-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8680-S8682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ETHICS AND LOBBYING REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we had a number of conversations this \nafternoon on the floor about ethics and lobbying reform. We are not \ngoing to move on that anymore today. We will renew our request \ntomorrow, until we get this done. I hope we can get it done. It is \nreally important for the country.\n  Mr. President, I am reading now into the Record a statement that was \nissued today. I received it in my office, as all Senators did:\n\n       Statement on status of 9/11 Commission recommendations \n     bill, dated June 28, 2007.\n       The 9/11 families are grateful to Congressional Leadership \n     for taking the difficult step of removing a controversial \n     labor provision from pending security legislation intended to \n     implement the remaining 9/11 Commission recommendations.\n\n  I will read that again; I didn't do a very good job of it.\n\n       The 9/11 families are grateful to Congressional Leadership \n     for taking the difficult step of removing a controversial \n     labor provision from pending security legislation intended to \n     implement the remaining 9/11 Commission recommendations. We \n     recognize that this was a difficult decision for them, \n     considering their party's longstanding dedication to the \n     principles involved.\n       Passage of this bill is long overdue, particularly in light \n     of bipartisan support at the bill's inception in both the \n     House and Senate. The Democrats have taken an important step \n     toward improving our national security by removing what the \n     opposition identified as an impediment to the bill's passage.\n       Senate Republican leadership must, in turn, stop blocking \n     the naming of conferees so that this critical legislation can \n     move forward. Similarly, the Administration should cease its \n     threats to veto legislation regarding the provisions that go \n     to the heart of the 9/11 Commission recommendations.\n       Everyone must work together. The safety and security of our \n     country is at stake.\n\n  This is signed by Carol Ashley, whose daughter Janice was lost in \nthat terrorist attack of September 11; Rosemary Dillard, who is the \nwidow of Eddie, who was killed in that terrorist attack; Beverly \nEckert, who is the widow of Sean Rooney, who was killed in that attack; \nMary Fetchet, the mother of Brad, who was killed in that terrorist \nattack; Carie Leming, whose daughter Judy was killed in that terrorist \nattack; and Abraham Scott, the widower of Janice, who was killed in \nthat attack.\n  These are members of organizations that have been steadfast in making \nsure everything is done so that we don't have other terrorist attacks \nand that we implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Those \norganizations are Voices of September 11th, 9/11 Pentagon Families, and \nFamilies of September 11, which are organizations well known throughout \nthe country.\n  Earlier this spring, the Director of National Intelligence, ADM Mike \nMcConnell, told our Armed Services Committee in a public hearing that \nal-Qaida's franchise is growing and its leadership remains alive and \nwell along the Afghanistan/Pakistan border and that any new attack on \nthe United States ``most likely would be planned and come out of the \n[al-Qaida] leadership in Pakistan.'' We think that is incredible. \nAlmost 6 years after 9/11, we face the same threat we faced that day: \nOsama bin Laden and a determined extremist group intent on harming \nAmericans. Unfortunately, it is painfully clear that much more can and \nmust be done to protect America from terrorist attacks.\n  Three years ago, the bipartisan 911 Commission recommended ways to \nstrengthen our defense against terrorism. Unfortunately, the Bush \nadministration and the Republican-controlled Congress failed to act on \nmost of these recommendations. That is why one of the first bills \npassed in the House and the Senate at the start of this session of \nCongress would finally and fully implement the unanimous \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  As my colleagues know, since we acted on a broad bipartisan basis, \nHouse and Senate Democrats and Republicans have worked tirelessly to \nresolve the differences over this bill and get it to the President's \ndesk so it can be signed into law. However, twice this week, my \nRepublican colleagues have objected to moving forward so we can \ncomplete action on this bill.\n  On Tuesday, a Republican Senator made it clear for the record that \nthe Republicans objected to proceeding to conference because of a \nprovision in the bill regarding TSA screeners, which had prompted the \nPresident to issue a veto threat on the bill.\n  Although the provision would improve efficiency, morale, and skills \nof TSA screeners, President Bush strenuously opposed it.\n  In an effort to demonstrate our commitment to completing this \nimportant legislation as quickly as possible, we informed our \nRepublican colleagues we were prepared to address their objections and \nremove this provision during conference negotiations. But my Republican \ncolleagues apparently decided to shift the goalposts.\n  Yesterday, when I asked for consent to proceed with the commitment \nthat the TSA provision not be included in the conference, Senator Lott \nobjected on behalf of Senate Republicans. But this time he would not \nsay why he objected. He just objected.\n  Once we made our intentions clear about their expressed concern, I \ncertainly don't understand why my Republican colleagues continue to \nobject to moving forward to complete action on this bill. Why do they \nkeep shifting the goalposts? Of what are they afraid?\n  This strange behavior is not lost on the American people. Today, \nrepresentatives of the 9/11 victims, their families, let their views be \nheard. I have read their statement into the Record. The American people \nexpect us to finish this work as rapidly as possible.\n  There can be little doubt that America will be more secure when this \nbill is signed into law. That is why I believe we need to take the next \nprocedural step as part of our regular order, which is to appoint \nconferees to finish these negotiations.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I make the following unanimous consent \nrequest: That the homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1 and that the Senate \nthen proceed to its immediate consideration--I am sorry, whenever I see \nthat H.R. 1, it confuses everybody; that is what we\n\n[[Page S8681]]\n\ndid that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that all \nafter enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 4, as passed in \nthe Senate, on March 13, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be \nread a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference \nwith the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, \nwith the above occurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oklahoma object?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, does the Senator from Oklahoma wish to make \na statement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, I do not \nmean to delay this bill. I am on that subcommittee. I worked hard on \nthis bill. I agree with the majority leader that many of those \nrecommendations need to go forward.\n  This bill spends $12 billion over the next 3 years. We have worked \ntirelessly and worked hard. Mr. President, $9 billion of that $12 \nbillion is grants. It is certainly not in the best interest of those \nmost at risk, but I lost that fight. So I am willing to let that go. \nBut the postgrant review process, which we asked for and were told \nwould be in the bill before we went to conference, is not in it. Every \ntime we ask about it, we get pushed back.\n  Until we look at how we are going to spend the money, until we can \nsatisfy that, I don't believe we are ready to go to conference, and I \nalso believe there are still some problems with ports in terms of \nsolving those problems and some of the tier 1 issues we have.\n  My objection is not meant to be dilatory or anything else, other than \nto make the point that if we are going to spend $9 billion in grants to \ncarry these recommendations out--and that is a small portion of the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission, but it is the $9 billion--and \nwe refuse to have a postgrant auditing process where we look to see--\nbecause we know from what IGs have told us and the GAO, much of the \nmoney we have been spending post-9/11 has been wasted, and it hasn't \ngone to prevent the next terrorist act.\n  I have a personal interest as well. I have a daughter who lives in \nNew York City. I want her protected. I don't want to do something that \nmight stop that, but we have to do it in a way that makes us good \nstewards of the taxpayers' money.\n  That is my reason for objecting. It is not on behalf of the \nRepublican leadership. It is on behalf of myself and my staff in trying \nto get good value for our money.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say through the Chair to my friend, I \nguess I will ask the question: Who have you talked to who said you \ncan't have this postaudit program in the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma can answer the \nquestion of the majority leader.\n  Mr. COBURN. My staff has relayed to me, the Federal Financial \nManagement Subcommittee minority staff, who have been working on this \nissue since we passed the bill, relayed to me before I came over that \nthey still will not grant us that access in the bill.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to work with Senator Lieberman. He is a \nperson who has a reputation for being fair. He would be the chair of \nthis conference, as far as I know.\n  I say to my friend, I will be happy to take a look at this issue--no \nguarantees. It sounds reasonable what the Senator is asking. I ask of \nthe Senator, let us go to conference. If something comes back out of \nconference--I will personally look into this. I will talk with Senator \nLieberman about this issue. I don't know the bill that well because it \nhas been through a committee of which I have no knowledge. But give us \na chance. I don't know who the distinguished Republican leader will put \non the conference. This is going to be a real conference, an open \nconference, where people will be able to, in a public meeting, say: I \nwant to offer this amendment, and then the conference can either accept \nit or reject it.\n  I think the Senator from Oklahoma should give us a chance. This is an \nimportant issue. There are provisions that should be implemented--\nshould have been implemented a long time ago.\n  I recognize that the Senator has a daughter in New York. I have \nlistened to my colleague, the senior Senator from New York, on more \nthan one occasion about what the people of New York went through, we \nall went through. America through long-lens glasses watched what \nhappened on 9/11. These people in New York, widows and widowers--and I \nread their names into the Record--have a better feeling about these \nissues and we need to get this done.\n\n  I commit to my friend, the junior Senator from Oklahoma, that I will \npersonally take a look at this issue. I know how thoughtful he is and \nhow he feels about the money that is spent by the American taxpayers. I \nwill make every effort to make sure the Senator from Oklahoma is \ntreated fairly. Even though he is not a member of the conference, I \nwill arrange it, if he is not on the conference committee, he can come \nand talk to the conferees. I will do whatever I can to help alleviate \nany of the concerns he has.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank Majority Leader Reid for \ntrying to move this bill forward.\n  Second, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, I have tremendous respect \nfor my friend from Oklahoma. I regard him truly as a friend. We \ntraveled to China together. He is a gentleman, and I don't think \nanybody doubts the sincerity of his conviction and his desire to save \nand not waste money.\n  Similar to Senator Reid, I am not familiar with the particulars of \nthis provision the Senator wishes to put into the bill, but it seems \nreasonable. I have to tell my friend from Oklahoma, I don't want to see \nmoney wasted. I can tell him that in New York City, we are not wasting \nthe money. In fact, the taxpayers of New York, the city where his one \ndaughter and two of mine reside, as well as my wife and my parents and \nmost of my family, we in New York don't like to see the money wasted. \nWe think too much of it is spread all over the place.\n  I will tell him this: That the money that goes to New York is not \nwasted, No. 1. No. 2, there are areas that affect the whole country \nthat will be held up. Port security--God forbid a nuclear weapon is \nsmuggled into this country and exploded, God forbid. The more we delay \non port security, the worse off we will be. Rail security, truck \nsecurity, and cyber security are all part of this bill.\n  Similar to Senator Reid, it seems to me the proposal the Senator from \nOklahoma is making sounds good. Why not have review? Money wasted on \nthis vital area--it is akin to money from the DOD wasted because it is \nour defense, even though it is our homeland defense as opposed to our \nmilitary defense--hurts all of us.\n  But I can tell him this: I have known Senator Reid a long time. The \nSenator from Oklahoma has known him a little less longer than I. When \nhe makes a commitment to be serious about this issue and to look at it \ncarefully and to give a colleague, such as the Senator from Oklahoma, a \nbird's-eye view of what happens in the conference and the ability to \npush and make changes, he is sincere. He is not trying to put one over \nand push this aside.\n  Also, I am not on the committee, but I will join my colleague from \nOklahoma in wanting a review process. I would like to speak with \nChairman Lieberman and other members of the committee as to why they \ndidn't put this in. I don't know the reason for that. But I can assure \nhim, as somebody who is involved in many parts of the Homeland Security \nbill because of the city and State from which I come, I will work with \nhim because I hate seeing the money wasted. I hate it.\n  In New York City, we are spending money. New York City taxpayers and \nNew York State taxpayers are spending money because we don't think \nthere is enough. I will give one example.\n  I live in Brooklyn. There is the Brooklyn Bridge. Intelligence \nreports\n\n[[Page S8682]]\n\ntargeted the Brooklyn Bridge several years ago, and they know how they \nwould try to blow up the bridge, which is by the two towers, the \ncables. It is a suspension bridge, the first one ever built. Every day \nthere are two police officers at each end of the bridge. That is four \npolice officers 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. We can't do it part time \nif terrorists are going to go after this bridge. So that is 20 police \nofficers per week. It is five shifts to do it 24 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek. That money is coming out of the pockets not of my friend from \nNevada or my friend from Oklahoma but the daughter of the Senator from \nOklahoma, my family, me, city residents. It is not fair.\n  This bill, in terms of helping deal with some of those issues, is \nimportant. In making our homeland secure, it is important.\n  So I make a plea to my friend from Oklahoma--and he is my friend and \nI think every bit of his intentions are honorable, as they almost \nalways are--to let this bill go forward, to take the majority leader's \nword that he will look at this issue himself carefully and make sure \nthe Senator from Oklahoma has the ability to look at it carefully \nbecause this bill has been delayed long enough and the heartfelt pleas \nof the people who Senator Reid mentioned--I know most of them \npersonally, I know about their losses, I know their families a little \nbit--are for real, as are the pleas of everybody else who is involved.\n  So I ask my colleague to consider lifting his objection and letting \nus move forward. There will be plenty of time to object if the \nconference committee doesn't treat him fairly. He can slow this place \ndown and slow the bill down at that point and have the same effect as \ndoing it now, and we might be able to move forward with the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, if I might be recognized, I say to my \ncolleague for New York, I have been working on this for 6 months. This \nisn't new. They knew this was coming. These are commitments that were \nmade that were not kept. This is not a reflection on Senator Lieberman. \nThis is a staff-driven problem. The only leverage I have to get staff \nto do what they are supposed to be doing is this.\n  I apologize to the Senator and to his constituents. If my colleagues \nfix it over the break, when we come back, I would not have any \nobjection.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Is that the Senator's only objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is the only objection I have.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to Senator Coburn, I received a note. \nThis is from Senator Lieberman's staff:\n\n       We have worked very close with Senator Coburn's staff--in \n     particular his subcommittee staff director--Katie French. \n     Coburn's provisions were included in S. 4. The House \n     negotiators opposed them and after long negotiations Katie \n     signed off on our final agreement.\n       Beth worked on this and will send more information in a \n     moment.\n\n  It appears they have worked this out.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have no knowledge, I say to the majority \nleader, that has been worked out. The last memo I have from my staff \ndirector is that it has not. If that is the case, again, I will live up \nto my word that I promised the majority leader and senior Senator from \nNew York that you would not have an objection from me--\n  Mr. REID. If this is the case, tomorrow in the Senator's absence, can \nwe go ahead with this bill?\n  Mr. COBURN. If that is the case, then I don't have a basis for \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8682-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, Chicagoans take our green spaces very \nseriously. In fact, if you look at the great seal of the city of \nChicago, you will see, written in Latin, the city's motto: Urbs in \nHorto--City in a Garden.\n  So it seems only natural that Chicago is home to one of America's \nmost popular and spectacular gardens: the Chicago Botanic Garden.\n  The Botanic Garden is one of the brightest jewels in Chicago's crown \nof great cultural and educational institutions.\n  Since its opening in 1972, the Chicago Botanic Garden has provided a \n385-acre island of beauty and tranquility just outside of one of \nAmerica's biggest and busiest cities.\n  Today, it is the second-most visited public garden in the country, \ndrawing appreciative visitors from throughout the Chicago area and \naround the globe.\n  Part of what makes the Chicago Botanic Garden so extraordinary is the \ndedication, vision and inexhaustible energy of the woman who has served \nas its president for the last 12 years, Barbara Whitney Carr.\n  With a great sense of gratitude--and a touch of sadness I would like \nto wish Barbara Carr well as she prepares to step down from the Botanic \nGarden and begin a new chapter in her life. More importantly, I want to \nthank her for all she has done to make the Chicago Botanic Garden a \nbeautiful oasis, a popular tourist attraction, and an important \nteaching tool.\n  Like Daniel Burnham, the legendary planner who redesigned Chicago \nafter the Great Fire of 1871, Barbara Carr ``make(s) no little plans.''\n  She joined the Botanic Garden as president and CEO in 1995 and \nimmediately set to work developing and carrying out a 10-year, $100 \nmillion improvement plan.\n  Her plan included renovation and construction of eight gardens, as \nwell as the restoration of close to 6 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline.\n  Under her direction, the Chicago Botanic Garden has expanded its \ncollection to include more than 2 million plants.\n  While it is undeniably beautiful, the Chicago Botanic Garden prides \nitself on being more than just a pretty garden. Under Barbara Carr's \nleadership, the garden has truly become a living museum and classroom. \nStudents from the Chicago Public Schools attend programs at the garden \nin which they learn about the science of plants and the importance \npreserving biodiversity.\n  And you don't even have to visit the Botanic Garden to learn from it. \nWorking with the University of Illinois at Chicago, the garden created \nan online, searchable database of plant species that can help even the \nmost inexperienced gardener. It is called eplants.org. If you have a \ngarden you might want to bookmark that site. It is a good one.\n  A few years ago, Barbara Carr realized that in Chicago--one of the \ngreenest cities in the country--there weren't a lot of advanced degree \nprograms in horticulture and botany, and she quickly set about to fill \nthat gap. She initiated the creation of an Academic Affairs Program at \nthe Botanic Garden and teamed with Northwestern University, the \nIllinois Institute of Technology, and the University of Illinois to \ndevelop several outstanding academic programs.\n  In recent years the garden has become the site of cutting edge \nresearch in the fields of botany and environmental conservation.\n  In recent years the garden has become the site of cutting edge \nresearch in the fields of botany and environmental conservation. It is \nhome to an impressive seed repository called the Seeds of Success \nprogram, part of a global initiative to collect and store native seeds \nin order to preserve plant biodiversity.\n  Over the years, both Barbara and the garden have received many \naccolades. The garden was recognized for its educational programs and \ncommunity outreach projects with the National Award for Museum and \nLibrary Service in 2004. This prestigious honor is the highest award \nbestowed upon a museum. Earlier this year, the American Public Garden \nAssociation presented Barbara with the 2007 Award of Merit, the \norganization's highest honor.\n  Before joining the Botanic Garden, Barbara Carr earned a degree from \nDenison University in Ohio. She spent nearly 20 years at the Lincoln \nPark Zoological Society, serving as its executive director and \npresident.\n\n[[Page S8683]]\n\n  To say that Barbara is ``retiring'' somehow doesn't seem quite right. \nIt would be more accurate to say that she is redirecting her energies. \nI have no doubt that Barbara will remain involved in her community and \ncommitted to the many causes in which she believes so deeply. She will \nalso have the opportunity to spend more time with her family: her \nhusband Robert F. Carr III--better known as Tad their six children, and \n11 grandchildren.\n  I join the residents of Chicago, the ``city in a garden,'' in \nthanking Barbara Whitney Carr for helping to create a garden in our \ncity that makes us all proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8683-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RESCUERS FROM EIELSON AIR FORCE BASE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it gives me great pride to salute three \nbrave young airmen stationed at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. SSGt \nBryan Fletcher, SrA Elicia Greer, and SrA John Rogers displayed \nremarkable heroism--and saved a life--on the evening of June 16, 2007.\n  The three airmen were riding recreational vehicles near Jet Ski Lake \nin Fairbanks when they heard a woman scream. They immediately stopped \nto help, and saw an unconscious man about to drown in the lake. Staff \nSergeant Fletcher dove into the water first, followed by Senior Airman \nGreer. They proceeded to pull the man out and began cardiopulmonary \nresuscitation. Senior Airman Rogers, who was riding a distance away, \nsoon arrived to help in this effort.\n  Airmen Fletcher, Greer, and Rogers spent several minutes \nadministering CPR to Joseph Mead before they registered any response. \nAll three took turns performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and \ncompressing Mead's heart. They continued CPR until the University of \nAlaska Fire Department arrived to take over. Mead was safely revived, \ntaken to the hospital, and released the next day with no lasting \ninjuries.\n  The lakeside rescue is not the first time these individuals have \ndisplayed tremendous heroism--each has also served in Iraq with \ndistinction. As veterans of U.S. Army combat convoy duty, they were \ntasked with dangerous and difficult work in the most demanding of \ncircumstances. Like their recent rescue of Joseph Mead, however, no \nchallenge has yet proven too difficult for them to overcome.\n  Staff Sergeant Fletcher hails from McCloud, TX; Senior Airman Greer \nis from Bozeman, MT; and Senior Airman Rogers is from Cumberland Gap, \nTN. They are currently assigned to the 354th Logistics Readiness \nSquadron at Eielson Air Force Base, where they serve Alaska and our \nNation with honor.\n  A few days after the rescue, Joseph Mead's cousin, Ben Saylor, said, \n``This is a reminder that there are good people in this world.'' He is \nright. These airmen epitomize the kind of quiet professionalism and \nunassuming valor our men and women in uniform demonstrate on a daily \nbasis. I join all Alaskans in commending their courageous actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8683-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8683-S8685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are \nconsistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con Res. \n21, the 2008 budget resolution.\n  For 2007, the estimates show that current level spending equals the \nbudget resolution for both budget authority and outlays while current \nlevel revenues exceed the budget resolution by $4.2 billion. For 2008, \nthe estimates show that current level spending is below the budget \nresolution by $928.1 billion for budget authority and $586.7 billion \nfor outlays while current level revenues exceed the budget resolution \nlevel by $34.6 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters and accompanying tables from \nCBO be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2007.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I wish to discuss the confirmation of \nLieutenant General Dell Lee Dailey as the Coordinator in the State \nDepartment's Office of Counterterrorism.\n  Lieutenant General Dailey has had a distinguished military career. \nThere can be no question about that. He is a graduate of West Point and \nhas served as a battalion commander, regiment commander, and assistant \ndivision commander both at posts in the United States and abroad. Most \nrecently, he served as director at the Center for Special Operations at \nMacDill Air Force Base. He has received numerous awards for his \nexcellence including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, two \nDefense Superior Service Medals, three Army Commendation Medals and six \nMeritorious Service Medals. He has spent his entire life defending this \nnation and I thank him for service.\n  The position to which he was confirmed last Friday is that of the \nState Department's Coordinator for the Office of Counterterrorism. \nWhile I did not object to Lieutenant General Dailey's confirmation, as \na member of both the Foreign Relations Committee and the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, I would like to register my concerns.\n  While the nomination of a military official to a civilian post does \nnot by itself cause concerns, this particular position requires an \nability to develop and implement interagency strategies and to \nencourage the use of and mobilize non-DOD assets. In the context of \nthis administration's tendency to employ military options against \nstrategic problems, or to assign nonmilitary functions to the \nDepartment of Defense, it is particularly important that the \nCoordinator for Counterterrorism demonstrate a commitment to expanding \nand utilizing the resources of the State Department, USAID and other \nagencies of the U.S. Government.\n  I have talked with General Dailey and reviewed his writings, \nincluding a 2006 article in which he wrote that Special Operations \nforces, ``doing what they do best,'' are ``developing links within the \npopulation that will provide ongoing intelligence and personal \nrelationships that will cement ties with allies around the world.'' \nWhen it comes to military engagements, Special Operations forces may, \nin fact, have this role. But in most of the countries and regions of \nthe world where we are fighting al-Qaida and seeking to deny it safe \nhaven, these activities should not fall to the Department of Defense. \nIndeed, ``developing links within the population'' and ``cement[ing] \nties with allies around the world'' are the jobs of our diplomats. And, \nin far-flung regions of the world, where a U.S. diplomatic presence or \nforeign aid program can help deny terrorist organizations safe haven, \nwe should be working to expand those efforts, not deferring to the \nDepartment of Defense. This is critical for four reasons. First, our \ndiplomats and foreign assistance professionals have the background and \ntraining to conduct these activities. Second, regardless of the skills \nof Special Operations forces, the very fact that uniformed officers are \nat the forefront of local diplomacy can be counterproductive by \nencouraging or reinforcing perceptions that U.S. policy is driven by \nour military. Third, if policy is to guide counterterrorism efforts--\nand that is the whole point of the Coordinator position--then \ndiplomats, not soldiers, need to be leading the way. And, finally, we \nneed our military to do what it does best in the struggle against al-\nQaida and its allies, and that is conduct tactical operations as well \nas work directly with host country militaries and regional peacekeeping \nforces. The overextension of Special Operations or other military \nforces for other missions takes away from these efforts.\n  We need only look at Africa, where strategic counterterrorism \npolicies are desperately needed, to understand the challenges ahead. In \nSomalia, DOD operations have been conducted in a near policy vacuum. \nTactical efforts have not, and will not, address the conditions that \nhave allowed terrorist organizations safe haven. Yet violence and \ninstability continue to fester, at great cost to our national security, \nwithout adequate diplomatic, humanitarian or foreign assistance \nefforts. Elsewhere on the continent, in regions where extremism can \ntake hold and where terrorist organizations might find sympathetic \npopulations, neither the State Department nor USAID has sought to \nmaintain a presence. Finally, AFRICOM's recent difficulties in finding \na willing host country illustrate how diplomatic initiatives must \nprecede efforts to expand our military footprint. I have supported \nAFRICOM and believe that African nations will recognize what the \ncommand may have to offer, but we must acknowledge that governments and \nlocal populations alike remain skeptical of initiatives that seem \ndriven by our military.\n  It is in this context that I sought from General Dailey an \nunderstanding of this critical position, one whose primary mission is \n``to forge partnerships with non-state actors, multilateral \norganizations, and foreign governments to advance the counterterrorism \nobjectives and national security of the United States.'' At his \nnomination hearing, I asked him the following question:\n\n       What points of collaboration do you see for the relative \n     roles of U.S. military action, military assistance and \n     nonmilitary assistance in the war against international \n     terrorism?\n\n  Lieutenant General Dailey's response was:\n\n       The military has a huge source of non-lethal, non-kinetic \n     resources that Department of State and the other agencies, I \n     think, can rely on to be successful in that portion of the \n     war on terror that gets to the hearts and minds of the \n     people. Civil affairs operations, public diplomacy--right now \n     the Special Operations organizations have about 15 or 20 \n     teams that help in public diplomacy that work specifically \n     for the ambassadors in the embassies. That's just a small \n     snapshot of what the military can bring to the table.\n\n  Unfortunately, this response appears to reflect the mindset of \nsomeone who sees combating terrorism through a military, or at least \nDepartment of Defense, prism. This answer suggests a lack of \nappreciation for the need to incorporate and balance civil, \nintelligence, and military initiatives when coordinating a U.S. \ncounterterrorism strategy. It is not that the answer is wrong; it \nindicates a keen understanding of what the Department of Defense can \nbring to the table. But the Department of Defense does not need more \nchampions in the interagency process. What is needed is a champion for \nthe role of other agencies and departments, for aggressive diplomacy, \nfor expanded foreign assistance efforts, for antipoverty and \nanticorruption programs that complement broader counterterrorism \nstrategies, for effective public diplomacy, and for multilateral \ncooperation, including strengthening regional organizations in places \nlike Africa and rediscovering the common ground with our allies in \nEurope and elsewhere that we had immediately after September 11.\n  I recognize that these challenges present an extremely high bar for \nany nominee. I also recognize that this nomination is colored by the \nfailure of this administration to develop and implement effective \ninteragency counterterrorism strategies. But it is precisely because of \nthe critical importance of this position and the need for the nominee \nto resist this administration's overemphasis on military options that I \nhave regarded General Dailey's nomination with such scrutiny. I do not \nregister these concerns lightly and now that he has been confirmed, I \nlook forward to working with General Dailey on developing coherent and \ncomprehensive counterterrorism strategies, coordinating true \ninteragency efforts and promoting the use of our diplomatic and other \nnonmilitary resources that are so critical to success in the fight \nagainst al-Qaida and its affiliates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8685-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8685-S8686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR CRAIG THOMAS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Craig Thomas was a very good \nfriend. He served in the Senate with great honor and respect for the \ninstitution.\n  I got to know Senator Thomas best through the work of the Finance \nCommittee. Senator Thomas was an active and dedicated participant in \nthe business of the committee from tax policy, to health care, Social \nSecurity and international trade. When I was chairman of the committee, \nI could always count on his diligent, steadfast and\n\n[[Page S8686]]\n\nvaluable involvement in the issues before us. I appreciated greatly his \ncommitment to conservative principles and the responsibilities of \ngoverning.\n  In particular, as chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, Senator Thomas \nwas a strong voice for opening new markets and opportunities for U.S. \nexports. He went above and beyond and engaged himself fully in efforts \nto achieve ambitious outcomes from trade negotiations. He demonstrated \nhis commitment time and again with his own personal time and his \npersonal resolve.\n  Senator Thomas was a true representative for his Wyoming \nconstituents. He worked hard and sincerely for their good and for the \ngood of our Nation every day. He will be missed so very much. Barbara \nand I extend our sincere and deep sympathies to his family and his \nstaff.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to honor the life of \nmy colleague, Senator Craig Thomas.\n  Craig, a real outdoorsman, would say he enjoyed nothing more than a \nhorseback ride through Wyoming's spectacular wilderness area. Despite \nthat, he found himself here in Washington, DC, working for the \nbetterment of his Home State and the Nation. He was outspoken on \ngovernment's need to provide adequate funding for national parks, a \nsubject he knew well as chairman and ranking member of the National \nParks Subcommittee on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  Senator Thomas was also a strong defender of his State's cattle \nindustry and was a firm believer in the virtues of rural America. This \npassion stems back to his time at the University of Wyoming, where he \nreceived a degree in animal husbandry. Senator Thomas also served as an \nofficer in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1955 to 1959, achieving the rank \nof captain, an experience that taught discipline and reinforced his \ncommitment to the United States.\n  Before Craig came to Congress, he served as vice president of the \nWyoming Farm Bureau, and once headed the rural electric trade \nassociation of Wyoming. After 5 years in the Wyoming House, Thomas won \na special election to replace Dick Cheney, who was appointed to be \nSecretary of Defense. As Wyoming's lone Member in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, he had the responsibility of representing over 450,000 \nconstituents. Craig was reelected to that seat in 1990 and 1992, a \ntestament to his ability to serve the people of Wyoming effectively. In \n1994, he ran for the U.S. Senate and won, defeating popular Democratic \nGovernor Mike Sullivan by 20 percentage points. He was elected to a \nsecond term in 2000 with a 74 percent majority, one of the largest \nmargins in Wyoming election history. He was reelected to a third term \nin 2006 with 70 percent of the vote.\n  Senator Thomas had no doubts about who he was or what he represented. \nHe was not one to pick a fight, but if asked how he felt about a given \nissue, he would be sure to give his typically candid and honest \nresponse. When it came to issues he was passionate about, such as \npublic lands and private property, he left little doubt as to his \npriorities. As a member of the Senate Energy Committee, and \nparticularly in his leadership of the National Parks Subcommittee, \nCraig asked tough questions and made strong statements about the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to care for the land it \nalready owned; the fundamental nature of private property rights; and \nCongress's need to consider the interplay between these principles when \ncontemplating new national parks or historic sites. He was always a \nfair broker, and I found on many occasions that he would give my \npriorities fair consideration and due process.\n  I very much regret that Senator Thomas lost his battle to cancer. In \n1970, President Nixon declared war on cancer. Had that war been \nprosecuted with the same diligence as other wars, my former chief of \nstaff, Carey Lackman, a beautiful young lady of 48, would not have died \nof breast cancer. One of my very best friends, a very distinguished \nFederal judge, Chief Judge Edward R. Becker, would not have died of \nprostate cancer. All of us know people who have been stricken by \ncancer, who have been incapacitated with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, \nwho have been victims of heart disease, or many other maladies. I \nsustained an episode with Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer 2 years ago. That \ntrauma, that illness, I think, could have been prevented had that war \non cancer declared by the President of the United States in 1970 been \nprosecuted with sufficient intensity.\n  On a personal level, Senator Thomas had an extraordinary relationship \nwith his wife Susan. As many of my colleagues can attest, Craig and \nSusan were quite inseparable and quick with humor. Even as Craig \nbattled with acute myeloid leukemia he continued to serve in the Senate \nwith extreme vigor and a smile. He leaves behind many friends and \nadmirers, who have tried to emulate his courage, his tenacity, and his \nintegrity.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to Susan, their four children, the \nwhole Thomas family, and his very able staff.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I join so \nmany Americans in mourning the passing of my dear friend and esteemed \ncolleague, Senator Craig Thomas. Craig served the people of Wyoming \nwith great integrity, honesty, and common sense. He was a true American \npatriot and dedicated public servant who never failed to put the best \ninterests of his beloved state and country above personal ambitions.\n  Craig came from humble beginnings, working summers on his family's \ndude ranch near Yellowstone National Park. He earned a degree from the \nUniversity of Wyoming, where he was a respected student and \naccomplished athlete, and from there he went on to serve in the U.S. \nMarine Corps. It was these life experiences that taught Craig the \nvalues of hard work, perseverance, and personal responsibility. These \nprinciples guided him throughout his remarkable career, during which he \nworked for the Wyoming Farm Bureau, the American Farm Bureau, and the \nWyoming Rural Electric Association before winning a special election to \nthe U.S. House of Representatives.\n  In 1994, Craig was elected to the U.S. Senate, and went on to make \nhis mark in a number of areas. He served with distinction on the \nEnergy, Finance, and Agriculture Committees--posts he used to promote \nissues important to his constituents in the rural west and their \nquality of life. As the chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee, \nCraig worked tirelessly to protect America's natural treasures, and as \nthe co-chairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, he made significant \nstrides in improving rural health care infrastructure. No question, \nCraig's numerous accomplishments truly speak volumes about his \ncommitment to the people of Wyoming and our entire Nation.\n  Craig's greatest commitment, however, was to his family. He was \nunwavering in his devotion to his dear wife Susan and his children \nPeter, Patrick, Greg, and Lexie. My husband Bob and I are blessed to \nhave known and worked with Craig, and we keep Susan and the entire \nThomas family in our thoughts and prayers.\n  Craig's memory and legacy indeed live on, across Wyoming, throughout \nthe halls of Congress, in the countless lives he touched, and in the \npublic servants who follow in his footsteps. Our Nation is grateful for \nhis many years of service and positive contributions. May God bless the \nentire Thomas family in this time of sorrow, and may God continue to \nbless his beloved Wyoming and this great land of the free--America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8686-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8686-S8687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CELEBRATING INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

However, our \nforefathers would have to fight 7 more years and draft and ratify the \nConstitution before the principles laid down in the Declaration of \nIndependence could truly begin to be realized.\n  That was just the beginning of our Nation's story. It has taken the \nhard work and dedication of countless Americans to build the great and \nfree Nation we know today. On this day we should pay tribute to the \npioneers who struck out across the frontier to build new lives, the \nindividuals who built the\n\n[[Page S8687]]\n\nroads and bridges that connect the country, the teachers who have \nensured our youth reached their full potential and all Americans who in \ntheir own way have contributed to this Nation.\n  We cannot forget the brave Americans of our armed services who \nthroughout our history have fought and died to preserve the freedom we \nall enjoy, nor those currently serving. On the Fourth of July we must \nalso honor the sacrifice of these men and women.\n  As New Mexicans gather with family and friends to barbecue and watch \nfireworks, I hope they will take a moment to remember the greatness of \nthis Nation and pay tribute to all those who have made it so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8687-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ROSWELL UFO FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I would like to commemorate \nthe 60th anniversary of the Roswell UFO incident.\n  On July 8, 1947, the Roswell Army Air Field, RAAF, issued a statement \nannouncing they had recovered a ``flying disk'' from a nearby ranch. \nThis news release, concerning the landing of a mysterious object, was \nquickly changed. The next day, the RAAF issued a retraction and stated \nthe mysterious object was in fact a downed weather balloon. Although \nRoswell Army Air Field officials had retracted their original statement \nwithin 24 hours, the controversy, which has endured for 60 years, had \nalready begun.\n  The interest ignited by the original ``flying disk'' statement \ncontinues to spark debate for many, not just in the great State of New \nMexico but around the world. Supposed witnesses of the event and UFO \ntheorists to this day claim that the mysterious object was an actual \nalien aircraft. Others hold steadfast in the Air Force's latest \nclassification of the object being a U.S. Government spy balloon. \nRegardless of what was recovered 60 years ago, this notable event has \nbecome part of Roswell and the history of our State.\n  For the past 12 years, the city of Roswell has celebrated this well-\nknown event by holding the Roswell UFO Festival on the town's main \nstreet. Skeptics and alien-enthusiasts alike gather from around the \nglobe to commemorate the incident by partaking in numerous activities \nand programs during a 4-day festival. The people who converge in \nRoswell this year for the festival, July 5--8, are in for an exciting \nweekend, as it promises to be the best in the festival's history. \nLectures, parades, concerts, hot air balloon rides and air shows are \nonly a few of the items on this year's program.\n  I have no doubt the controversy and debate surrounding the events of \n60 years ago will continue. However, as long as we are able to enjoy \nand commemorate such events in our country's history, I look forward to \nmany more festivals such as these that bring people together from \nacross the globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8687-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING SINAI, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Bush made a commitment to the people of Louisiana, \n     in a nationally-covered statement that the federal government \n     would do what was necessary to provide for the recovery of \n     the state and its citizens; and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana has always proposed that \n     the Road Home Program pay for owner-occupied uninsured or \n     underinsured wind damage as well as flood damage within the \n     parameters of the program; and\n       Whereas, in Action Plan Amendment No.1 proposed by the \n     Louisiana Recovery Authority, captioned Action Plan Amendment \n     for Disaster Recovery Funds for the Road Home Housing \n     Programs, which, according to news releases, was approved by \n     the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Affairs in May 2006, \n     it was clearly stated the program proposed to provide ``the \n     full proposed assistance to all of the Louisiana homeowners \n     who suffered major or severe damage'' and stated that ``It is \n     the State's policy that participants in the Homeowner \n     Assistance Program deserve a fair and independent estimate or \n     projection of damages from the storm, regardless of the cause \n     of damage''; and\n       Whereas, according to federal sources, 43,298 homeowners \n     experienced no major flooding but major or severe wind \n     damage; and\n       Whereas, since the adoption of Action Plan Amendment No. 1, \n     the state has experienced increased costs in the program, \n     resulting in a current three billion dollar shortfall, duly \n     from a combination of factors, including an increase in the \n     number of eligible claimants from the original estimates by \n     approximately eleven thousand, more homes severely damaged \n     than originally estimated, increased costs per eligible \n     claimant than originally estimated, lower than anticipated \n     homeowner property insurance claim benefits received from \n     private insurers, and higher than estimated costs of repair \n     and construction. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States and urges and requests the \n     federal administration to fulfill the commitment to the \n     citizens of Louisiana to fully fund recovery from damages \n     resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, to \n     each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States \n     Congress, and to the President of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-143. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to prevent the taxation of rebuilding grants \n     from the state's Road Home program; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 25\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana taxpayers have spent countless hours \n     coping with paperwork and bureaucracy that has inconvenienced \n     them since hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated southern \n     Louisiana in 2005; and\n       Whereas, while the grants themselves are not taxable, the \n     Internal Revenue Service says grant recipients who claimed a \n     storm-related casualty loss would be required to consider all \n     or part of the grant as income; and\n       Whereas, the average Road Home grant is sixty-five thousand \n     dollars; therefore, some recipients would find themselves \n     bumped up to higher tax brackets and would likely have a \n     higher federal income tax liability; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana Department of Revenue has determined \n     that grants would not constitute income for state purposes. \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States and the \n     Internal Revenue Service to take such actions as are \n     necessary to prevent the taxation of rebuilding grants from \n     the state's Road Home program. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America, to the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, \n     and to each member of the Louisiana congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-144. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of Colorado urging Congress to pass the federal \n     ``Gestational Diabetes Act of 2006''; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                      Senate Joint Memorial 07-005\n\n       Whereas, gestational diabetes is one of the most common \n     issues facing pregnant women and their health care providers, \n     and the prevalence of gestational diabetes is increasing; and\n       Whereas, according to the American Diabetes Association, \n     gestational diabetes affects approximately 4-8% of all \n     pregnant women, which is about 135,000 women in the United \n     States each year; and\n       Whereas, according to the Colorado Pregnancy Risk \n     Assessment Monitoring System, gestational diabetes affects \n     approximately 7.5% of all pregnant women in Colorado, which \n     is about 5,000 women in Colorado each year; and\n       Whereas, women who are overweight or obese are at an \n     increased risk for developing gestational diabetes, and other \n     risk factors include genetics, ethnicity, and maternal age; \n     and\n       Whereas, gestational diabetes is associated with more \n     health problems for the mother and child, including an \n     increased risk for birth trauma, induction, and caesarean \n     section; extreme increases in birth weight for children of \n     women who developed gestational diabetes; an increased risk \n     for developing childhood obesity; and putting the mothers and \n     their children at a higher risk of developing Type 2 \n     diabetes; and\n       Whereas, greater understanding is needed by both patients \n     and health care providers on treating and preventing \n     gestational diabetes, especially as there is disagreement \n     among health care providers about how to treat gestational \n     diabetes and the effectiveness of treatments; and\n       Whereas, United States Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton \n     introduced the federal ``Gestational Diabetes Act of 2006'' \n     (GEDI act), which is aimed at lowering the incidence of \n     gestational diabetes, providing funding for research and \n     community education, and preventing women who developed \n     gestational diabetes and their children from developing Type \n     2 diabetes; and\n       Whereas, the GEDI act:\n       Creates a research advisory committee with representatives \n     from federal agencies and health organizations to develop \n     standardizing procedures for gestational diabetes\n\n[[Page S8690]]\n\n     data collection, to set up a method to track mothers who had \n     gestational diabetes and develop methods to prevent these \n     mothers and their children from developing Type 2 diabetes, \n     and to address factors that influence risks for gestational \n     diabetes; and\n       Provides grants to nonprofit organizations and state health \n     agencies to be used for expanding state-based and community-\n     based prevention activities and training for health care \n     providers in helping to prevent gestational diabetes; and\n       Expands basic, clinical, and public health research on \n     gestational diabetes, including therapies for detecting and \n     treating gestational diabetes, facilitating enrollment in \n     clinical trials for populations that disproportionately \n     suffer from gestational diabetes, developing diagnostics, and \n     understanding factors that influence gestational diabetes; \n     and\n       Whereas, the GEDI act is an important step toward a better \n     understanding of gestational diabetes and in lowering the \n     incidence of gestational diabetes in pregnant women. Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-sixth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein, That we, the members of the Colorado \n     General Assembly, respectfully request the Congress of the \n     United States, including the members of Colorado's \n     Congressional delegation, to support the proposed \n     ``Gestational Diabetes Act of 2006''. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Memorial be sent to the \n     Colorado Chapter of the American Diabetes Association, the \n     Colorado Diabetes Prevention Control Program, Senator Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton, the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     and each member of Colorado's Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-145. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Louisiana urging Congress to support efforts, programs, \n     services and advocacy of organizations, such as the American \n     Stroke Association, that work to enhance public awareness of \n     childhood stroke; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 87\n\n       Whereas, a stroke, also known as a ``cerebrovascular \n     accident,'' is an acute neurologic injury that occurs when a \n     blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain \n     is either blocked by a clot or bursts; and\n       Whereas, a stroke is a medical emergency that can cause \n     permanent neurologic damage or death if not promptly \n     diagnosed and treated; and\n       Whereas, twenty-six out of every one hundred thousand \n     newborns and almost three out of every one hundred thousand \n     children have a stroke each year; and\n       Whereas, an individual can have a stroke before birth; and\n       Whereas, stroke is among the top ten causes of death for \n     children in Louisiana, and twelve percent of all children who \n     experience a stroke die as a result; and\n       Whereas, the death rate for children who experience a \n     stroke before the age of one year is the highest out of all \n     age groups; and\n       Whereas, many children who experience a stroke will suffer \n     serious, long-term neurological disabilities, including \n     hemiplegia, which is paralysis of one side of the body, \n     seizures, speech and vision problems, and learning \n     difficulties; and\n       Whereas, those disabilities may require ongoing physical \n     therapy and surgeries; and\n       Whereas, the permanent health concerns and treatments \n     resulting from strokes that occur during childhood and young \n     adulthood have a considerable impact on children, families, \n     and society; and\n       Whereas, very little is known about the cause, treatment, \n     and prevention of childhood stroke; and\n       Whereas, medical research is the only means by which the \n     citizens of the United States and Louisiana can identify and \n     develop effective treatment and prevention strategies for \n     childhood stroke; and\n       Whereas, early diagnosis and treatment of childhood stroke \n     greatly improves the chances that the affected child will \n     recover and not experience a recurrence; and\n       Whereas, all citizens of Louisiana are encouraged to learn \n     more about the impact of childhood stroke on our state. \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     does hereby urge and request the Congress of the United \n     States to support the efforts, programs, services and \n     advocacy of organizations, such as the American Stroke \n     Association, that work to enhance public awareness of \n     childhood stroke. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each member \n     of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-146. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana repealing, rescinding, canceling, \n     voiding, and superseding any and all extant applications by \n     the Legislature of the State of Montana previously made \n     during any legislative session to the Congress to call a \n     convention pursuant to the terms of Article V of the U.S. \n     Constitution for proposing one or more amendments to it; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 38\n\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Montana, acting \n     with the best of intentions, has, at various times and during \n     various sessions, previously made applications to the \n     Congress of the United States of America to call one or more \n     conventions to propose either a single amendment concerning a \n     specific subject or to call a general convention to propose \n     an unspecified and unlimited number of amendments to the \n     United States Constitution, pursuant to the provisions of \n     Article V of the United States Constitution; and\n       Whereas, former Chief Justice of the United States of \n     America Warren E. Burger, former Associate Justice of the \n     United States Supreme Court Arthur J. Goldberg, and other \n     leading constitutional scholars agree that such a convention \n     may propose sweeping changes to the Constitution, any \n     limitations or restrictions purportedly imposed by the states \n     in applying for a convention or conventions to the contrary \n     notwithstanding, thereby creating an imminent peril to the \n     well-established rights of the citizens and the duties of \n     various levels of government; and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States of America \n     has been amended many times in the history of this nation and \n     may be amended many more times, without the need to resort to \n     a constitutional convention, and has been interpreted for \n     more than 200 years and has been found to be a sound document \n     that protects the lives and liberties of the citizens; and\n       Whereas, there is no need for, and rather there is great \n     danger in, a new Constitution or in opening the Constitution \n     to sweeping changes, the adoption of which would only create \n     legal chaos in this nation and only begin the process of \n     another 2 centuries of litigation over its meaning and \n     interpretation. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana, That the Legislature does hereby \n     repeal, rescind, cancel, nullify, and supersede to the same \n     effect as if they had never been passed any and all extant \n     applications by the Legislature of the State of Montana to \n     the Congress of the United States of America to call a \n     convention to propose amendments to the Constitution of the \n     United States of America, pursuant to the terms of Article V \n     of the Constitution, regardless of when or by which session \n     or sessions of the Montana Legislature the applications were \n     made and regardless of whether the applications were for a \n     limited convention to propose one or more amendments \n     regarding one or more specific subjects and purposes or for a \n     general convention to propose an unlimited number of \n     amendments upon an unlimited number of subjects. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the following resolutions and memorials are \n     specifically repealed, rescinded, canceled, nullified, and \n     superseded: Joint Concurrent Resolution No. 2, 1901; House \n     Joint Resolution No. 1, 1905; Senate Joint Resolution No. 1, \n     1907; House Joint Memorial No. 7, 1911; House Joint \n     Resolution No. 13, 1963; and Senate Joint Resolution No. 5, \n     1965. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of Montana \n     urges the Legislatures of each and every state that has \n     applied to Congress to call a convention for either a general \n     or a limited constitutional convention to repeal and rescind \n     the applications. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State is directed to send \n     copies of this resolution to the Secretary of State of each \n     state in the Union, to the presiding officers of both houses \n     of the Legislatures of each state in the Union, to the \n     President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and to the Montana \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-147. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Ohio urging Congress to appropriate full \n     funding for the Adam Walsh Act; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 7\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States passed the Adam \n     Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (the ``Adam \n     Walsh Act'') on July 25, 2006, to protect the public from sex \n     offenders and offenders against children, and President \n     George W. Bush signed the Adam Walsh Act into law on July 27, \n     2006; and\n       Whereas, the Adam Walsh Act establishes a comprehensive \n     national system for the registration of sex offenders and \n     offenders against children that requires the State of Ohio to \n     amend its Sexual Offender Registration and Notification Act; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Adam Walsh Act requires the U.S. Attorney \n     General to implement a Sex Offender Management Assistance \n     program through which the U.S. Attorney General may award \n     grants to states to offset the costs of implementing the Adam \n     Walsh Act and may give bonus payments to states that \n     implement the Adam Walsh Act in a specified period of time. \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 127th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, urge the Congress to \n     appropriate full funding for the Adam Walsh Act; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the President of \n     the United States, to the members of the Ohio Congressional \n     delegation, to the Speaker and the\n\n[[Page S8691]]\n\n     Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to \n     the President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States \n     Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8691-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. KENNEDY, from the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions:\n       Report to accompany S. 845, a bill to direct the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services to expand and intensify programs \n     with respect to research and related activities concerning \n     elder falls (Rept.

A bill to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 to enhance \nthe independence of the Inspectors General, to create a Council of the \nInspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL.

That \nact has provided a layer of accountability in our Government that is \nvery important. Unfortunately, there are still times that the inspector \ngenerals in our Government are not given the respect and deference they \ndeserve. That is why today I am introducing the Improving Government \nAccountability Act.\n  If one thinks about the inspector generals, what they are is a first \nline of defense on behalf of taxpayers and against Government waste and \ninefficiency. They are the first line of defense because they are \ninside Federal agencies. Let's be honest, inspector generals inside \nFederal agencies are facing mountains of waste and inefficiency. If \nthey are to do their jobs the way Congress intended, they must be \nindependent, and their work must be immediately accessible to the \npublic.\n  We have had some troubling incidents over the last several years as \nit relates to the independence, the qualifications and, frankly, the \nintegrity of our inspector generals. That is why this legislation is \nnecessary. That is why this legislation is so important.\n  The legislation will do several things. First, all inspector generals \nwill be appointed for terms of 7 years. That will make sure they cannot \narbitrarily be removed from their position by a department head who is \ngetting nervous about information they are providing to the public in \nterms of accountability.\n  Second, Congress must be notified of the removal of any inspector \ngeneral and, very importantly, the reasons for the removal before they \ncan be removed from office.\n  Third, all inspector generals will have their own legal counsel to \navoid using the agency counsel. This is important because if they are \ngoing to have independence, they must have independent legal advice \nabout their ability to do their job.\n  Fourth, no inspector general can accept a bonus. The bonuses are \ngiven by the heads of the agencies. That is an inherent conflict. If \nyou know that you please the head of your agency and you get more \nmoney, what kind of shortcuts are you going to take? What are you going \nto be willing to gloss over in order not to embarrass the head of that \nagency with information you have discovered about waste and \ninefficiency?\n  Fifth, in the event of a vacancy, the Council on Integrity and \nEfficiency will recommend to the appointing authority three possible \nreplacements. They will not have the ability to dictate the replacement \nfor the IG, but it will provide the appointing authority with three \nqualified people to take\n\n[[Page S8694]]\n\nover the important function of inspector general.\n  Also key in this legislation is that instead of making their annual \nbudget requests to the agencies they oversee, the IG budget requests \nwill go straight to the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, that \nsends the President's budget request to Congress.\n  Next, all inspector general Web sites must be directly accessible \nfrom the home page of the agency. I asked my staff to take a tour \nthrough Government agency Web sites to see how easy it was to find out \nwhat the IGs had been up to in those agencies. It was remarkably \ndifficult. In many instances we couldn't even find the inspector \ngeneral's information on the home page of that agency. The public ought \nto be able to go on the page of any Federal agency and immediately \nclick on the last inspector general report, find out what that \ninspector general found and, frankly, ought to be able to ask the \nquestion, what has been done about it. There will be a way for the \npublic to anonymously send allegations of waste, fraud, and abuse \ndirectly to the IG offices.\n  Our office found that only three of 27 sampled Federal agencies have \nan obvious direct link from their home page to the IG's Web site. \nClearly, we are not focused on making this information available to the \npublic. Frankly, all the auditors in the world, all the inspector \ngenerals in the world do no good if the public can't learn the \ninformation. Because if the public doesn't know about it, it isn't \ngoing to have the cleansing effect it should. Only six of the 27 \nsampled IGs have an obvious direct link on their home page to report \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. That is very important.\n  I give credit to Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee who has been \nworking on this legislation in the House. I am excited to join him in \nthis effort. Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman have some of these \nprovisions in their Accountability in Government Contracting Act, of \nwhich I am also proud to be a cosponsor.\n  There have been specific examples that have occurred recently. I \nwon't go into them other than to say, we had one Commerce IG who \nrefused to resign after an investigation showed that he had committed \nmalfeasance in office. However, after much pressure from Congress, he \nfinally did step down. We have another inspector general who has been \naccused of trying to block the serving of a search warrant at NASA. \nThink about that, trying to block the serving of a search warrant that \nhad been issued by a court of law. We have another IG who was not \nreappointed by President Bush and said publicly it was because at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, he was seen as a traitor, and he was \nintimidated about not issuing reports that might reflect badly on the \nagency.\n  Bottom line, we should protect inspector generals. They are precious. \nThey are important to what we do. We can talk all we want about \noversight, but if we can't get the information from inside these \nagencies, frankly, we are not going to be effective in Congress with \nany kind of oversight. The information the inspector generals provide \nis crucial to Congress and crucial to the public. This legislation \nwould make sure that they are qualified, protected, independent, and \nthe public knows what they are up to.\n  I urge my colleagues to get excited about this legislation and maybe, \nuncharacteristically, move it quickly through the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1726. A bill to regulate certain State taxation of interstate \ncommerce, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to speak about the bill I am \nintroducing today with Senator Crapo, the Business Activity Tax \nSimplification Act of 2007. Our bill tries to address a very important \nquestion: How should States tax businesses that locate their operations \nin a few States, but have customers and earn income in many States? \nThis issue has grown in importance in recent years, and the Supreme \nCourt's decision last week not to get involved in the issue raises the \nstakes even further.\n  The crux of the issue is this: A majority of States impose corporate \nincome and other so-called ``business activity taxes'' only when \ncompanies have ``physical presence,'' such as employees or property, in \ntheir States. However, some States contend that the mere presence of a \nbusiness's customers, or an ``economic presence,'' is all that is \nnecessary to impose a business activity tax. These companies are facing \na confusing and costly assortment of State and local tax rules, some \nenacted by legislatures and others imposed upon them by State revenue \nauthorities and upheld by State courts.\n  Senator Crapo and I introduced similar legislation in the 109th \nCongress to try to address this problem of double taxation and tax \npractices that vary from State to State. That bill came close to \npassing the House, but some last-minute objections were raised. Now, \nthe need for legislation and congressional action has taken on new \nurgency, and we have revised the bill to address many of the concerns \nexpressed last year.\n  Just last week, the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in two cases \nthat challenged the constitutionality of State taxation of out-of-State \ncompanies with no physical presence in a State. The States involved in \nthese cases, West Virginia and New Jersey, asserted theories of \neconomic nexus to tax out-of-State corporations. They claimed that \nbecause some customers of such corporations reside in the State, even \nthough the corporation is not physically present, they are subject to \nbusiness activity taxes.\n  The first case involves a credit card company headquartered in \nDelaware. The bank issued credit cards nationwide, including credit \ncards issued to West Virginia customers. The bank had no property or \nemployees, no office or any other physical presence, in the State. The \nsecond case involves a Delaware holding company that licensed \nintellectual property trademarks and trade names to a customer that \ndoes business in New Jersey. The holding company itself had no offices, \nemployees, or property in New Jersey, and did not otherwise have a \nphysical presence in the State. In both cases, the State courts ruled \nthat the out-of-State corporation was taxable.\n  What is so disappointing about the Supreme Court's silence on this \nissue is the fact that these State court decisions conflict with an \nearlier Supreme Court ruling. In 1992, in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, \nthe Supreme Court prohibited States from forcing out-of-State \ncorporations from collecting sales and use tax, unless the corporation \nhas a physical presence in the taxing State. However, some State courts \nhave held that the physical presence test established by Quill creates \nno such limitations on the imposition of business activity taxes.\n\n  Currently, 19 States take the position that a State has the right to \ntax a business merely because it has a customer within the State, even \nif the business has no physical presence in the State whatsoever.\n  These States' actions in pursuing these taxes have caused uncertainty \nand widespread litigation, so much so that it has created a chilling \neffect on foreign and interstate commerce. I have spoken out against \ndouble taxation on many issues in the past, and the double tax in these \ncases, while not as large, is just as wrong.\n  Let me be clear about this: I know that several Governors and State \nrevenue commissioners have spoken out against the legislation because \nthey don't like the Federal Government telling them what they can and \ncannot tax. They are also concerned about any revenue they might lose \nas a result. But if the States are collecting a tax they shouldn't be \ncollecting in the first place, the fact that they might lose a small \namount of revenue is not the most persuasive argument, in my view.\n  I believe Congress has a responsibility to create a uniform nexus \nstandard for tax purposes so that goods and services can flow freely \nbetween the States. Firm guidance on what activities can be conducted \nwithin a State will provide certainty to tax administrators and \nbusinesses, reduce multiple taxation or the same income, and will \nreduce compliance and enforcement costs for States and businesses \nalike.\n  The last time Congress acted on this issue was in 1959, when Public \nLaw 86-272 was enacted to prohibit States from imposing ``income \ntaxes'' on sales of ``tangible personal property'' by a business whose \nsole activity within a State\n\n[[Page S8695]]\n\nwas soliciting sales. No one can deny that in the almost 50 years \nsince, interstate commerce has taken on a whole new character. New \ntechnologies allow companies headquartered in one State to provide \nservices to consumers across the country. The Internet is replacing \nbricks-and-mortar stores. Companies and consumers are increasingly \nlinked across State lines.\n  The Business Activity Tax Simplification Act of 2007 addresses these \nchanges over the last 48 years both modernizing Public Law 86-272 and \ncodifying the physical presence standard. Our bill extends the \nprotections of the 1959 law to include solicitation activities \nperformed in connection with all sales and transactions, not just sales \nof tangible personal property. The bill protects the free flow of \ninformation, including broadcast signals from outside the State, from \nbecoming the basis for taxation of out-of-State businesses.\n  BATSA also protects activities where the business is a consumer in \nthe State. It makes little sense to impose tax on out-of-State \nbusinesses that purchases goods or services from an in-State company. \nObviously, in this very common scenario, the out-of-State business is \nnot using these goods or services to generate any revenue in the State. \nWhy should they be subject to tax?\n  Most importantly, BATSA codifies the physical presence standard. \nStates and localities can only impose business activity taxes on \nbusinesses within their jurisdiction that have employees in the State, \nor real or tangible personal property that is either leased or owned. \nIt is consistent with current law and sound tax policy, which holds \nthat a tax should not be imposed by a State unless that State provides \nbenefits or protections to the taxpayer. Further, the physical presence \nstandard is the basis for each and every one of our treaties with \nforeign nations--adoption of a more nebulous standard by the States \nundermines these international treaties.\n  We need to act now. Already, State legislatures are interpreting the \ncourt's denial of cert as an affirmation of their position that they \nare free to enact whatever policies affecting interstate commerce that \nare beneficial to their particular State revenue needs, regardless of \nthe national impact. Because the court will not review their nexus \nstandard and Congress has not acted, States now have an ideal \nopportunity to raise revenues from out-of-State corporations regardless \nof the national impact.\n  Only 3 days after the Supreme Court denied cert, the New Hampshire \nAssembly added an amendment to the State budget at 3:40 a.m. to allow \nthe State to collect revenue from out-of-State businesses. The denial \nof cert thereby resulted almost immediately in a $10 million to $100 \nmillion windfall for New Hampshire. No one can deny that this was an \nextremely aggressive action; why else would the legislature have taken \nsuch drastic measures to tack on this amendment it? the wee hours of \nthe morning?\n  States are clearly overreaching in their efforts to collect these \ntaxes, and it creates a difficult situation for businesses. It is \nlaughable to think that a company would decide to cut off all \ntransactions with individuals within a certain State to avoid similar \nlaws. And so they will have to start paying taxes to States where they \nstart generating no revenue, hiring no employees, and contributing \nnothing to the State's economy from their phantom presence aside from \nthese taxes. But these companies are not going to stand idly by and be \ndouble-taxed; they will simply declare less income in their home States \nas a result.\n  I know that my legislation with Senator Crapo has raised concerns in \nthe past. The States have argued that BAT legislation represents an \nintrusion into their authority to govern. But I believe the contrary: A \nfundamental aspect of American federalism is that Congress has the \nauthority and responsibility under the commerce clause to ensure that \ninterstate commerce is not burdened by State actions.\n  In fact, the exercise of such congressional power is necessary in \norder to prevent excessive burdens from being placed on businesses \nengaged on interstate activity by virtue of their customer's residing \nin a particular State. Congress must act to ensure certainty, \npredictability, and fairness of taxation of multistate corporations. \nThe lack of a bright-line physical presence standard encourages each \nState to act in its own self interest by taking action to maximize its \nrevenues, regardless of the potential double taxation that results.\n  Let me address a few concerns that have been raised about the bill. \nOpponents claim that BATSA includes so many exceptions to the physical \npresence standard that large, multistate companies will utilize the \nlegislation to ensure they pay minimum State tax nationwide. But our \nbill explicitly States that it preserves States' authority to adopt or \ncontinue to use their own tax compliance tools.\n  In response to those who say that this legislation will be a huge hit \nto State budgets, the figures just don't add up. There have been a \nnumber of studies done, but even the highest revenue estimate \nrepresents only a very small percentage of the total amount of business \nactivity taxes collected by the States. The studies leave out one \nimportant fact, however: Companies affected by double-taxation are \ngoing to declare less income in their home States, if they have to pay \ntaxes on that same income to another State.\n  Let me cite just one example from a company in my State. In 2005, \nCitigroup paid 63 percent of all it State and local taxes to New York \nState and New York City, all based on physical presence in the State \nand the city. As more States follow the lead of New Hampshire, the city \nand State of New York will be getting less from Citibank, one way or \nanother, as they won't want to be double taxed, once by New York \nbecause of our physical presence and again in New Hampshire and other \nStates because they have customers in those States. This is why any \nrevenue loss estimates from any city or State are overblown.\n  In short, this is no longer a theoretical discussion. Federal \nlegislation is required to stop this food fight.\n  I believe that Congress has a duty to prevent some States from \nimpeding the free flow and development of interstate commerce and to \nprevent double taxation. That is why I am asking my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, including the chairman and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, to carefully consider this legislation.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from New \nYork, Senator Schumer, for the work he has done on this bill. He shares \nmy grave concerns about the devastating impact that legal \ninterpretations of Public Law 86-272 are having on foreign and \ninterstate commerce. I'm pleased that we can work together in a \nbipartisan effort to make changes to a law that is in serious need of \nupdating and clarification in view of the more service-oriented economy \nwe have today driven in large part by modern technology's profound \ntransformation of business transactions. This is why we are introducing \nthe Business Activity Tax Simplification Act of 2007, or BATSA, today.\n  Congress has a Constitutional responsibility to ensure that \ninterstate commerce is not unduly burdened by State actions, including \nunfair and burdensome taxation of such commerce. Public Law 86-272 was \nenacted almost 50 years ago, for just these purposes. Ways of \nconducting multi-state business have changed, and, in the absence of \nany clarifying legislation, some state courts have interpreted taxation \nactivity under an ``economic presence'' approach. This approach does \nnot reflect the intent or spirit of the Commerce Clause of the \nConstitution; furthermore, it creates a climate of uncertainty that \ninhibits business expansion and innovation. Businesses have to take \ninto account the very real possibility that they will be taxed multiple \ntimes for the same business activity. These ``business activity taxes'' \nare certainly appropriate when a business has a physical presence in a \nState; these taxes are inappropriate when imposed by a State where that \nbusiness's customer happens to reside, but in which the business has no \nphysical presence.\n  States' efforts to impose improper business activity taxes have been \nfurthered by the Supreme Court's recent silence on this issue. Recent \nState court rulings are in conflict with the high Court's ruling in \nQuill Corp. v. North Dakota in 1992. In that ruling,\n\n[[Page S8696]]\n\nthe Supreme Court prohibited States from forcing out-of-state \ncorporations to collect sales and use taxes unless such corporation had \na physical presence in the taxing State. As my colleague from New York \npointed out a few minutes ago, State courts in both New Jersey and West \nVirginia have held that the physical presence test in Quill only \napplies to sales and use taxes, not business activity taxes. I share my \ncolleague's deep concern with the fact that the appeals of these two \ncases to the Supreme Court were denied certiorari just last week. This \ndenial underscores the urgency of BATSA.\n  This effort by a large number of States to impose business activity \ntaxes based on economic presence has the potential to open a Pandora's \nBox of negative implications for businesses. Without clarification by \nCongress, States will be free to enact revenue-raising nexus \nlegislation and policies that, by definition, will not and cannot take \ninto account the national impact of such activities. The eleventh-hour \nenactment of economic nexus legislation by the New Hampshire State \nLegislature just days after the Supreme Court denial of certiorari in \nthe New Jersey and West Virginia cases is a sign of things to come. For \nmany businesses, this will serve as a death knell for growth and \nexpansion.\n  BATSA will help clarify the intent of Public Law 86-272. BATSA \ncodifies the ``physical presence'' standard and will eliminate \nconfusion for State tax administrators and businesses alike. It's \nconsistent with current law and the notion that a tax should not be \nimposed by a State unless that State provides benefits or protections \nto the taxpayer. BATSA clarifies that an out-of-state business must \nhave nexus under both the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause. \nThis standard is also consistent with the standards we have in place \nwith regard to our trading partners abroad.\n  BATSA modernizes Public Law 86-272 by extending the protections under \nthat law to include solicitation activities performed in connection \nwith all sales and transactions, not just tangible personal property. \nBATSA applies to all business activity taxes, not just net income \ntaxes. This includes gross receipts taxes, gross profits taxes, single \nbusiness taxes, franchise taxes, capital stock taxes and business and \noccupation taxes. It does not apply to transaction taxes such as sales \nand use taxes.\n  BATSA protects the free flow of information, critical in our modern \nera of Internet business and protects the activities where the business \nis a consumer in that State. And, as my colleague, Senator Schumer, \nrightly pointed out, it is counterintuitive to impose taxes on an out-\nof-state company purchasing goods or services from an in-State company, \nsince the out-of-state company isn't generating any revenue for the \nState.\n  BATSA upholds the approach of disregarding certain de minimus \nactivities codified in Public Law 86-272.\n  States have argued that BATSA will result in substantial lost State \ntax revenue. In fact, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nprojected total loss of revenue to states from BATSA in year one of \nenactment represents just 0.2 percent of all State and local taxes paid \nby businesses in 2005. And the CBO cost estimate is actually less than \nthe cost claimed by the National Governor's Association in its own \nrevenue estimates.\n  I will tell you what BATSA does not do. BATSA does not help large \ncompanies avoid paying their fair share of State taxes, stating \nexplicitly that States retain the authority to adopt or continue to use \nanti-tax avoidance compliance tools. It expressly endorses statutory \nand regulatory tools at States' disposal to combat tax abuse. Industry \nand activity-specific safe harbors included in prior bills do not exist \nin this legislation.\n  In the glaring absence of Supreme Court clarification on Quill Corp. \nv. North Dakota, and in the presence of confusing state court \ninterpretations of that decision and ongoing, and legally-creative \nrevenue-raising schemes by States, it's imperative that Congress act \nnow to preserve the free flow of commerce between States. The Business \nActivity Tax Simplification Act of 2007 provides that clarification. \nBATSA ensures that one standard of taxation applies for taxing multi-\nstate companies, so that companies are not unjustly taxed multiple \ntimes by different States on the same income. I hope that our \ncolleagues here in the Senate will support this important legislation \nthat will protect the business expansion in our country that keeps our \neconomy competitive and thriving.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Chambliss, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. \n        Voinovich):\n  S. 1727. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a credit against income tax for certain educator expenses, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my good friends, \nSenators Warner, Chambliss, Snowe, Isakson, Lugar, Cornyn, Coleman, and \nVoinovich, to introduce the Teacher Tax Credit Act of 2007.\n  As we approach the end of the school year, it is appropriate once \nagain to consider tax relief to help cover the out-of-pocket expenses \nour Nation's teachers incur to improve the education of our children.\n  Many times in the past, we have come to the floor to offer \nlegislation on this subject. In 2001, Senator Warner and I offered \nlegislation which resulted in the enactment of the existing $250 \nteacher tax deduction. That deduction expires at the end of this year. \nEarlier this session, Senator Warner and I offered legislation to make \nthat deduction permanent, raise it to $400, and expand it to cover \nprofessional development expenses.\n  Today, we introduce legislation that would provide teachers with an \nalternative tax credit for books, supplies, and equipment they purchase \nfor their students, as well as for professional development expenses. \nThe tax credit would be set at 50 percent of such expenditures so that \nteachers would receive 50 cents of tax relief for every dollar of their \nown money they spend, up to $300.\n  Our rationale in proposing a tax credit as an alternative to the \nexisting deduction is simple, deductions only reduce tax liability \nindirectly, by reducing taxable income. The value of the deduction is \nequal to the taxpayer's marginal tax rate, or what we call their tax \n``bracket.'' For example, for teachers in the 25 percent tax bracket, a \n$100 deduction would reduce their tax liability by 25 percent, or $25.\n  By contrast, the tax credit we are proposing would reduce the amount \nof taxes paid by a teacher by 50 percent for each dollar that a teacher \nspends on school supplies or professional development expenses, \nregardless of the tax bracket the teacher is in. A teacher who took the \nmaximum credit amount of $300 would save 50 percent of that amount--\n$150--in taxes.\n  We have made an effort to ensure that the tax benefit we are \nproposing will make all teachers who use it better off, relative to the \ncurrent deduction. Let me take a moment to explain how we have done \nthis: first, the tax credit is structured as an alternative teachers \ncan choose either the deduction or the credit, whichever works best for \ntheir tax situation. Second, the level of the credit, if adopted in its \npresent form, would provide a net after-tax benefit of $150. This is \nsignificantly higher than the net after-tax benefit that most teachers \ncan receive using the current $250 deduction.\n  It is even higher than the net after-tax benefit that would result \nfrom the $400 deduction Senator Warner and I proposed earlier this \nyear. Teachers in the 25 percent tax bracket would get a net after-tax \nbenefit of $100 from a $400 deduction, so they will see an increase of \n$50 under the credit system that we are proposing today. Even teachers \nin the highest tax bracket, which is currently set at 35 percent, would \nsee a small increase in the net benefit they would receive under this \ncredit, compared to a $400 deduction.\n  I should also note that some teachers make so little they do not even \nhave the tax liability to offset this credit. To make sure these \nteachers are also compensated for the money they spend on classroom \nsupplies and professional development, the credit Senator Warner and I \nare proposing is fully refundable.\n  It is remarkable how much the average teacher spends every year out \nof\n\n[[Page S8697]]\n\nhis or her own pocket to buy supplies and other materials for their \nstudents. Many of us are familiar with a survey of the National \nEducation Association that found that teachers spend, on average, $443 \na year on classroom supplies. Other surveys show that they are spending \neven more than that.\n  The NEA's data also shows that the average teacher in the U.S. still \ndoes not make $50,000, and in many States, including Maine, they \naverage less than $40,000. When you realize that the average teacher is \nnot particularly well paid, it speaks volumes about their dedication \nthat they are willing to make that kind of investment to support the \nteaching they provide to their students.\n  Indeed, I have spoken to dozens of teachers in my home State who tell \nme they routinely spend far in excess of the $300 credit limit on \nmaterials they use in their classrooms. At every school I visit, I find \nteachers who are spending their own money to improve the educational \nexperiences of their students by supplementing classroom supplies. Year \nafter year, these teachers spend hundreds of dollars on books, bulletin \nboards, computer software, crayons, construction paper, tissue paper, \nstamps and inkpads. For example, Anita Hopkins and Kathi Toothaker, \nelementary school teachers from Augusta, Maine, purchase books for \ntheir students to have as a classroom library as well as workbooks and \nsight cards. They also purchase special prizes for positive \nreinforcement for students. Mrs. Hopkins estimates that she spends $800 \nto $1,000 of her own money on extra materials to make learning fun and \nto create a stimulating learning experience.\n  It is important that this credit also be available to teachers who \nincur expenses for professional development. While this tax relief \nprovides modest assistance to educators, it is my view that students \nare its ultimate beneficiaries. Studies consistently show that well-\nqualified teachers, and involved parents, are the most important \ncontributors to student success. Educators themselves understand just \nhow important professional development is to their ability to make a \npositive impact in the classroom. Teachers in Maine repeatedly tell me \nthat they need, and want, more professional development. But tight \nschool budgets often make funds to support this development impossible \nto get. By providing a credit for professional development expenses, \nthis amendment will help teachers take that additional course or pursue \nthat advanced degree that will make them even better at what they love \nto do.\n  Our bill makes it a priority to reimburse educators for just a small \npart of what they invest in our children's future. It is both sound \neducation policy and sensible tax policy. I hope our colleagues will \njoin us in support of this important initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2007.\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     Senator John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Warner: On behalf of the National \n     Education Association's (NEA) 3.2 million members, we would \n     like to express our strong support for your proposal to \n     create a tax credit for educators' classroom supply and \n     professional development expenses. We thank you for your \n     continued leadership and advocacy on this important issue.\n       As you know, educators across the country make considerable \n     financial sacrifices as they reach into their own pockets to \n     purchase classroom supplies. Studies show that teachers spend \n     more of their own funds each year to supply their classrooms, \n     including purchasing essential items such as pencils, glue, \n     scissors, and facial tissues. For example, NEA's 2003 report \n     Status of the American Public School Teacher, 2000-2001 found \n     that teachers spent an average of $443 a year on classroom \n     supplies. More recently, the National School Supply and \n     Equipment Association found that in 2005-2006, educators \n     spent out of their own pockets an average of $826.00 for \n     supplies and an additional $926 for instructional materials, \n     for a total of $1,752.\n       By creating a tax credit, your legislation would reduce the \n     amount of taxes paid by a teacher by 50 percent for each \n     dollar he or she spends on school supplies. Thus, a teacher \n     taking the maximum credit of $300 would save $150 in taxes, \n     regardless of his or her tax bracket. As a result, your bill \n     will make a real difference for many educators, who often \n     must sacrifice other personal needs in order to pay for \n     classroom supplies.\n       NEA also strongly supports your proposal to cover out-of-\n     pocket professional development expenses under the tax \n     credit.

Your bill \n     will make a critical difference in helping educators access \n     quality training.\n       We thank you again for your work on this important \n     legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you \n     to support our nation's educators.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diane Shust,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n     Randall Moody,\n       Manager of Federal Advocacy.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support, once again, of \nAmerica's teachers by joining with Senator Collins in introducing the \nTeacher Tax Credit Act of 2007. Other original cosponsors of this bill \ninclude Senators Chambliss, Coleman, Cornyn, Isakson, Lugar, Snowe, and \nVoinovich.\n  Senator Collins and I have worked closely for some time now in \nsupport of legislation to provide our teachers with tax relief in \nrecognition of the many out-of-pocket expenses they incur as part of \ntheir profession. In the 107th Congress, we were successful in \nproviding much needed tax relief for our Nations' teachers with passage \nof H.R. 3090, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.\n  This legislation, which was signed into law by President Bush, \nincluded the Collins/Warner Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001 provisions \nthat provided a $250 above-the-line deduction for educators who incur \nout-of-pocket expenses for supplies they bring into the classroom to \nbetter the education of their students. These important provisions \nprovided almost half a billion dollars worth of tax relief to teachers \nall across America in 2002 and 2003.\n  In the 108th Congress we were able to successfully extend the \nprovisions of the Teacher Tax Relief Act for 2004 and 2005. In the \n109th Congress we were able to successfully extend the provisions for \n2006 and 2007.\n  While these provisions will provide substantial relief to America's \nteachers, our work is not yet complete.\n  It is now estimated that the average teacher spends $826 out of their \nown pocket each year on classroom materials--materials such as pens, \npencils, and books. First-year teachers spend even more. Why do they do \nthis? Simply because school budgets are not adequate to meet the costs \nof education. Our teachers dip into their own pocket to better the \neducation of America's youth.\n  Moreover, in addition to spending substantial money on classroom \nsupplies, many teachers spend even more money out of their own pocket \non professional development. Such expenses include tuition, fees, \nbooks, and supplies associated with courses that help our teachers \nbecome even better instructors.\n  The fact is that these out-of-pocket costs place lasting financial \nburdens on our teachers. This is one reason our teachers are leaving \nthe profession. Little wonder that our country is in the midst of a \nteacher shortage.\n  Accordingly, Senator Collins and I have joined together to take \nanother step forward by introducing legislation today that creates a \nrefundable tax credit for teachers. The Teacher Tax Credit Act of 2007 \nwill simply provide a refundable tax credit up to $150 for classroom \nexpenses and professional development expenses.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the end of \nmy statement the attached letter from the National Education \nAssociation endorsing the Collins-Warner Teacher Tax Credit Act of \n2007. I will also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the end of my statement the attached letter from the Virginia \nEducation Association endorsing the Collins-Warner Teacher Tax Credit \nAct of 2007.\n  Mr. President, our teachers have made a personal commitment to \neducate the next generation and to strengthen America. In my view, the \nFederal Government should recognize\n\n[[Page S8698]]\n\nthe many sacrifices our teachers make in their career.\n  In addition to the refundable tax credit legislation that we are \nintroducing today, earlier this year Senator Collins and I introduced \nS. 505, The Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2007. S. 505 will build upon \ncurrent law by increasing the above-the-line deduction, as President \nBush has called for, from $250 allowed under current law to $400; \nallowing educators to include professional development costs within \nthat $400 deduction; and making the teacher tax relief provisions in \nthe law permanent.\n  The Teacher Tax Credit Act of 2007 is another step forward in \nproviding our educators with the recognition they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 27, 2007\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     Senator John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Warner: On behalf of the National \n     Education Association's (NEA) 3.2 million members, we would \n     like to express our strong support for your proposal to \n     create a tax credit for educators' classroom supply and \n     professional development expenses. We thank you for your \n     continued leadership and advocacy on this important issue.\n       As you know, educators across the country make considerable \n     financial sacrifices as they reach into their own pockets to \n     purchase classroom supplies. Studies show that teachers spend \n     more of their own funds each year to supply their classrooms, \n     including purchasing essential items such as pencils, glue, \n     scissors, and facial tissues. For example, NEA's 2003 report \n     Status of the American Public School Teacher, 2000-2001 found \n     that teachers spent an average of $443 a year on classroom \n     supplies. More recently, the National School Supply and \n     Equipment Association found that in 2005-2006, educators \n     spent out of their own pockets an average of $826.00 for \n     supplies and an additional $926 for instructional materials, \n     for a total of $1,752.\n       By creating a tax credit, your legislation would reduce the \n     amount of taxes paid by a teacher by 50 percent for each \n     dollar he or she spends on school supplies. Thus, a teacher \n     taking the maximum credit of $300 would save $150 in taxes, \n     regardless of his or her tax bracket. As a result, your bill \n     will make a real difference for many educators, who often \n     must sacrifice other personal needs in order to pay for \n     classroom supplies.\n       NEA also strongly supports your proposal to cover out-of-\n     pocket professional development expenses under the tax \n     credit. Teacher quality is the single most critical factor in \n     maximizing student achievement. Ongoing professional \n     development is essential to ensure that educators stay up-to-\n     date on the skills and knowledge necessary to prepare \n     students for the challenges of the 21st century. Your bill \n     will make a critical difference in helping educators access \n     quality training.\n       We thank you again for your work on this important \n     legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you \n     to support our nation's educators.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diane Shust,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n     Randall Moody,\n       Manager of Federal Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Virginia Education Association,\n\n                                      Richmond, VA, June 28, 2007.\n     Senator John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: On behalf of the members of the \n     Virginia Education Association, I am delighted and proud that \n     you are again proposing to create a tax credit for educators' \n     classroom supply and professional development expenses. \n     Virginia teachers and I appreciate your continued leadership \n     on this matter because it obviously affects Virginia \n     educators--and educators around the nation--directly in the \n     pocketbook.\n       As I'm sure you are aware, the National Education \n     Association reported in a study entitled the Status of the \n     American Public School Teacher, 2000-2001 that teachers spent \n     an average of $443 a year on classroom supplies. Since that \n     time, the average spending for supplies and materials is \n     estimated to have increased to over $1,750 annually. Add to \n     that the out of pocket expense of professional development \n     and you realize the sacrifice and commitment of our nation's \n     teachers to a quality education for their classrooms and the \n     professional commitment they have for themselves.\n       The bill you are sponsoring with Senator Collins recognizes \n     teachers' dedication and will make a significance difference \n     for many educators. Again, I thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Princess Moss,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                   Virginia Education Association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 1729. A bill to amend titles 18 and 28 of the United States Code \nto provide incentives for the prompt payments of debts owed to the \nUnited States and the victims of crime by imposing surcharges on unpaid \njudgments owed to the United States and to the victims of crime, to \nprovide for offsets on amounts collected by the Department of Justice \nfor Federal agencies, to increase the amount of special assessments \nimposed upon convicted persons, to establish an Enhanced Financial \nRecovery Fund to enhance, supplement, and improve the debt collection \nactivities of the Department of Justice, to amend title 5, United \nStates Code, to provide to assistant United States attorneys the same \nretirement benefits as are afforded to Federal law enforcement \nofficers, and for authorized purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Cochran to \nintroduce a bill that will provide parity between the retirement \nbenefits granted to assistant U.S. attorneys and those granted to other \nFederal law enforcement officers.\n  There are 5,500 assistant U.S. attorneys in 93 offices throughout the \nUnited States, all of whom are serving on the front lines to uphold the \nrule of law. Having served as a prosecutor for many years in Vermont, I \nknow well the integral role prosecutors play in the administration of \njustice. Prosecutors are a crucial component of our justice system, and \nshould be recognized as such when they reach the end of their careers.\n  Probation officers, deputy marshals, corrections officers, and even \ncorrections employees not serving in a law enforcement role receive \nenhanced benefits greater than those received by assistant U.S. \nattorneys. This is an inequity that should be remedied. By correcting \nthis disparity, Congress would also help the Federal justice system \nretain experienced prosecutors. Of all the prosecutors who leave the \ngovernment for the private sector, 60 to 70 percent do so with \nexperience of between 6 and 15 years. With the Department of Justice's \nrapidly expanding role in combating terrorism, we cannot afford to lose \nthe experienced men and women who serve in this vital role.\n  This legislation also addresses concerns about the cost to the \nFederal Government of providing enhanced retirement benefits to \nassistant U.S. attorneys. Proponents of the bill have helped craft \nprovisions that would assist the Department of Justice in recovering \nmoney owed to the Federal Government as a result of judgments and other \nfines. By bolstering the Department's ability to collect the funds it \nis owed, resources would be freed up to provide the parity in \nretirement benefits sought by assistant U.S. attorneys. The result of \nthe creative efforts to fund these benefits in an alternative manner is \nthat the Department of Justice will, through its duties as the Nation's \nlaw enforcement agency, be able to provide the benefits its employees \ndeserve at little or no cost to the taxpayer.\n  By passing this legislation, we will signal the Federal Government's \nrecognition that prosecutors in our society fulfill a critical role. \nCongress can send the message that the service of these prosecutors is \na valued and indispensable component of our Federal justice system. I \nhope all Senators will join us in supporting this legislation to ensure \nthat Federal policy equally respects the contributions of all members \nof the law enforcement community in keeping our society safe and \nsecure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1729\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct, to reward States for engaging individuals with disabilities in \nwork activities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce Pathways to \nIndependence Act of 2007, along with Senators Conrad, Stabenow, Snowe, \nand Collins. This legislation includes two important provisions that \nwill help States transition Temporary Assistance for Needy Fami1ies, \nTANF, recipients who have disabilities into work.\n  States currently face a conflict between the new Federal TANF \nrequirements, as reauthorized by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2006, \nDRA, and the nondiscrimination requirements of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. In order to comply with the ADA, States must make \nmodifications to the work requirements they impose on TANF recipients \nwith disabilities to ensure that they can participate in the program \nand move toward gainful employment. However, under new Federal TANF \nrules, States only get credit when recipients participate in a narrow \nset of activities for a specific number of hours each week, with \nlimited flexibility for people with disabilities.\n  Our legislation would allow States to create modified employability \nplans for people with disabilities and get credit toward the TANF \nparticipation rate if\n\n[[Page S8701]]\n\nrecipients comply with the requirements in those plans. This would \nencourage States to engage people with disabilities in appropriate \nemployment-focused activities without fear of facing Federal penalties \nfor not meeting their TANF work rates. The bill also would allow states \nTo exclude people with pending SSI applications and severe temporary \ndisabilities from the work rates.\n  This legislation allows states to receive full credit when a modified \nemployability plan is developed for a family that includes a person \nwith a disability. The bill requires States that receive credit for \nfamilies on their caseload with modified employability plans to submit \nannual reports to the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, on \nthe types of modifications made and disabled populations served. It \nalso requires HHS to compile this information and send an annual report \nto Congress.\n  This approach is appealing to States for many reasons. It allows \nStates to design a system and receive credit for moving a person \nprogressively over time from rehabilitation toward work. It also \ncreates a more realistic work structure for individuals with \ndisabilities and/or addictions who otherwise may fall out of the system \neither through sanction or discouragement, despite their need for \nfinancial assistance.\n  In July 2002, the General Accounting Office reported that as many as \n44 percent of TANF families have a parent or child with a physical or \nmental impairment. This is almost three times higher than the rate \namong the non-TANF population in the United States. In 8 percent of \nTANF families, there is both a parent and a child with a disability; \namong non-TANF families, this figure is 1 percent. The GAO's work \nconfirmed the findings of earlier studies, including work by the Urban \nInstitute and the HHS Inspector General.\n  These figures mean that we need to make sure that the TANF program \ngives States the ability and incentives to serve families in their TANF \nprograms and help them to move from welfare to work. This is the lesson \nthat Oregon and many other States already have learned when they \ndeveloped and refined their TANF programs.\n  Most individuals with disabilities who receive TANF are able to \nengage in work activities and move toward employment, and many will \neither need no modifications to standard work activities or only minor \nmodifications. Those with more serious conditions may need more \nintensive services and more significant adjustment to the basic work \nrequirements. Under the bill, a qualified professional must make a \ndetermination that an individual has a disability and the state must \ndocument the types of modifications, if any, that the individual needs \nto succeed in moving toward employment.\n  Our bill proposes the creation of a more appropriate path for those \nwho have disabling conditions, both short- and long-term, recognizing \nthe barriers many of these families face both financially and \nemotionally. The current strategy of rapid employment for all TANF \nrecipients is not always feasible. This bill will help families with \ndisabilities achieve and maintain stability during the transition from \nwelfare to becoming more financially secure and independent of \nGovernment assistance.\n  Over 20 individual States, including Oregon, and the National \nGovernors Association, representing all 50 States and five territories \nhave identified problems with how the current rules affect their \nability to serve individuals with disabilities appropriately and meet \nthe TANF work requirements. They have asked for modifications to the \nnew TANF requirements like the ones proposed in our bill.\n  I look forward to working with my cosponsors, Senators Conrad, \nStabenow, Snowe, and Collins on these important provisions, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join us in support of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith, Conrad, Stabenow, Snowe, and Collins: \n     I am writing to commend you for introducing the ``Pathways to \n     Independence Act of 2007''. This legislation will enable \n     States to engage individuals with mental health and substance \n     use conditions in programs to help them successfully move \n     from welfare to work.\n       Mental Health America is dedicated to helping all people \n     live mentally healthier lives. Our network of over 320 State \n     and local affiliates nationwide includes advocates, consumers \n     of mental health services, family members of consumers, \n     providers of mental health care, and other concerned \n     citizens--all dedicated to improving mental health care and \n     promoting mental wellness.\n       A large percentage of individuals who need and rely on the \n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program have \n     significant mental health conditions and substance use \n     disorders. Studies indicate that one-fourth to one-third of \n     TANF recipients has serious mental health conditions, and \n     some studies show that up to one-fifth of TANF recipients \n     have substance use disorders. Moreover, more than one-fifth \n     have learning disabilities and more than one-fifth have \n     physical impairments. As you know, these rates are well above \n     those for the general population and indicate a pressing need \n     for access to care.\n       We are very concerned about changes made to the TANF \n     program in reauthorizing legislation included in the Deficit \n     Reduction Act (DRA). Individuals with mental health \n     conditions, substance use disorders, or other disabling \n     conditions will need assistance meeting the work requirements \n     of the TANF program that were significantly tightened by the \n     DRA. However, the regulations issued by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services implementing the new DRA \n     requirements provide such narrow definitions of the types of \n     activities that can count toward a state's work participation \n     rate (which determines Federal funding), we fear States will \n     be discouraged from providing the services these individuals \n     need in order to be engaged in the program and able to work. \n     We are particularly alarmed that States are only allowed to \n     count individuals receiving mental health or substance abuse \n     treatment or rehabilitation activities as job readiness \n     activities for 4 consecutive weeks and 6 weeks total per year \n     before requiring that these individuals be engaged in full-\n     time employment.\n       States are required under the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n     (Rehab Act) to make modifications to Federal programs, \n     including TANF, to enable individuals with disabilities to \n     participate. However, if States provide ADA-required \n     modifications to the work requirements for individuals with \n     disabilities, including those with serious mental health \n     conditions, they may not meet their work participation rates \n     even if these TANF recipients are actively engaged in \n     activities designed to help them secure full-time jobs.\n       Your bill would give States the flexibility they need in \n     order to fully engage individuals with serious mental health \n     conditions or substance use disorders in activities designed \n     to move them successfully into employment. Specifically, your \n     bill would allow States to develop ``modified employability \n     plans'' for TANF recipients who are determined by qualified \n     medical, mental health, or social services professionals \n     either to have a disability or to be caring for a family \n     member with a disability. These provisions would also enable \n     States to meet the ADA and Rehab Act requirements to provide \n     reasonable accommodations to these families without losing \n     Federal TANF funds.\n       We greatly appreciate your on-going leadership in working \n     to ensure that individuals with mental health conditions, \n     substance use disorders, and other disabling conditions are \n     able to fully participate in and benefit from the TANF \n     program. We look forward to working with you toward swift \n     enactment of the ``Pathways to Independence Act of 2007''.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      David Shern,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n                                      Consortium for Citizens with\n\n\n                                                 Disabilities,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 2007.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith, Conrad, Stabenow, Snowe, and Collins: \n     We are writing to thank you for introducing legislation that \n     will allow States to more effectively serve families that \n     include a person with a disability in the Temporary \n     Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program. We believe this \n     legislation, if enacted, will significantly improve the \n     ability of States to help families successfully move from \n     welfare toward work while also ensuring that the needs of \n     family members with disabilities are met. The undersigned \n     organizations enthusiastically support this legislation.\n       The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is a \n     coalition of national consumer, advocacy, provider and \n     professional organizations headquartered in Washington, DC. \n     We work together to advocate for national public policy that \n     ensures the self determination, independence, empowerment, \n     integration, and inclusion of children and adults with \n     disabilities in all aspects of society. The CCD TANF Task \n     Force seeks to ensure that families that include persons with \n     disabilities are afforded equal opportunities and appropriate \n     accommodations under the TANF block grant.\n       Congress explicitly stated in the Personal Responsibility \n     and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act that, in implementing \n     TANF, States are to comply with the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitative \n     Services Act of 1973. The expectation, therefore, is that \n     States will provide individualized treatment and an effective \n     and meaningful opportunity to fully participate in the \n     program. To achieve this, States must provide appropriate \n     services, modify as necessary policies, practices, and \n     procedures, and adopt non-discriminatory methods of \n     administering the program. This expectation is also conveyed \n     in guidance to the States issued by the Office of Civil \n     Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services.\n       Under the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA), Congress \n     reauthorized the TANF block grant program. The legislation \n     retained States' obligation to comply fully with the ADA and \n     Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended \n     while hindering States' ability to fully engage families that \n     include a person with a disability. The DRA effectively \n     increases the work participation rate for the TANF program \n     and imposes penalties on States that fail to meet the \n     participation rates. It does not allow States to receive \n     credit toward the work participation rate for families whose \n     employability plan has been modified to accommodate a person \n     with a disability. It fails to ensure that States receive \n     adequate credit for providing rehabilitative services to \n     parents with disabilities to help them prepare for a \n     successful transition to work. In short, existing policies do \n     not provide States with credit for offering appropriate \n     accommodation and services to families that include a person \n     with a disability. Instead it increases the likelihood States \n     offering such accommodations and services that ``do not \n     count'' will face financial penalties.\n\n[[Page S8703]]\n\n       HHS received comments from TANF administrators across the \n     country who argued that the TANF provisions adopted under the \n     DRA and reflected in HHS interim regulations severely impedes \n     their ability to appropriately serve families that include a \n     person with a disability. In a letter to Secretary Leavitt in \n     response to the interim proposed regulations, the National \n     Governor's Association stated that:\n       Governors continue to believe that States should have \n     maximum flexibility in receiving credit for key \n     rehabilitative and supportive services such as substance \n     abuse, behavioral/mental health and domestic violence \n     treatments in one or more work activity. These services are \n     an imperative part of moving recipients, with barriers, to \n     work and retaining employment. States need credit for these \n     services in work activities that are fully countable for all \n     hours of participation without time limit.\n       We believe your legislation provides appropriate \n     flexibility for families who require accommodation due to a \n     disability. Under this bill, States will receive credit, not \n     face penalties, for investing in the supports necessary to \n     help individuals with disabilities succeed in the labor \n     market and achieve a higher degree of self-reliance. The \n     flexibility provided in this bill can improve the overall \n     performance of the TANF program by helping families at \n     greatest risk move toward employment. To date, studies have \n     demonstrated that a disproportionate number of families who \n     exit the program without employment or other sources of \n     financial assistance include a person with a disability. \n     States can and must serve these families better and Congress \n     should provide them with the tools to do so by supporting \n     this legislation.\n       Thank you again for introducing this legislation and your \n     leadership on this very important issue. We are grateful for \n     your leadership on behalf of families that include an adult \n     or child with a disability. We look forward to working with \n     you and your staffs to ensure that this provision becomes \n     law.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Dance Therapy Association.\n       American Music Therapy Association.\n       American Association on Intellectual & Developmental \n     Disabilities.\n       American Psychological Association.\n       Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD).\n       Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n       Easter Seals, Inc.\n       Epilepsy Foundation.\n       Goodwill Industries International, Inc.\n       Learning Disabilities Association of America.\n       Mental Health America.\n       National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n       National Alliance to End Homelessness.\n       National Association of Councils on Developmental \n     Disabilities.\n       National Association of County Behavioral Health and \n     Developmental Disability Directors.\n       National Association of State Directors of Special \n     Education.\n       National Association of State Head Injury Administrators.\n       National Association of State Mental Health Program \n     Directors.\n       National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare.\n       National Disability Rights Network.\n       The Arc of the United States.\n       United Cerebral Palsy.\n       United Spinal Association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Chambliss):\n  S. 1731. A bill to provide for the continuing review of unauthorized \nFederal programs and agencies and to establish a bipartisan commission \nfor the purposes of improving oversight and eliminating wasteful \nGovernment spending; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the United States \nAuthorization and Sunset Commission Act of 2007. I am very pleased to \nbe joined by my colleagues and good friends, Senator George Voinovich \nand Senator Saxby Chambliss, who share my commitment that every dime \nsent by taxpayers to Washington, DC, is spent wisely.\n  The United States Authorization and Sunset Commission Act of 2007 \ncreates an eight member bipartisan Commission, made up of four Senators \nand four Representatives. The Commission will look at the effectiveness \nand efficiency of all Federal programs, but will especially focus on \nunauthorized and ineffective programs. The bill is modeled after the \nsunset process that the State of Texas instituted in 1977 to identify \nand eliminate waste, duplication, and inefficiency in government \nagencies. This process has led to the elimination of dozens of agencies \nthat have outlived their usefulness and has saved Texas taxpayers \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n  The job of the Commission is to ask the fundamental question: ``Is an \nagency or program still needed?''\n  The Commission has two major responsibilities. First, the Commission \nmust submit a legislative proposal to Congress at least once every 10 \nyears that includes a review schedule of at least 25 percent of \nunauthorized Federal programs and at least 25 percent of ineffective \nFederal programs or where effectiveness cannot be shown by the Office \nof Management and Budget's, OMB, Performance Assessment Rating Tool, \nPART. The Commission's schedule will abolish each program if Congress \nfails to either reauthorize the program or consider the Commission's \nrecommendations within 2 years.\n  Second, the Commission must conduct a review of each program \nidentified in its review schedule and send its recommendations for \ncongressional review. Congress will then have 2 years to consider and \npass the Commission's recommendations or to reauthorize the program \nbefore it is abolished.\n  Congress has two bites of the apple when it comes to evaluating \nFederal spending. First, when it authorizes a program and second when \nit appropriates the money for it. Yet a study by the Congressional \nBudget Office found that Congress spent just under $160 billion in 2006 \non agencies and programs despite the fact that their authorization had \nexpired. The list included hundreds of accounts, big and small, ranging \nfrom the Coast Guard, $8 billion, to the Administration on Aging, $1.5 \nbillion, to section 8 tenant-based housing, $15.6 billion, to foreign \nrelations programs, $9.5 billion. Many of these expired programs and \nagencies, perhaps most, deserve reauthorization. Nonetheless, Congress \nshould aggressively determine whether these programs and agencies are \nworking as intended and the Commission will help serve this purpose.\n  In addition, the Commission will use OMB's PART, which is a tool to \nassess and improve program performance. PART looks at all factors that \naffect and reflect program performance including program purpose and \ndesign, performance measurement, evaluations, and strategic planning, \nprogram management, and program results. Using PART, OMB has scored 793 \nGovernment programs and found that 4 percent are ineffective and the \nresults for 24 percent could not be shown. Programs rated as \n``ineffective'' or ``results not demonstrated'' account for $152 \nbillion in budget authority.\n  The Commission's work will be guided by 10 criteria, including the \nprogram's effectiveness and efficiency, achievement of performance \ngoals, and whether the program has fulfilled its legislative intent.\n  Unfortunately Congress has a tendency to create commissions and then \nignore their work and continue on with business as usual. This bill \nsolves this problem. It requires Congress to consider, debate, and vote \non the Commission's report under expedited procedures.\n  The United States Authorization and Sunset Commission Act of 2007 is \nan important step to getting our fiscal house in order and to making \nsure that Congress gets back to the hard work of oversight to determine \nif programs actually fulfill their stated purpose or yield some \nunintended or counterproductive results. Periodic assessments are \nessential to good Government and this is what the Commission will \nprovide to Congress and to taxpayers across the country. For this \nreason, I ask that my colleagues join me in cosponsoring the United \nStates Authorization and Sunset Commission Act of 2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1731\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States Authorization \n     and Sunset Commission Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Cornyn in introducing the United States Authorization \nand Sunset Commission Act of 2007. This legislation would create a \nbipartisan commission to make recommendations to Congress on whether to \nreauthorize, reorganize, or terminate Federal programs. It would \nestablish a systematic process to review unauthorized programs and \nagencies, and, if applicable, programs that are rated as ineffective or \nresults not demonstrated under the\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\nProgram Assessment Rating Tool, PART. The Comptroller General and the \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, would serve as ex-\nofficio members, bringing their knowledge and experience and that of \ntheir organizations to the process.\n  Earlier this year, as it does every year, the CBO reported on \nprograms that at one time had an explicit authorization that has either \nexpired or will expire during the current session. This is always a \nlengthy report that runs 75 pages or more. In recent years, the total \namount of unauthorized programs receiving appropriations reported by \nCBO has ranged between $160 billion and $170 billion annually.\n  I make this point, not to criticize or to imply that all unauthorized \nprograms should be eliminated. Instead, it is to point out that what we \nare doing now is not working for us. We know that oversight is an \nimportant part of our job, but oversight takes time. How do we explain \nto our constituents that we do not have the time to distinguish between \nworthwhile programs and those that have outlived their purpose, are \npoorly targeted, operate inefficiently, or simply are not producing \nresults?\n  As a sponsor of The Stop Over-Spending Act of 2007, ``S.O.S.,'' \nlegislation, which includes several provisions from bills I introduced \nearlier this year, I want to work with my colleagues to pass \nlegislation that allows us to convert some of the time spent on the \nannual budget cycle into time spent on oversight. A biennial budget \ncycle plus commissions such as this one and others that I have proposed \nto examine entitlement programs and increase program accountability all \nhave a similar goal--to provide the time and the tools to reinvigorate \ncongressional oversight.\n  This legislation does not take away our obligation to make difficult \ndecisions about what programs to continue and those that we can no \nlonger afford to support. What it does do is provide an opportunity to \nwork smarter. I believe by establishing this Commission to do a \nthorough examination of programs and agencies, using established \ncriteria, and a transparent reporting process, that we can carry out \nour responsibilities more efficiently and effectively.\n  I urge my colleagues to support The United States Authorization and \nSunset Commission Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. \n        Brown):\n  S. 1733. A bill to authorize funds to prevent housing discrimination \nthrough the use of nationwide testing, to increase funds for the Fair \nHousing Initiatives Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Housing Fairness \nAct of 2007, legislation that would strengthen efforts to detect \ndiscrimination and enforce equal housing opportunities. This \nlegislation is especially timely given that June is National \nHomeownership Month.\n  The Housing Fairness Act promotes equal housing opportunities for all \npeople by authorizing funds to process complaints, investigate cases of \nhousing discrimination, and develop and operate education and outreach \nprograms to inform the general public of fair housing rights. The \nlegislation also creates a competitive matching grant program for \nprivate nonprofit organizations to examine the causes of housing \ndiscrimination and segregation and their effects on education, poverty \nand economic development.\n  Despite the passage of the Fair Housing Act almost 40 years ago, more \nthan 4 million fair housing violations still occur each year. When the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development designated certain real \nestate companies for investigation, studies uncovered an 87 percent \nrate of racial steering and a 20 percent denial rate for African-\nAmericans and Latinos. In part due to fair housing violations, the \nhomeownership gap between people of different racial and ethnic groups \nis larger than it was in 1940. These facts confirm that we need to be \ndoing more to promote fair housing.\n  I invite my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work with me \nto find solutions to further detect discrimination and enforce the Fair \nHousing Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 1733\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Housing Fairness Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Housing \n     and Urban Development should--\n       (1) fully comply with the requirements of section 561(d) of \n     the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (42 U.S.C. \n     3616a(d)) to establish, design, and maintain a national \n     education and outreach program to provide a centralized, \n     coordinated effort for the development and dissemination of \n     the fair housing rights of individuals who seek to rent, \n     purchase, sell, or facilitate the sale of a home;\n       (2) utilize all amounts appropriated for such education and \n     outreach program under section 561(g) of such Act; and\n       (3) promulgate regulations regarding the fair housing \n     obligations of each recipient of Federal housing funds to \n     affirmatively further fair housing, as that term is defined \n     under title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. \n     3601 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to provide for prostate cancer imaging research and \neducation; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Prostate \nResearch, Imaging, and Men's Education Act. This important legislation \naddresses the urgent need for the development of new technologies to \ndetect and diagnose prostate cancer, and for the education of the \ndangers of this deadly disease.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Frank Lautenberg and Senator John \nKerry, for joining me as original cosponsors of this important \nlegislation.\n  Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in the United \nStates, and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in men. \nThis cancer strikes one in every six men, making it even more prevalent \nthan breast cancer, which strikes one in every seven women.\n  In 2007, more than 218,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate \ncancer, and more than 27,000 men will die from the disease. One new \ncase occurs every 2.5 minutes and a man dies from prostate cancer every \n19 minutes.\n  The Prostate Research, Imaging, and Men's Education Act, also known \nas the PRIME Act, will mirror the investment the Federal Government \nmade in advanced imaging technologies, which led to life-saving \nbreakthroughs in detection, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. \nThis bill directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, to expand research on prostate cancer, and provides the \nresources to develop innovative advanced imaging technologies for \nprostate cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment.\n  The Prostate Research, Imaging, and Men's Education Act would also \ncreate a national campaign conducted through HHS to increase awareness \nabout the need for prostate cancer screening, and the development of \nbetter screening techniques. Since African American men are 56 percent \nmore likely to develop prostate cancer compared with Caucasian men and \nnearly 2.5 times as likely to die from the disease, this campaign will \nwork with the Offices of Minority Health at HHS and the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention to ensure that this effort will reach \nthe men most at risk from this disease.\n  The Prostate Research, Imaging and Men's Education Act will also \npromote research that improves prostate cancer screening blood tests. \nAccording to a recent National Cancer Institute study, current blood \ntests result in false-negative reassurances and numerous false-positive \nalarms. Some 15 percent of men with normal blood test levels actually \nhave prostate cancer. Even when levels are abnormal, some 88 percent of \nmen end up not having prostate cancer but undergoing unnecessary \nbiopsies. Furthermore, the prostate is one of the last organs in a \nhuman body where biopsies are performed blindly, which can miss cancer \neven when multiple samples are taken.\n  Government initiative in research and education can be the key to \ndiagnosing prostate cancer earlier and more accurately. This \nlegislation would strengthen our efforts to fight this disease.\n  As June is Men's Health Month, this is an ideal time to draw \nattention to the issue affecting so many men across the Nation. I ask \nall my fellow Senators to join with me in ensuring the health of our \nhusbands, brothers, sons, and friends against this disease.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1736. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that the eligibility requirements for disability insurance \nbenefits under which an individual must have 20 quarters of Social \nSecurity coverage in the 40 quarters preceding a disability shall not \nbe applicable in the case of a disabled individual suffering from a \ncovered terminal disease; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Claire Collier \nSocial Security Disability Insurance Fairness Act. This legislation \nwill ensure that individuals suffering from certain terminal diseases \nare entitled to receive Social Security disability benefits. Under \ncurrent law, an individual who contracts a covered terminal illness, \nand who has not been part of the workforce for a period of time, may \nnot qualify for Social Security disability benefits they would \notherwise be entitled to.\n  This bill is named after Claire Collier, a Stamford, Connecticut \nmother of three, who I first met a few years ago after she was \ndiagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, in 2003. ALS, \ncommonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, first strikes the nerve cells, \nthen weakens the muscles, causes paralysis and tragically leads to \ndeath.\n  Three years ago, Claire applied for Social Security disability \nbenefits. However, she was denied the benefits because she did not have \nenough work credits. Ms. Collier, who worked for more than 15 years as \nan events planner, does not qualify for Social Security disability \nbenefits, even though she paid Social Security and Medicare taxes for \nmore than 15 years. The reason is the Social Security Act mandates that \nan individual earn 20 quarters of Social Security earnings during the \n10 years preceding a disability to collect benefits. This discriminates \nagainst people who have earned the required number of credits outside \nof the time period prescribed under current law.\n  Under the present system, hardworking Americans, such as Claire \nCollier, are being denied benefits at a time when they need them most. \nIn Claire's case, the rules are especially unfair since she has been \npenalized for choosing to stay at home with her children prior to being \ndiagnosed with ALS.\n  The bill I am sponsoring will change the eligibility standard. The \nClaire Collier legislation will amend the Social Security Act to \nprovide that the eligibility standard for disability insurance benefits \nnot be applicable in the case of a disabled individual suffering from a \nterminal illness.\n  Passage of this important legislation will simply ensure fairness. We \nshould reward individuals who contribute to Social Security, not punish \nthem. The Claire Collier Social Security Disability Insurance Fairness \nAct will eliminate inequity in the current system. I look forward to \nworking with\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\nmy colleagues to see that this legislation is not only passed by this \nbody soon, but that it is signed into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mrs. Boxer)\n  S. 1738. A bill to establish a Special Counsel for Child Exploitation \nPrevention and Interdiction within the Office of the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, to improve the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, to \nincrease resources for regional computer forensic labs, and to make \nother improvements to increase the ability of law enforcement agencies \nto investigate and prosecute predators; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Combating \nChild Exploitation Act of 2007. This legislation takes a bold step \nforward in addressing child exploitation.\n  And, Mr. President, let me assure you, we need bold action. We have \ntaken some important steps here in the Senate, including passing the \nJacob Weterling Act, the Pam Lyncher Act, the Amber Alert program, and \nlast year's Adam Walsh Act.\n  But, this is a problem that keeps growing and growing, and we need \nbold action to address this problem. If we do not act, we will probably \nbe back here naming a new bill after another unfortunate child victim.\n  The bottom line is that the Internet has facilitated an exploding, \nmulti-billion dollar market for child pornography, with 20,000 new \nimages posted every week. This is a market that can only be supplied by \nthe continued sexual assault and exploitation of more children and the \nresearch shows that victims are getting younger and they are being \nexposed to more sadistic abuse.\n  The FBI and the Department of Justice have testified before Congress \nthat there are hundreds of thousands of people trafficking child \npornography in this country and millions around the world.\n  We are not making a dent in this problem.\n  Don't get me wrong, there are many Federal, State and local \ninvestigators and prosecutors out there working tirelessly, but need to \ndo much more.\n  We have not dedicated enough Federal agents to this problem and we \nhave not provided enough support for States and local government.\n  The most troubling aspect, one that led to the drafting of this \nlegislation is that we know where many of these people are and if we \nset the right priorities we can go pick them up.\n  Let me repeat that, we have new investigative techniques that will \nallow us to identify many of the people who are trafficking child \npornography and we can go pick them up.\n  A very conservative estimate is that there are more than 400,000 \npeople who we know who are trafficking child pornography on the \nInternet in the U.S. right now.\n  We can, with minimal effort, take these people down. But, due to lack \nof resources we are investigating less than 2 percent of these cases. \nAgain, we are only investigating 2 percent of the known child \npornography traffickers.\n  We also know that when law enforcement agents do investigate these \ncases, there is a local abused child in 30 percent off the cases. And, \nresearch shows that at least 55 percent of child pornography possessors \nhave previously sexually assaulted children or attempted to do so. So, \nby picking up these known offenders, we are saving children.\n  Finally, it is important to note that every time one of these images \nor videos are shared, the child is victimized again and again.\n  So, to help ensure that law enforcement has the capacity to get the \njob done, I am introducing the Combating Child Exploitation Act of \n2007.\n  First, this legislation will establish a Special Counsel in the \nDeputy Attorney General's Office to coordinate all activities related \nto preventing child exploitation. This will be one person who will be \nheld accountable for results.\n  We will also congressionally require that there be at least one \nInternet Crimes Against Children Task Force, CAC, in each State. This \nprogram is poised to become the backbone for our investigative efforts \nhere in the U.S. by forming a network of highly trained investigators \nto focus exclusively on combating child exploitation. Under this bill, \nwe will triple the funding for the ICAC program to help with hiring, \ntraining, and investigative resources to form this Nation-wide network.\n  In addition, we will authorize over 250 new Federal agents to focus \nexclusively on this problem, including 125 new FBI agents, which will \ndouble the number of agents under the Innocent Images Program at the \nFBI, 95 new agents for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, \nICE, and 31 new postal inspectors.\n  This bill will help us form a coordinated effort to go after child \npredators. As stated previously, we know where many of these people are \nand we need to go get them.\n  In my view, it is inexcusable that we are not putting the resources \ntoward tracking the ones down who we know about and doing much more to \nfind the others who are lurking in the shadows.\n  This legislation will get us on the right track and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1739. A bill to amend section 35 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to improve the health coverage tax credit, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, last month, the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, released yet another report about the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance, TAA, health coverage tax credit, HCTC. The \nreport confirms what many in Congress have been saying since the HCTC \nprogram began, the credit is not enough, the program has several \nbarriers to enrollment, the premiums are prohibitively high for some \nworkers because of medical underwriting, and the program is very \nconfusing and expensive to administer. Although the GAO reported a $19 \nmillion decrease in costs of administration between 2003 and the end of \nfiscal year 2006, administrative costs still make up approximately 34 \npercent of the total spending for the HCTC.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Act is up for reauthorization this \nyear. It is long past time for Congress to focus on the problems with \nthe TAA health coverage tax credit and reauthorization presents us with \nthat opportunity. That is why I am introducing legislation today that \nwill make much-needed improvements to the HCTC program. And, I am proud \nthat the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, is joining me in \nintroducing this important bill. The TAA Health Coverage Improvement \nAct of 2007 offers solutions to many of the problems with the HCTC \nidentified by the GAO. This legislation will go a long way to make the \nTAA health care tax credit a realistic option for displaced workers and \ntheir families.\n  When Congress passed the Trade Act of 2002, we made a promise to \nAmerican workers that the potential loss of jobs will not equal the \nloss of health care coverage. Unfortunately, Congress has failed to \nmake good on that promise. Since we passed this bill, I have heard from \nsteel retirees and widows in my State about how unaffordable the TAA \nhealth care tax credit is. And I have been very frustrated, just as I \nwas when this bill passed, that we were not able to make the credit \nmore affordable and accessible for people who need it the most--laid-\noff workers and retirees with very limited income. We can fix these \nproblems by including provisions from the TAA Health Coverage \nImprovement Act in the TAA reauthorization bill.\n  For a good number of supporters of the Trade Act of 2002, the health \ninsurance tax credit was the single most important factor in overcoming \ntheir concerns about giving the President fast-track authority to move \ntrade agreements through Congress. In my own judgment, the fast-track \nwould not have passed Congress without the health care tax credit. The \nTAA health credit was the trade-off to balance the President's \nauthority.\n  Yet, the success many of us envisioned for the health care tax credit \nhas not been realized through implementation. The number of people who \nhave been able to access the health care tax credit over the last 2 \nyears is extremely disappointing. As of January 31, 2007, only 15,506 \nout of 252,280 who are eligible for the credit are enrolled\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\nin the program. That is just over 6 percent, which means that almost 94 \npercent of those eligible are not participating.\n  In my home State of West Virginia, we have worked hard to promote the \nHCTC for trade-displaced workers. When Weirton Steel instituted \nsignificant layoffs, thousands of employees lost their jobs. In the \naftermath, State and national officials, health plan staff, and \nrepresentatives of the Independent Steelworkers Union and United Steel \nWorkers worked collaboratively to provide continuous health care \ncoverage for HCTC-eligible workers and retirees. The community really \ncame together and worked around the clock to educate workers and \nretirees about their coverage options and to ensure they were enrolled \nin the HCTC.\n\n  Loss of employment is absolutely devastating to workers and their \nfamilies. While health care coverage alone cannot replace job loss, it \ndoes help to ease the burden on displaced workers and their dependents. \nWest Virginia is a model example of how HCTC can work. However, with \nonly 6 percent of those eligible for HCTC enrolled across the country, \nthere is still much more that needs to be done.\n  I must say to my colleagues that Congress has had a hand in these \ndisappointing enrollment figures. We have ignored every opportunity to \nimprove the health coverage tax credit and enhance the lives of workers \ndisplaced by trade. Members of this body have previously voted against \nTAA bills that would have extended Trade Adjustment Assistance to \nservice workers and also addressed some of the problems the GAO has \nidentified with the health coverage credit.\n  The TAA Health Coverage Improvement Act makes long overdue \nimprovements to the TAA health care tax credit. First, this legislation \naddresses the issue of affordability. In addition to the GAO, several \nconsumer advocacy groups and research organizations, including the \nCommonwealth Fund, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and \nFamilies USA, have cited affordability of the credit as the primary \nreason for low participation in the HCTC program. The bottom line is \nthat a 65 percent subsidy is not enough. With a 65 percent credit, an \neligible individual still has to pay an average of $2,104 in annual \npremium costs for single coverage plus additional amounts for \ndeductibles and co-payments. This figure is particularly astounding \ngiven the fact that the average worker, while actively employed and \nearning a paycheck, paid just $627 annually in 2006 for single \nemployer-sponsored health insurance coverage. In other words, if you \nlose your job, you have to pay more than three times as much for health \ninsurance, even if you get the HCTC. The TAA Health Coverage \nImprovement Act makes the credit more affordable by increasing the \nsubsidy amount to 95 percent.\n  This legislation also addresses the issue of affordability by placing \nlimits on the use of the individual market, as Congress intended under \nthe original law. The Trade Act of 2002 specified that the health \ninsurance credit could not be used for the purchase of health insurance \ncoverage in the individual market except for HCTC-eligible workers who \npreviously had a private, non-group coverage policy 30 days prior to \nseparation from employment. However, States have been allowed by this \nAdministration to create State-based coverage options in the individual \nmarket for any HCTC beneficiaries, including those who did not have \nindividual market coverage one month prior to separation from \nemployment.\n  Because of the Administration's interpretation of the law, there are \npeople who had employer-based coverage prior to separation from \nemployment who are now being covered in the individual market. This was \nnot the intent of the law. To make matters worse, this interpretation \nundermines the consumer protections set forth in the law because \nindividual market plans are allowed to vary premiums based on age and \nmedical status. In one state that GAG reviewed for a previous report, \nbecause of medical underwriting, HCTC recipients in less-than-perfect \nhealth were charged almost 6 times the premiums charged to recipients \nrated in the healthiest category. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday addresses this problem by clarifying that States can only \ndesignate individual market coverage within guidelines of 30-day \nrestriction and by requiring individual market plans to be community-\nrated.\n  Second, this legislation guarantees that eligible workers will have \naccess to comprehensive group health coverage. Group coverage is what \npeople know. The vast majority of laid-off workers and PBGC retirees \nhad employer-sponsored group coverage prior to losing their jobs or \npension benefits. The TAA Health Coverage Improvement Act designates \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, FEHBP, as a qualified group \noption in every State, so that displaced workers Nationwide will have \naccess to the same type of affordable, comprehensive coverage they were \nused to when they were employed.\n  Third, the TAA Health Coverage Act clarifies the 3 month continuous \ncoverage requirement. Under the original TAA statute, displaced workers \nare required to maintain 3 months of continuous health insurance \ncoverage in order to qualify for certain consumer protections. Those \nprotections are guaranteed issue, no preexisting condition exclusion, \ncomparable premiums, and comparable benefits. Congress intended this 3 \nmonth period to be counted as the 3 months prior to separation from \nemployment. However, the administration has interpreted the 3 month \nrequirement as 3 months of health insurance coverage prior to \nenrollment in the new health plan, which usually is after separation \nfrom employment and after certification of TAA eligibility. Many laid-\noff workers and PBGC recipients cannot afford to maintain health \ncoverage in the months between losing their jobs and TAA certification \nand, therefore, lose eligibility for the statutorily-provided consumer \nprotections. This legislation corrects this problem by clarifying that \nthree months of continuous coverage means 3 months prior to separation \nfrom employment.\n  Fourth, this bill allows spouses and dependents to receive the health \ncoverage tax credit. Over the last 2 years, younger spouses and \ndependents of Medicare-eligible individuals have not been able to \nreceive the subsidy because eligibility runs through the worker or \nretiree. This technicality is unfair to individuals who rely on health \ncoverage through their spouses or parents. The TAA Health Coverage \nImprovement Act allows younger spouses and dependent children to retain \neligibility for the health coverage tax credit in the event the \nqualified beneficiary becomes eligible for Medicare.\n  Finally, this legislation streamlines the HCTC enrollment process and \nmakes it easier for trade-displaced workers to access health insurance \ncoverage. According to GAO, two of the factors contributing to low \nparticipation include the complex nature of the HCTC program and the \ninability of workers to pay 100 percent of the premium during the up to \n3 months before they begin to receive advance payments. The TAA Health \nCoverage Improvement Act improves consumer information about the HCTC \nby requiring that the Treasury Secretary's eligibility notice include a \ndescription of the HCTC program; specific contact information for state \noffices responsible for determining eligibility and providing \nenrollment assistance; a list of the HCTC coverage options in the sate; \nand a statement informing eligible individuals of the deadline to \nenroll in HCTC in order to avoid lapses in coverage. Additionally, our \nlegislation includes a presumptive eligibility provision that allows \ndisplaced workers to enroll in a qualified health plan and receive the \nHCTC immediately upon application to the Department of Labor for \ncertification. There is also a provision which directs the Treasury \nSecretary to pay 100 percent of the cost of premiums directly to the \nhealth plans during the months TAA-eligible workers are waiting for \nadvance payment to begin.\n  As a former Governor, I know how important Trade Adjustment \nAssistance is to individuals who have lost their jobs due to trade. In \nWest Virginia, thousands of workers have lost their jobs as a result of \ntrade policy. While adjusting to the loss of employment, these \nindividuals still have to pay mortgages, put food on the table, and \ncare for their families. Finding affordable health care adds a \nsignificant burden to their worries. The TAA health coverage tax credit \nis designed\n\n[[Page S8711]]\n\nto help American workers retain health insurance coverage during this \nvery difficult transition.\n  Unfortunately, the HCTC program is not living up to its potential. \nThe Government Accountability Office has given us a very specific \ndiagnosis of the problems. Now, it is up to us to fix them. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation in conjunction with reauthorization of the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 1739\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe dollar limitation on contributions to funeral trusts; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \neliminate the current dollar limitation on Qualified Funeral Trusts, \nQFTs. Congress created these savings vehicles in 1997 to assist \nindividuals and families who wanted to plan for, and prepay, funeral \nexpenses. Yet, funeral costs are rising\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\nrapidly, and the arbitrary cap that Congress imposed on QFTs makes \nplanning more difficult. Today I am proud to introduce this bipartisan \nlegislation, along with my colleague from Wisconsin, the chairman of \nthe Special Committee on Aging, Senator Kohl. We are also joined by two \nof our distinguished colleagues, Senators Specter and Crapo. The change \nwould have a positive impact on the lives of older Americans and on \ntheir families. In addition, according to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, it would have a slight, but positive, impact on the Federal \ntreasury.\n  When Congress created QFTs, it did so as a tax simplification \nmeasure. Unfortunately, it capped the size of these trusts at $7,000, \nadjusted regularly for inflation. This year, the inflation-adjusted cap \nis $8,800, but in many instances, this amount is no longer sufficient \nto cover a family's funeral expenses. In Utah, the average cost of a \nfull funeral and burial is $12,685. I am sure that in many other states \nit is even higher. Because of this contribution limit, even those who \npreplan their own funerals too often leave their heirs with substantial \nexpenses. Even those who attempt to cover the entire expense may not \nhave enough money to cover all costs after administrative fees and \ntaxes are deducted.\n  This proposal would make Qualified Funeral Trusts more effective. The \nprincipal reason individuals set up Qualified Funeral Trust plans is to \nlift a financial burden from their children. Ordinarily, trusts for \nfuneral expenses are grantor trusts, and the beneficiary is responsible \nfor paying any tax on income generated by the trust. Congress \nrecognized, however, that this result created an administrative burden \nfor the beneficiary or the funeral director trustee. As a result, \nCongress enacted Section 685 of the Internal Revenue Code, allowing \nfuneral director trustees to elect to pay the tax on income earned by \nfuneral trusts. This tax simplification measure eased the paperwork \nburden and administrative costs on funeral director trustees, who were \npreviously required to issue hundreds of 1099 forms to their elderly \ncustomers. It also eliminated the tax liability and confusion of many \nelderly Americans who previously received these forms. Unfortunately, \nonly those trusts under the cap are currently eligible for designation \nas QFTs. By removing this restrictive cap, our legislation will \neliminate unnecessary administrative burdens on beneficiaries and \ntrustees.\n  Let me give you an example of how the current cap creates unnecessary \nconfusion for families. I have used this example before. It remains \nworth telling. Four years ago, a constituent of mine wrote me about \nthis situation. He was suffering from Parkinson's disease. So he began \nplanning his own funeral in order that these decisions and this burden \nwould be lifted from his children. Because of the cap on QFTs, however, \nwhich at the time was $7,800, this Utahn was not able to fully fund the \nfuneral services he desired. It became necessary to have one of his \nsons complete this planning for him by opening up his own, separate \ntrust that would help to cover the remaining expenses. We should not be \nmaking it hard for families to do the right thing. We should not be \nmaking families jump through extra hoops when all they are trying to do \nis make these responsible decisions, well in advance of need.\n\n  For older Americans, the primary benefits of this legislation are the \nability to have all the money they have saved in the trust be applied \nto final expenses, instead of taxes, and the incentive to increase the \namount of their contribution. Sixty percent of prefunded funerals were \nfunded by trusts and elimination of the cap should raise this \npercentage. For funeral directors, this change would eliminate the \nburden and expense of issuing information documents to report income \nearned from the trust.\n  The National Funeral Directors Association supports this legislation. \nSo too do numerous funeral homes that serve the people of Utah.\n  I have no doubt that many more of these funeral businesses, many of \nwhich are family-owned and family-run, that serve local communities \nfrom coast to coast support this legislation as well.\n  I think we can all agree that we should make it easier for those who \nare willing to provide for these necessary expenses in advance. Today, \nI ask my colleagues to join me in an effort to enact this important \nmeasure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1743\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 261\n\n       Whereas many citizens of the United States remember Donald \n     Jeffry Herbert as ``Mr. Wizard'' and mourn his passing;\n       Whereas Don Herbert was born in Waconia, Minnesota and \n     graduated from the La Crosse State Teacher's College in \n     Wisconsin in 1940 where he trained to be a science teacher;\n       Whereas Don Herbert volunteered for the United States Army \n     Air Corps and served our country in the Atlantic theater and \n     earned the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with \n     3 oak leaf clusters;\n       Whereas Don Herbert developed the idea for science \n     programming culminating in ``Watch Mr. Wizard'', a live \n     television show produced from 1951 to 1964 and honored by a \n     Peabody Award in 1954;\n       Whereas the National Science Foundation and the American \n     Chemical Society lauded Don Herbert and his show for \n     promoting interest in science and his contributions to \n     science education;\n       Whereas ``Watch Mr. Wizard'' has been recognized by \n     numerous awards;\n       Whereas an additional educational program, ``Mr. Wizard's \n     World'', inspired children from 1983 to 1990 on cable \n     television;\n       Whereas ``Mr. Wizard'' continued to serve as an ambassador \n     for science education by authoring multiple books and \n     programs, and by traveling to schools and providing classroom \n     demonstrations;\n       Whereas educational research indicates that young children \n     make decisions about future careers at a very early age and \n     are influenced greatly by positive contacts with science and \n     technology;\n       Whereas a strong education in science and technology is one \n     of the building blocks of a productive, competitive, and \n     healthy society;\n       Whereas ``Mr. Wizard'' encouraged children to duplicate his \n     experiments at home, driving independent inquiry into science \n     with simple household equipment;\n       Whereas ``Mr. Wizard's'' dynamic and energetic science \n     experiments attracted unprecedented numbers of children to \n     educational programming, even those who were disinterested or \n     unmotivated in science;\n       Whereas Mr. Wizard Science Clubs were started across the \n     United States and had more than 100,000 children enrolled in \n     5,000 clubs by the mid-1950s; and\n       Whereas Don Herbert will be remembered as a pioneer of \n     commercial educational programming and instrumental in making \n     science education exciting and approachable for millions of \n     children across the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses appreciation for the profound public service \n     and educational contributions of Donald Jeffry Herbert;\n       (2) recognizes the profound impact of higher educational \n     institutions that train teachers;\n       (3) encourages students to honor the heritage of Don \n     Herbert by exploring our world through science, technology, \n     engineering, and mathematics fields; and\n       (4) tenders condolences to the family of Don Herbert and \n     thanks them for their strong familial support of him.\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1979.

Mr. President, I would ask one thing of my colleagues. \nWe wouldn't want this--certainly, I wouldn't, and I believe most of my \ncolleagues wouldn't--want to let this bill be delayed because of the \ncuts of a thousand deaths. We have dealt with the first objection--TSA. \nWe did something many of us thought we shouldn't do in an effort to \nmove the bill forward. The majority leader has said he will deal with \nSenator Coburn's objection. But if then tomorrow something else comes \ndown and they make another objection and next week another objection \nand another objection, that would not be fair.\n  So I would ask my colleagues, anyone else who has objections, to \nbring them forward tomorrow so maybe we can try to resolve them and \nmove this bill forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8723-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8723-S8724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE\n\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to H.R. 1830.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1830) to extend the authorities of the Andean \n     Trade Preference Act until February 29, 2008.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, the Senate has taken an important \nstep in our relationship with Latin America. Following House action \nlast night, the Senate unanimously approved an 8-month extension of the \nAndean Trade Preference Act, ATPA. Our action today prevents these key \ntrade preferences from expiring abruptly this weekend. More \nimportantly, it underscores the value that United States places on \nstrong economic engagement with our partners in the Andean region.\n  The Andean Trade Preference Act provides duty-free access to certain \nproducts from Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. These preferences \nensure that hundreds of thousands of workers in these countries can \nfind legal and meaningful employment in their own countries--workers \nwho might otherwise find jobs in coca fields or in other illicit \nindustries. By doing so, the Andean trade preferences enable the United \nStates to continue to promote economic and political stability in a key \nregion of Latin America.\n  ATPA and other preference programs are not a one-way street. I hear \nrepeatedly from American businesses and consumers how these preference \nprograms benefit the United States. Specifically, ATPA provides \nnumerous U.S. companies with a source of high-quality, duty-free inputs \nfor their products. American companies then pass these benefits on to \nAmerican consumers in the form of lower costs and greater product \ndiversity.\n  While I welcome this extension, I do not wish to minimize legitimate \nconcerns that some of my colleagues have about the program, especially \nthose relating to protection of U.S. investment. ATPA provides a \nframework for addressing these concerns and finding the solutions. To \nbenefit from these preferences, beneficiary countries must protect \nforeign investment. They must afford worker rights. They must uphold \nkey intellectual property rights. And they must meet counternarcotics \nrequirements. Because of these provisions, ATPA is one of the best \ndiplomatic tools America has in Latin America.\n  Today we took an important step in passing an 8-month extension of \nATPA. But 8 months is not a lasting solution. Rather, it is a stepping \nstone toward a possible longer term extension for ATPA beneficiaries, \nas circumstances warrant. Eight months from now, some countries may \nstill need these preferences; others may not. During the time, I will \nclosely monitor whether ATPA beneficiary countries live up to their end \nof the bargain and abide by the requirements of the program. If they \ndo, I will work hard to secure a longer extension. The United States \nand the Andean region will be better for it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before I ask this be completed, I am glad \nthis is being done. I am disappointed it is only until the end of \nFebruary.\n  I traveled to Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. This is so important to \nthose countries. I am glad we will get it extended. It would have \nexpired at the end of this month. It will not expire now. I hope by \nnext February we can have a multiyear extension. I have spoken to \nSenators Grassley and Baucus. I hope that is the case.\n  I ask unanimous consent the bill be read three times and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1830) was ordered to be read a third time, was read \nthe third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/28/senate-section/article/S8724-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 1585\n\n  Mr. REID.
