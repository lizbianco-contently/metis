Mr. President, No. 1, I wish to acknowledge the progress \nthat was made yesterday between Senator McConnell and Senator Reid \nregarding an impasse over circuit court nominations.\n  The average, I believe, for the last 2 years of a Presidential term \nwhen the opposing party had control of the Senate, was 15 circuit court \nnominations being confirmed by the Senate. At this point, we are at \nseven.\n  As I understand, an agreement reached yesterday between Senator Reid \nand Senator McConnell will allow three circuit court judges to be moved \nforward by the May 23 recess. I appreciate that progress.\n  I live in the State of South Carolina, which is in the Fourth \nJudicial Circuit. We have a judicial emergency on hand there. A third \nof the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals is vacant. We have two nominees, \none from South Carolina and one from North Carolina, who have been \nawaiting hearings and confirmation for well over 200 days now.\n  I urge my colleagues to allow these fine candidates for the judiciary \nto move forward and the Senate get on about its business when it comes \nto judges. What I worry the most about is, over the last 4 or 5 years, \nwe have had an experience with judges pretty much unknown to the \nSenate. There are a lot of anecdotal stories, a lot of cases in the \npast where people slow walked. I can only speak to my time here. I was \ninvolved in the Gang of 14 to make sure the Senate did not do something \nthat would haunt the body for years to come. The Gang of 14 was a \nbipartisan effort to make sure filibustering judges would be done only \nin extraordinary circumstances, simply because if we engage in this \npractice of trying to hold up Presidential nominations based on \nphilosophy and not qualifications, if all of us become President, so to \nspeak, saying, I am not going to allow a vote on a judge I wouldn't \nhave picked, it becomes chaos.\n  I urge Senators Clinton and Obama, who have been, quite frankly, part \nof the problem, to look at the model they are setting, because if they \ndo secure the White House, they do not want this to come back to haunt \nthem.\n  I want an independent judiciary. I wish to make sure it is well paid \nand insulated as much as possible from an unfair process. The \nconfirmation process is getting out of hand, overly political, too many \npolitical interest groups on the left or right have an inordinate \namount of say in who gets on the bench. The role of the Senate is to \npass judgment, an up-or-down vote, on qualified nominees sent over by \nthe President.\n  I found in the Senate if you get someone who is an outlier, there is \nusually bipartisan support to say no to that nominee. President Bush \nsent over a couple nominees I opposed. Generally speaking, I expect my \ntime in the Senate to defer as much as possible to a Presidential \nnominee who I think is qualified and not base my vote or denying a \nnominee a vote based on the fact I would not have chosen that person. I \ncertainly would not have chosen Justice Ginsburg, if I was President, \nbut she is eminently qualified and received well over 90 votes, I \nbelieve.\n  I hope in the future we will allow judges to come to the floor, \nthrough the committee, in a timely process. The Fourth Judicial Circuit \nis in dire need of Judge Conrad and Mr. Steve Matthews from South \nCarolina having hearings and a vote. If a Senator does not like these \nnominees, they can vote against them. What happened there is creating a \nproblem in the area of the country in which I live and, quite frankly, \nit is unfair.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to break this logjam. \nSenator Durbin and Senator Kennedy were kind enough to meet with Steve \nMatthews, the nominee from South Carolina, and I appreciate them doing \nso.\n  Let's not get into a pattern that will come back to haunt us as a \nbody and do a lot of damage to the confirmation process and over time \nerode the independence of the judiciary.\n  I appreciate the progress that was achieved yesterday, but there is a \nlot more to do, particularly when it comes to the Fourth Circuit.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3040-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3040-S3046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, over the past couple of weeks, there has \nbeen a lot of talk about the lack of progress the Democrat majority in \nthe Senate has made on judicial confirmations in the last couple of \nyears, but I want to thank the majority leader for his promise last \nnight to confirm three judges by Memorial Day. This is certainly \nwelcome news. I hope at least one of those is the nominee for the \nFourth Circuit.\n  As we all know, our courts are in crisis. Currently, there are over \n40 vacancies on the U.S. Circuit Court, and of those half are judicial \nemergencies. The consequences of the majority's failure to act on these \nnominations result in extended judicial vacancies, increased casework, \nand a delay in verdicts. This obstruction is harmful for the American \njudicial system and the American people.\n  One of the most important jobs we have here in the Senate is to offer \nadvice and consent to the President's judicial nominees. While I \nbelieve all of these nominees deserve an up-or-down vote on the Senate \nFloor, I rise today specifically to speak on the current judicial \nvacancies on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and the qualified \nnominees waiting for a vote.\n  The Fourth Circuit of Appeals, which covers South Carolina, North \nCarolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland, is one-third vacant. \nEven though the Fourth Circuit is facing so many pronounced vacancies, \nand there is a critical need for judges, the Democratic leadership has \nmade no effort to move any of the pending nominees.\n  In spite of the number of vacancies, the Fourth Circuit, run by Chief \nJudge Karen Williams, continues to do a remarkable job. Many of the \ncases brought before the Fourth Circuit are extremely complex, and the \njudges must spend a longer amount of time on each of these cases before \nissuing their opinion. Our judges will not sacrifice quality, but it \nmay take a lot longer for the court to issue its decision. We are lucky \nthat the Fourth Circuit has the leadership it has. They are dedicated \nand hardworking, clearly, but we cannot continue with this high level \nof vacancy.\n  I have heard firsthand about the impact these vacancies have on the \nFourth Circuit. Appellate courts must have enough judges to fill the \npanel, and if a seat is vacant, they must fill it somehow. This means \njudges from other circuits or judges from the district courts must take \ntime away from their families, their caseload, their administrative \ntasks to fill the spot on the panel.\n  Two of the Fourth Circuit nominees, Mr. Steve Matthews of South \nCarolina and Mr. Robert Conrad of North Carolina, have the support of \ntheir home State Senators and are ready for a hearing in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Despite these facts, both nominees have been \nwaiting for over 200 days for a hearing.\n  Let me quote an editorial from the Washington Post in December of \n2007 in which they addressed the dire straits of the Fourth Circuit.\n\n       The Senate should act in good faith to fill vacancies--not \n     as a favor to the President but out of respect for the \n     residents, businesses, defendants, and victims of crime in \n     the region the Fourth Circuit covers. Two nominees--Mr. \n     Conrad and Steve A. Matthews--should receive confirmation \n     hearings as soon as possible.\n\n  On that note, I wish to spend a couple of minutes telling you about \nMr. Steve Matthews from South Carolina. President Bush nominated Steve \nMatthews in September of 2007, but the Senate Judiciary Committee has \nfailed to hold a hearing on his nomination.\n  Matthews received his undergraduate degree from the University of \nSouth Carolina and his law degree from Yale Law School. He is currently \nthe managing director of Haynesworth, Sinkler, and Boyd in Columbia, \nSC.\n  Prior to joining the Columbia firm, Matthews practiced in the \nWashington office of Dewey Ballantine and served\n\n[[Page S3041]]\n\nin the U.S. Department of Justice during President Reagan's second \nterm. During his time at the Department of Justice, Matthews advised \nthen Attorney General Ed Meese and President Reagan on the selection of \nnominees for Federal judgeships, and served as special counsel to Meese \non the Iran Contra investigation.\n  I have personally met with Mr. Matthews several times and know he has \nthe experience, the intellect, and the integrity necessary to serve on \none of our Nation's highest courts.\n  We must fulfill our constitutional responsibility to vote on judicial \nnominations and allow hearings, as well as plain up-or-down votes here \non the Senate Floor. The Senate Judiciary Committee has several \nextraordinary nominees before it, and the Fourth Circuit desperately \nneeds their service.\n  Our courts are in critical need of judges and any inaction on these \nnominees is irresponsible and puts our Nation's judicial system at \nrisk. Again, I thank the majority leader for committing to at least \nthree by Memorial Day, and I appreciate the opportunity to address this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think the Senate is clearly in a \nslowdown. It is not fulfilling its responsibility to evaluate and vote \non Presidential nominees for our courts in America.\n  We are now into the fourth month of 2008 and only one circuit judge, \nJudge Haynes, who received an ABA rating of unanimously well \nqualified--the highest rating by the bar--has been confirmed, and that \nconfirmation only happened last week, April 10. So we have gone quite a \nlong time here. We still have 10 pending nominations to the appeals \ncourts that need hearings, need votes out of the Judiciary Committee, \nand need up-or-down votes on the Senate Floor.\n  Why is this a problem? I will tell you. Because President Bush \ncampaigned on, and effectively, I believe, won the day on the argument \nthat judges should be, as now Chief Justice John Roberts said at his \nconfirmation hearing, neutral umpires. They are supposed to call the \nballs and strikes. They are not supposed to be on one side or the \nother. They are not supposed to be setting forth their personal \npolitical agendas in the guise of ruling on disputes of law in a \ncourtroom. That is an abuse of the power of the judiciary. Members of \nthe Judiciary are given lifetime appointments. They cannot be removed \nexcept through impeachment or death, and their salaries can not be \nreduced. It is critical that those judges show restraint and remember \ntheir proper role in our three branch system.\n  Now, the truth is that for many years my liberal activist colleagues \nhave delighted in having Federal judges, and sometimes State judges, \npromote and affect a political agenda they could not win at the ballot \nbox. That is what it is all about. But we need judges who respect the \nrule of law and who understand they are not policymakers. If they want \nto set policy, let them run for Governor, let them run for President or \nthe Senate. So President Bush has consistently submitted nominees with \nhigh ratings, even from the American Bar Association, which frequently, \nI submit, is more activist than I would favor. Indeed, they meet and \nhave all these resolutions and pass these resolutions on issues with \nwhich I do not agree. I am a member of the ABA, but I don't agree with \nsome of the positions they take in these resolutions. They meet in some \nbig conference, unrepresented by the members of the bar, and they do \nthese things.\n\n  I mention all that to say they have been rating these present \nnominees very well. They have been giving them high ratings because \nthey are men and women of good legal ability, sound judgment, and \nPresident Bush would not nominate them if they were not committed to \nthe proper role of a judge, in my view.\n  Circuit court vacancies--these are the 11 circuits we have. The \ncircuit courts are the first level of appellate courts above the \nFederal district court, the trial courts. When you appeal a criminal \nconviction or a civil judgment in America, you appeal first from the \ndistrict court to the circuit court. That is one step below the Supreme \nCourt. Then you can appeal from there to the U.S. Supreme Court, Chief \nJustice Roberts and his team, right across the street. That is the way \nthe system works. These appellate courts are important because the \nSupreme Court only takes 100 or so cases a year, and many of the \nrulings of the circuit courts have become final. That is one reason \npeople consider them to be important. Ultimately, the Supreme Court \nwill rule.\n  Despite the fact that there are 10 nominees for the 13 vacancies in \nthe circuit courts, the Judiciary Committee, our committee, of which I \nhave been a member now for almost 12 years, has only given a hearing to \n1, and that was over a year and a half ago when Senator Specter was \nchairman, the Republican chairman.\n  Peter Keisler, the circuit nominee for the D.C. Circuit here in \nWashington, was given a hearing in August 2006, but he has still not \nbeen voted on, called up for a vote in the Judiciary Committee. He is a \nfabulous nominee. One of the reasons he is being objected to is the \nsame reason they objected to Miguel Estrada, the same reason they \nobjected to a lot of other nominees--he is so capable, he would be on \nthe short list for the Supreme Court of the United States. If they can \nkill them off at this level, they will not be considered sometime in \nthe future. That is just a fact. I have been here. I know how this \nworks. There is no reason Peter Keisler ought not to be confirmed. He \nhad a hearing in August 2006, and he still has not been brought up for \na vote in the committee.\n  Catharina Haynes was highly rated too. She was confirmed last week \nafter we began to complain about this. That was the first circuit court \nnomination hearing since September of last year.\n  The Fourth Circuit is in a crisis. The vacancy rate is alarming. One-\nthird of the seats are vacant. Four nominees are pending for those \nvacancies, but none has even been given a hearing.\n  Robert Conrad, former Federal prosecutor, has been waiting for a \nhearing for 265 days. He is also, at this point, a Federal district \njudge, a Federal district judge for the Western District of North \nCarolina. He was nominated for a judicial emergency. He has the support \nof both his home Senators, received a unanimous ABA rating of ``well \nqualified,'' the highest rating you can get. He is a consensus nominee. \nThe Senate unanimously confirmed him for his current district judge \nseat, and the ABA, then, ranked him unanimously ``well qualified.'' The \nwhole ABA 15-member committee voted him the highest rating, \nunanimously. So why hasn't he been given a hearing?\n  Steve Matthews has been waiting over 205 days. We have others out \nthere who I think are being slowed down.\n  Mr. Conrad is an excellent nominee, in my opinion. He has a number of \nqualifications. I remember he was given the duty to conduct one of the \ninvestigations that occurred in the Department of Justice. He \ntestified. I remember him testifying because I liked the honesty and \ndirectness in his testimony. He chose not to prosecute anybody for \nthose offenses, but by all accounts he examined it carefully and \nfairly. Among other qualifications he had, he played point guard on the \nClemson University basketball team in the ACC where he was an academic \nAll-American basketball player, among the other things he did, which \nhas always impressed me.\n  I would say there has been talk about invoking the so-called Thurmond \nRule. The Thurmond Rule could sort of be, if you want it to be, an \nexcuse for slow-walking nominees and not approving the nominees who \nought to be approved just because there is a Presidential election on \nthe horizon. Majority Leader Harry Reid mentioned last night that the \nso-called rule would be invoked in June. Senator Leahy has mentioned \nbefore that he would invoke it in the second half of this year. Let me \nsay this about the Thurmond Rule. It is a myth. It does not exist. \nThere is no reason for stopping the confirmation of judicial nominees \nin the second half of a year in which there is a Presidential election.\n  I remind my colleagues that our now chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Chairman Leahy, when he assumed control over the committee, \nstated he would institute the Thurmond Rule starting the spring of this \nyear. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S3042]]\n\n\n       The Thurmond rule, in memory of Senator Strom Thurmond--he \n     put this in when the Republicans were in the minority--which \n     said in a Presidential election year, after spring, no judges \n     would go through except by the consent of both Republican and \n     Democratic leaders. I want to be bipartisan. We will \n     institute the Thurmond rule.\n\n  Those were his remarks at Georgetown University Law School in \nDecember 2006.\n  In May 2007, he reiterated that the Thurmond Rule would kick in next \nApril. Senator Leahy said:\n\n       Obviously the Thurmond rule kicks in.\n\n  But let's be very clear about it. The Thurmond Rule as interpreted is \na false myth. Senator Leahy, before the statements he made in 2006 and \n2007 during the Bush Presidency, has admitted as much. In fact, as \nSenator Leahy said in 2000, when the situation was somewhat different--\nduring President Clinton's final year in office, like this is President \nBush's last year:\n\n       There is a myth that judges are not traditionally confirmed \n     in Presidential election years. That is not true. Recall that \n     64 judges were confirmed in 1980; 44 in 1984; 42 in 1988, \n     when a Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed the Reagan \n     nominees and, as I have noted, 66 in 1992, when a Democratic \n     majority in the Senate confirmed 66 Bush nominees.\n\n  Those are not my words. Those are Senator Leahy's words.\n  I see the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee is \nhere. It is time for him to speak. I will just say that we, as Members \nof this Senate, have a Constitutional responsibility to move judicial \nnominees. We should not be playing games. Good nominees with strong \nsupport ought to be moved forward. A lot of these nominees have not \nbeen treated fairly. It is time to move them forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my distinguished \ncolleague from Alabama for his cogent, timely comments about the need \nto process the confirmation of judges. Republicans have reserved time \nin our period for morning business to speak to this issue in order to \nacquaint the American people with the importance of proceeding with the \nconfirmation of Federal judges. The process has been slowed down very \nmaterially during the final two years of Presidential terms when the \nWhite House is controlled by one party and the Senate the other, as the \nWhite House is now controlled by Republicans and the Senate by \nDemocrats.\n  As I have said on the Senate floor, this is a problem that has been \ngoing on for the past two decades. In the last two years of President \nReagan's administration, there was a slowdown when Democrats were in \ncharge of the Senate. The slowdown continued during the term of \nPresident Bush, the 41st President. Then, Republicans retaliated during \nthe term of President Clinton by slowing down the process. We have had \nvery major disputes--I would even call them bitter disputes. \nNotwithstanding the disrepute of the word ``bitter,'' sometimes it is \napplicable, and I think it is certainly applicable to the filibusters \nof 2005. During that confrontation between the parties, filibusters \nwere used repeatedly by Democrats. Republicans retaliated in kind with \nthe threat of a so-called nuclear or constitutional option.\n  As I have said on the floor on previous occasions, the fault lies, in \nmy judgment, with both parties. I thought the Republican caucus was \nwrong in its response to President Clinton's nominees, and I backed up \nmy opinion with my votes. I voted in support of President Clinton's \nqualified nominees.\n  It is my hope that we can find a resolution to this issue, that we \ncan reach across the aisle. There is no doubt the American people are \nsick and tired of party bickering. There is also no doubt that the \nAmerican people want prompt justice in our courts. Where you have \njudicial emergencies, as you have in many courts where nominees have \nbeen pending for protracted periods of time, failing to fill vacancies \ndoes great harm to the litigants who are waiting to have their cases \nheard. As a simple illustration, I'll use an automobile accident case. \nIf somebody has this type of case in court, first you look to the \njurisdiction, which is a judicial emergency, and there is no district \njudge to try the case. The litigant waits and waits. You do not have to \nemphasize the consequences of that situation. People are perhaps out of \nwork from their injuries as their medical bills are rising. They ought \nto have their day in court to have the matter adjudicated. If the \nmatter is finally tried, then an appeal is taken in the courts of \nappeals, and there are judicial emergencies there. Again, the litigant \nwaits and waits. The problem is clear. It is my hope we would move \nahead here and process judicial nominees.\n  I am pleased to note that some progress has been made, as announced \nby the majority leader after consultation with Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader. There is an arrangement to have three circuit judges \nconfirmed before Memorial Day. That is a step in the right direction, \nproviding that the right judges are confirmed.\n  It has been announced similarly that finally, at long last, after \nprotracted disputes, there is an agreement between the White House and \nthe Michigan Senators on the nomination of two circuit judges for the \nSixth Circuit.\n  It is my hope that the confirmations will be directed to three of the \nnominees who have been ready for hearings or committee votes and have \nbeen waiting the longest time.\n  Peter Keisler, nominee for the District of Columbia Circuit Court of \nAppeals, has been waiting for more than 650 days. There has been some \ntalk about the D.C. Circuit not needing an additional judge. That is \nsimply not factually correct. Mr. Keisler has been lauded by newspaper \neditorials--The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times--and is \npreeminently well qualified to be confirmed to that position.\n  Judge Robert Conrad, Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court in North \nCarolina, has been waiting for over 270 days, and he is nominated to \nfill a judicial emergency. There is no blue-slip problem with Judge \nConrad; the Senators from North Carolina are both urging his \nconfirmation.\n  Similarly, with the nomination of Steve Matthews of the Fourth \nCircuit, he has been waiting for more than 220 days. And, again, both \nthe blue slips have been returned. So, it is my hope we will move \nquickly to confirm Mr. Keisler, Judge Conrad, and Mr. Matthews. They \nare the ones who have been ready for committee action the longest and \nare most pressing.\n  By letter dated April 10, I wrote to Senator John McCain, Senator \nHillary Clinton, and Senator Barack Obama, asking for their positions \non prospective motions, which I intend to pursue in the Senate, to \ndischarge from the Senate Judiciary Committee the nominations of Judge \nConrad, Mr. Keisler, and Mr. Matthews.\n  There are procedures where we can take the matters from the committee \nand take them to the floor for action by the entire body. The \nConstitution provides that confirmations will be handled by the Senate; \nthere is no provision for committee action. In my judgment, when the \ncontroversies have raged for this period of time, the nominees ought to \ncome to the full Senate.\n  I have also written to the interrogators of the debate, which is \nscheduled for this evening at the convention center of Philadelphia, \nMr. George Stephanopoulos of ABC News and Mr. Charles Gibson of ABC \nNews, suggesting that these would be appropriate questions for Senator \nClinton and Senator Obama during the course of the discussion this \nevening.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letters to Senator \nMcCain, Senator Clinton, Senator Obama and Mr. Stephanopoulos and Mr. \nGibson be included in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Now, in these letters to the three Senators, dated April \n10, I said I would not make the disclosure of them public until April \n15, in order to give them an opportunity to reply before these letters \nwere released to the press. I said:\n\n       I do not plan to make the news media aware of my inquiries \n     until April 15th in order to give you ample opportunity to \n     advise me of your response.\n\n  Yesterday evening, I did receive a response from Senator Obama. I \nthink it is worthwhile to read this into the Record. Senator Obama \nwrites:\n\n       I am responding to your letter of April 10, 2008, regarding \n     several pending judicial\n\n[[Page S3043]]\n\n     nominations. As a former constitutional law instructor, I \n     fully appreciate the important work that our Federal judges \n     do and the need to fill judicial vacancies. However, I have \n     great respect for the Senate's constitutional advice and \n     consent role in the confirmation of these judges.\n       The concerns you have raised in your letter are important \n     ones. However, since I am not a member of the Judiciary \n     Committee, I would defer to Chairman Leahy on the scheduling \n     of any committee votes on these pending nominations, and I \n     would defer to Senator Reid on the scheduling of any floor \n     votes.\n       Moreover, I am confident that we can work in a bipartisan \n     fashion to continue to fill vacancies. Just last week, the \n     Senate confirmed five judicial nominations. And today, \n     Chairman Leahy has announced a resolution reached with the \n     Administration over Sixth Circuit nominations. Those events \n     highlight a desire on all sides to ensure that vacancies on \n     the bench are filled.\n       Thank you for seeking my views on this issue. Sincerely, \n     Barack Obama, United States Senator.\n\n  I begin by thanking Senator Obama for his reply. But, I disagree with \nhim, disagree respectfully, on the position he has taken. When he says \nhe is not a member of the Judiciary Committee, I believe his standing \nas a Member of the Senate is the determinative membership, and under \nthe Constitution of the United States, the Senate has the \nconstitutional responsibility to consent or not on pending nominations.\n\n  When Senator Obama says that ``I would defer to Chairman Leahy on the \nscheduling of any committee votes on these nominations,'' and, ``I \nwould defer to Senator Reid on the scheduling of any floor votes,'' \nagain, I disagree, respectfully.\n  A Senator's duties are not delegated. No Senator can delegate to \nanyone else his constitutional responsibilities. The Constitution does \nnot refer to the Judiciary Committee. The Constitution does not refer \nto the majority leader. Even if it did, that would not provide a basis \nfor a Senator, duly elected and sworn to uphold the Constitution, as I \ntook an oath on five occasions and as Senator Obama has taken an oath \nand as every Member of this body has taken an oath, not to uphold the \nConstitution.\n  The Constitution says: The Senate confirms. The Constitution says: \nSenators vote. You cannot delegate your constitutional \nresponsibilities. There is an abundance of case law on this subject in \na myriad of contexts, and so, I would respectfully ask my colleague, \nSenator Obama, to reconsider.\n  I would also ask, respectfully, for Senator McCain to respond and for \nSenator Clinton to respond. Further, when Senator Obama talks about his \nconfidence that we can work out, in a bipartisan fashion, an agreement \nto fill the current vacancies, I think that confidence is misplaced.\n  When Senator Obama makes note of the fact that there were \nconfirmations last week, he does not make note of the fact that these \nwere the first confirmations this year, and that there was no hearing \non any circuit judge from September 25, 2007, until February 21, 2008.\n  What is required to move the process along is for Senators to \ndischarge their duty. In proposing to bring these matters to the floor \nfor action by the full Senate, it is my view that every Senator ought \nto stand up and say whether he agrees with what is going on today \nbecause I think we have an electorate that is concerned.\n  And, the purpose of this discussion today is to fully acquaint the \nelectorate with what is happening. As we have seen in prior elections, \nobstructionism costs at the ballot box. I would prefer not to resort to \nthe political process. I would prefer not to make this a campaign or an \nelection issue. I would prefer to see the Senate decide this on the \nmerits.\n  Again, I emphasize the need for independent judgments. I do not think \nit is sufficient for a Senator to say: I am going to defer to the \nchairman. I do not that it is sufficient for a Senator to say: I am \ngoing to defer to the majority leader.\n  When I disagreed with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--and we \nhad a very distinguished chairman, Senator Hatch, sitting beside me--I \nsaid to Senator Hatch: Orin, I respectfully disagree. I am going to \nvote that way. Let the Record show Senator Hatch is nodding in the \naffirmative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for morning business has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. When I disagreed with the majority leader, I said so. I \nwould ask other Senators to do the same.\n  Mr. President, we have the Senator from South Carolina on the floor. \nHe arrived in the middle of my remarks. I would ask that he be \npermitted to speak, and also Senator Hatch, be permitted to speak for \nup to 5 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, we are laying down our \nbill. Senator DeMint has been waiting for his amendment. He has a time \nproblem. So I am willing to give another 3 minutes to our Republican \nfriends. But, seriously, we need to get going on this bill. We have \nbeen on this bill now for 3 days.\n  We finally have an amendment. We would like to hear it. So I would \nagree to 3 minutes more.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I renew my request for 5 minutes for the \ntwo Senators who are on the floor.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator. I have spoken on judges. I will \ndefer to Senator Hatch and make my comments later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 2008.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: I write seeking your position on a \n     prospective motion to discharge from the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee the pending nominations of Mr. Peter Keisler, \n     nominee to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Judge \n     Robert Conrad of North Carolina, nominee to the Court of \n     Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and Mr. Steve Matthews of \n     South Carolina, nominee to the Court of Appeals for the \n     Fourth Circuit.\n       Mr. Keisler's nomination has been on the agenda since June \n     29, 2006, without a Committee vote despite his excellent \n     credentials. He graduated magna cum laude from Yale \n     University and then received his Juris Doctor from Yale Law \n     School. In addition to clerking for Supreme Court Justice \n     Anthony Kennedy, Mr. Keisler has held several high level \n     positions in the Department of Justice. Most recently, he \n     served as Acting Attorney General, providing much needed \n     leadership after the resignation of Attorney General \n     Gonzales. Prior to that, Mr. Keisler served as the Assistant \n     Attorney General managing the Civil Division of the Justice \n     Department. He is currently a partner in the D.C. office of \n     Sidley Austin LLP. The American Bar Association has awarded \n     him its highest rating, a ``unanimous well qualified,'' and \n     the editorial boards of the Los Angeles Times and The \n     Washington Post have called him a ``moderate conservative,'' \n     a ``highly qualified nominee,'' and someone who ``certainly \n     warrants confirmation.''\n       The only objections raised to Mr. Keisler's nomination have \n     nothing to do with his qualifications or suitability to sit \n     on the D.C. Circuit. Instead, the objections concern whether \n     the Senate needs to fill the 11th seat on the D.C. Circuit, \n     the seat to which Mr. Keisler is nominated. On the contrary, \n     there is recent precedent of the Senate confirming a nominee \n     to fill the 11th seat on the D.C. Circuit. In 2005, the \n     Senate voted to confirm Thomas Griffith to fill the 11th seat \n     on the D.C. Circuit. Judge Griffith was voted out of the \n     Judiciary Committee and confirmed with bipartisan support, \n     including the support of Senators Biden, Feinstein, Durbin, \n     Kohl, and Schumer. In addition, Congress recently validated \n     the 11th seat of the D.C. Circuit when it passed the Court \n     Security Improvement Act last year. Further, arguments \n     against filling the 11th seat based on the decrease in the \n     D.C. Circuit's caseload since 1997 are premature due to the \n     recent addition of detainee cases to the circuit's \n     jurisdiction and the possibility of an increase in \n     administrative law cases due to choice of venue options.\n       I include Judge Conrad and Mr. Matthews in the proposed \n     motion due to the critical need to expeditiously fill the \n     vacancies on the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. \n     Currently, one-third of the seats on the Fourth Circuit are \n     vacant, leaving the court inexcusably understaffed. Judge \n     Conrad and Mr. Matthews are also exceptional appellate court \n     nominees. Judge Conrad is the Chief Judge of the Western \n     District of North Carolina, a position to which he was \n     unanimously confirmed in 2005. Prior to his service on the \n     bench, he had a long career as a federal prosecutor, working \n     in both Republican and Democratic administrations. He has the \n     support of both his home state senators, and the ABA has \n     rated him unanimously ``well qualified.'' The vacancy to \n     which Judge Conrad has been nominated has been declared a \n     ``judicial emergency'' by the nonpartisan Administrative \n     Office of the Courts. In fact,\n\n[[Page S3044]]\n\n     there is a protracted history to this particular seat, which \n     has been vacant since 1994. However, Judge Conrad has been \n     waiting for a hearing for over 260 days.\n       Mr. Matthews is another outstanding circuit court nominee. \n     A graduate of Yale Law School, Mr. Matthews has had a \n     distinguished career in private practice in South Carolina. \n     He also served for several years in appointed positions in \n     the Department of Justice, including positions in the Civil \n     Division, the Civil Rights Division, the Office of Legal \n     Policy, and the Office of the Attorney General. He has been a \n     shareholder of a prominent South Carolina law firm since \n     1991, and from 2004 to 2008 served as the managing director. \n     He has the strong support of both of his home state senators. \n     Despite his impressive and varied professional credentials, \n     Mr. Matthews has been waiting for a hearing for over 200 \n     days. Notwithstanding my repeated requests, no Committee \n     action is planned at this time on any of the aforementioned \n     nominees.\n       Another nominee, Justice Stephen Agee of Virginia was \n     recently nominated to fill another judicial emergency on the \n     Fourth Circuit. I remain hopeful that Justice Agee will be \n     listed on a hearing agenda and acted on by the Committee in \n     the very near future. If the Committee delays in processing \n     his nomination, I may return to him, given the judicial \n     emergency on the Fourth Circuit.\n       I write to find out how you would vote on the proposed \n     discharge petition, but also, candidly, to focus the public's \n     attention on these nominations. I know you are aware of the \n     ongoing controversy as to whether the Judiciary Committee is \n     processing nominations with appropriate dispatch. This type \n     of delay has been a recurrent problem during the last two \n     years of every President's Administration for the past two \n     decades when the White House is controlled by one party and \n     the Senate by the other.\n       I am also seeking the responses of Senator Obama and \n     Senator McCain on this subject.

On the contrary, \n     there is recent precedent of the Senate confirming a nominee \n     to fill the 11th seat on the D.C. Circuit. In 2005, the \n     Senate voted to confirm Thomas Griffith to fill the 11th seat \n     on the D.C. Circuit. Judge Griffith was voted out of the \n     Judiciary Committee and confirmed with bipartisan support, \n     including the support of Senators Biden, Feinstein, Durbin, \n     Kohl, and Schumer. In addition, Congress recently validated \n     the 11th seat of the D.C. Circuit when it passed the Court \n     Security Improvement Act last year. Further, arguments \n     against filling the 11th seat based on the decrease in the \n     D.C. Circuit's caseload since 1997 are premature due to the \n     recent addition of detainee cases to the circuit's \n     jurisdiction and the possibility of an increase in \n     administrative law cases due to choice of venue options.\n       I include Judge Conrad and Mr. Matthews in the proposed \n     motion due to the critical\n\n[[Page S3045]]\n\n     need to expeditiously fill the vacancies on the Court of \n     Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Currently, one-third of the \n     seats on the Fourth Circuit are vacant, leaving the court \n     inexcusably understaffed. Judge Conrad and Mr. Matthews are \n     also exceptional appellate court nominees. Judge Conrad is \n     the Chief Judge of the Western District of North Carolina, a \n     position to which he was unanimously confirmed in 2005. Prior \n     to his service on the bench, he had a long career as a \n     federal prosecutor, working in both Republican and Democratic \n     administrations. He has the support of both his home state \n     senators, and the ABA has rated him unanimously ``well \n     qualified.'' The vacancy to which Judge Conrad has been \n     nominated has been declared a ``judicial emergency'' by the \n     nonpartisan Administrative Office of the Courts. In fact, \n     there is a protracted history to this particular seat, which \n     has been vacant since 1994. However, Judge Conrad has been \n     waiting for a hearing for over 260 days.\n       Mr. Matthews is another outstanding circuit court nominee. \n     A graduate of Yale Law School, Mr. Matthews has had a \n     distinguished career in private practice in South Carolina. \n     He also served for several years in appointed positions in \n     the Department of Justice, including positions in the Civil \n     Division, the Civil Rights Division, the Office of Legal \n     Policy, and the Office of the Attorney General. He has been a \n     shareholder of a prominent South Carolina law firm since \n     1991, and from 2004 to 2008 served as the managing director. \n     He has the strong support of both of his home state senators. \n     Despite his impressive and varied professional credentials, \n     Mr. Matthews has been waiting for a hearing for over 200 \n     days. Notwithstanding my repeated requests, no Committee \n     action is planned at this time on any of the aforementioned \n     nominees.\n       Another nominee, Justice Stephen Agee of Virginia was \n     recently nominated to fill another judicial emergency on the \n     Fourth Circuit. I remain hopeful that Justice Agee will be \n     listed on a hearing agenda and acted on by the Committee in \n     the very near future. If the Committee delays in processing \n     his nomination, I may return to him, given the judicial \n     emergency on the Fourth Circuit.\n       I write to find out how you would vote on the proposed \n     discharge petition, but also, candidly, to focus the public's \n     attention on these nominations. I know you are aware of the \n     ongoing controversy as to whether the Judiciary Committee is \n     processing nominations with appropriate dispatch. This type \n     of delay has been a recurrent problem during the last two \n     years of every President's Administration for the past two \n     decades when the White House is controlled by one party and \n     the Senate by the other.\n       I am also seeking the responses of Senator Clinton and \n     Senator McCain on this subject. I do not plan to make the \n     news media aware of my inquiries until April 15th in order to \n     give you ample opportunity to advise me of your response.\n       Thank you very much for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 2008.\n     Mr. George Stephanopoulos,\n     ABC News.\n       Dear George: On April 10, 2008, I wrote to Senator John \n     McCain, Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama \n     seeking their positions on a prospective motion to discharge \n     from the Senate Judiciary Committee the pending nominations \n     of Mr. Peter Keisler to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     Circuit, Judge Robert Conrad of North Carolina to the Court \n     of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and Mr. Steve Matthews of \n     South Carolina to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth \n     Circuit.\n       With this letter, I am enclosing copies of those letters.

Mr. President, last week an event occurred that was a long \ntime coming.\n  I am not talking about the grand opening of the Newseum a few blocks \nfrom here down Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  No, last week the Senate finally voted on and confirmed a few \nnominees to the Federal bench.\n  This event is of historical proportions because not since 1848 had \nthe Senate taken this long to confirm a Federal judge in a Presidential \nelection year.\n  You heard me right.\n  The first judicial confirmation of 2004 was on January 28, the first \none in 2000 was on February 10, and the first one in 1996 was on \nJanuary 2.\n  One of my Democratic colleagues was here on the floor last week \ntrying to shuffle the historical chairs on the judicial confirmation \ndeck by talking about the 1996 session rather than 1996 itself because \nthe second session of the 104th Congress began on January 3.\n  By dicing and splicing the calendar that way, he tried to avoid \ncounting all of the judges we confirmed that year.\n  I am not going to play that game.\n  I am comparing apples with apples, years with years.\n  In 33 of the 40 Presidential election years since 1848, the Senate \nconfirmed the first Federal judge by the end of February.\n  Not mid-April, not mid-March, but the end of February.\n  This is the latest start to judicial confirmations in a presidential \nelection year in 160 years.\n  Now I realize that the Senate cannot vote on nominations that have \nnot been reported to the floor from the Judiciary Committee.\n  And the Judiciary Committee generally does not report out nominees \nwho have not had a hearing.\n  Unfortunately, the Judiciary Committee has simply not been holding \nhearings for nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  There was no judicial confirmation hearing at all last month, and the \nhearing 2 weeks ago was yet another one with no appeals court nominee.\n  This graph shows the number of appeals court nominees receiving a \nJudiciary Committee hearing in each of the 16 Congresses since I was \nfirst elected to the Senate.\n  These are the 95th Congress in 1977-78 to the current 110th Congress.\n  You can see there is some variation here and there from Congress to \nCongress, but without a doubt the 110th Congress is the lowest of them \nall.\n  Appeals court nominees are simply not getting hearings.\n  This graph helps us better evaluate what is going on today.\n  The Judiciary Committee held a hearing for an average of 23 appeals \ncourt nominees in the previous 15 Congresses during which I have served \nin this body.\n  One of my Democratic colleagues last week actually mocked using such \nan average as a comparison.\n  This average is over many years and includes periods when Democrats \nas well as Republicans ran the Senate and occupied the White House.\n  It is a much better, much more reliable standard than pulling out the \nsingle year or, worse yet, only the portion of a single year that makes \na predetermined partisan point.\n  Today, 15 months into the 110th Congress, only five appeals court \nnominees have received a hearing.\n  That is less than one-fourth the average over the previous 30 years.\n  Now some might say that Presidential election years, and therefore \nPresidential election Congresses, are different, that everything slows \ndown.\n  OK, fair enough, perhaps that would be a better comparison.\n  Comparing the current Congress with the previous seven Presidential \nelection Congresses, however, only widens the contrast between what the \nSenate has done in the past and what the Senate is not doing today.\n  It turns out that the Judiciary Committee held a hearing for an even \nhigher average of 25 appeals court nominees during those Presidential \nelection seasons.\n  In the current Presidential election season, however, only five \nappeals court nominees have had hearings.\n  If the partisan roles were reversed and the pace of hearings for \nappeals court nominees had slowed to perhaps one-half or one-third of \nthe historic average, I can guarantee you that my friends across the \naisle would be down here raising the roof about how we were failing to \ndo our confirmation duty.\n  In fact, when I chaired the Judiciary Committee under the previous \nPresident and the hearing pace was much faster than it is today, my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S3046]]\n\non the other side did complain early, loudly, and often.\n  But the pace today is worse than one-half, worse than one-third, \nworse even than one-fourth of the historic average.\n  The current Judiciary Committee hearing pace for appeals court \nnominees is the worst in decades.\n  In fact, there is virtually no current pace at all.\n  It has not been this way in the past, and it does not have to be this \nway today.\n  I am pleased that last night the distinguished majority and minority \nleaders spoke about this here on the floor and the majority leader \nacknowledged that ``we need to make more progress on judges.''\n  The majority leader said he would do his very best, his utmost as he \nput it, to confirm three more appeals court nominees by Memorial Day, \nwhich is coming in less than 6 weeks.\n  I would like to point out a few highly qualified nominees who have \nbeen waiting a long time and who I hope will be included in this \neffort.\n  Yesterday, this editorial appeared in the Washington Post.\n  It opens with these words: ``It is time to stop playing games with \njudicial nominees.''\n  The editorial correctly notes that the Senate confirmed more than \ntwice as many appeals court nominees in the final 2 years of the \nClinton administration than the Senate has confirmed so far in the \n110th Congress.\n  Even with the three additional appeals court nominees the majority \nleader has pledged to confirm, we have a lot of ground to make up.\n  The editorial suggests beginning to make up that ground by confirming \nPeter Keisler to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and Rod \nRosenstein to the Fourth Circuit.\n  Unlike some other languishing appeals court nominees, Mr. Keisler has \nat least had a hearing.\n  But it was 624 days ago.\n  Mr. Rosenstein has not been waiting that long but is fully as \nqualified. As the Post editorial points out, he has admirers on both \nsides of the aisle and is an excellent and principled lawyer.\n  Two other Fourth Circuit nominees whose consideration by the \nJudiciary Committee is long overdue are Steven Matthews of South \nCarolina and Robert Conrad of North Carolina.\n  My colleagues from those States are speaking in more detail on the \nfloor today, but I want to highlight that these fine nominees have the \nstrong support of their home-State Senators.\n  Lack of such support can be a reason why a nominee does not get a \nhearing.\n  I know, because that is the reason I could not give a hearing to some \nClinton judicial nominees when I chaired the Judiciary Committee.\n  But that is not the case with these nominees.\n  And in Judge Conrad's case, this body confirmed him just a few years \nago to the U.S. District Court without even a rollcall vote.\n  I hope that this pledge by the majority to make some much-needed \nconfirmation progress is not just a temporary flash in the pan.\n  The majority leader last night suggested that there is some kind of \nrule that the Senate does not confirm judicial nominees after June.\n  He actually referred to this as the Thurmond doctrine.\n  I want to say to my colleagues that there is no such thing as a \nThurmond doctrine, a Thurmond rule, or even a Thurmond guideline for \njudicial confirmations in a Presidential election year.\n  In 2000, the current Judiciary Committee chairman said that while \nthings might, he said might, slow down ``within a couple months of a \npresidential election,'' that the best judicial confirmation standard \nwas set in 1992.\n  Like today, his party was in the majority.\n  Like today, a President Bush was in the White House.\n  Senator Thurmond himself was ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  In that Presidential election year, the Judiciary Committee held \nhearings on appeals court nominees until September 24 and the Senate \nconfirmed appeals court nominees until October 8.\n  The Senate confirmed 66 judges, including 11 appeals court judges, in \n1992.\n  So I want to dispel this judicial confirmation myth that there is any \nkind of rule, let alone a doctrine, that justifies shutting down the \nconfirmation activity which I hope and trust is finally about to begin.\n  There is no doubt that we are way behind where we should be in the \njudicial confirmation process.\n  But it does not have to stay that way, not if we are serious about \ndoing our duty.\n  As the Washington Post editorial said, the Senate ``should at least \ngive every current nominee an up-or-down vote and expeditiously process \nthe nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.''\n  That would be a great place to start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3046-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4146.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of March 7, 2008, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know my colleague Senator DeMint is here \nto offer what will be the first amendment to this bill. I thank him, \nbecause I know he initially had several amendments. It looks as though \nhe has boiled it down to one amendment. I know Senator Inhofe and I are \nglad about that. I thanked him previously for calling me and saying \nthat he was pleased with the way we treated the transparency of this \nbill.\n  I have been given a copy of the amendment by the Senator from South \nCarolina. I will listen carefully to his presentation, and I will have \nremarks afterward. Senator Inhofe may also have some remarks prior to \nSenator DeMint being recognized.\n  Senator Inhofe and I are hopeful we can get this completed. This is a \nbill that overall creates not one more penny of new spending. It will \nunleash into our economy, however, a billion dollars already budgeted \nfor. That is why so many people are supporting this in real life: \nConstruction companies, workers, transit operators. All of them have \nwritten to us. I will put those names in the Record. We are hopeful, if \neverybody cooperates today, we can get this finished. This bill isn't \nrocket science. It is very simply making technical corrections to \nSAFETEA-LU and in places where some projects simply couldn't go \nforward, replacing those projects without adding a penny of new \nspending. There is full transparency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I agree with the comments made by the \nchairman. It is my understanding we are down to maybe three amendments. \nI have talked to Senator Coburn, who has an amendment, as well as \nSenator Bond. It is my hope that Senator DeMint will be able to present \nhis amendment. Then it is my understanding we will hold votes until \nearly this afternoon and maybe try to get some of the others out of the \nway. Being a conservative, I want to make sure everybody understands: A \ntechnical corrections bill is always necessary when we have a major \nreauthorization of transportation. There are some things in here that \nare borderline. One case, in my State of Oklahoma, in Durant, I \nmistakenly said 200 yesterday, but it is $300,000 on a road program \nthat the Department of Transportation came back and said: We thought we \nwere ready for this, but we\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\nare not. But we are, on down the road in Idabel.\n  It is common sense that that is where it should be done. It is the \nsame amount of money. I agree with the principle behind the amendment \nof the Senator from South Carolina, but in this case we have to have \nthe technical corrections bill in order to go forward with a lot of the \nprojects that have been authorized since 2005. I am hopeful we will be \nable to proceed along those lines.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to recommit H.R. 1195 to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works of the Senate with instructions \n     to report the bill back to the Senate with an amendment \n     striking all new earmarks and spending increases for existing \n     earmarks.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the chairwoman and ranking member \nfor setting an example for this body in how a bill should be presented \nto the Senate--with full disclosure, all documentation. It allows us to \nhave an open and honest debate about any differences. There is no \nquestion about what is contained therein and what is not. In this case, \nwe disagree on parts of this, but I don't want to begin without first \nsaying I believe the chairwoman and ranking member have set an example \nfor the rest of the committees.\n  My motion to recommit simply addresses what I believe are serious \nproblems in developing a technical corrections bill that actually \nchanges the legislation from one earmark to another or pluses up \nearmarks, takes money from an earmark that might be not needed anymore, \nthe project is not wanted, that money is moved somewhere else. While it \ncertainly is correct that the total cost of the bill is about the same, \nwe do need to remember that by next year, we are projecting over a $3 \nbillion shortfall in the trust fund. So instead of adding to earmarks \nand creating new ones, it makes sense to try to save some of that money \nso we can fund important infrastructure projects around the country.\n  The motion to recommit sends this bill back to committee with an \namendment that says it should be presented back to the Senate where all \nof the new earmarks are excluded and any additions to funding for \nexisting earmarks is returned to the current level. What that leaves us \nwith is a technical corrections bill, which is what this bill should \nbe.\n  The administration has noted with strong concerns that the majority \nof the technical corrections bill is devoted to earmarks. It modifies \nhundreds of earmarks from the legislation that passed in 2005. It \neffectively creates new earmarks, including a stand-alone section that \nwould provide mandatory funding for a magnetically levitating rail \nsystem. The presence of excessive earmarks in the 2005 bill created \nsignificant inefficiency in the allocation of resources to fund \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  I have heard regularly from the Department of Transportation of the \ndifficulty in implementing a national transportation system with \nthousands and thousands of earmarks for special projects that don't \nnecessarily match State priorities.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a look at the motion to recommit. \nIt does not kill the bill. It simply refocuses on a technical \ncorrection perspective rather than adding to earmarks or creating new \nones.\n  I thank the chairwoman for the opportunity to offer this and thank \nboth her and the ranking member for setting an example of how a bill \nshould be brought to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator for his kind \ncomments about the way we have handled this legislation.\n  This amendment is, first, wrong on its face and, second, it is going \nto kill the bill. Of all times to try and kill what I consider a mini-\neconomic stimulus plan, this is not one of them. We have a lot of \npeople out of work. Many people have called Senator Inhofe and myself, \nand others, saying this is an important piece of legislation.\n  I will read the names of those people, because I believe it is \nimportant that we show the breadth of support. It is a very simple \npiece of legislation, but it will correct some errors. It will say, as \nan example, in Oklahoma--and we have them in California--and for all \nthese 500 projects, one leg of a project might not have been ready. \nLet's put the funds where they can be used now, where they are ready to \ngo. Unleashing up to a billion dollars of funds right now means tens of \nthousands of jobs, and we have to rebuild our infrastructure. We are \ndoing it within the confines of the moneys that were already \nauthorized.\n  Again I have said this so many times, I am sure it is boring people, \nbut I think it is important to note who has written to Senator Inhofe \nand myself to move this bill: the American Association of State Highway \nand Transportation Officials, whose members include the Departments of \nTransportation for all 50 States; the American Highway Users Alliance, \nwhose members represent millions of highway users; the American Public \nTransit Association; the American Road and Transportation Builders \nAssociation; the Associated General Contractors; the Council of \nUniversity Transportation Centers; the National Stone, Sand and Gravel \nAssociation; the National Asphalt and Pavement Association.\n  This is not one of these bills that is a matter of some intellectual \ndebate. This means real jobs for real people and real infrastructure \nimprovements for all the people of this Nation who count on us to keep \ntheir highway and transit systems moving.\n  What does Senator DeMint do? He would send this bill back to the \ncommittee, in essence killing the bill. We passed this bill out of \ncommittee on a bipartisan voice vote on June of 2007. Here we are, \nmoving toward June of 2008. Why on Earth would we want to stop the \nforward progress of this legislation? We can't afford further delay.\n  I am sorry my colleague has left the Chamber, but Senator DeMint had \nseveral projects that he asked for in SAFETEA-LU. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print a list of those projects in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    DeMint SAFETEA Project Requests\n\n       Senator DeMint requested 13 different earmarks in SAFETEA, \n     totaling $110 million dollars.\n       1. 1-73, Construction of 1-73 from Myrtle Beach, SC to 1-\n     95, ending at the North Carolina state line: $40,000,000.\n       2. Construction of I-73 from Myrtle Beach, SC to I-95, \n     ending at the NC state line: $10,000,000.\n       3. Widening of US 278 to six lanes in Beaufort County, SC \n     between Hilton Head Island and SC 170: $15,000,000.\n       4. Engineering, design and construction of a Port Access \n     Road connecting to I-26 in North Charleston, SC: $10,000,000.\n       5. Improvements to US 17 in Beaufort and Colleton Counties \n     to improve safety between US 21 and SC 64: $10,000,000.\n       6. Widening of SC 9 in Spartanburg County from SC 292 to \n     Rainbow Lake Road: $5,000,000.\n       7. Complete Construction of Palmetto Parkway Extension (I-\n     520) Phase II to I-20: $3,000,000.\n       8. Complete a multi-lane widening project on SC Hwy 5 \n     Bypass in York County, SC between I-77 and I-85: $4,000,000.\n       9. Re-construction of an existing interchange at I-385 and \n     SC 14, in Laurens County, SC: $2,000,000.\n       10. Construction of the Lexington Connector in Lexington \n     County, SC to alleviate traffic congestion: $2,000,000.\n       11. Widening of 4.4 miles of West Georgia Road in \n     Greenville County, SC: $2,000,000.\n       12. Extension of Wells Highway in Oconee County, SC: \n     $2,000,000.\n       13. Demolition of the old Cooper River Bridges in \n     Charleston, SC: $5,000,000.\n       Total: $110,000,000.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. All of these will bring jobs and improve transportation \nin the State of South Carolina. That is why I supported it, as did \nSenator Inhofe. That is why we all supported it. There is a number of \nprojects contained here, 13 projects, $110 million, Senator DeMint has \nin SAFETEA-LU. Fortunately for Senator DeMint, none of his projects \nrequired any technical corrections.\n  Let's take one: Construction of I-73 from Myrtle Beach, SC to I-95, \nending\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\nat the North Carolina State line. Suppose something had turned up in \nthe engineering and they had to stop it further toward Myrtle Beach, \nbut they couldn't go ahead with the project until they made that \ntechnical change. Then Senator DeMint would find that the project was \nstymied. He is fortunate. He didn't have this problem. But a lot of us \nweren't so fortunate. We did have issues in our States where we had to \nmake changes.\n  This legislation fixes nearly 500 descriptions for highway and \ntransit projects. Without the changes included in the legislation, many \nof these projects will continue to be stuck at red lights. This isn't \nthe time to slow down job creation. This is the time to unleash job \ncreation. This technical corrections bill provides a green light that \ncould unleash up to $1 billion in transportation projects. The funding \nhas been approved before, so we are not increasing spending. Given the \ncurrent slowdown in our economy, we simply cannot afford to allow these \nfunds to remain unused.\n  At the appropriate time, I am going to move to table the DeMint \nmotion. I think we are working on an agreement to have a vote on that \nmotion at around 2 o'clock.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will just be a moment. I see the Senator \nfrom Florida wants the floor. But let me, first of all, say that this \nis right. In my State of Oklahoma, we had some things for which it took \n7 years for this bill to come into reality. The reauthorization is \nsomething we should do every other year, but we did not do it.\n  When you pass a bill of this magnitude--and, look, I have to say \nthere is no one person in this body of 100 Senators who is more \nconservative than I am. That is what all the ratings say. ACLU has me \nas No. 1. So it is not a matter of conservative versus liberal. This is \na matter of doing what we are supposed to do. We are supposed to defend \nAmerica. We are supposed to work on the infrastructure. We have been \ndoing it since the National Highway System came into effect back in the \nEisenhower administration.\n  But I had two changes that were in my bill. I had a light \nsignalization that was meant to take place in Tulsa, OK. This is a \nmodernization, using new technology. However, in the original bill, it \nsaid ``Oklahoma.'' It did not say ``Tulsa, OK,'' when clearly that was \nour intent. So the Department of Transportation of Oklahoma said: Put \nin ``Tulsa'' so we know where that belongs.\n  The other one, which I have already mentioned, was the $300,000 for a \nproject. Actually, it was a feasibility study in Durant, OK, in \nsouthern Oklahoma. Then they found out later that you are better off \ndoing it down the road from there in Idabel. Consequently, if we are \nforced not to be able to make that technical correction, we would be \nforced to spend $300,000 on something we are not ready to do.\n  So the important thing to get across to people is that this technical \ncorrections bill does not increase the total amount of authorizations \nthat are taking place right now from the 2005 bill. It is the same \namount. I do not want people to think it is not, because it is, and \nthat is an irrefutable fact.\n  I kind of agree with the chairman of the committee when she talks \nabout that this will kill the bill. It would if it went back and they \ncould not move it, the House would not accept this. This is one of the \nmost difficult things to deal with when we are doing the authorization \nbill because every time we finally get an agreement here, we have to go \nover there and get the same thing--Democrats and Republicans here and \nDemocrats and Republicans there. I just don't want to put ourselves in \na position where we send anything over there that could kill this bill \nbecause this is necessary to finally finish the implementation of the \n2005 Transportation authorization bill.\n  So with that, I will yield the floor, and I will have more to say \nlater.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \ntechnical corrections bill. In large part, we have a technical \ncorrection in the bill affecting a major interstate project in Florida \nthat needs to be passed.\n  Now, the story I am about to tell you is going to amaze some people \nof what happened.\n  A few years back, when we passed the highway bill, they passed the \nversion in the House, and we passed the version in the Senate, and they \ngot merged so they were identical. The bill was getting ready then--the \nsame bill that had passed both Houses--to go to the President for \nsignature. But a strange thing happened on the way to the White House \nbecause someone--identity yet unknown--went in and changed the \nlanguage, which was, ``Widening and Improvements for I-75 in Collier \nand Lee County''--a matter of $10 million in the highway bill--and \nchanged that to be, instead, $10 million for a study for an interchange \non Interstate 75 at Coconut Road.\n  Now, the long and short of it is, you simply cannot do that once it \npasses the House and passes the Senate in identical form and then goes \nto the President in that identical form for signature. Somewhere in the \nprocess of enrolling the bill to send it down to the White House, \nsomeone is not permitted to go in and change the meaning of the \nappropriation--in this case, $10 million for widening Interstate 75, \nwhich has become a parking lot at 7 o'clock in the morning and 5 \no'clock in the afternoon because of all the traffic. That is why we \nwant to widen Interstate 75 in southwest Florida to six lanes instead \nof the existing four lanes.\n  Someone went in and changed the intent and wording of the bill. So \nwhat we have in the technical corrections bill is a technical \ncorrection to have the law read, in fact, what it was intended to read, \nand what it, in fact, did read until somebody went in and tampered with \nit.\n  Now, in the meantime, we have had correspondence from the chairman of \nthe Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the House of \nRepresentatives to the local metropolitan planning organization, which \nhas, under State law, the authority for setting up the priorities for \nroad projects, saying to them that you need to follow the law--the law \nas it went to the President for signature. We have correspondence back \nfrom the metropolitan planning organization--in this case, many \nletters, but in the one I have in my hand to me--stating there was an \nerror in the enrollment of the bill and the metropolitan planning \norganization wants the original intent of the legislation to be what \ngoverns, which is the widening of Interstate 75, and the $10 million \nused for that.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord both of these pieces of correspondence.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and \n           Infrastructure,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 23, 2006.\n     Mr. John Albion,\n     Chairman, Lee County Metropolitan Planning Organization \n         (MPO), Fort Myers, FL.\n       Dear Chairman Albion: Thank you for your letter of December \n     21, 2005 updating the Committee Transportation and \n     Infrastructure on the Lee County MPO's Long Range \n     Transportation Plan and their decision to exclude the Coconut \n     Road Interchange from its financially feasible plan. The \n     letter further requests a ``re-programming'' to occur for \n     these funds.\n       Section 1701 of Subtitle G, Title I of SAFETEA-LU (Public \n     Law 109-59) contained amendments to the law located in \n     Section 117 U.S.C. Title 23, titled High Priority Projects. \n     The authority provided in Sec. 117 with regard to projects \n     authorized in Sec. 1702 on SAFETEA-LU is quite clear and \n     unambiguous. Projects for which funds are designated are \n     available only for that project. The state in which the \n     designated project resides is free under the terms of the law \n     to build, or not build the project. However, the law does not \n     provide authority for a state to use funds designated for an \n     authorized project on some other project.\n       In this important sense then, the funds made available to \n     these authorized projects are not subject to the same legal \n     terns and conditions as formula funds.\n       As the second session of the 109th Congress proceeds, the \n     Committee will, as the Committee has historically done on \n     previous reauthorizations, work to pass into law a bill to \n     amend SAFETEA-LU. This bill, which in previous Congresses has \n     been titled a corrections bill, will seek to make \n     improvements, rectify errors and modify aspects of SAFETEA-\n     LU. With regard to Sec. 1702, my past experience on this \n     committee suggests that where a state elects to not utilize \n     funds designated for an authorized project, the committee \n     will incorporate the effect of that\n\n[[Page S3049]]\n\n     decision as appropriate when developing the bill. In an era \n     of funding shortfalls, it is an important responsibility of \n     the committee to see that all funds provided in SAFETEA-LU \n     are in fact used for their intended benefit on the \n     transportation system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Don Young,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Lee County Metropolitan\n\n\n                                        Planning Organization,\n\n                                  Fort Myers, FL, August 20, 2007.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson, I write as Chair of the Lee County MPO \n     requesting that the language for the $10 million ``Coconut \n     Road Earmark'' be restored to the language that both the \n     House and Senate approved when they voted final passage of \n     SAFETEA-LU on 7/28/05--``Widening and improvements for I-\n     75.''\n       This correction to the legislation corrects an error in the \n     enrollment of the bill. The language in the Public Law is not \n     the same as that passed by the House and Senate. During the \n     enrollment process, managed by Congressman Don Young (AK), \n     someone tampered with the bill. Funds for I-75 improvement \n     were changed to funds for a totally new Coconut Rd. \n     interchange--a project not on the MPO priority list.\n       The specific requested change is as follows: Technical \n     Amendment to SAFETEA-LU (119 Stat. 1509) [PL. 109-59, Section \n     1934]: The table contained in Section 1934 of the Safe, \n     Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A \n     Legacy for Users (119 Stat. 1509) is amended in item number \n     462 by striking `Coconut Rd. interchange I-75/Lee County' and \n     inserting ``I-75 widening and improvements in Collier and Lee \n     County, FL.''\n       The MPO has been discussing this topic for two years, \n     attempting to understand how we received money for a project \n     that was not anywhere on our priority list. We were told that \n     we had no choice other than to accept it or return it. Having \n     learned that our entire delegation and the full Congress \n     actually voted for an MPO priority project and that it is \n     possible to have an enrollment error corrected, on Friday \n     August 17, 2007, the MPO voted (10 in favor, 3 opposed, 2 \n     absent) to request this technical amendment.\n       On behalf of the MPO, I thank you for your assistance in \n     this matter. If you wish to contact me, please contact me \n     directly. I look forward to your reply to our request.\n           Cordially,\n                                            Carla Brooks Johnston,\n                                                        MPO Chair.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. So we come to this point. It is absolutely \ncritical that we pass a technical correction so that the law, as it was \nintended by the passage in the House and the Senate, be honored. The \nquestion is, What about the tampering? Well, we need to find out.\n  Mr. Coburn, the Senator from Oklahoma, has taken great umbrage at \nthis tampering. I can tell you, as the senior Senator from Florida, I \nam very grateful to him for him being upset and wanting to do something \nabout this. This Senator and my colleague from Florida have signed on \nto an amendment by Senator Coburn trying to get to the bottom of who \ndid the tampering and how did it occur so this kind of stuff will never \nhappen again.\n  There is some question about the way Senator Coburn's amendment is \ndrafted, that it would be a direction to the House of Representatives \nwhich might meet some constitutional problem, in which case what we are \ntrying to work out is that there would be a future amendment where \nthere would be an investigation by the General Accounting Office and \nmaybe some resolution with regard to the Justice Department saying that \nthis matter ought to be investigated as to a violation of the laws of \nthis country in that you cannot tamper with legislation like this.\n  Whatever we resolve, I hope we will get it in because we have that \nseparate issue of the tampering that needs to be dealt with, and it \nneeds to be exposed to the light of day so people will understand you \njust do not take a bill that is duly passed by the Congress of the \nUnited States and, while it is en route from Capitol Hill to 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue, change the meaning of the bill.\n  It is my hope that as we get into all these other issues that seem to \nhave cropped up that have nothing to do with Interstate 75, we can get \nthese other issues resolved so the technical correction can proceed and \nthat we can get this particular technical correction adopted into law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 p.m. \ntoday the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the DeMint motion to \nrecommit the bill, and that no further amendments be in order to the \nmotion prior to the vote; that following the conclusion of the debate \nthis morning with respect to the motion, it be set aside to recur at 2 \np.m., with the time until 2:15 p.m. equally divided and controlled \nbetween Senators Boxer and DeMint or their designees; and that at 2:15, \nwithout further intervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to \nvote in relation to the DeMint motion to recommit the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, since we have a lull in the conversation \nabout the technical corrections bill--and the reason for that is, \nfrankly, it is a very straightforward bill. We know of two other \namendments. We are working with Senator Coburn on his amendment dealing \nwith an investigation into what occurred in the Coconut Road project in \nFlorida. We know Senator Bond has an amendment which is really not a \ntechnical correction. It goes to overturning a law that was passed \nwhich protects consumers when they are defrauded by furniture moving \ncompanies. That is his amendment. We hope he can come down here so we \ncan get going; we can start to debate that.\n\n  But in the meantime, I have asked Senator Inhofe if he had any \nobjection if I rose to pay tribute to 19 young Americans who were \nkilled in Iraq who were either from California or based in California, \nand he had no objection to that. I don't know if I need to ask to speak \nas in morning business. If that is the appropriate thing, I ask \nunanimous consent to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Boxer are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Halting the Growth of Greenhouse Gases\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, later today, President Bush will propose \nhalting growth in U.S. greenhouse gases by the year 2025. In his speech \nat the White House, the President is expected to place significant \nemphasis on new technology.\n  I recently introduced legislation to address the challenge of how to \ndeal with greenhouse gases. The bill is called the Greenhouse Gas \nEmissions Atmospheric Removal Act, or the GEAR Act.\n  Members of this body have discussed various proposals to regulate the \noutput of greenhouse gases. Some advocate doing it through a cap-and-\ntrade approach. Others have advocated a carbon tax. Such proposals are \naimed at limiting future carbon output into the atmosphere. Many \nproposals have been introduced and debated using this approach of \ndealing with carbon output.\n  Overlooked in the debate are the greenhouse gases that are already in \nthe atmosphere. The best science tells us that the greenhouse gases \nalready in the atmosphere are the gases that are causing the warming of \nour planet. To what extent, we are not certain.\n  So let's resolve to find a way to remove the excess greenhouse gases \nthat are already in the atmosphere--remove them and then permanently \nsequester them.\n  To accomplish this goal, we are, as a nation, going to need to make a \nsignificant investment to develop new technology.\n  The approach my legislation takes to address this is through a series \nof financial prizes--prizes where we set the technological goals and \nalso define the outcomes we demand.\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\n  The first researchers who meet each criteria will receive not only a \nfinancial prize but also international acclaim.\n  The prizes would be determined by a Federal commission under the \nDepartment of Energy. The commission would be composed of climate \nscientists, physicists, chemists, engineers, business managers, and \neconomists.\n  The commission would be appointed by the President with the advice \nand consent of the Senate. The awards would go to those, both public \nand private, who would achieve milestones in developing and applying \ntechnology--technology that could significantly help to slow and even \nreverse the accumulation of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.\n  The greenhouse gases would have to be permanently sequestered, and \nsequestered in a manner that would be without significant harmful \neffects.\n  This is how it would work. There would be four different levels of \nprizes.\n  The first level would go to either the private or public entity that \ncould first demonstrate a design for successful technology that could \nremove and permanently sequester the greenhouse gases.\n  Second, there would be a prize for a lab scale demonstration project \nof the technology that accomplishes the same thing.\n  Third, there would be an award for demonstrating the technology to \nremove and permanently sequester greenhouse gases that is operational \nat a larger working model scale.\n  Finally, there would be an award for whoever can demonstrate the \ntechnology to remove and permanently sequester greenhouse gases on a \ncommercially viable scale.\n  There you have it--four different levels of development: First, to \ndesign the technology; second, a lab scale demonstration of the \ntechnology; then for a larger working model; and then, finally, the \nproven use of the technology on a commercially viable scale.\n  Well, once the technology is developed, the United States would share \nintellectual property rights to that technology with whomever invented \nit.\n  This bill, as drafted, does not include a specific dollar amount for \neach prize. Instead, it authorizes such sums as may be necessary.\n  The commission will be directed to report to Congress 1 year after \nenactment into law. The commission will recommend the levels of funding \nthat would be necessary to achieve the goals of this act.\n  I believe prizes can be a unique tool in creating the technological \ndevelopment we need. It only seems natural that if we get all the best \nscientific minds thinking about the same problem, and working on it, we \nsignificantly enhance our chances of solving it.\n  Historically, prizes have been used to spur all types of \ntechnological development to solve big problems.\n  In 1714, the British Government offered the first prize of this type, \nand they did it for a device capable of accurately measuring longitude. \nJohn Harrison, a clock maker, was awarded 20,000 pounds for designing \nan accurate and durable chronometer 59 years later. This transformed \nour ability to sail the seas.\n  In 1810, the first vacuum-sealed food was produced after 15 years of \nexperimentation. It was driven, again, by a prize offered, this time, \nby Napoleon. Today, vacuum sealing is still used throughout the world.\n  In 1909, the first flight across the English Channel was spurred by a \nprize offered by a newspaper.\n  Charles Lindbergh was competing for a prize offered by a wealthy \nhotel owner when he flew the Spirit of St. Louis nonstop from New York \nto Paris in 1927. Well, that achievement spawned what is a $300 billion \naviation industry today.\n  It is my hope and my goal that this legislation will foster the kind \nof solutions that we need to address the concerns about climate change.\n  What I am proposing is that we take a brand new look at climate \nchange. With that new look, our solution will be based on removing \nexcess greenhouse gases that are already in the atmosphere. We must \nthink anew and we must act anew.\n  That line--``we must think anew and we must act anew''--is engraved \non a scenic overlook along Interstate 80 between Cheyenne and Laramie, \nWY. It is engraved on the pedestal that holds a large-size bust of \nAbraham Lincoln. Lincoln was the one to have the vision for the \nTranscontinental Railroad.\n  It is now time for us as Americans to think anew and act anew about \nthe issue of climate change and controlling greenhouse gases. Americans \nhave always looked within ourselves for solutions. We have always had \nconfidence in American ingenuity and American creativity to deal with \nthe challenges of the future.\n  Yes, we want to protect our environment and, yes, we want a strong \neconomy. The way to have both is by thinking anew and acting anew. It \nis time to use our untapped human potential and the American spirit to \ndevelop the technologies we need.\n  It is now time for the Senate and for Congress to find a solution to \nglobal climate change, not through limits but through imagination, \ninnovation, and invention. I look forward to working with each and \nevery Member of the Senate in achieving this goal.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Iowa if he wants to \nspeak in morning business.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, for 6 or 7 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, Senator Grassley be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, first of all, I make a plea to my friends \non the other side of the aisle. There are a couple of amendments out \nthere. Senator Inhofe and I are anxious to get done with the bill. The \nbill is a mini-economic stimulus. It would release a billion dollars \nworth of projects for important highway and transit programs. It is a \ntechnical corrections bill that stays within the limits we set in terms \nof spending. When Senator Inhofe and I agree on something, it usually \ncovers the spectrum. So we hope we will have a good vote.\n  I wanted to say something before Senator Barrasso leaves because he \nmentioned the President's goals. The President says we should halt the \ngrowth of greenhouse gases by 2025--``halt the growth,'' which means 18 \nyears of nothing. What a pathetic response to a crisis that has united \nevangelical groups, scientists, businesses, and much of the world.\n  So I am just here to say--I am not going to have a debate with my \ngood friend, whom I really enjoy as a member of our Committee, but I \nwant to say this gives new meaning to doing nothing. When we have a \ncrisis such as we have now and we have a small window to act and we \nwait 18 years, this is not talking about leaving the problems to the \nnew President, like he is doing in Iraq. It means we are following a \nrecipe for gloom and doom instead of looking at this problem and seeing \nit for what it is--an amazing opportunity.\n  It is interesting that my friend, Senator Grassley, is here, who is \nso strong on ethanol. Well, this is the kind of thing we are going to \ndo so we can get off of fossil fuel. We have other opportunities, such \nas cellulosic. We have new ways of making cars.\n  I happen to drive a hybrid. It is amazing. I get over 50 miles per \ngallon. I sort of wave at the gas stations because I don't have to go \nthere that often. These cars are getting better and better.\n  We have so many ways, but it is not going to happen if we simply say, \nby 2025 we will halt the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. We have to \nhalt the growth very soon. I view it as a great opportunity for an \neconomic renaissance in this country. If you look at Great Britain, \nthey have cut their carbon emissions by 15 percent over the last 10 \nyears or so. Their GDP has grown by 45 percent, and they have added \n500,000 new green jobs.\n  I think rather than being so frightened and meek as the President is \nabout this, we should be leading the world to this new great economic \nrenaissance. America should be in the front, inventing these products. \nI know the President says he wants to invest in new technology. Unless \nyou have a cap on greenhouse gas emissions, unless your proposal \ninvolves a cap so we get down to what is necessary to prevent \ncatastrophe, then you are part of\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\nthe problem. You are not part of the solution. You are just making \nbelieve you are part of the solution.\n  I don't want to do any more than is necessary. I want to do what is \nnecessary to reverse a real, serious, horrific problem for the world. \nAs our intelligence community tells us, as our Pentagon tells us, if we \ndo nothing, the ravages of global warming will be the cause of wars, \nwill be the cause of droughts, will be the cause of famine, will be the \ncause of unrest, and will be the cause of refugees wandering around \nstarving to death.\n  That is why so many churches have joined us, many of the great \nreligions have joined us in this effort. We have a great group working \nhere. I was a little bit surprised when the President sort of took on \nthe Lieberman-Warner bill in his way. He didn't mention it by name, but \nhe basically referred to efforts in the Senate and the dangers. Mr. \nPresident, I have been trying to get to see you on this issue. I have \nwanted to talk to you on this issue. I know the former Prime Minister \nof England, Tony Blair, spoke to you about this issue. He is coming to \nspeak to me again. We need to work together. This should not be \npartisan.\n  Unfortunately, it is. When I and my staff were in Great Britain, we \nwere meeting to understand what steps they have taken and how about a \ncap-and-trade system and the rest. What we found out was most \nremarkable. Each party, Labor and Conservative, was staking claim to \nthe issue of global warming and saying to the other party: You are not \ndoing enough. I turned to my staff and said: Oh, if I have one prayer, \nit is that we have a situation where that happens at home instead of \nthis horrible fight. And if I have another prayer, it is that the \nPresidential candidates, Republican and Democratic, will argue over who \nhas the best plan. That may happen, and that would be exciting. But I \ndo not want to wait until then. I do not want to do nothing. I do not \nwant to be part of the problem. I do not want my grandkids to say: \nWhere was my grandma? At the moment they had a window to do something, \nthey slammed it shut.\n  I am glad my friend came to speak about global warming. I hope we can \ncontinue to work together to get him on board in a more aggressive way \nto do more, to do our job, to fulfill our responsibility. We would \nnever take our grandchild, put him or her in an infant seat in the car, \ngo to a parking lot at the supermarket and leave him or her inside with \nthe windows closed and the Sun beating down. We would not do that \nbecause we adore our children and our grandchildren, and we want the \nworld to be better. At least we want it to be as good as it was for us.\n  We are so lucky. We have lived through such golden years for \nourselves and our families. We have the American dream. We saw Richard \nNixon step to the plate and create the Environmental Protection Agency, \nand Presidents, Republican and Democratic, who have come after stand \nup--until now.\n  I say to my colleagues, we are going to have a moment come June. It \nis going to be a little bit different than today. Today Senator Inhofe \nand I are joined at the hip on this technical corrections highway bill. \nWe are not going to be that way on global warming, but I hope we can \nhave some bipartisanship, and John Warner has been leading the way. We \nneed to do more instead of wait until 2025 to halt the growth of \ngreenhouse emissions. That is too late. That is dangerously late. That \nis the equivalent of doing nothing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                          Medicaid Moratoriums\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee is taking up--or maybe has already taken up--consideration of \na bill, H.R. 5613. This bill seeks to place a moratorium on seven \nMedicaid regulations until the next administration.\n  I know some people have concerns, because I have discussed those \nconcerns, with these CMS Medicaid regulations. So let me be very clear \nthat I am not unsympathetic with those concerns. I am not here to argue \nthe regulations put forth by the administration are perfect. I have \nissues with some of them that I wish to see addressed.\n  However, the regulations do address areas where there are real \nproblems with Medicaid. CMS is taking care of those problems, and we \nought to let them move forward instead of delaying all of these \nMedicaid regulations at once.\n  As everyone knows, Medicaid is a Federal-State partnership that \nprovides a crucial health care safety net for some very vulnerable \npopulations, people whom we all agree we have a social responsibility \nto look out for--low-income seniors, the disabled, pregnant women, and \nchildren. These classes of people depend on Medicaid, and it does \ngenerally serve them well.\n  Medicaid is also a program with a checkered history of financial \nchallenges that we, as fiscal conservatives--and we all brag about \nfiscal conservatism--ought to be concerned about, these financial \nchallenges coming from Medicaid, sometimes not being administered the \nway it should be.\n\n  Quite frankly, using the term ``fiscal challenges'' is a gentle way \nof putting it sometimes. A more severe way of putting it would be that \nMedicaid has a history in our respective States--not every State but a \nlot of States--of abusively pushing the limits of what should be \nallowed to maximize Federal dollars that we send to them under various \nformulas.\n  I am not going to devote time in my remarks today to issues of fraud \nand abuse in Medicaid, but that is legitimate to talk about. I will be \nback with that at another time. Instead, I want to focus on a very \nsimple concept, and that simple concept is that Medicaid program \nintegrity depends upon the setter for Medicaid services and the States \nand providers and ultimately beneficiaries having a clear understanding \nof the rules of the road. That is what we ought to expect out of any \ngovernment program, that everybody knows how that program operates.\n  In this instance, States have not had clear guidance. In that case, \nthey could be inappropriately spending taxpayers' dollars. Improper \npayments, wasteful spending--what does it do? It only increases the \nfinancial pressure on a very worthwhile safety net.\n  The Medicaid regulations that H.R. 5613 attempts to halt would halt \nall efforts by CMS to provide clear rules, rules of the road in very \ncritical areas where there have been well-documented problems and most \nof those problems costing the taxpayers more money.\n  During the recent debate on the budget resolution, I entered into the \nRecord a Congressional Research Service memo that showed some of the \nissues that exist under current law. I am not going to go into all of \nthose issues today in detail because they are in the Record, but when \nCMS does not know how a State is billing for a service and States do \nnot have clear guidance for how they should bill, neither Medicaid \nbeneficiaries nor the taxpayers at the Federal or State levels are well \nserved.\n  We should be, in fact, talking about fixing the regulations so that \nthey better address real problems in Medicaid. But instead, the House \nof Representatives is trying to kick this can down the road to next \nyear.\n  What does that mean for the taxpayers? H.R. 5613 spends $1.7 billion \nto place a short moratorium on these regulations. This is only to delay \nthe regulations until March of next year--$1.7 billion to delay the \nregulations for 1 year.\n  I know supporters hope the next administration, whichever party that \nmight be, whichever of the three candidates still in the race might be, \nwill completely cancel the regulations. If these regulations were \ncanceled, what would it cost if we tried to completely prevent these \nregulations from ever taking effect? It would not cost just this $1.7 \nbillion that is going to be spent between now and next March. It would \nactually cost the taxpayers almost $20 billion over the next 5 years \nand almost $50 billion over the next 10 years.\n  It is absolutely a farce for anyone to argue that all of those \ndollars are being appropriately spent and that Congress ought to walk \naway from these issues. But that is what this bill, H.R. 5613, does; it \nwalks away. Let's say it another way. It kicks the can down the road \nhoping the next President might walk away.\n  I know supporters of that bill will say they need more time. They say\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\nthey have not had enough time to study the regulations and to respond. \nThat argument is starting to strain credibility. The public provider \nrule was proposed well over a year ago to study and react. The \nrehabilitation services rule was proposed 9 months ago for people in \nthe House of Representatives to respond to and react.\n  Supporters of that bill have had plenty of time; that is, plenty of \ntime if they wanted to make new policy. But it is obvious by these \nactions that their only real interest is in making these regulations go \naway.\n  This is very unfortunate because finding solutions is what we should \nbe doing instead of kicking the can down the road. When we start \ntalking about the integrity of the Medicaid Program, it is clarity of \nthe rules that is most needed between the Center for Medicaid Services \nand our 50 States. So if you do not like the rules, that is fine, but \nthere are tens of billions of dollars involved in this delay.\n  I say to my colleagues: Roll up your sleeves, or maybe I should say \nroll up our sleeves and let us all get to work to solve a problem that \nthe regulations try to solve instead of kicking the can down the road. \nThat is what we should be doing for the taxpayers. That is what we \nshould be doing for the credibility of the Medicaid Program, a Medicaid \nProgram that is needed, a Medicaid Program, for the most part, that \nserves people well. Contrariwise, putting moratoriums on all the \nMedicaid regulations issued by the Center for Medicaid Services is not \nthe right answer.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion on the Boxer \nsubstitute amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Boxer \n     substitute amendment No. 4146 to H.R. 1195, an act to amend \n     the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation \n     Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, to make technical \n     corrections, and for other purposes.\n         Barbara Boxer, Harry Reid, Charles E.

Mr. President, I send a second cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 1195, an act \n     to amend the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient \n     Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, to make \n     technical corrections, and for other purposes.\n         Barbara Boxer, Harry Reid, Charles E.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum call required by those motions be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I have indicated to the Chairman, and, of \ncourse, I have not had the opportunity to speak to the ranking member, \nbut we have explained to the minority that I am filing these cloture \nmotions--I have done so with the hope and anticipation that we need not \nhave a cloture vote on this bill. We should finish this bill today. I \nhope we can do that. If not, of course, with these being filed, we will \nhave the cloture vote Friday morning. But I hope that is not necessary. \nThere is not a reason in the world we should not finish this bill today \nand go on to something else.\n\n\n                      Welcoming Pope Benedict XVI\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this morning I was honored to help welcome \nPope Benedict XVI to the United States for his first papal visit to \nAmerica.\n  In his brief remarks this morning on the south lawn of the White \nHouse, he spoke of his admiration and respect for America, our country.\n  His lifetime of righteousness in faith and deeds is an inspiration, \nnot just to the more than 1 billion Catholics worldwide but to those of \nevery faith.\n  As Pope Benedict XVI said shortly after his election 3 years ago:\n\n       I place my ministry in the service of reconciliation and \n     harmony between peoples.\n\n  During my entire life, I have known the Catholic Church to be a deep \nwell of comfort and aid to those in need and a pillar of strength in \ntimes of uncertainty.\n  I had a wonderful conversation this morning with Cardinal Mahony of \nLos Angeles. He indicated: Can we please do something on immigration? I \nsaid: We are trying. And he has been so helpful to us on this issue. I \nhope we can fulfill the wishes and prayers of Cardinal Mahony and do \nsomething about immigration. Certainly, it is something that needs to \nbe done. Comprehensive immigration reform is what we need, which he \nsupports.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I certainly wish to extend my welcome to the \nPope. We welcome him to America with open arms.\n\n\n             One Year Anniversary of Virginia Tech Shooting\n\n  Mr. REID. One year ago today, on a campus not far from here, \nsouthwest of where we stand, the Virginia Tech community suffered a \ntragedy that continues to defy our comprehension. This great \nuniversity, academically sound, athletically, in many instances \nsuperior, suffered a great loss. Thirty-two lives were taken by the \nhand of a young man with a deeply disturbed mind and some guns.\n  One year from that day, we pause to honor memory of these 32 young \nmen and women and to grieve for their friends, family, and loved ones. \nI would, in passing, indicate that there were others than just students \nkilled. Our thoughts go out to those unfortunate individuals whose \nlives were snuffed out for no reason.\n  I also grieve for our country, for these bright young men and women \ntaken from all of us before their limitless potential could be \nfulfilled. As we mark this sad anniversary, the terrible images of \nchaos, panic, and heartbreak remain woven in the fabric of that \ncommunity and our common memory.\n  But we remember also the amazing strength of Virginia Tech's \ncommunity in those days and weeks that followed, how they lifted \nthemselves from the deepest depths of despair to find a brotherhood and \nsisterhood of solace, peace, and even hope. President Steger and the \nentire Virginia Tech family demonstrated grace and steely resolve.\n  I want to take particular note at this time and extend my admiration \nand appreciation to Governor Kaine, who has led that State with such \nintegrity and political brilliance but with an example of all things \ngood during the time of this tragedy. To this day, he has done a \nwonderful job of reaching out to the community, everyone in the State \nof Virginia, meeting with people, and giving them confidence that the \nfuture will be better.\n  Now, as then, there is little we can offer but the broad shoulders of \nour Nation to lean upon and help carry the heavy burden of their pain.\n  Mr. President, I say for those of us who suffer this time of year \nwith allergies, being outside on the south lawn for an hour today, as \nindicated by my inability to stop coughing, makes me reflect on how \ngreat it is to live in the desert with no rose petals, flower petals, \nand pollen around. In the desert, we do not worry about that kind of \nstuff. But we also do not have much hay fever.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Fair Pay Restoration Act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this month, we honored the 40th \nanniversary of the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Each year on \nthis anniversary we get together and speak glowingly of Dr. King's life \nand work. These words are important; make no mistake. But even more \nimportant than honoring Dr. King with words is honoring Dr. King with \naction. Today, we have the opportunity to do that by passing the Fair \nPay Restoration Act.\n  The right to equal pay for equal work is a fundamental right. Indeed, \nDr. King was in Memphis on that fateful day in April 1968 to protest \npay discrimination against African-American Memphis sanitation workers. \nWe hope to have this legislation on the floor in the early part of next \nweek. It involves overturning the Ledbetter case, a Supreme Court \ndecision of recent times.\n  Forty years later, we are still fighting the same fight as Dr. King. \nWe are still trying to empower workers to assert their civil rights.\n  Over the years, I have been proud to stand with the majority of the \nCongress for justice and fairness by passing strong bipartisan laws \nagainst pay discrimination. In 1963, we passed the Equal Pay Act. We \nfollowed that in 1964 with the landmark Civil Rights Act. Then we \npassed the Age Discrimination Act, then the Americans With Disabilities \nAct. Most recently, we passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991. All these \nlaws protected workers from pay discrimination and have made our \ncountry a stronger, better, and fairer land.\n  These laws are just words on a page of a lawbook if workers can't get \ninto court when employers break the law. To bring these words to life, \nwe must today continue the work Dr. King started. This effort is \nnecessary because last May the Supreme Court undermined the fundamental \nprotections against pay discrimination. In the Ledbetter decision, the \nCourt imposed serious obstacles in the path of workers seeking to \nenforce their rights.\n  Ledbetter was a textbook case of pay discrimination. Lilly Ledbetter, \nwhom I have had the honor to meet, was one of a few women supervisors \nat a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant in Gadsen, AL. She worked \nat the plant for almost two decades, consistently demonstrating that a \nwoman can do a job traditionally done by men. She put up with teasing \nand taunting from her mail coworkers, but she persevered and \nconsistently gave the company a fair day's work for what she thought \nwas a fair day's pay. What she didn't know, however, was that Goodyear \nwasn't living up to its end of the bargain.\n  For almost two decades, the company used discriminatory evaluations \nto pay her less than her male colleagues who performed exactly the same \nwork. The jury saw the injustice in Goodyear's treatment of Ms. \nLedbetter and awarded her full damages. But five members of the Supreme \nCourt ignored that injustice and held that Ms. Ledbetter was entitled \nto nothing at all--nothing at all--saying she was too late in filing \nher claim.\n  Under the rule in the Ledbetter case, Ms. Ledbetter would have had to \nfile her claim within a few months of when Goodyear first started \ndiscriminating against her. Never mind that Ms. Ledbetter didn't know \nabout the discrimination when it first began. Never mind that she had \nno means to learn of the discrimination because Goodyear kept salary \ninformation confidential. Never mind that Goodyear's discrimination \nagainst Ms. Ledbetter continued each and every time it gave her a \nsmaller paycheck than it gave her male colleagues. The rule imposed by \nthe Supreme Court reversed decades of precedent in the courts of \nappeal, it overturned the policy of the EEOC under Democratic and \nRepublican administrations, and it upset the Nation's accepted \ndefinition of what is right.\n  This chart shows that the paycheck accrual rule was the law of the \nland prior to Ledbetter. In all these areas, these are the courts of \nappeal decisions that would have helped Ms. Ledbetter to recover. These \nareas are the areas where the EEOC demonstrates the paycheck accrual \nrule under EEOC policy, as well as these others. This small area in \nhere shows what is now known in the Supreme Court decision as the \nLedbetter decision. But this is the way the law of the land had been \nfor years prior to this judgment and this decision.\n  The rule imposed by the Supreme Court reversed the decades of \nprecedent in the courts of appeal, it overturned the policy of the EEOC \nunder both Democratic and Republican administrations, and it upset the \nNation's accepted definition as to what is fair and right.\n  The Court's decision turned back the clock on civil rights. Every \nyear, thousands of workers suffer pay discrimination. The Ledbetter \ndecision will hurt workers alleging discrimination of every kind: Sex, \nrace, national origin, age, and disability. This chart shows 5,700 pay \ndiscrimination charges that have been brought. These here are on \ndisability, discrimination on the basis of disability, after we passed \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act. The dark green is on gender \ndiscrimination. The lighter green is on race discrimination; \ndiscrimination on the basis of race. This is national origin in here: \n588. This is discrimination on age. All these cases--5,700--are based \nupon the pay discrimination that has crossed the country.\n  This is a real challenge. This doesn't represent the hundreds of \nthousands--hundreds of thousands--of cases of people who don't know \nabout it. This is what is happening in this country. This is what is \ngoing to continue to happen unless we overturn the Ledbetter decision.\n  The Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter gives employers free rein \nto continue to discriminate and leaves workers powerless to stop it. \nThe result defies both justice and common sense. We must act to restore \nthe decency and fairness to our Nation's civil rights laws.\n  The bipartisan Fair Pay Restoration Act will restore the clear intent \nof Congress. That is the legislation we will have on the floor to act \non this next week. It provides a reasonable rule that reflects how pay \ndiscrimination actually occurs in the workplace. It links the time for \nfiling a pay discrimination claim to the date a worker receives a \ndiscriminatory paycheck--not when an employer makes a discriminatory \ndecision. Workers shouldn't have to be mindreaders in order to protect \nthemselves from discrimination. Workers who aren't allowed to share \ninformation about their wages shouldn't be rendered powerless to combat \ndiscrimination. This bill recognizes that workers who receive a \ndiscriminatory check today should not be out of time to file a claim \nsimply because the employer managed to hide its illegal behavior \ninitially.\n  This legislation holds no surprises. It puts the law back to what it \nwas on the day before the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision. So we \nknow this legislation is fair and it is workable. There would not be \nany unexpected consequences. Courts would not be overwhelmed. In fact, \nthe Congressional Budget Office has said this bill would not increase \nlitigation costs by much and businesses would not be blindsided. We are \nrestoring what the law was previously. Most importantly, the Fair Pay \nRestoration Act makes employers accountable for violating the law. \nUnder the Supreme Court's rule, if an employer can keep its \ndiscriminatory ways secret for 6 months, it gets a free pass. Do my \ncolleagues hear me? If they are able to keep this secret that they are \ndiscriminating on any one of these bases--any of the bases we have \nmentioned, including age or disability, national origin, sex or race--\nin any of these areas, if they are able to do that and keep that a \nsecret for 6 months, the employers get the free pass.\n  They can continue to discriminate and its victims are powerless to \nstop the unfair treatment. It only makes sense that, if the violation \ncontinues, the right to challenge it should continue. No one should get \na free pass to break the law.\n  The Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter took us backward in time. \nIt takes us farther away from our ideal of a fair and just workplace \nfor all Americans. We have too much progress still to make, and we \ncannot afford a step back. With this legislation, we can at least make \nup the ground we have lost.\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\n  That is why this legislation has such widespread support. This chart \nindicates the various groups. A wide array of civil rights groups, \nlabor unions, and religious and disability rights groups support this \nlegislation. It includes the American Association of People with \nDisabilities. AARP understands what is happening in terms of age \ndiscrimination; Business and Professional Women understand the \ndiscrimination taking place against women; NAACP; the United Auto \nWorkers and other labor organizations, too; National Congress of Black \nWomen; Religious Action Center understands the moral implications of \nthis issue; U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, and others. They all \nsupport this legislation. Many businesses also support the bill, \nincluding the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, as I said. All \ncompanies that play by the rules and treat workers fairly should \nsupport this legislation.\n  Workers have lived for almost a year with the inequity of the \nLedbetter decision. It is time to stand up for the right to fair pay. \nAs Dr. King said so eloquently after the passage of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964:\n\n       Many people felt that after the passage of the civil rights \n     bill, we had accomplished everything. We didn't have anything \n     else to do and we would miraculously move into a new era of \n     freedom.\n       But when we opened our eyes, we came to see that the civil \n     rights bill, as marvelous as it is, is only the beginning of \n     a new day and not the end of a journey.\n       If this bill is not implemented in all of its dimensions, \n     it will mean nothing, and all of its eloquent words will be \n     as sounding brass on a tinkling cymbal. We must take this \n     bill and lift it from thin paper to thick action, and go all \n     out, all over this Nation, to implement it.\n\n  It is time to hold employers accountable for their unlawful conduct. \nIt is time to turn the clock forward on civil rights, instead of \nbackward. It is time to pass the Fair Pay Restoration Act.\n  A final comment. This is a remarkable woman, Lily Ledbetter. Here is \nher quote:\n\n       And according to the Court, if you don't figure things out \n     right away, the company can treat you like a second class \n     citizen for the rest of your career. That isn't right.\n\n  She played by the rules. She worked hard and provided for her family \nand was being discriminated against. Here she is again:\n\n       I hope that Congress won't let this happen to anyone else. \n     I would feel that this long fight was worthwhile if, at least \n     at the end of it, I knew that I played a part in getting the \n     law fixed so that it can provide real protection to real \n     people in the real world.\n\n  We hear a lot of speeches in this body about the importance of work \nand paying people fairly. We hear speeches on both sides of the aisle \nabout this. Here we have the classic example of a hard-working, decent, \nfairminded woman, who is trying to provide for a family, is playing by \nthe rules, and she is getting shortchanged on the basis of doing equal \nwork but not getting equal pay. She finds that out and pursues her \nrights and receives damages, under the rule of law in most of the \nStates; and the Supreme Court, by a narrow margin of one, makes a \ndecision that because she didn't know about it at the time this was \nstarted, when there was no chance in the world she would know about it \nbecause pay records are kept confidential, she is going to lose out on \nthe fair pay she is entitled to under the protection of the law we have \npassed.\n  This body has gone on record time in and time out about fair wages \nfor their work. We are going to have another opportunity in the next \nweek to see whether we are going to continue this.\n  Let me finally say we are going back to the previous law. This isn't \na new, bold idea carving out terms of the future. This is the way the \nlaw was. We are restoring the law, restoring the protections. This \nshould have passed unanimously. How can Members of this body say no to \nrestoring the law to what it was in the overwhelming majority of the \njurisdictions of this country, on the fundamental issue of fairness \nthat applies to virtually all workers, applies to men and women of \ncolor, men and women of disability, men and women of age, applies to \nnational origin, and applies across the board? What are we afraid of?\n  We will have the chance to take this up and to take action on it and \nto call the roll, and the American people will understand who in this \nbody is for fairness and treating American workers right, and who is \nfor going back in terms of the Nation's fundamental commitment to \ndecency and honoring hard-working people, who should be entitled to \nequal pay for equal work. We will find out when we call the roll the \nearly part of next week.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Tester pertaining to the introduction of S. 2875 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Tax Day\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on an issue that is \non the forefront of most Americans' minds this week, and that is the \nissue of tax day. Yesterday was the filing deadline, April 15, which \ncomes around every year, and for most Americans it is greeted with a \ngreat deal of trepidation and anxiety.\n  April 15 represents the annual call of Uncle Sam, the tax collector, \nknocking on the doors of hard-working taxpayers, and it highlights the \nreal tax burden that is placed on American families.\n  This year, Americans will work 74 days to pay their Federal taxes, 74 \ndays to pay their Federal tax burden alone. In order to pay State and \nlocal taxes, Americans will work an average of 39 additional days. What \nthat means is that the typical hard-working, taxpaying, law-abiding \nAmerican in this country will have to work an average of 113 days to \npay taxes in 2008.\n  If we look at a calendar, that pretty much takes care of the months \nof January, February, March, and April, up to the 23rd of this month. \nIf you think about it, every American is still working this year to pay \nthe tax man. They have not gotten to that point in the tax year when \neverything they make can then be dedicated to the expenses they have \nfor their families, for their children's education, for retirement, for \nfuel costs--all the things we deal with in our daily lives. We are \nstill at a point on the calendar where none of what we make can be \napplied to those necessities of life because we are still at a point on \nthe calendar where everything we earn and make in this country is \ndedicated to paying the tax man. Literally 113 days of the calendar \nyear of this year up until April 23, which will be next week, is \ndedicated to pay the tax man.\n  What does that mean? Another perspective: If you put it into an 8-\nhour work day, taxpayers are going to work 1 hour and 37 minutes every \nsingle day to pay Federal taxes, and an additional 51 minutes to pay \nState and local taxes.\n  Put that into perspective. All other categories of consumer spending \npale in comparison to the annual tax burden. In fact, Americans only \nneed to work 60 days to pay for annual housing costs, 50 days for \nhealth and medical care, 35 days to pay for their annual costs, and 29 \ndays to pay for transportation.\n  So the expenses most people deal with in their every-day lives, \nwhether, again, that is the cost of housing, health care, food, or \ntransportation--all are basic necessities--pale in comparison to the \nnumber of days the American taxpayer works every single year to pay \ntheir tax burden.\n  That is a pretty remarkable chart, I think you would have to say, \nwhen you look at the tax burden and the number of days you have to pay \nrelative to the things we spend the rest of our money on.\n  This year, the statistics are probably better, if you can imagine \nthat, than they were a few years ago. In 2000, before the historic tax \ncuts took effect, taxpayers had to work an all-time high\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\nof 123 days to pay their tax burden. We have gone from 123 days down to \n113 days.\n  In that same year 2000, a record 33.6 percent of the Nation's income \nwas dedicated to paying taxes. After the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, \nAmericans were able to work an average of two fewer weeks to meet their \nFederal tax burden. That is why we find the average American working \n113 days to meet their tax liability as opposed to 123 days a few short \nyears ago. That is attributable to the tax relief that was enacted in \n2001 and 2003.\n  Aside from paying taxes, filling out tax returns is a burden in and \nof itself. We have a Tax Code that is out of control, out of date, and \nis imploding under its own weight. The U.S. Tax Code spans over 54,000 \npages. Some of the current provisions of the code were created 40 years \nago. Each year individuals, families, and businesses spend needless \nhours poring over IRS forms and regulations trying to make sense of the \nendless exercise of filing taxes. In fact, in total, taxpayers dedicate \nover 6 billion hours to file their taxes and spend over $140 billion a \nyear in compliance costs.\n  I read a story a couple of days ago that those who still fill out \ntheir own tax returns take an average of 34 hours to do so. That is \nalmost a week. That is a workweek almost for most people to comply or \nfill out the tax return--for those who still fill out their own tax \nreturns.\n  Bear in mind that a lot of Americans have gotten to the point where \nit is so complex, burdensome, and complicated they turn it over to a \ntax preparer. For those who still fill out their tax returns, 34 hours \nis the average they spend in complying with the Tax Code in this \ncountry.\n\n  Ironically, the complexity and uncertainty of filing taxes is only \namplified by congressional action. Since 1986, we have made--I say we, \nthe Congress--have made 15,000 changes to our Tax Code, or \napproximately 2 every single day. Many of these changes focus on 1- or \n2-year extensions of expiring provisions.\n  For example, last year, Congress was unable to extend the alternative \nminimum tax until the IRS had published its 2007 tax return forms. \nBecause of this delay, 13.5 million taxpayers had to wait until \nFebruary 11 to file forms relative to the alternative minimum tax.\n  Only Congress can create a complex tax provision, such as the \nalternative minimum tax, and actually make it more complicated by \nextending it after the IRS publication deadline.\n  Unfortunately, the congressional leadership is simply either \noblivious or unsympathetic to the tax burden on American families. Last \nmonth, the Senate Democrats called for the largest tax increase in \nAmerican history. Under the Democratic budget, the reduced individual \ntax rates are set to expire in 20 months.\n  As millions of Americans have now finished coping with this year's \nApril 15 deadline, I think it is important to point out that this \ndeadline is going to be even more painful under the Democratic budget \nthat passed the Senate earlier this year.\n  If the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are not extended, on January 1, 2011, \nthe 10-percent tax bracket will expire, the tax bracket that was put \ninto effect that impacts low-income earners, lowers their tax liability \nand took literally millions of American taxpayers completely off the \ntax rolls. The 25-percent tax bracket that currently applies to earners \nin that tax rate bracket is going to go up to 28 percent. The 28-\npercent tax rate will increase to 31 percent. The 33-percent tax rate \nwill increase to 36 percent. And the 35-percent tax rate will increase \nto 39.9 percent.\n  On top of the increased tax rates that will happen on January 1, \n2010, unless we take steps to extend and prevent those tax cuts from \nexpiring, the increased child tax credit will expire as well. Families \nwith children are going to see their tax burden increase substantially \nwhen the $1,000 tax credit is reduced to $500 after the year 2010.\n  Additionally, the marriage penalty is reinstated. The 3l million \nfilers who report dividend income and the 26 million filers who report \ncapital gains income also will see their taxes on their investments go \nup.\n  Finally, the death tax will be reinstated at pre-2001 levels of $1 \nmillion. In other words, you can exempt $1 million worth of your \nincome, the wealth you acquired over the years, from the death tax \nliability. If we think about how that impacts small businesses, \nfarmers, and ranchers--and I can share that as someone who lives in a \nrural State where we have a lot of farm and ranch families. We have a \nlot of people with lots of assets, lots of land, lots of equipment, but \nthey are very cash poor. When you take $1 million anymore, with land \nvalues being what they are in a place such as even my State of South \nDakota, you are going to have an awful lot of people who are going to \nbe hit very hard by the death tax when it becomes reinstated at a $1 \nmillion-level exemption.\n  Attach to that a maximum statutory rate of 55 percent--which, \nincidentally, is one of the highest death tax rates in the world. So \nliterally you are going to have for people now who worked their whole \nlives--small businesses, farmers, ranchers--to accumulate some things \nto pass on to the next generation, all but $1 million of that would be \ntaxed at a rate as high as 55 percent.\n  Think about the impact that is going to have on family farm and ranch \noperations in this country and many of our small businesses, which is \nwhere most of the jobs in the country are generated.\n  In total, the average family is going to see their taxes increase by \nroughly $2,300 per year. That is enough to buy several months of \ngroceries or several months worth of health care.\n  It does not have to be this difficult. Congress can work in a \nbipartisan manner to fix our broken Tax Code and to ease the tax burden \nfor families and small businesses.\n  Commissions have been convened, hearings have been held, studies have \nbeen published, and yet another tax day has passed without \ncomprehensive tax reform.\n  Streamlining our Tax Code will strengthen our economy, it will \nimprove the competitiveness of our businesses, and it will greatly ease \nthe tax burden for all American families.\n  The problem is not that Washington taxes too little. The problem is \nthat Washington spends too much. The American people, when they start \nspending virtually a third of their year to pay the tax burden that is \nimposed on them at the Federal level, the State level, and the local \nlevel, we are asking way too much and imposing way too much a burden on \nthe working men and women in this country and those small businesses \nthat are creating the jobs and those who are trying to pass on those \noperations to the next generation so we can keep family farms, ranches, \nand small businesses in the family, contributing, creating jobs, and \npaying taxes. With a confiscatory death tax, which will happen if we do \nnot take steps to extend the tax cuts, we are going to see a lot of \nthose farms, ranchers, and small businesses go by the wayside.\n  I hope the sentiment in this body, the Senate, and the House of \nRepresentatives will change to the point that we recognize the \nimportance of extending the tax relief that was enacted in 2001 and \n2003 so we do not see these steep increases in income rates and return \nof the marriage penalty and a decrease in the per-child tax credit, \ndividend, and capital gains income being taxed at much higher rates, \nand the death tax being reinstated. If we are successful in extending \nthose tax cuts, I think we will see an economy that, although \nexperiencing an economic downturn right now, will improve, will start \nto grow again and create jobs. If we allow these tax cuts to expire, I \nthink it is ``Katy, bar the door'' in terms of the adverse economic \nconsequences and impact it will have on this economy and on the working \nmen and women of this country and the entrepreneurs who make it work.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 2:15 shall be equally \ndivided and controlled between the Senator from\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, and the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. \nDeMint, or their designees.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I don't see the Senator from South \nCarolina here, and I don't want to presume to describe his amendment. \nThat wouldn't be fair because he views his amendment as something that \nwill help this bill and I view it as something that will kill this \nbill. Simply put, what he is saying is we need to recommit this bill to \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, and what he is basically \nsaying is that we need to scrub out of this bill any changes that were \nmade to projects.\n  Although Senator DeMint wasn't here at the time, I made the point \nearlier that in this SAFETEA-LU bill is $110 million worth of projects \nhe requested. He was fortunate: all those projects seemed to be moving \nforward, and they do not need any technical correction. But many of \nus--many of us--don't have that experience. For example, Senator Inhofe \nexplained a road project in Oklahoma where one portion of the project \nwasn't ready for funding and another was. So, yes, we make a technical \ncorrection. I have a similar project in my State where we have to make \nsure the project is changed a little bit or there are going to be some \nbad impacts on some of my people who live in those communities.\n  So there is really nothing nefarious going on here. We are just \ntrying to get these projects moving. We are trying to give a green \nlight to projects that are facing a red light. What that means is that \nabout $1 billion worth of projects could actually get started--transit \nprojects, road projects--and we think that, at this particular time \nwhen we are suffering a recession, the last thing we should do is try \nto bring this bill back to the committee because, effectively, that \nwould kill it. So I have respect for my colleague's intention here, \nbut, in essence, if he was being completely straightforward, he would \nadmit this is going to kill this bill.\n  We know how hard it is to get bills up before the Senate. This bill \nactually passed when Senator Inhofe was chairman of the committee, but \nit has languished because we haven't had a chance to bring it to the \nfloor. Senator Reid gave us time. It is a simple bill. I was hopeful it \ncould be finished by now. I am grateful we are having a vote on at \nleast one of the amendments--we know of another couple of amendments.\n  So that is really what I have to say. At the appropriate time, I am \ngoing to make a motion to table this motion, so I will return to do \nthat, as I say, at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator is advised that the time is under the control of the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Two minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I appreciate the chairman giving me the time to speak on \nthe bill. I am offering a motion to recommit, which will be up for a \nvote in just a few minutes, and it is a motion to recommit the \ntechnical corrections bill back to the EPW Committee.\n  The purpose of this is clear: Colleagues, we have to stop increasing \nspending at every point, never cutting anything and never looking for \nsavings. On this Transportation bill, there have been a number of \nprojects, hundreds of millions of dollars worth, that were not needed \nor wanted. And we need to be reminded that the highway trust fund by \nnext year is going to be over $3 billion in the red. With this \nTransportation bill, we had an opportunity to save. Yet, instead of \ndoing that, I am afraid this technical corrections bill goes well \nbeyond technical corrections and takes the money that would have been \nsaved from unwanted or unneeded projects and uses it to add new \nearmarks to the Transportation bill that aren't in the original \nlegislation and adds spending to existing earmarks.\n  My motion would recommit the technical corrections bill to the \ncommittee and instruct them to take out any new earmarks and any \nincreases in spending for existing earmarks. What that will do is just \nleave the base bill, which would be, at that point, technical \ncorrections. That is what this bill is intended to be. So I encourage \nall my colleagues to show some fiscal restraint and to restore this \nbill to a technical corrections bill.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I have 1 minute to \nrespond.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we talked about this before. First of all, \nI am coming from a very conservative perspective. Looking at this and \nalso looking at the infrastructure needs we have, we want to make sure \nthe technical corrections bill is not killed because that will stop all \nthe activity going on that is so desperately needed in South Carolina \nas well as the rest of the country.\n  There is no increase in the technical corrections bill in the amount \nof authorization. That is very important for people to know. We talk \nabout projects and assume they are projects that were not considered \nbefore. The top line is an amount of authorization that is the same. It \nhas not increased at all. So I contend, with all due respect to one of \nmy closest friends and fellow conservatives, that the conservative \nposition is to stay with the technical corrections bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to table the DeMint motion to \nrecommit and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the motion to recommit.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton) \nand the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Nebraska (Mr. Hagel) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3057]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment that has \nbeen filed, which may or may not be offered. I wanted to alert the \nSenate to the possibility of an amendment that deals with moving \ncompanies--companies that move families, move furniture, et cetera, \nfrom city to city and across State lines--in fact, move them all over \nthe country.\n  This amendment touches on a bipartisan provision that the Commerce \nCommittee handled 3 years ago, which was, I guess, led by Senators \nInouye, Stevens, Lott, and myself. We basically acknowledged that there \nhas been a problem in the moving industry for quite some time. I don't \nwant to go into great detail, but I will be glad to if Senator Bond \ncomes down and offers his amendment.\n  I want to give a little bit of background. Basically, if you look at \nthe statistics, since 2001, there have been about 25,000 official \ncomplaints with the Department of Transportation related to household \ngood carriers transporting goods in interstate commerce. These \ncomplaints do cover a wide range of abusive household good carrier \npractices--everything from fraudulent cost estimates to lost and even \ndamaged goods. So they really do cover the waterfront. However, the \nmost outrageous of these complaints, in my view, is what they call \n``hostage goods.''\n  What happens here is a moving company will move goods, and they will \nhold a consumer's possessions hostage until they pay thousands of \ndollars in excess of the original estimate. It is hard to believe that \npeople would treat each other this way, but we have seen this thousands \nof times around the country, where a moving company will hold goods \nhostage because they want to chisel more money out of the customer.\n  Three years ago now, in the Commerce Committee, we looked at this \nsituation. We understood the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration only had five employees assigned for the entire Nation \nwhen it comes to household goods and those complaints. Obviously, we \nhad a problem. We worked on a solution. Again, this was a very \nbipartisan solution.\n  Part of the solution was to authorize State attorneys general and \nState consumer protection officials--they are not always AGs; it \ndepends on the State. Usually they are attorneys general offices, but \nthey don't have to be. It would allow the State to enforce certain \nFederal household goods consumer protection laws and regulations as \ndetermined by the Secretary of Transportation. This set up a \npartnership between the State governments and the Federal Government. \nWe think it has been working well. We are hearing positive feedback.\n  State attorneys general, back in January of 2004, sent a letter, \nsigned by 48 State attorneys general, saying they would like to have \nthis authority. Let me tell you why. Probably, they have had similar \nexperiences that I had when I was in the attorney general's office in \nArkansas. I had a friend of mine who had moved from Florida back to \nArkansas; he was moving back with his family, et cetera, et cetera. \nLiterally, his goods--everything he owned--were held hostage by one of \nthese unscrupulous moving companies. Naturally, as the attorney \ngeneral, I thought surely we could help him. We started looking at it \nand learned that we were preempted by Federal law. I think he filed a \ncomplaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation, but let me ask my \ncolleagues, who is going to be better at enforcing this and doggedly \npursuing relief for their citizens, the State attorney general or the \nU.S. DOT in Washington--again, with five employees for the whole \nNation? That is a pretty easy answer, and that is the State AGs. This \nis something we crafted, and we believe it is balanced. It came out of \ncommittee unanimously. There was compromise. Two Democrats and two \nRepublicans worked together to get compromise language that we believed \nwas fair and, we thought, served the purpose, and we believe it is good \nlaw.\n  I think it is important that it did come out of the committee \nunanimously. Again, Senator Lott took a real leadership role, and \nSenator Stevens was involved and Senator Inouye was involved and I was \ninvolved. We worked hard to get this done for the committee and for the \nSenate and for the American people.\n  As part of all this, we listened to industry complaints. We really \ndid try to go the extra mile with the industry. We even had a hearing \nheld by Chairman Lott on May 4, 2006. We brought in witnesses and \nallowed moving companies to come in and talk about the situation. \nBasically, at the conclusion of the hearing, the committee found strong \nsupport for our safety provision, including the endorsement of the U.S. \nDOT inspector general and the FMCSA.\n  So this has been something that has been vetted, has been agreed to, \nhas been passed by the committee and by the Senate, and it has been \nsigned into law. We think it is a good provision.\n  Obviously, if there is an amendment on this today, this would not be \na technical correction, this would be a big shift in policy. I think \nthat is an important factor for colleagues to consider as they look at \nthis.\n  Also, if it is offered and if, in fact, I have a chance to come back \nto the floor and talk about it further, I know there will be a little \nbit of a comparison to the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission bill that we filed a few weeks ago, and we \npassed it on the Senate floor 79 to 13, I believe it was.\n  I know there will be a little comparison, but this is very different. \nThis is different in a number of ways. It is similar in some ways, but \nit is different also. And that is, with a consumer recall and with the \nState being able to enforce a consumer recall once that decision has \nbeen made in Washington, there may be thousands, tens of thousands, \npossibly millions of units of that product out in the American \nmarketplace that has been recalled. Those products may be in warehouses \nor they may show up on the Internet. There are a lot of different ways \nthey can show up. It can take literally years to get all those products \nout of the stream of commerce.\n  The moving industry is very different than that. Almost always what \nhappens with one of these moving companies is something goes on during \nthe move which more often than not is over a few days' period. \nOftentimes, it is from one State to another State. The fact situation \nhere is very different.\n  One of the reasons we are seeing an increase--and even though we \npassed this law, we are still seeing a fairly steady increase in these \ntypes of complaints--is the proliferation of the Internet. You can get \non the Internet right now--I did this yesterday as an experiment. I \nclicked on something such as ``cheap moving companies.'' I don't know \nexactly what I typed. Several came up. With many of these companies, \nwhat you do is click a couple of little buttons to tell how many rooms \nyou have in the house, or something very rudimentary, and you get a \nquote.\n  For folks who know about moving, it takes a lot more than that. You \ncannot make a couple clicks on the computer and think you are going to \nget an accurate moving estimate.\n  My experience has been with these large companies, they have written \ncontracts and they have procedures in place. They come out to your \nhome, or wherever you may be, and they look at your goods. They \nmeasure, they offer various services for crating, boxing, and all this \nkind of jazz. They can look, do their measurements and calculations and \ngive you an estimate down to the penny. More often than not, those \nestimates are very accurate.\n  The problem is not so much the name-brand companies. I am sure there \nare occasional problems with them. But the problem we are trying to get \nto is these companies that are fly by night, many based on the \nInternet, many of them you do not know with whom you are dealing.\n  What we are trying to do is clean up this industry and help the \nAmerican public in any way we can.\n  Since we passed this legislation, you would think you would see an \namazing drop in statistics. We have seen the numbers grow a little bit. \nAgain, it has been fairly steady. We feel as though\n\n[[Page S3058]]\n\nwe do not have accurate numbers yet. We are actually going to request a \nGAO study to allow them to do their analysis and see how our provision \nis working. I think what we will find, once the numbers come in and are \nanalyzed, is some good movement in the right direction.\n  One point that is important is that under SAFETEA-LU, the FMCSA did \nnot add that many employees. It went from 5 employees to 11 employees. \nThat is still a very small number of employees to do this all over the \ncountry. Hopefully, the State attorneys general will be able to help \nresolve these matters that are very good for the people in their \nStates.\n  Madam President, I don't know if Senator Bond is going to offer his \namendment. He told me earlier he thought he would. I hope he does not. \nIf it does require a vote, certainly I will ask my colleagues to vote \nagainst his amendment. If he, in fact, does offer his amendment, I \nwould like to have a chance to respond to Senator Bond. I know Senator \nBoxer and a few others have indicated their interest in doing that as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4538 to Amendment No. 4146\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside and at the appropriate place amendment No. 4538 be inserted into \nthe Boxer substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may propose an amendment to that \nsubstitute.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. COBURN], for himself, Mr. \n     Nelson of Florida, Mr. Martinez, Mr. McCain, Mr. Obama, Mrs. \n     Clinton, and Mrs. McCaskill, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4538 to amendment No. 4146.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To create a bipartisan, bicameral special committee to \ninvestigate the improper insertion of an earmark for Coconut Road into \n the conference report of the 2005 highway bill after both chambers of \n   Congress had approved identical versions of the conference report)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. COCONUT ROAD INVESTIGATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to item number 462 of the table contained in \n     section 1934 of the Conference Report on H.R. 3 (109th \n     Congress), which was passed by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives on July 29, 2005, $10,000,000 was allocated \n     for ``Widening and Improvements for I-75 in Collier and Lee \n     County''.\n       (2) According to item number 462 of such table in the \n     enrolled version of H.R. 3 (109th Congress), which was signed \n     into law by the President on August 10, 2005, $10,000,000 was \n     allocated for ``Coconut Rd. interchange I-75/Lee County''.\n       (3) A December 3, 2007, article in the Naples Daily News \n     noted, ``Mysteriously, after Congress voted on the bill but \n     before the president signed it into law, language in the \n     earmark was changed to read: `Coconut Rd. interchange I-75/\n     Lee County.' ''.\n       (4) Page 824 of Riddick's Senate Procedure notes that \n     ``Concurrent resolutions are used to correct errors in bills \n     when enrolled, or to correct errors by authorizing the re-\n     enrollment of a specified bill with the designated changes to \n     be made.''.\n       (5) The only concurrent resolution that Congress passed \n     regarding the enrollment of H.R. 3 (H. Con. Res. 226) does \n     not refer to the change made to item 462 of section 1934.\n       (6) The secret, unauthorized redirection of $10,000,000 to \n     the ``Coconut Rd. interchange I-75/Lee County'' calls into \n     question the integrity of the Constitution and the \n     legislative process.\n       (7) A full and open investigation into this improper change \n     to congressionally-passed legislation is necessary to restore \n     the integrity of the legislative process.\n       (b) Preservation of Documentation Relating to the \n     Enrollment of H.R. 3.--Officers and employees of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives shall take whatever actions \n     may be necessary to preserve all records, documents, e-mails, \n     and phone records relating to the enrollment of H.R. 3 in the \n     109th Congress, including all documents relating to changes \n     made to item 462 of the table contained in section 1934 of \n     such Act, to allocate funding for the Coconut Road \n     interchange in Lee County, Florida.\n       (c) Special Committee on Enrollment Irregularities.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There is established a select committee \n     of Congress to be known as the Special Committee on \n     Enrollment Irregularities (referred to in this subsection as \n     the ``Committee'').\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of the Committee are to--\n       (A) investigate the improper insertion of substantive new \n     matter into the table contained in section 1934(c) of the \n     Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity \n     Act: A Legacy for Users (Public Law 109-59) after the Act \n     passed the Senate and the House of Representatives on July \n     29, 2005; and\n       (B) determine when, how, why, and by whom such improper \n     revisions were made;\n       (3) Membership.--The Committee shall be comprised of 8 \n     members, of which--\n       (A) 2 shall be appointed by the majority leader of the \n     Senate;\n       (B) 2 shall be appointed by the minority leader of the \n     Senate;\n       (C) 2 shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (D) 2 shall be appointed by the minority leader of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (4) Authority.--The Committee, consistent with the \n     applicable rules of the Senate or the House of \n     Representatives, may--\n       (A) hold such hearings, take such testimony, and receive \n     such documents as the Committee determines necessary to carry \n     out the purposes described in paragraph (2); and\n       (B) require, by subpoena or otherwise, the attendance and \n     testimony of such witnesses and the production of such books, \n     records, correspondence, memoranda, papers, documents, tapes, \n     and materials as the Committee determines necessary.\n       (5) Reports.--\n       (A) Interim report.--Not later than August 1, 2008, the \n     Committee shall prepare an interim report that details the \n     Committee's findings and make such report available to the \n     public in searchable form on the Internet.\n       (B) Final report.--Not later than October 1, 2008, the \n     Committee shall prepare a final report that details the \n     Committee's findings and make such report available to the \n     public in searchable form on the Internet.\n       (6) Use of information.--The Committee may share all \n     findings, documents, and information gathered in an \n     investigation under this subsection with--\n       (A) the Select Committee on Ethics of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of the \n     House of Representatives; and\n       (C) appropriate law enforcement authorities.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I am on the floor this afternoon because \na few years ago something happened in Congress that should never have \nhappened. What happened is a bill passed the House and a bill passed \nthe Senate. A bill that both Houses agreed to was changed before it \nwent to the President. We do not know where it was changed or who \nchanged it. We do not know the details of it. There has been \nspeculation in the press, but we do not have any real knowledge of how \nthis happened. But there is a principle, and the principle is, if we \ncannot trust what we agree to in both bodies of Congress will be sent \nto the President, then everything we pass has to be suspect.\n  This is a hard amendment to offer because there is a lot of angst \naround looking at ourselves and looking at the problems. But the one \nthing we do know is the American people expect the process to be one \nthat is open, one that is accurate, and that when the President gets a \nbill, it truly represents what the Congress intended.\n  What actually happened? On the highway bill conference report passed \nby Congress, item 461, there were widening improvements for the I-75 \ncorridor in Collier and Lee Counties in Florida. What actually went to \nthe President was different. This was changed to Lee County only and \nfor an interchange. Somehow that got changed. This money has been \nrejected three times by the citizens and their elected representatives \nin that area because they do not want an interchange. What they wanted \nwas to widen I-75 in terms of hurricane evacuations.\n  As I said, we do not know how this happened. There is press \nspeculation. We don't know if it occurred in the Senate. We don't know \nif it occurred in the House. What we do know is it did occur, and \nnobody can dispute the fact. And this bill, thanks to Chairman Boxer, \ncorrects that and puts it back to what the original intent of Congress \nwas, what Congress intended originally.\n  Some will say: Now that we fixed it, we don't need to do anything \nabout it.\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\nBut the problem the American public has in terms of confidence in us is \nthat we will do the right thing, and the right thing is to figure out \nhow something such as this happened and make sure it never happens \nagain and put in the safeguards so we know it will not happen again. I \nbelieve it is time for Congress to look at this issue and fix it.\n  Many of my colleagues say we are treading on dangerous water because \nif this occurred in the House, we are forcing the House to look at \nsomething, one body telling the other body to do something. We don't \nknow where it occurred.\n  The amendment I am offering creates a committee of Members, four from \nthe House, four from the Senate, that will look at this issue and make \nappropriate recommendations to the appropriate bodies; that is, the \nHouse Committee on Official Conduct and the Senate Ethics Committee or \nany law enforcement officers.\n  I understand that there will possibly be a second-degree amendment, \nand this ought to be offered and made, that the Justice Department look \nat this. That can certainly happen in due time, but there is this \nlittle issue of separation of powers. We have the responsibility in \nCongress to do what is right.\n  It is very interesting the debates we have had, especially in this \nCongress, about separation of powers and not wanting the executive \nbranch to take power away from us. However, we are thinking about \noffering a second-degree amendment that would do that.\n  I believe in the people in this body. I believe we all do not like \nthat this happened. I believe we all want to see that it never happens \nagain. The best way to do this is to have an investigation, two Members \nappointed by the Speaker and two Members appointed by the minority \nleader in the House, two Members appointed by the majority leader in \nthe Senate and two Members appointed by the minority leader in the \nSenate. So we have eight Members reporting back to us what happened and \nmaking recommendations to the appropriate committees, not necessarily \nto us.\n  As we all know, Senate ethics investigations, as well as House \ninvestigations in terms of official conduct, are not public. We don't \nknow if something is going on regarding this issue now. But what we do \nknow is something happened, and we ought to be about fixing it.\n  My worry is if we modify this amendment or we do not agree to this \namendment, this is going to be the feeling of the American public: Is \nthis political? Can we not control the rules of our own body in terms \nof enrollment?\n  It is interesting what Jefferson said when he talked about this in \nhis manual. He described what should and shouldn't be done when a bill \nhas passed both Houses of Congress.\n  The House last acting on it, notifies its passage to the other and \ndelivers the bill to the Joint Committee on Enrollment, who sees it is \ntruly enrolled in parchment. When the bill is enrolled, it is not to be \nwritten in paragraphs but solidly, all in one piece, that the blanks \nbetween the paragraphs may not give room for forgery.\n  That is, in essence, what happened in this case. Now, that is not a \ncase for the Justice Department to investigate at this time. That is a \ncase for us to investigate and look at our own rules. The fact is, \nsomething went terribly wrong on the way of a bill going to the \nPresident that was different than both Houses of Congress passed.\n  I understand the angst of someone coming from the Senate and saying \nthis ought to happen, and I understand we don't want to get in a \nfingerpointing mode. But if the House agrees with this in conference, \nit will happen; and if they do not agree with this in conference, it \nwon't happen. But what should happen in the Senate should be that we \nlook at this so we can create the confidence that the American people \ndeserve to have in this body to know that when we pass a bill out, that \nthe bill we passed is actually the bill the President signs.\n  I am thankful to the Transportation Committee and Chairman Boxer and \nRanking Member Inhofe for clarifying this and fixing it. It is right \nthat it should be done. It is right that the original intention of it \nshould be done. But that is not good enough. That is not good enough \nfor the American public. I understand the desire of the chairman of the \ncommittee to move this out of our hands and into the Justice \nDepartment's hands, but I have some problems with that. One is this \nidea of separation of powers. What other powers are we going to give up \nwhen we can't handle a simple investigation into what went wrong during \nthe process of enrollment?\n  The second thing is, my legal staff tells me we cannot mandate to the \nexecutive branch what they will and will not investigate. So should \nthey choose not to investigate this, we will have been no further down \nthe road. But the 100-percent guarantee that it will get investigated \nis if we have Members of both bodies investigate this and come to a \nresolution so it does not happen again.\n  It doesn't matter whose bill it is, and it doesn't matter which \nparty's bill it is. If a bill, no matter whose bill it is, is changed, \nit affects the whole country, and it affects the confidence in this \nbody. This is an ethical issue for us, if in fact it involved the \nSenate.\n  The easy thing would be not to offer this. That is easy; you don't \nmake other Senators uncomfortable with you; you don't have the chance \nthat the House could be upset at what we are suggesting in a \nconference, if they agree to us jointly in investigating this. We could \nsweep it under the rug as if it never happened because we corrected it. \nBut it did happen. And by not investigating it, it means it can happen \nagain.\n  This is not without precedent. I believe in 1982 or 1992, this same \nthing happened and it didn't get investigated. It just got changed. So \nhere we have it happening again, and only because of some very good \nwork in the press were we made aware of it. Consequently, we ought to \nbe the ones to fix it. We ought to take responsibility for our actions \nand we ought to correct the problem that happened with this, wherever \nit may be. If it happened in the House, the House should correct it. If \nit happened in the Senate, the Senate should correct it. But at least \nwe ought to know the details of how and why, and then, if appropriate, \na referral, if in fact that is justified. If it was a simple clerical \nerror, we will know that. If it was more than that, we will know that.\n  The fact is, by not doing this, what we are saying to the American \npeople is, oops, we had a mistake that is paramount to the quality and \nthe clarity of how this body functions, and we believe it is not a \ngrave error. Well, I happen to disagree. It is an entirely egregious \nerror because it impacts every other piece of legislation.\n  If I as a Senator can no longer trust that the bills we pass in \nCongress, after they are enrolled, are exactly what we pass, then I now \nhave to spend the time looking at every bill after it has been enrolled \nto make sure it matches. None of us has the time to do that. That is \nwhat we entrust the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House \nfor.\n  So somewhere along the way, something changed. We need to know that. \nWe don't need to play the same political games. We don't need to play a \npartisan game with it, because nobody knows for sure who did what. What \nwe do need to do is to do the hard work of looking at what went wrong \nand making the appropriate changes.\n  I note there are several cosponsors, and the Presiding Officer is \none. She has been a great addition to our body because she seeks \nclarity and transparency in what we do here; also Senator McCain and \nSenator Obama, as well as Senator Martinez and Senator Nelson of \nFlorida. They are the two Senators where this had the most impact.\n\n  I don't come to the floor lightly saying we want to poke at people, \nbut I do think it is important for the integrity of our body that we, \nalong with the House, get to the bottom of it. It was my hope we could \nwork this out without trying to refer it to the Justice Department. If \nin fact it needs to get there, it will get there after appropriate \ninvestigation.\n  To bypass us and give up our power to correct things that are wrong \nwith our rules--not laws, our rules--seems to me to be the antithesis \nof what we have debated so many times in this Senate over the past 9 to \n15 months about the executive power encroaching on the Senate. Now we \nare ready to give that power away for something that is duly ours and \nset a precedent\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\nthat we are going to ask the Justice Department to investigate us? We \nought to be investigating ourselves.\n  We have the integrity, we have the quality, we have the people, and \nwe have the goodwill of all the Senators of this body and all the \nMembers of the House to do that. Because the institution is more \nimportant than any one of us. What we do for the American people has to \nbe more important than any one of us. So it is my hope--I will not take \nmuch more time--the Senate will concur.\n  This is done with all sincerity. I am pointing a finger at no one. \nBut I think if we do not do this, by a second amendment that takes it \naway, what we will have done is to abrogate our responsibility in terms \nof the clarity of our purpose and the quality of our work. And if we \nchoose to do that, here is what we will find. We will find another \nnotch down the confidence in Congress by the American people, if we \nrefuse to look under our own bedsheets for our own bedbugs and give \nthat responsibility away.\n  I appreciate the help of the staff of the committee. They have been \nvery forthright in working with us. As I have said before, I appreciate \nSenator Boxer's cooperative attitude on this. We disagree on how best \nto handle this, and I understand her right as the chairman and as a \nMember of this body, but my hope is we don't give away powers that are \nours. The separation of powers is a very important concept in this \nbody, and to abrogate our responsibility and appoint it somewhere else, \nwhen we don't have the facts--that can always happen afterwards.\n  In fact, this amendment states that appropriate referrals will be \nmade to both Ethics Committees of the House and Senate and to law \nenforcement, if necessary. So my hope would be that we could vote this \neventually and look at it. I think it is paramount for the quality of \nour work.\n  Madam President, I reserve any time I may have, and I look forward to \nthe comments of the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, when I learned about this whole issue of \nwhat went on in a very devious way related to a highway project, I was \nvery glad Senator Coburn called it to our attention. Where we are right \nnow is the best way to handle this, and this is where there is a bit of \na disagreement.\n  I am concerned, as I look at the Senator's solution here. \nEssentially, what he has is the House and Senate selecting Members to \ngo on this special committee, and I believe that injects politics into \nit right away. We can all say we are going to be objective, and so on \nand so forth, but I think people get the sense, oh, that is a \nRepublican, and he may feel one way; or she is a Democrat, she may feel \none way; or I saw that person going to dinner with another Senator or \nanother House Member this way.\n  I am chair of the Ethics Committee, so I know it is very hard to be \ntotally objective, and you must be in this circumstance. But I think \nthe appearance of a conflict of interest in setting up this committee \nis something I would rather avoid. So I think that Senator Coburn has \ndone everything in his power to set up a way to investigate this that \nis fair, but my feeling is there is a better way to go.\n  As a matter of fact, I am going to offer an amendment to the \nunderlying substitute, and I would ask the Parliamentarian if I need to \nlay aside the pending amendment in order to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not need to do that. The \namendment is in order at this time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4539\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S3060, April 16, 2008, the Record reads: Amendment No. \n4539 to Amendment No. 4146\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Amendment No. 4539\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n    (Purpose: To call for a review by the Department of Justice of \n           allegations of violations of Federal criminal law)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I send an amendment to the underlying substitute to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Do I need to ask for its immediate consideration?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is automatic. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4539 to the text of the committee \n     substitute to be inserted:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REVIEW.\n\n       Consistent with applicable standards and procedures, the \n     Department of Justice shall review allegations of impropriety \n     regarding item 462 in section 1934(c) of Public Law 109-59 to \n     ascertain if a violation of Federal criminal law has \n     occurred.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank the clerk for reading. That is \nit in its entirety. We call attention to the exact problem that \noccurred in the bill, the exact project, without naming it. It is \nexplained here. We know it is the Coconut Road project.\n  This is not a sense of the Senate. This is a very direct amendment \nthat says the Department of Justice shall review these allegations and \nthey shall ascertain if a violation of Federal criminal law has \noccurred.\n  So what we do, by taking it into this realm, we take it out of the \nrealm of politics. Senators selected by the Senate to be on this \ninvestigation committee of something that happened over in the House; \nHouse Members selected by the House to investigate, to me it injects \npolitics into the process.\n  Secondly, if you read the Constitution and you see the speech and \ndebate clause, you understand that this raises constitutional issues--\nthe Coburn amendment--as to whether one part of Congress can \ninvestigate another. I don't want to see this whole thing collapse like \na deck of cards because we did something unconstitutional. We know that \nthe Justice Department, when there is an allegation of improper \nbehavior, we know when there is a possibility here of laws being \nbroken, they have the clear obligation and responsibility, and now we \nare, in essence, telling them they must review this.\n  In our conversations, one of the things Senator Coburn was worried \nabout was that the Department of Justice could not use the subpoena \npower. I have looked at that and what I have found is that is not true. \nIn the case of the Jefferson investigation, it was because there was no \nwarrant. That was the problem. There was some narrow issue involving \nthat. Clearly, this investigation would be appropriate.\n  Also, we don't give up anything here, I say to my colleague. \nConsistent with applicable standards and procedures, that is what we \nsay. The Department of Justice shall review, consistent with applicable \nstandards and procedures. No new rules, no new laws, no new ways, and \nvery clearly done.\n  Frankly, if I might say, I am so angry about this. I am so upset \nabout this. I am sick about this. I think it is very possible people \nought to go to jail here. A Senate and House committee can't send \nanybody to jail. They simply can't. They could make a referral to \nJustice, but they can't do it.\n\n  I am saying I think what we are doing here, by requiring that the \nJustice Department--by saying, ``They shall review allegations,'' I \nthink is a much better way to go. It keeps politics out of this, it \nkeeps constitutional questions about the debate clause out of this, and \nit gets to the heart of this, which is, if there was a crime, the \nperson ought to go to jail or the people ought to go to jail.\n  Let's get right to the point instead of setting up some political \ncommittee. They will call hearings and the press will come and people--\nSenators will make speeches and make their careers. I can just see this \nthing. I can see this coming. I want to avoid a circus. I want to put \nsomebody in jail if they did something wrong. That is why I think this \nparticular amendment I am offering is the way to go.\n  I do respect my friend. I certainly am looking forward to having \nvotes on both of these, but I do think this simple amendment we have \nhere will get to the bottom of this, which is where my friend wants to \ngo. He wants to punish the people who have done something wrong. That \nis what I think we do here.\n  I will be happy to yield the floor because I see my colleague would \nlike to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, first of all, I thank the chair for her \nwords. I stated that this amendment language is based on a very big \nprecedent established in 1992 in this body with a joint committee of \nMembers of Congress to look at the rules in both Houses, to look at the \nprocesses in both Houses. There is a precedent. There is not a\n\n[[Page S3061]]\n\nproblem with the debate clause. I think that is not a prudent argument \nto be against this.\n  The Justice Department will eventually get this if, in fact, we find \nout there was a crime. I also make the point that nobody knows right \nnow where this occurred. At least I don't. Nobody knows what the facts \nare, so the assumption we are making that we would be involved in \ninvestigating the House is--we do not know that. At least I certainly \ndo not know it, and I have kind of been looking at this for quite some \ntime. So it is an assumption that we are going to have, necessarily, an \ninvestigation of the House. We may be having an investigation of the \nSenate.\n  The fact is, we have a good precedent for this. This was a Joint \nCommittee on the Organization of Congress, H. Con. Res. 192, in the \n102nd, and it looked at everything. It didn't just look at one specific \nthing. So there is precedent for it.\n  More important is the separation of powers issue. What we are saying \nto the American public is we do not have the power to control our own \nbody and that we have to ask the Justice Department to come in and do \nit. If there is a criminal violation, they certainly ought to be \ninvolved in that, but we do not know that yet.\n  First of all, these are the rules of the Senate. They are not law. We \nare asking them to investigate the rules of the Senate, not a law; \ntherefore, we are giving power to the executive branch, we are asking \nthe executive branch to come in. My great worry--there is no question, \nSenator Boxer's amendment will do this. It will get an investigation, \nif they will come and do it--there is no way we can force them to come \nand do it--and we will get to the bottom of it.\n  But I am worried about the integrity of the body, saying to the \nAmerican public that we cannot police ourselves; we cannot do it; we do \nnot want to take the heavy lifting it is going to take. And I do not \nbelieve a four-by-four panel of two Democratic Senators, two Republican \nSenators, two Democratic Congressmen, and two Republican Congressmen--\nand this committee has the right to not do any of this in public if \nthey do not want to. The committee totally gets to do this. Nobody \nwants a circus. I am even reticent that I am actually here making this \npoint. I think it is a pox on our body that this happened, but I think \nit needs to be addressed.\n  My hope is that people will not take a partisan viewpoint on how they \nvote. My hope is they will think about the institution of Congress, \nthey will think about the separation of powers, they will think about \nthe difference between laws and rules of the Senate and rules of the \nCongress. Then, if a referral needs to be made to the Justice \nDepartment, we would do that, but that would most appropriately come \nfrom our Ethics Committees, not from this committee--after a referral \nfrom this committee to the Ethics Committee.\n  The chair of the Ethics Committee cannot say whether they are looking \nat this right now. They may be. They may not be. We do not know. The \nJustice Department cannot say whether they are or not. So we do not \nknow what is happening.\n  The point is, something needs to happen. I worry that when we tell \nthe American public we are not capable of looking into our own \ndysfunction, that, in fact, what it says is that we give up power to \nthe Justice Department to look at how we enroll bills and whether we \nviolated the rules under how we do it. I have a real concern with that. \nI have tremendous concern with that, especially since we made such a \nlarge issue of separation of powers in this Congress.\n  I will make one other point, and it is not to demean the Senator from \nCalifornia. If this were important to the committee, why was your \namendment not part of the committee mark? If, in fact, the committee \nwas enraged over this, why was this not a part of the original \ncommittee mark?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is that a question to me?\n  Mr. COBURN. Why have we not addressed this in the original committee \nmark or the substitute? We corrected it--and I said, while the Senator \nwas out, I was thankful that the problem was corrected. But the issue \nof how it got changed is not in the committee mark.\n  This amendment, this second-degree amendment, comes on the fact that \nwe are trying to offer what I think is a cogent way that has precedent \nin both the House and Senate for solving this. That is probably just an \noversight because I know the Senator cares deeply about this. I know \nshe was upset about it. With everything they had to do to bring this \nbill to the floor as quickly as they did, that is probably what \nhappened. But the fact is, we are at this point. If the body wants the \nJustice Department--if we want to give up that power to the Justice \nDepartment, the body will vote that, and that is fine.\n  The last point I will make, and I will not continue on a lot further, \nis this does not force the House to do anything. Let me tell you why. \nThis bill will go to a conference committee, I believe, of which \nChairman Boxer will be the head, and all the House has to say is: We \ndisagree with this; we do not want to do this; we do not want to have a \ncommittee look into this. The House has that option, and if it does not \nagree to it, it will not come out of the conference committee and we \nwill not do anything on it.\n  The same is true of her amendment in terms of the Department of \nJustice. But it is important for the American people to know whether \nsomething happens on it and whether we do it in a way that emboldens \nand strengthens the institution of Congress or weakens it.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4540 to Amendment No. 4539\n\n  Before I yield the floor, I have a second-degree amendment at the \ndesk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4540 to amendment No. 4539.\n       The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. COCONUT ROAD INVESTIGATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to item number 462 of the table contained in \n     section 1934 of the Conference Report on H.R. 3 (109th \n     Congress), which was passed by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives on July 29, 2005, $10,000,000 was allocated \n     for ``Widening and Improvements for I-75 in Collier and Lee \n     County''.\n       (2) According to item number 462 of such table in the \n     enrolled version of H.R. 3 (109th Congress), which was signed \n     into law by the President on August 10, 2005, $10,000,000 was \n     allocated for ``Coconut Rd. interchange I-75/Lee County''.\n       (3) A December 3, 2007, article in the Naples Daily News \n     noted, ``Mysteriously, after Congress voted on the bill but \n     before the president signed it into law, language in the \n     earmark was changed to read: `Coconut Rd. interchange I-75/\n     Lee County.' ''.\n       (4) Page 824 of Riddick's Senate Procedure notes that \n     ``Concurrent resolutions are used to correct errors in bills \n     when enrolled, or to correct errors by authorizing the re-\n     enrollment of a specified bill with the designated changes to \n     be made.''.\n       (5) The only concurrent resolution that Congress passed \n     regarding the enrollment of H.R. 3 (H. Con. Res. 226) does \n     not refer to the change made to item 462 of section 1934.\n       (6) The secret, unauthorized redirection of $10,000,000 to \n     the ``Coconut Rd. interchange I-75/Lee County'' calls into \n     question the integrity of the Constitution and the \n     legislative process.\n       (7) A full and open investigation into this improper change \n     to congressionally-passed legislation is necessary to restore \n     the integrity of the legislative process.\n       (b) Preservation of Documentation Relating to the \n     Enrollment of H.R. 3.--Officers and employees of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives shall take whatever actions \n     may be necessary to preserve all records, documents, e-mails, \n     and phone records relating to the enrollment of H.R. 3 in the \n     109th Congress, including all documents relating to changes \n     made to item 462 of the table contained in section 1934 of \n     such Act, to allocate funding for the Coconut Road \n     interchange in Lee County, Florida.\n       (c) Special Committee on Enrollment Irregularities.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There is established a select committee \n     of Congress to be known as the Special Committee on \n     Enrollment Irregularities (referred to in this subsection as \n     the ``Committee'').\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of the Committee are to--\n       (A) investigate the improper insertion of substantive new \n     matter into the table contained in section 1934(c) of the \n     Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity \n     Act: A Legacy for Users (Public Law 109-59) after the Act \n     passed the Senate and the House of Representatives on July \n     29, 2005; and\n       (B) determine when, how, why, and by whom such improper \n     revisions were made;\n\n[[Page S3062]]\n\n       (3) Membership.--The Committee shall be comprised of 8 \n     members, of which--\n       (A) 2 shall be appointed by the majority leader of the \n     Senate;\n       (B) 2 shall be appointed by the minority leader of the \n     Senate;\n       (C) 2 shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (D) 2 shall be appointed by the minority leader of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (4) Authority.--The Committee, consistent with the \n     applicable rules of the Senate or the House of \n     Representatives, may--\n       (A) hold such hearings, take such testimony, and receive \n     such documents as the Committee determines necessary to carry \n     out the purposes described in paragraph (2); and\n       (B) require, by subpoena or otherwise, the attendance and \n     testimony of such witnesses and the production of such books, \n     records, correspondence, memoranda, papers, documents, tapes, \n     and materials as the Committee determines necessary.\n       (5) Reports.--\n       (A) Interim report.--Not later than August 2, 2008, the \n     Committee shall prepare an interim report that details the \n     Committee's findings and make such report available to the \n     public in searchable form on the Internet.\n       (B) Final report.--Not later than October 1, 2008, the \n     Committee shall prepare a final report that details the \n     Committee's findings and make such report available to the \n     public in searchable form on the Internet.\n       (6) Use of information.--The Committee may share all \n     findings, documents, and information gathered in an \n     investigation under this subsection with--\n       (A) the Select Committee on Ethics of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of the \n     House of Representatives; and\n       (C) appropriate law enforcement authorities.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, let me just say to my friend, I am the \nchair of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I am not the chair \nof the Judiciary Committee. I just want to say for the record, in \ndefense of my committee members all, that we fixed this problem in this \nbill. We fixed the problem in the bill. Do I support the Justice \nDepartment going after the evildoers and putting them in jail? You bet \nI do. But--I hate to say it--in Environment and Public Works, that is \nnot our role. I support what the Senator is trying to do here. So let's \nget that clear.\n  On page 86, here it is fixed, in section 110. I want to make that \nclear, that our committee did the right thing and fixed this problem.\n  My friend is right, there was a committee to look at the rules. But \nif all he is doing is looking at rules--and I know he is not--then what \nis the point? I want to look at what happened. My friend himself talked \nabout fraud. The fact is, we better get to the bottom of this, and all \nthis committee is going to do is look at rules. Frankly, I don't think \nit is doing much. I would much rather put people in jail. The proper \nway to do that is to call on the Justice Department to look at these \ncrimes because, to me, it is the crimes that concern me. I think what \nthey did, on the face of it, going in the dead of night, is certainly \nnot allowed in our rules--at least my interpretation of the rules. \nThat, to me, is not.\n  I tell you right now, in our committee we are pretty tough on this. \nWe are not allowing people to change things.\n  Everything that is in this technical corrections bill--and that is \nwhy Senator DeMint praised us--is on the Web site for all to see. We \nbelieve in transparency.\n  What this is about is getting to the bottom of allegations of serious \ncrimes--bribery. Bribery. That is why I do believe at the end of the \nday let's keep politics out of this issue.\n  I can tell you right now, the Senators who get on this committee are \ngoing to have the flashbulbs going off in their faces, they are going \nto make a big to-do about this, and they are not going to talk about \nrules, they are going to talk about crimes. The sad thing is, even if \nthey got to the bottom of it, at the end of the day the committee \ncannot put anybody in jail. The Justice Department can.\n  The speech and debate clause is really clear. I know my colleague in \nthe chair is a very prominent attorney. If you look at section 6, \narticle I, it clearly says:\n\n       . . . for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall \n     not be questioned in any other Place.\n\n  So our attorneys are saying the way this is set up, A, you have \npolitics in it; B, you have a constitutional problem, probably; and C, \nit is a lot of hoopla, a lot of cameras, and at the end of the day we \nwant to put people in jail. That is what we are talking about, really, \nat the end of the day.\n  Looking at the Senator's own document on page 5, he says the \ncommittee shall share its findings, share its documents, share its \ninformation, and so on, with various groups.\n  I just believe to be tough you have to get the Justice Department \ninvolved. When there is a knock on the door from the Justice \nDepartment, you will get to the bottom of this. That is what the Boxer \namendment does.\n  I hope people who really want to be tough will do the tough thing, \nnot set up some committee that is going to give Senators and House \nMembers a chance to make political points, and the public will look at \nus and say this is just a great big show, but really get to the bottom \nof it and get the Justice Department into this now. There are reports \nthat they are looking at some issues, but there is nothing to say that \nthey are looking at this particular problem.\n  That is what I have to say. My friend is right to bring this up. I am \nglad. When the press said: What do you think? I said: Good for him for \nbringing this up. I am sorry we were not able to agree on the right \napproach, but I feel very good about the approach I have come up with \nhere. I look forward to our colleagues voting on this at the \nappropriate time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I will just make one comment.\n  First of all, the chair of the EPW Committee is very gracious. I \nappreciate her words, and I intended no disrespect for her in terms of \nher effort. I know she supports this effort to get to the bottom of it. \nBut I would make a correction. We only say we should share with three \npeople: the appropriate law authorities and the appropriate ethics \ncommittees of both the House and the Senate.\n  We did not envision a show. I would envision that the people who \nmight be on this committee would take this very seriously; that, in \nfact, it probably would not be open hearings but, rather, closed, and \nthat, in fact, we would get to the bottom of the problem.\n  But either way we get to the bottom of the problem, I am happy we are \ngoing to get there. I think it is important that we get there. As I \noutlined, I think the integrity of what we pass, no matter how we get \nthere, as long as we can ensure the integrity, I will be satisfied we \nhave done that. I am not sure we will get that.\n  The final point I would make is we will be setting a precedent. Let \nus not forget, we will be setting a precedent that the Congress says \nthe Justice Department should investigate us. That is a big precedent. \nThat is a big precedent. I am not a lawyer. I do not know if it has \nhappened before, but I do not like that precedent. I don't like it at \nall. Because I think the integrity of this body is far greater than \nthat. I think Members of this body are far above that, that we do not \nneed the Justice Department to investigate us. I think we can \ninvestigate ourselves and we need to demonstrate to the American public \nthat we do have the will and courage to do the disciplined thing and do \nthe right thing and to solve the problem.\n  Then if a referral is needed to the Justice Department, we should \ngive it. But I have great qualms, great worries about ceding to the \nJustice Department the power to investigate us. My own personal \nexperience is, we do not know where they will go. We do not know that \nthey will stick on us. The point is, this is a big precedent I would \nworry about setting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, if I might respond to my friend, No. 1, \nwe do not cede a thing. We do not give up anything. As a matter of \nfact, we stay consistent with applicable standards and procedures, and \nthis cannot be a fishing expedition. We say the Department of Justice \nshall review allegations of impropriety regarding item 462 in section \n193(4)(C) of Public Law 109-\n\n[[Page S3063]]\n\n59, to ascertain if a violation of Federal criminal law has occurred.\n  The question is, to me: Will the people or persons who did something \nwrong be punished? At the end of the day, that is what I am about. I am \nnot about big committee hearings and special committees and the rest. \nListen, I am not about that. I am about: We have a lot of work to do \nfor the American people. My friend used words--``fraud,'' he said. He \nsaid ``fraud.'' He already used it. And in his own resolution he says: \nIf they find that there was such fraud, which he already thinks there \nwas--which, by the way, I think it was worse than that, but that is \nwhat I think from what I know.\n  There needs to be proof here. I do not mean to leap ahead too far. He \nsays he is going to refer it to the proper law enforcement. Why can't I \nsay: Well, that is a bad precedent. I do not get it. The difference \nbetween what the Senator is doing and what I am doing is I am saying: \nIt looks bad, as if there were a crime committed; we are not sure. \nLet's get right to the heart of it, and let's go after it.\n  Here, what my friend is doing, he says: Before we tell them to look \nat it, we are going to have these hearings. By the way, in his own \nwords, he is going to put the findings on the Internet, he is going to \npublish them. I have been around here long enough to know what a circus \nis. I have been involved in a lot of investigations on a lot of \ncommittees, and what I want is justice done. I do not want political \ntheatre. I want justice done. I will tell you why. When justice is done \nand someone goes to jail--we have seen a few people from the other side \nwalk off to jail--that sends the best possible message.\n  I do not think it ought to be delayed by hearings. Sometimes what \nhappens is, it holds up a Justice Department investigation when there \nare public hearings going on. I have been in that circumstance too. So \nI say, here we have two options. One sets up this elaborate committee, \nand the other one says: Let's get to the heart of this, go after these \nbad actors, put them in jail. I think that is the better way to go.\n  I guess I have said it a hundred ways to Sunday. I would stand on \nthose remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I certainly appreciate hearing the debate on the \namendments of the technical corrections of the highway bill.\n  I want to take a little detour for a moment. I ask unanimous consent \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Nigerian Detaining\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I rise to speak on a matter that has \nbeen of great concern this week to not only the Governor of the State \nof Montana and Senator Baucus, but to my colleagues from the State of \nWashington, Senator Cantwell and Senator Murray.\n  Four Americans were detained last weekend in Nigeria. They have been \nheld in Nigeria until today. Today they were released. It is an \nenormous relief to all of us and particularly to those families, that \nSandy Cioffi, Tammi Sims, Clifford Worsham, and Sean Porter will soon \nbe reunited with their loved ones.\n  Nigeria's State Security Service has been overseeing their custody \nsince Saturday afternoon, more than 100 hours. They were charged with \nno crime. They were in the country legally. They did nothing wrong. So \nwe worked closely to try to get these folks released, and it did \nhappen. It is particularly of importance to me because one of the \npeople who was detained is a lady by the name of Tammi Sims. Tammi is \nfrom Joplin, MT, which is a stone's throw away from my hometown. I have \nbeen in regular contact with her family since last weekend, and they \nhave been worried sick. But now we have reason for hope. We will not be \ncelebrating, however, until Tammi is reunited and the others are \nreunited with their families here in the United States. We will \ncontinue to keep our fingers crossed, and Sharla and I will continue to \npray for Tammi and the rest of the group until they are back here on \nAmerican soil.\n  I do, however, want to take a minute to thank the consular affairs \nsection of the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria, who were so very helpful in \ngetting information about these individuals back to my office and to \nthe families of those folks. I also thank the dedicated Foreign Service \nofficers of the State Department. They do this kind of work all over \nthe world, probably every day, but it is not until one of your own is \nin need of assistance that you appreciate their work, and I do.\n  I also thank some of my other colleagues, including Senator Feingold, \nSenator Brown, who also expressed support for these folks. I thank them \nfor that. This is a good day, and hopefully those folks will be back in \ntheir home country very soon with their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                  Congratulating Dover Air Force Base\n\n  Mr. CARPER. While we are talking as in morning business, I wish to \ncontinue the detour, although I may take a little different direction.\n  As the Chair and my colleague from Montana probably know, each year \nour military bases in this country go through a competition in which \nAir Force bases are evaluated against other Air Force bases, and naval \ninstallations against other naval installations, Marine Corps against \nothers, Army installations against other Army installations.\n  For 23 years or so the Air Force has been comparing their bases in a \nfriendly competition called the Commander in Chief's Installation \nExcellence Award. During that period of time, it is my understanding \nthat no mobility command, no airlift base, if you will, such as Dover, \nhas ever been honored as the best of the best.\n  Yesterday I was visited here on Capitol Hill by COL Steve Harrison, \nwho is the active-duty wing commander for the Dover Air Force Base, and \nhe gave me this letter announcing the good news, that Dover Air Force \nBase has been selected for this high honor.\n  As an old naval flight officer, I remember often my squadrons on the \nnaval bases where I was located participating in ORI exercises, \noperational readiness exercises. This is not an ORI. This is a \ncompetition which digs in deep and looks at things other than how well \nyou fly your airplanes and meet your readiness requirements and meet \nyour mission, although that is part of it.\n  This is a competition that also involves how you care for your \npeople; what kind of workspaces do you provide for the folks who are on \nyour bases, the uniformed, nonuniformed personnel? How do you look out \nfor the families of those military personnel? How well do you think \noutside the box in trying to address the problems and challenges you \nface? What kind of commitment do you have to innovation in the delivery \nof the service you provide to support our military forces?\n  There are over 100 Air Force installations throughout this country. \nTo have been chosen as the one that is believed to be most worthy of \nreceiving this award this year is a matter of great pride, not only for \nthe men and women who wear the uniform at the base, not only for the \ncivilians who work there, and for the families, not only for the Air \nForce retirees in our State--and there are a lot of them who served at \nDover Air Force Base--not only for the folks who live in Dover, the \ncivilian population in central Delaware, this is a matter of pride for \nall of Delaware.\n  We have one active-duty installation, actually active duty and a \nreserve wing at Dover Air Force Base. We have an Air Guard installation \nup north in our State that we are very proud of. They fly C-130s. But \nthis one, Dover Air Force Base, is very special to the people in our \nState. They fly C-5 aircraft, which are among the largest aircraft in \nthe world. To be from a little State, and to be the home of one of the \nbiggest aircraft in the world, gives us bragging rights that little \nStates do not often get.\n  We have C-5B aircraft, about 18 of those at our base. We are getting \na new squadron, a squadron of brand new C-17 aircraft that will \ncomplement our C-5s. The C-5s will be modernized in the years to come.\n  Dover Air Force Base has not only wonderful people, a terrific \ntradition and reputation, but will also have the new C-17s and maybe \nthe first modernized C-5s. We will be ready to go to work and do our \njob.\n  Among the things pointed out in the recognition of Dover Air Force \nBase is\n\n[[Page S3064]]\n\nthat they have secured, I think in the last year or so, October 1, last \nfiscal year, October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007, among other \nthings, they have secured some roughly $50 million in milcon projects. \nI hope our delegation, Senator Biden, Congressman Castle and I, was \nhelpful in that process. We are grateful to our colleagues for the \nsupport of that funding.\n  During that period of time, we opened a brand new air freight \nterminal that cost, over several years, about $77.5 million. The \nefficiencies that will flow from that new cargo-handling facility will \nactually pay for that facility within 2 years. Now, whenever companies \nare looking for a way of a return on investment, the idea that you can \nget a return on investment in 5 years or maybe even 10 years is not \ndeemed very bad. We will realize a return on this investment for our \nnew cargo-handling facility, our air freight terminal, within 2 years \nof bringing it on line.\n  What we have done at the base in terms of privatizing the housing and \nproviding enlisted and officer personnel with better housing for \nthemselves and their families is something we greatly appreciate. Also, \nin the Air Force, they conduct roughly every 400 or so days an \ninspection called an isochronal inspection. The isochronal inspections \nthat are now being provided for C-5 aircraft take place not only for \nthe air mobility command C-5S but for those that are in the Air Reserve \ncomponents and the C-5s that are part of the Air National Guards are \nall done at Dover Air Force Base.\n  The good news is not only are they done at Dover, because they are \ndone at the Air Force base with people who know how to do this work, \ntrained to do it, they are able to greatly reduce the amount of time it \ntakes to produce the isochronal inspection--not to diminish the \nquality, the thoroughness of that inspection, but to reduce the time. \nSince time is money, we are saving some money there for the taxpayers.\n  Dover Air Force Base provides over one-quarter of all the Department \nof Defense airlift requirements. They have for some time. With the new \ncargo-handling facility coming on line, we expect to see that number go \nup. I understand in the last year or so, the last fiscal year, they \ncompleted more than 20 antiterrorism and force protection initiatives.\n  So to the team at Dover Air Force base that very much is a team, the \nactive-duty wing, the Reserve wing, which works seamlessly together in \nproviding airlift capabilities for our country and around the world, \nthis old naval flight officer salutes you on a job well done. On behalf \nof every single Delawarean, congratulations and God bless. Keep up the \ngreat work.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, yesterday, the Secretary of Defense \nannounced the 2008 Commander in Chief's Awards for Installation \nExcellence. These awards honor the best installation for each service. \nFor the first time in the 23-year history of the award, the Air Force \nwinner is a mobility base, Dover Air Force Base. Out of 117 Air Force \ninstallations, Dover AFB was chosen as the absolute best.\n  I cannot say that I was surprised. I believe they won because of the \ntradition of excellence imbued in each man and woman working at Dover.\n  It started in 1941, when the 112th Observation Squadron of the Ohio \nNational Guard arrived to set up antisubmarine operations at the new \nDover airfield. That mission and the others that helped America and her \nallies win World War II began an enduring tradition of excellence. In \n1948, the airfield was officially named Dover Air Force Base and the \nNation moved into its Cold War posture. Some may not know this, but for \n7 years, 1951-1958, Dover was home to fighter squadrons defending \nAmerican airspace.\n  In 1955, one of Dover's best known missions came to the base, the \nAerial Port Mortuary. For over 70 years, the Dover team has given \nfallen Americans an honorable and compassionate homecoming. While it is \nonly one mission on the base, every generation of air men and women \nstationed at Dover has taken pride in honoring America's heroes and \nensuring the grace and dignity of their return to our Nation and their \nfamilies.\n  By the late 1950s, Dover was transformed into a mobility base, under \nthe Military Air Transport Service, which became Military Airlift \nCommand, and eventually became Air Mobility Command. Since 1973, Dover \nhas been home to America's largest military transport aircraft, the C-\n5. Just last year, the Nation's second largest military transport \naircraft, the C-17, was added to the base. As home to the Nation's \ngreat airlifters, Dover has always been busy--supporting American \nforces in every military engagement from Vietnam to Grenada to Panama \nto the first gulf war to the Balkans to Afghanistan and Iraq; \nsupporting our Israeli allies with critical supplies during the Yom \nKippur War; evacuating Americans from Iran in 1978; assisting with \nclean-up from the devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill; assisting Central \nAmerican nations, Turkey, and Taiwan that have experienced devastating \nearthquakes; providing humanitarian aid around the globe after major \nnatural disasters; and supporting Presidential travel around the world. \nThis dual mission, to provide lethal force and vital humanitarian aid, \nmakes Dover critical to America's use of both hard and soft power and \nhas made it all the more important that every generation serving at \nDover carry on the tradition of excellence.\n  This year, Dover's tradition of excellence and the entire Dover team \nhave been recognized with the Commander in Chief's Award. What does it \nmean to be the best base in the Air Force? It means that the entire \nDover team has found innovative ways to make the absolute most of the \nresources they have. They have not only saved the taxpayers money, they \nhave also given the warfighter more capability.\n  They have also been unstinting in giving back to the local community \nand the larger Delaware community. The Dover team is not just the air \nmen and women serving on the base. It is also their families, civilians \nworking on base, the businesses that support base operations and life, \nthe State and local government that support base needs, and the entire \nDelaware military community working together to give the State and the \nNation the very best.\n  Let me give you some examples from the seven categories that were \nconsidered in the competition. Keep in mind that all of these \naccomplishments occurred in 1 year. They were only possible because the \npeople at Dover, despite full-time, 365/24/7 operations in support of \nIraq and Afghanistan, constantly challenged themselves to do more and \nto do it better.\n  First, improvements to the infrastructure of the base and the working \nenvironment were considered.\n  Dover opened a state-of-the-art, $77.5 million Air Freight Terminal \nthat increased cargo capacity and efficiency through Dover by 50 \npercent. The base also invested $53 million in a major runway \nimprovement project and another $3.5 million to repair 183,000 square \nfeet of taxiway, improving both the efficiency and safety of airfield \noperations. After a close analysis of their budget, the Dover team \nfound $32 million to use for base improvements, including a $5 million \nrenovation of a squadron operations building, C-5 recapitalization, and \nprojects needed for the C-17 squadron setup. Thoughtful planning \nallowed Dover to keep the bed down of a new C-17 squadron on schedule \nbecause base personnel proactively made $780,000 necessary basic \ninfrastructure improvements. In addition, they installed solar lights \non the runways and reinforced the taxiway so that C-17 aircrews could \ndo navigation training and combat off-load training.\n  Dover also improved security operations by installing over 450 \nremovable bollards on the base, including some at the gate in a ``Lazy \nS'' curve to prevent reverse entry threats. The bollard installation \nreduced the force protection squadron's time spent on contracting by 50 \npercent, freeing them for security missions. Security was further \nenhanced by the installation of a $450,000 crash-rated airfield gate, \nU.S. Transportation Command's No. 1 priority for force protection, and \nby the use of radiological detection equipment to screen over 91,000 \ntrucks in 1 year alone. This valuable equipment, valued at $150,000, \nwas obtained by base personnel at no cost. In addition, by renovating \nthe Security Forces firing range at a cost of $4.8 million, the base \nwas able to increase the range's capacity by 15 percent and save 1,000 \nmanhours per year.\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\n  Second, improvements to the quality of life on the base were \nconsidered.\n  Dover has pioneered Air Mobility Command's privatization effort for \nbase housing. Dover built 240 homes in 2007 and was named the 2007 \nOutstanding Housing Installation Team-Privatized Location for the Air \nForce. The $250 million housing project is the benchmark for the \ncommand and will ultimately increase the housing standards for 980 \nfamilies when complete in 2009. Dover's Services Squadron was \nrecognized as Air Mobility Command's 2007 Youth Program of the Year and \nthe Outdoor Recreation Program earned the Air Force's 5-Star Program \nAward. Quality of life for airmen was further enhanced by finalizing \nthe design of a $13 million, 144-room dormitory that exceeds command \nstandards and will be a model for other bases.\n  Keeping the Dover team, including families, healthy is critical to a \nhigh quality of life. Dover is the only base in the command with 100 \npercent of its pharmacy technicians nationally certified. In addition, \nthe base was first in the command and third in the Air Force for flu \nimmunization rates, at over 99 percent.\n  Third, efforts to enhance the productivity of the workforce were \nconsidered.\n  Dover has taken the lead role in reducing the time needed for \nIsochronal, ISO, inspections and, as a result, was made the regional \ncenter for all east coast C-5 Isochronal inspections in July of 2007. \nThis is the first such regional facility in the Air Force. \nHistorically, an ISO inspection took up to 38 days to complete. The \n436th Maintenance Team reviewed the entire process to increase velocity \nwhile maintaining quality. This led the team to one record-breaking \neffort in which an ISO inspection was completed in only 13.2 days. \nThese initiatives were also a key reason the 436th Maintenance Squadron \nwon the 2006 Air Force Maintenance Effectiveness Award.\n  In order to reduce the time planes are on the ground, the 436th \nMaintenance Squadron did a complete review of how they maintained \nground equipment. As a result, they were able to reduce the steps each \nmechanic takes from 763 to 73, saving 29.7 minutes per inspection, \nwhile reducing wait time by 34 minutes. They also saved 63.7 minutes \nper inspection or 26.54 manhours per year and vacated 17,660 square \nfeet of floor space to be designated for other use. The cellular work \ndesign they came up with is considered the benchmark for such designs \nin the command and is a model of how the Air Force Smart Operations for \nthe 21st century initiative and use of Lean Six Sigma, a process \nimprovement approach first used in the private sector, can make better \nuse of existing resources.\n  The Dover Operations Group improved throughput for aircraft by \ncreating the only C-5 one-stop/jet-side service system in the Air \nForce. The Required Flight Manual, Flight Information Publications, \nweapons and tools needed by an aircrew for a mission are delivered \ndirectly to the aircraft. This reduces travel time by 20 minutes, \nallowing a 12-percent reduction in the C-5 launch sequence and \nproviding more duty days for the crews to complete their missions.\n  Dover was able to reduce the amount of time needed to overhaul and \nrebuild C-5 jet engines, TF39, by 12 days, going from 75 to 63 days. \nThe process improvement also allowed two production crews to be \nreassigned to other sections, regained five critical manning positions, \nand saved 36 manpower positions and $3.8 million in operating costs. On \nthe whole, by reducing wasted motion for support equipment and tools, \nthe 436th Maintenance Group has saved 73.3 annual man-days and \nexpedited engine repairs so that they are done 5 days faster than the \noriginal standard and freeing 1,944 square feet of floor space for \nother work.\n\n  Another key initiative was the effort to ensure that Basic Post \nFlight inspections be done within 10 hours of mission completion. This \ninitiative was begun in 2005 by the Dover Maintenance Group Commander \nand brought completion time down to 6 hours, a 40-percent improvement. \nThe complete process review improved Home Station Logistics Reliability \nrate by 40 percent and overtime man hours were reduced by 75 percent. \nOverall, this means the team saved 23,000 labor-hours and $1.168 \nmillion. The mission benefits included the following: a reduced number \nof tail swaps, increased number of aircraft ready for flight, reduced \nnumber of late take-offs, and dramatically improved efficiency in the \nlaunch sequence of events.\n  The Dover team also ensured a seamless transition for the new C-17 \nsquadron, ensuring that Dover's first C-17 was able to fly its first \ncombat mission within 36 days of arrival. In the squadron's first \nmonth, they had a 100-percent on-time departure rate and a 99-percent \nmission capable rate.\n  In addition, once investigators were done with the 2007 C-5 crash \nscene, Dover personnel took the initiative to save and recover parts. \nTheir efforts ensured that 127 parts were recovered, inspected, and \nrestocked into the Air Force supply system, saving $7 million.\n  Fourth, increases in customer satisfaction or improvements in \ncustomer service were considered.\n  Today, Dover's key mission, or customer service, is to support \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Twenty-seven percent of the entire \nDepartment of Defense airlift requirement last year went from Dover. \nThe 3rd and 9th Airlift Squadrons flew more than 8,000 hours, with more \nthan 2,000 combat hours and 460 combat missions. The two squadrons \ncombined airlifted 59.4 million pounds of cargo and more than 12,000 \npassengers.\n  Dover is the second busiest en route airfield in the Department of \nDefense. It supported 3,000 en route missions in 2007 with a 95-percent \ndeparture reliability rate.\n  In addition, Dover assisted America's diplomatic efforts and the \nState Department by supporting foreign military sales to 32 countries, \nhandling 85 missions and 950 tons of cargo.\n  The Dover team also made sure that it provided the best possible \nservices to military personnel and their families on base. Access to \nmental health care was increased by 35 percent, despite a 40-percent \ndecrease in manning. This exceeded the command's goal for access by 20 \npercent. In order to keep basic operations functioning, the \nCommunications Squadron answered 99 percent of their 2,700 assistance \nrequests within 2 days. That is 4 percent better than the Air Force \nstandard.\n  In an effort to improve safety and provide instantaneous responses to \nemergencies with existing resources, the Civil Engineer Fire Department \nteamed with the Medical Group to provide 24/7 ambulance service. The \nMedical Group Airmen who provide ambulance response are now co-located \nat the emergency call center at the base Fire Department.\n\n  Fifth, efforts to encourage bottom-to-top communication and team \nproblem solving were considered.\n  Dover has been a true leader in implementing Air Force Smart \nOperations for the 21st century. The key to the success of this \ninitiative to make operations more streamlined and ``lean'' has been \nclear communication and a team approach. In recognition of this \nexcellence, Dover has hosted numerous training sessions for units from \nfive major commands, Air Force senior leaders, and for the Royal Air \nForce. Dover instructors have trained 4,200 students in Basic Lean \nAwareness including a program at the First Term Airmen Center.\n  Dover is the first base in the command to have two fully qualified \nlevel-2 facilitators. These facilitators certified seven level-1 \nfacilitators and trained another 20 level-1 students. They have \nsuccessfully made operations more efficient in over 50 areas in just 1 \nyear. In addition, Dover's trainers ensured that 210 future Ramstein \nAir Force Base and Charleston Air Force Base facilitators understood \nthe basics of lean initiatives. These efforts won the Dover team praise \nfrom the Logistics Director at Air Mobility Command Headquarters.\n  Sixth, the promotion of unit cohesiveness and the recognition of \noutstanding individual effort was considered.\n  The Dover team won two Department of Defense, one Secretary of the \nAir Force, 12 Air Force, and 93 Air Mobility Command Awards in 2006. In \naddition, they won the 2007 U.S. Small Business Administration Award \nfor the State of Delaware. One critical example of why these awards \nwere won is in antiterrorism, where they won command honors for the \nninth consecutive year for best\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\nantiterrorism and force protection programs. Dover was able to obtain \n$1.2 million in Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiative Funds that it \nused to resolve installation vulnerabilities, resulting in winning the \nDepartment of Defense's Best Antiterrorism Operational Unit in 2006 and \nthe Department of Defense's Best Antiterrorism Program Manager Awards \nfor 2007. The Dover team won these awards by completing over 20 \nantiterrorism and force protection initiatives that created a hard \ntarget security signature. These efforts paid off by deterring Fort Dix \nterrorists from attacking Dover AFB. This event permeated Air Force \nculture and is commonly referred to as the ``Dover Effect.''\n  Seventh, the promotion of energy conservation and environmental \nsafety, including compliance, remediation, and stewardship, was \nconsidered.\n  The maintenance squadron at Dover was able to dramatically improve \nthe process for cleaning ground equipment while also making it more \nenvironmentally sound. Formerly all ground equipment had to be moved to \na separate wash facility primarily used for aircraft. Through careful \nresearch, a completely self-contained wash system with zero \nenvironmental impact was selected, designed, and installed in the \nground equipment facility. This decreased travel time from 190 hours to \n12 hours a year, a 94-percent savings. This increased the capability \nand availability for ground equipment, alleviated contractual issues \nthat had arisen with the old cleaning system, and reduced the chance \nfor aircraft delays. The new process is environmentally friendly and \ncaptures, filters, and recycles all waste water.\n  Dover also received the 2006 Secretary of Defense Environmental \nRestoration Award for Best Environmental Restoration Program for its \nrestoration of natural resources used to support the base's warfighting \nmission. Dover reached the Defense Department's environmental goals 4 \nto 8 years ahead of schedule. Activities at Dover Air Force Base which \nearned this award include, but are not limited to: obtaining regulator \nsignatures on six Records of Decision for 39 sites in 6 months; \nachieving Response Complete status at 27 of Dover's 59 sites; opening \nup 54 acres of formerly restricted land for use in supporting the \nbase's mission; and completing Remedial Designs and Work Plans for 17 \nsites in only 3 months.\n  In addition, Dover won the 2006 Air Force General Thomas D. White \nEnvironmental Award which recognizes the efforts of installations and \nindividuals to improve environmental quality, restoration, pollution \nprevention, recycling, and conservation of natural and cultural \nresources. Dover is 6 years ahead of schedule in its environmental \nremediation program.\n  These are the areas that the selection committee looked at when it \ndecided which base was the best in the Air Force this past year. It is \nobvious that in every area, the Dover team took seriously the challenge \nto improve base operations and the quality of life wherever possible. \nFrom the smallest process improvements to the largest investments in \ncritical infrastructure, Dover personnel found ways to do more. The \nresult is not just that they upheld the base's long tradition of \nexcellence, they surpassed it. In so doing, they have truly given our \nNation their best and have made me and every Delawarean proud. We have \nalways known Dover is the best in the Air Force. It is time the rest of \nthe Nation knew about your excellence.\n  Congratulations, Dover Air Force Base!\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Firefighters Killed in Colorado\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I come to speak in regard to three firefighters killed \nin the State of Colorado in the last day and a half. These three \nfirefighters are part of the legion of first responders who make sure \nthey are keeping us safe day in and day out. In Colorado, in the last \nday we have had three significant fires that have broken out: one in \nCrowley County, one in El Paso County in Fort Carson, and a third in \nGarfield and Pitkin Counties in Carbondale.\n  The fire in Crowley County, we had two volunteer firefighters who \ngave their lives fighting that fire. They are John Schwartz and Terry \nDeVore. To them, their families, we appreciate their sacrifice, serving \nas first responders often do, putting their lives on the line to make \nsure communities are protected.\n  In the case of Gert Marais, who was fighting the fire at Fort Carson \nand whose plane crashed while he was fighting the fire, to his family \nwe also send our condolences and appreciation.\n  These are unusual fires for us in Colorado. Usually we get to fire \nseason during the dry times of July and August, September and October. \nThis year in particular we have had moisture that is on average about \n200 percent over a normal year in all of our southern river basins, \nwhich is seemingly unprecedented. But the fires have been driven by \nhigh winds, and the damage has been significant.\n  In Ordway in Crowley County, a rural and remote part of our State, \nmuch of the town of Ordway has been devastated; 1,100 people who live \nin the town had to be evacuated because of the fire. I have been in \nCrowley County and Ordway many times in my public life. It is one of \nthose counties in Colorado which is part of that forgotten America. It \nis rural and very remote. Thousands upon thousands of acres of land \nwithin Crowley County have been dried up as the water that irrigated \nthose fields has been taken to so-called higher economic uses of the \ncity, the cities of Pueblo, and Colorado Springs, and the Denver \nmetropolitan area.\n  It is this fire that caused extensive damage to the town of Ordway \nand has also created the devastation.\n  I am certain the 1,100 citizens of Ordway, as devastated as they are \nin the aftermath of the fire, are also very rich and powerful in \nspirit. With that power of spirit, they will rebuild the town and the \ncommunity. I will be there, along with my colleagues, to do everything \nwe can to help them rebuild.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Governor Ritter and the Federal agencies \nthat have been so responsive to the issues created by these fires in \nColorado.\n\n\n                         Visit of Pope Benedict\n\n  I also rise to speak concerning the Pope's visit to America. This \nmorning, along with many of my colleagues in the Senate, I participated \nin greeting the Pope upon his arrival at the White House with President \nand Mrs. Bush.\n  It is a momentous occasion for all of us who come from a Roman \nCatholic tradition to have Pope Benedict visit America. It is our hope \nthat as he comes to Washington and then goes to New York and visits \nGround Zero and also addresses the United Nations, one of the things \nthe Pope will do is to talk about what he is here to do, and that is to \ntalk about how it is that we are one global community. As we deal with \nthe issues that confront our world today, whether they relate to \nterrorism or poverty, disease or the issue of global climate change, at \nthe end of the day it is important to recognize that the hope and \noptimism of humanity is bound up in how we work together as one people. \nIt is a message of hope and optimism.\n  We have looked forward to his visit to America and to the inspiration \nthat he will give to 300 million Americans, as well as the over 50 \nmillion Catholics we have in the United States.\n  Some years ago, in 1993 and 1994, we prepared for and held World \nYouth Day where Pope John Paul II came to the United States and visited \nmany of us in Colorado. He had a mass at Cherry Creek State Park which \nwas attended by over 500,000 young Americans from throughout the United \nStates as well as the world. It was a celebration of World Youth Day in \nDenver. It was characterized as one of the most peaceful gatherings of \na crowd that size in the history of the State, a crowd that size, in \nterms of the peacefulness of it, probably in the United States. It left \na legacy not only in Colorado but across the United States and the \nworld about the hope and optimism that we see in America and in the \nworld, so much of it through the eyes of our young people.\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\n  Today, for me, as I greeted the Pope in Washington, DC, at the White \nHouse, I was reminded about the hope and optimism which is part of the \nlegacy John Paul II left when he came to visit in Colorado now some 15 \nyears ago.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the majority leader will be coming out \nshortly to let Members know what is happening. But I can tell everybody \nthat this bill is being slow walked. This is a simple bill. This is a \nmini-economic stimulus bill. It would release $1 billion of highway \ntrust fund moneys to build roads, to fix bridges, to run transit \nsystems, and it got caught up in Presidential politics, \ninvestigations--everything you can think of--while the people wonder \nwhat we are doing.\n  This bill, simple as it is, would create about 50,000 new jobs at a \ntime when we know--it is worse than a middle-class squeeze. It is \nreally a middle-class struggle that is going on, and people are \nworried. They are worried about their homes, they are worried about \neverything, and this bill will create jobs.\n  So what we have is a classical slowdown, with Presidential politics \nbeing involved dealing with the gas tax that funds the highway trust \nfund. That is fine, but just let everybody know from where it is \ncoming. The only amendments to this bill--the only amendments--come \nfrom the Republican side. I offered one as a side-by-side to Senator \nCoburn's, which I think is a good amendment. My amendment will not \nbring down this bill. Others will.\n  Here is where we are. We have a simple bill. It passed a year ago in \nthe House. It passed, I believe it was June of 2007, under the \nleadership of Senator Inhofe. Actually, it was under my leadership but \nwith the work of Senator Inhofe, both of us working together, \nbipartisan, bicameral.\n  I want to show you, Mr. President, who is strongly supporting this \nbill: the American Association of Highway and Transportation Officials, \nthat is departments of transportation officials of all 50 States; the \nAmerican Highway Users Alliance, millions of highway users throughout \nthe country; the American Public Transit Association, transit systems \nfrom across the country; the American Road and Transportation Builders \nAssociations, more than 5,000 members of the transportation \nconstruction industry; Associated General Contractors, more than 32,000 \ncontractors, service providers, and suppliers; the Council of \nUniversity Transportation Centers, more than 30 university \ntransportation centers from across the country; the National Stone, \nSand and Gravel Association, companies producing more than 92 percent \nof crushed stone and 75 percent of sand and gravel used in the U.S. \nannually; the National Asphalt and Pavement Association, more than \n1,100 companies that produce and pave with asphalt.\n  These are real people who are willing, ready, and able to build and \nrebuild our infrastructure, to build and rebuild our transit systems. \nThis bill is a no brainer. Instead, it is caught up in all of these \nnegotiations right now. Whether we vote tonight or not, we are going to \nfind out soon enough from Senator Reid. But, Mr. President, let me say \nto my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Senator Inhofe and I \nreally wanted to get them a good bill. Senator Inhofe and I really \nwanted to get this work done quickly. We did all our homework. We put \neverybody's name on the Web site, so we complied with the new ethical \nrules. Senator DeMint said he was very pleased with the standard we set \nfor transparency.\n  These projects are ready to go. They are ready to go in Brooklyn, \nthey are ready to go in Manhattan, they are ready to go in San \nFrancisco, they are ready to go in Atlanta, and they are ready to go in \nOklahoma. They are ready to go in every State of the Union. I say to \nall these good people who told us how much they want this bill to move: \nPlease contact the Republican leadership and tell them to play \nPresidential politics another day with amendments that are not germane, \nwith amendments that don't belong on this bill. Today pass this \nlegislation.\n  There is too much talk around here and not enough action. We passed a \nstimulus bill. We did it in a bipartisan way, but we all know there is \nmore to be done. This little bill will create tens of thousands of \ngood-paying jobs in America, doing something that has to be done. But, \nno, we cannot finish it. We had one vote so far on an amendment by \nSenator DeMint. We defeated it, which was important because it was a \nkiller amendment. It says to me people want this bill.\n  This is the status. We are waiting for some type of agreement. This \nwhole thing is being slow walked. We look forward to hearing from the \nmajority leader as to whether there will be any more votes this \nevening. But as far as this Senator is concerned--I know I speak for \nSenator Inhofe--we want to get this bill done. But people are slow \nwalking this bill. We are going to do our best to see if we can get \nthis logjam stopped. But at this point, we have not been able to do it.\n  Tens of thousands of jobs are in jeopardy, and 500 various transit \nprojects already paid for are in jeopardy. What a shame we cannot go \nforward. What a shame we are in another slowdown by my friends from the \nother side of the aisle. It is very discouraging.\n  Again, as the eternal optimist, I will return to this place tonight, \nif we can continue working, or tomorrow after we come in after we pay \nour respects to the Pope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3067-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

Madam President, there has been a lot of controversy in \nthe last couple of weeks about the President's sending the Colombia so-\ncalled free trade agreement to the House of Representatives. Under this \nunusual law, there is something called fast track procedure. Fast track \nprocedure--this is a lot of inside baseball--changes the way we do \nbusiness in the House and Senate. Trade law is the only issue that \nchanges the way that we do business. On no other issue that comes in \nfront of the House and Senate, except the budget, are there limits on \namendments, are there limits on required up-or-down votes, timetables--\nall of that. The Senate rules do not apply on that legislation. It is \nthe only time--in part because of who has written trade policy in this \ncountry in the last 20 years.\n  We have seen trade agreements that always look out for the interests \nof the drug industry, look out for the interests of the insurance \nindustry, of banking interests, of energy interests. But we have not \nseen trade policy written in this country, negotiated by the President \nof the United States, the U.S. Trade Representative, that has shown any \nof the same concern for workers, for the environment, for food safety, \nfor the safety of consumer products. That is why we have seen what \nhappened with all the toys that came into this country from China. It \nshould not have been a surprise to us that at Eastertime, that at \nChristmas, that at Halloween last year, that consumer products, \nespecially toys for small children, came into this country that were \ndangerous. It should not have surprised us because it was somewhat \ninevitable because of the way we do trade policy in this country.\n  Professor Jeff Weidenheimer, a professor of chemistry at Ashland \nUniversity, about 10 miles from where I grew up in north central Ohio, \ntook his class to test children's toys last fall at Halloween and then \ndid it again at Christmas and did it again at Easter. In case after \ncase, they would go to a toy store\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\nor a discount store and they would buy a bunch of toys, very \ninexpensive toys, and they would test them for lead. Every one of these \nbatches of toys had significant numbers of toys that had lead content--\nlead in the paint that covered these toys--lead content way above on \naverage what is considered safe. What is considered safe is about 600 \nparts per million. These were, in some cases, thousands of parts per \nmillion.\n  What should not surprise us about that is the way we set up trade \npolicy in this country. We don't write trade policy to protect our \nchildren or to protect our communities or to protect our workers. We \ndon't write trade policy to protect our food supply. We write long \ntrade agreements--this isn't one, but I have to gather these papers to \nshow how long they are. We pass trade policies that are this long. If \nwe wanted to eliminate tariffs, we would pass trade policies that are \nthis long. You could write a schedule of eliminating tariffs in the \nColombian free trade agreement of 2 or 3 pages. Instead, we write \nagreements that are hundreds, if not in some cases over a thousand \npages, because they are full of protections--not for workers, not for \ncommunities, not for children, not for our kitchen tables, our \nfamilies--but these are trade policies that are chock-full of \nprotections for the drug industry, the insurance industry, the oil \ncompanies, the banks. That is what our trade policy is all about. That \nis why.\n  Go back to Jeff Weidenheimer's class at Ashland University and look \nwhat happened. American companies decide they are going to shut down in \nthis country because they would rather pay Chinese workers low wages \nand not have environmental laws and not have worker safety laws and not \nhave to worry about consumer protection laws, so they shut down plants \nsuch as Huffy Bicycle in Sidney, OH, and they move to China where it is \na whole lot cheaper. You don't have to worry about treating Chinese \nworkers well because they are disposable. They did have to worry about \ntreating American workers well, frankly, because many of them were \nunion, and even if they were not, we have consumer protection laws, \nsafe drinking water, clean air, environmental laws--all of those kinds \nof things. So these companies in Ohio and in the State of Washington \nwhere the Presiding Officer is from, all over our country, these \ncompanies shut down and they move to China.\n  A company such as Hasbro, a toy manufacturer, moves their production \nto China. Hasbro then subcontracts with a Chinese company, they \nsubcontract their work. They go to a country, China, that does not have \nthe same environmental safety, worker safety, consumer safety, and \nwages we have in this country, and then they deal with Chinese \ncontractors and they push those Chinese contractors to cut costs: You \nhave to cut costs; you have to cut costs. Every year they cut costs \nover the year before, because that is good business. These American \ncompanies, when they outsource their jobs to China, force those Chinese \ncontractors to cut costs.\n  Do you know what happens? They use lead-based paints. Do you know \nwhy? Because lead-based paint is cheaper to apply, it is cheaper to \nbuy, it dries faster. These toys, then, all of a sudden, instead of \nhaving a coating that is safe for little children instead now have a \ncoating that has lead base in them, making them dangerous to children. \nBut they do that because these American companies are pushing these \nsubcontractors to cut costs.\n\n  Forgetting for a moment--because these American companies don't seem \nmuch to care and the Chinese contractors don't seem to care much--\nforgetting for a moment these people in China are working in these \nfactories and are probably ingesting all kinds of toxic lead \nthemselves--forget that for a moment, as bad as that is. These toys \nthen come back to the United States. Do you know what the Bush \nadministration did? The Bush administration has weakened consumer \nprotection laws and cut the number of inspectors so these products come \nthrough the American regulatory system that used to be the best \nregulatory system, the best consumer product safety system in the \nworld, the best Food and Drug Administration system in the world--\nagencies that protected consumer products, about toys, especially--and \nagencies that protected food products that came into this country. And \nwhat do we end up with? We end up with toxic toys coming to our \nchildren's bedrooms, we end up with contaminated vitamins and other \ncontaminated food coming into our kitchens. That is the result of \nAmerican trade policy. It doesn't look out for our families, it doesn't \nlook out for our children, it doesn't look out for our workers, it \ndoesn't look out for our communities. Instead, it looks out for the \ndrug companies, it looks out for the big toy manufacturers, it looks \nout for the big insurance companies, it looks out for the banks, it \nlooks out for the oil industry. That is what is wrong with our trade \npolicy.\n  President Bush's answer is let's send another free trade agreement to \nthe Senate, to the House of Representatives, the Colombia free trade \nagreement. It is more of the same. It will not work.\n  The last point, Madam President, and I think we are pretty ready to \nadjourn for the night. When I came to Congress--I was elected the same \nyear the Presiding Officer was elected, 1992--we had a $38 billion \ntrade deficit. That means our country bought $38 billion more than our \ncountry sold to other countries around the world. Today, that trade \ndeficit exceeds $800 billion--from $38 billion to $800 billion in a \ndecade and a half. President Bush the First said for every $1 billion \ntrade surplus or trade deficit, it amounted to 13,000 jobs. That means \nif we had a $1 billion trade surplus, if we were selling more than we \nwere bringing in, it meant 13,000 net gain of jobs in country. If we \nhad a $1 billion trade deficit, it meant we bought $1 billion more than \nwe sold, we had a 13,000 jobs net loss. We have an $800 billion plus \ntrade deficit. Do the math. Think about that.\n  As we adjourn for the evening, think about what this trade policy is \ndoing. It continues to fail the American people, continues to fail our \ncommunities, and it kind of begs the issue about which Albert Einstein \nonce said: The definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and \nover and expect a different result.\n  We are getting the same result. It hurts our communities, it doesn't \nprotect our families--consumer protection and food safety and all of \nthat. These trade agreements are a bad idea. We can fix them. I, like \nSenator Dorgan, who has spoken on the floor many times about this, want \nmore trade. We want plenty of trade. We just want it under a very \ndifferent set of rules, rules that protect our families, protect our \ncommunities, that protect our workers--not just protecting the drug \nindustry and the oil industry and the energy companies and those toy \nmanufacturers that sort of forget about the safety of our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3068-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3068-S3070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Madam President, I rise today to honor \nNebraska Army National Guard Sergeant Heather Springer, in recognition \nof receiving the Army Veterans' Association Medic of the Year award and \nthe Bronze Star Medal for Valor.\n  Sergeant Springer is a native of Lincoln, NE, and currently attends \nthe University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Nursing. She \njoined the Nebraska Army National Guard on April, 8, 2004, and served \nwith the 313th Ground Ambulance and 110th Medical Battalion. On March \n1, 2006, Sergeant Springer transferred to Charlie Company 2-135 General \nSupport Aviation Battalion, 36th Combat Brigade, to become a flight \nmedic. Soon after, she was deployed to Iraq in Diyala Province in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  On July 15, 2007, Sergeant Springer was transported to a landing zone \nwhere several U.S. soldiers had been struck by a roadside bomb. While \nconducting treatment for a critically injured soldier, her team \nsuddenly came under enemy fire. She immediately secured the wounded \nsoldier she was attending to and then moved 10 meters to a second \nwounded soldier, willingly exposing herself to open fire. During this \nhostile situation, Sergeant Springer remained composed and demonstrated \nassertive judgment by concluding that the wounds sustained by the first \nsoldier were more critical. She determinedly led part of her team \nthrough 60 meters of open road, completely susceptible to enemy fire, \nto secure the soldier inside a Black Hawk helicopter. Once inside the \nhelicopter, Sergeant Springer noticed that the second wounded soldier \nshe had attended to was being moved towards the helicopter, and \ninstantly moved to help safely transport the soldier aboard the \naircraft.\n  Sergeant Springer displayed remarkable courage and selflessness while \nplacing her own life at risk. These two wounded warriors are alive \ntoday as a direct result of her steadfastness and superb medical \nskills. The DUSTOFF--Dedicated Unhesitating Service to Our Fighting \nForces--Association recently awarded her the DUSTOFF Medic of the Year \naward. The DUSTOFF Association is a nonprofit organization for the Army \nMedical Department's enlisted and officer personnel, aviation crew \nmembers, and others who have actively supported Army aeromedical \nevacuation programs in war or in peacetime.\n  Sergeant Heather Springer's admirable performance in Iraq led her to \nbecome the second woman in Nebraska National Guard history to receive \nthe Bronze Star Medal for Valor. I wish Sergeant Springer all the best \nas she pursues her education in nursing school, and join all Nebraskans \nin honoring the heroism of this exceptional soldier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3070-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF VIRGINIA TECH TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Madam President, Senate Democrats have worked hard to make \nprogress on judicial nominations. That hard work has paid off, with \ncircuit court vacancies at less than half of what they were when \nPresident Clinton left office. The majority leader last week was right \nto call the Republican complaints chutzpah.\n  Yesterday, the Michigan Senators and I were able to overcome a long \nimpasse lasting more than a decade over vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. \nI have long urged the President to work with the Michigan Senators, \nand, after 7 years, he finally has. With his nomination of Judge Helene \nWhite of Michigan, we have a significant development that can lead to \nfilling the last two vacancies on the Sixth Circuit before this year \nends.\n  Our actions in resolving this impasse stands is sharp contrast to \naction of Senate Republicans who refused to consider any nomination to \nthe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the last 3 years of the Clinton \nadministration, leaving open four vacancies. Thanks to the hard work of \nSenator Levin and Senator Stabenow, we are now poised to fill them all.\n  Judge White was initially nominated 11 years ago, but her nomination \nwas 1 of the more than 60 judicial nominees the Republicans pocket \nfilibustered. After literally years of work, her renomination yesterday \nallows us to move forward with the support of the Senators from \nMichigan. I plan to consider the Sixth Circuit nominations as quickly \nas possible.\n  We are also poised to make progress to end a long impasse on the \nFourth Circuit with the pending nomination of Steve Agee of Virginia. \nAfter insisting on nominating a series of contentious and time-\nconsuming choices such as Jim Haynes, Claude Allen and Duncan Getchell, \na nomination that was not supported by either the Republican Senator or \nthe Democratic Senator from Virginia, the President this year has \nfinally chosen to work with Senator Warner and Senator Webb. I have \nalready said that I expect to hold the confirmation hearing on the Agee \nnomination as soon as the paperwork is completed. If we are able to \nconfirm Steve Agee, there will be fewer Fourth Circuit vacancies than \nthere were at the end of the Clinton administration.\n  Just last week, on a day when the Republicans chose to ignore the \npressing problems affecting the lives of the American people and vent \nover judicial nominations, the Senate proceeded on schedule to confirm \nanother five lifetime judicial appointments, including that of \nCatharina Haynes to fill the last vacancy on the Fifth Circuit. Similar \nto yesterday's progress with nominations to the Sixth Circuit, this \nstands in marked contrast to consideration of nominations to that court \nduring the Clinton administration. At that time, the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate refused to consider nominees for the last 4 years \nof the Clinton administration, while the Chief Judge of the Fifth \nCircuit declared a circuit-wide emergency. Today, there are no \nvacancies on the Fifth Circuit.\n\n  I have said for 8 years that if the President is willing to work with \nus and consult in the constitutionally mandated process of advice and \nconsent, we can make significant progress. When he does so, as he has \nrecently with respect to Virginia and now Michigan, I have commended \nhim. I do so again today.\n  It has taken years. It has taken effort. It has taken the \nsteadfastness of Senators Levin and Stabenow. Today we can all take \nheart that we have broken through a decade's old impasse. Others have \ntried but been unsuccessful. I know that Senator Hatch tried and \nSenator Specter tried. We are succeeding. We are succeeding because we\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\nhave not been distracted by politically driven fights but stayed focus \non making real progress. Even now, while others insist on fussing and \nfighting, I am working to continue to make progress where we can.\n  We have already cut the circuit court vacancies more than in half. \nToday circuit court vacancies stand at 12, the lowest number of such \njudicial vacancies in more than a decade, indeed since the Republican \neffort to stall President Clinton's nominees and increase circuit court \nvacancies. By the end of President Clinton's administration, the \nRepublican majority in the Senate had expanded those vacancies from 12 \nto 26. When I began the consideration of President Bush's nominees in \nthe summer of 2001, circuit court vacancies stood at 32 and overall \nvacancies topped 110. Yet we get no credit or even acknowledgement from \nthe Republican side of the aisle for all our efforts and \naccomplishments in cutting those vacancies. In fact, we are being \npenalized for doing a good job early and not following their pattern of \nbuilding up massive vacancies before allowing nominations to proceed.\n  While I continue to process nominations in the last year of this \nPresident's term, we have already lowered the vacancies in the Second \nCircuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, the \nNinth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, the DC Circuit, \nand the Federal Circuit. Both the Second and Fifth Circuits had \ncircuit-wide emergencies due to the multiple simultaneous vacancies \nduring the Clinton years with Republicans in control of the Senate, \nsome numbering as high as five. Both the Second Circuit and the Fifth \nCircuit now are without a single vacancy after last week's confirmation \nof Judge Catharina Haynes. Circuits with no vacancies also include the \nSeventh Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit, the Eleventh \nCircuit and the Federal Circuit. That is five circuits without a single \nvacancy due to our efforts. Indeed, the only circuit that has more \nvacancies than it did at the end of the Clinton administration is the \nFirst Circuit, which has gone from no vacancies to one. The other three \ncircuits, the Third, the Fourth and the Seventh have the same number of \nvacancies today that they had at the end of the Clinton administration. \nWhen we take action on the Agee nomination from the Fourth Circuit, \neven that circuit will be in an improved posture.\n  I am trying to make significant progress. I have made sure that we \ndid not act as Republicans did during the Clinton administration when \nthey pocket filibustered more than 60 judicial nominations and voted \nlock step against the confirmation of Ronnie White. I am also mindful \nthat their bad behavior not simply be forgotten, and thereby rewarded. \nThey have yet to acknowledge responsibility and accept any \naccountability for their actions. We have not engaged in a tit-for-tat. \nRather, by cutting the vacancies as we have, we have taken a giant step \ntoward resolving these problems, just as we are now on course to \nresolve the longstanding impasse in the Sixth Circuit. We have acted \nmore fairly. I hope to be able to complete the restoration of the \nconfirmation process during the next President's administration. We \nwill then have overcome years of partisan rancor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3071-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  Early in the morning of September 9, 2007, a gay man was walking home \nwhen he was attacked near the Georgetown University campus. According \nto the victim, two men at a college party began following him while \nyelling homophobic slurs. As the victim turned a corner, one of the men \nbegan punching him in the head, resulting in cuts and bruises to his \nface, and a broken thumb. The victim immediately reported the incident \nto the Georgetown campus police. The attack was investigated as a bias-\nrelated crime based on the victim's sexual orientation and the \ncircumstances of the attack. However, the Washington, DC, Metropolitan \nPolice Department has charged Philip Cooney, a 19-year-old Georgetown \nsophomore, with simple assault.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3071-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3071-S3073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FOREIGN POLICY VISION\n\n  Mr. CARPER.

The physical security of our children. \n     The retirement security of our parents. The economic and \n     health security of our families. And, above all else, the \n     national security of our country, which is a President's \n     first responsibility.\n       I start from a simple premise: we cannot afford another \n     four years of Republican stewardship of our nation's \n     security.\n       After eight years of the Bush Administration, our country \n     is less secure and more isolated than it has been at any time \n     in recent history. This administration has dug America into a \n     very deep hole--with very few friends to help us climb out.\n       It doesn't have to be this way. The next President will \n     have an awesome responsibility--but also the greatest \n     opportunity since FDR--to change the direction of our \n     country* * * and the world.\n       It starts with a much clearer understanding of how the \n     world has changed over the past two decades. As Yeats wrote \n     in ``Easter 1916,'' our world has ``changed utterly, a \n     terrible beauty has been born.''\n       The emergence of China and India as major economic powers. \n     The resurgence of Russia floating on a sea of oil. A unifying \n     Europe. The spread of dangerous weapons and lethal diseases. \n     The shortage of secure sources of energy, water and even \n     food. The impact of climate change. Rising wealth and \n     persistent poverty. A technological revolution that sends \n     people, ideas and money hurtling around the planet at ever \n     faster speeds. The challenge to nation states from ethnic and \n     sectarian strife. The struggle between modernity and \n     extremism.\n       That's a short list of the forces shaping the 21st century. \n     No one country can control these forces, but more than any \n     other country, we have an ability to affect them--if we use \n     the totality of our strength.\n       Our military might and economic resources are necessary but \n     not sufficient to lead us into this new century. It is our \n     ideas and ideals that will allow us to exert the kind of \n     leadership that persuades others to follow and to deal \n     effectively with these forces of change.\n       Over the next few months, I'll speak in detail about how \n     Democrats will exert that kind of leadership.\n       For today, I want to concentrate on this administration. It \n     has squandered our ability to shape this new world. It has \n     put virtually all of these issues on the back burner, failing \n     to devote the intellectual capital and constant effort they \n     require. It has destroyed faith in America's judgment. And it \n     has devalued America's moral leadership in the world.\n       Instead, this administration has focused to the point of \n     obsession on the so-called ``war on terrorism'' and produced \n     a one-size-fits-all doctrine of military preemption and \n     regime change ill suited to the challenges we face.\n       It has made fear the main driver of our foreign policy. It \n     has turned a deadly serious but manageable threat--a small \n     number of radical groups that hate America--into a ten-foot \n     tall existential monster that dictates nearly every move we \n     make.\n       Even if you look at the world through this administration's \n     distorted lens, you see a failed policy. This failure flows \n     from a dangerous combination of ideology and incompetence and \n     a profound confusion about whom we're fighting.\n       It starts with the very language the President has tried to \n     impose: ``the global war on\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\n     terror.'' That is simply wrong. Terrorism is a means, not an \n     end, and very different groups and countries are using it \n     toward very different goals. If we can't even identify the \n     enemy or describe the war we're fighting, it's difficult to \n     see how we will win.\n       The most urgent threat is the intersection of the world's \n     most radical groups--like Al Qaeda--with the world's most \n     lethal weapons.\n       But we also must confront groups that use terror not to \n     target us directly, but to advance their own nationalistic \n     causes. We must deal with outlaw states that support them and \n     otherwise flout the rules. We must face a civil war in Iraq, \n     a renewed war for Afghanistan, and an ideological war for the \n     future of Pakistan. We must help resolve a historic conflict \n     between Arabs and Israelis.\n       And we must contend with Iran, especially its efforts to \n     acquire the capacity to build a nuclear weapon.\n       This administration spent five years fixated on changing \n     the Iranian regime. No one likes the regime, but think about \n     the logic: renounce the bomb--and when you do, we're still \n     going to take you down. The result is that Iran \n     accelerated its efforts to produce fissile material and is \n     closer now to the bomb than when Bush took office.\n       Instead of regime change, we should focus on conduct \n     change. We should make it very clear to Iran what it risks in \n     terms of isolation if it continues to pursue a dangerous \n     nuclear program but also what it stands to gain if it does \n     the right thing.\n       That will require keeping our allies in Europe, as well as \n     Russia and China, on the same page as we ratchet up pressure. \n     But it also means doing much more to reach out to Iran--\n     including through direct talks--to exploit cracks within the \n     ruling elite and between Iran's rulers and its people, who \n     are struggling economically and stifled politically. The \n     Iranian people need to know that their government, not the \n     United States, is choosing confrontation over cooperation.\n       Saber rattling is the most self-defeating policy \n     imaginable. It forces Iranians who despise the regime to \n     rally behind their leaders and spurs instability in the \n     Middle East, which adds to the price of oil, with the \n     proceeds going right into Tehran's pockets. The worst \n     nightmare for a regime that thrives on isolation and tension \n     is an America ready, willing and able to engage. It's amazing \n     how little faith this administration has in the power of \n     America's ideas and ideals.\n       All these fronts throughout the Middle East and South Asia \n     are connected. But this administration has wrongly conflated \n     them under one label, and argued that success on one front \n     ensures victory on the others. It has lumped together, as a \n     single threat, extremist groups and states more at odds with \n     each other than with us. It has picked the wrong fights at \n     the wrong time, failing to finish a war of necessity in \n     Afghanistan before starting a war of choice in Iraq.\n       The result is that, to quote the findings of the most \n     recent National Intelligence Estimate on the Terrorist \n     Threat: ``Al Qaeda is better positioned to strike the West . \n     . . [it has] regenerated . . . and remains determined to \n     attack us at home.''\n       Of course, we must destroy Al Qaeda.\n       But instead of rolling back the threat it poses, this \n     administration's approach has helped produce a global \n     breakout of extremism, which now threatens more people in \n     more places than it did before 9-11.\n       So even on its own terms, the national security strategy of \n     this administration has been a failure. We cannot afford four \n     more years.\n       Last month, a man I greatly admire and consider a friend, \n     Senator John McCain, set out his vision for our foreign \n     policy.\n       To his credit, John repudiates some of the Bush \n     Administration's approach to the world. He recognizes that \n     the power of our example is as important as the example of \n     our power . . . that allies we respect, not disdain, can \n     advance our interests. He is especially eloquent about his \n     abhorrence for war--as John is uniquely placed to be.\n       But John McCain remains wedded to the Bush Administration's \n     myopic view of a world defined by terrorism. He would \n     continue to allow a tiny minority to set the agenda for the \n     overwhelming majority.\n       It is time for a total change in Washington's world view. \n     That will require more than a great soldier. It will require \n     a wise leader.\n       Nowhere is this truer than in Iraq. The war dominates our \n     national life. It stands like a boulder in the road between \n     us and the credibility we need to lead in the world and the \n     flexibility we require to meet our challenges at home.\n       When it comes to Iraq, there is no daylight between John \n     McCain and George W. Bush. They are joined at the hip.\n       When it comes to Iraq, there will be no change with a \n     McCain administration . . . and so there is a real and \n     profound choice for Americans in November.\n       Like President Bush, Senator McCain likes to talk about the \n     dire consequences of drawing down our forces in Iraq. He \n     argues that Iraq is the meeting point for two of the greatest \n     threats to America: Al Qaeda and Iran. It's an argument laden \n     with irony. After all, who opened Iraq's door to Al Qaeda and \n     Iran? The Bush Administration.\n       ``Al Qaeda in Iraq'' is a Bush-fulfilling prophecy: it \n     wasn't there before the war, but it is there now. As to Iran, \n     its influence in Iraq went from zero to sixty when we toppled \n     Saddam's Sunni regime and gave Shi'ite religious parties \n     inspired and nurtured by Iran a path to power.\n       No matter how we got to this point, President Bush and \n     Senator McCain argue that if we start to leave, it will \n     further empower Al Qaeda and Iran.\n       I believe they are exactly wrong. And so do a large number \n     of very prominent retired military and national security \n     experts who testified before the Foreign Relations Committee \n     this month.\n       Would drawing down really strengthen ``Al Qaeda in Iraq'' \n     and give it a launching pad to attack America? Or would it \n     help eliminate what little indigenous Iraqi support ``Al \n     Qaeda in Iraq'' retains?\n       Most Sunni Arabs have turned on ``Al Qaeda in Iraq,'' \n     alienated by their tactics and ideology. ``Al Qaeda in Iraq'' \n     is down to about 2,000 Iraqis and a small number of \n     foreigners whose almost exclusive focus is Iraq. When we draw \n     down, the most likely result is that Iraqis of all \n     confessions will stamp out its remnants--and we can retain a \n     residual force in or near Iraq to help them finish the job.\n       Last week, I asked our ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, to \n     tell us where al Qaeda poses a greater threat to America's \n     security: in Iraq, or in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He said: \n     Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n       So what about Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan--the \n     people who actually attacked us on 9-11? If we draw down, \n     would they be emboldened?\n       Or, to paraphrase the National Intelligence Estimate on \n     Terrorism, would they lose one of their most effective \n     recruiting tools--the notion that we're in Iraq to stay, with \n     permanent military bases and control over the oil? And would \n     they finally risk the full measure of America's might?\n       Senator McCain has taken a lot of heat for saying he would \n     not mind if American troops stay in Iraq for 100 years. The \n     truth is, he was trying to make an analogy to our long term \n     presence in peaceful post-war Germany, post-armistice Korea \n     and post-Dayton Bosnia.\n       But Germany, Korea or Bosnia after the peace are nothing \n     like Iraq today--with thousands of bombs, hundreds of \n     American injured and dozens of American killed every month--\n     and there is little prospect Iraq will look like them anytime \n     soon.\n       Worse, saying you're happy to stay in Iraq for 100 years \n     fuels exactly the kind of dangerous conspiracy theories about \n     America's intentions throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds \n     that we should be working to dispel.\n       What about Iran? Would drawing down increase its already \n     huge influence in Iraq? Or would it shift the burden of \n     helping to stabilize Iraq from us to them and make our forces \n     a much more credible deterrent to Iran's wider misbehavior?\n       The idea that we could or even should wipe out every \n     vestige of Iran's influence in Iraq is a fantasy. Even with \n     160,000 American troops in Iraq, our ally in Baghdad greets \n     Iran's leader with kisses. Like it or not, Iran is a major \n     regional power and it shares a long border--and a long \n     history--with Iraq.\n       Right now, Iran loves the status quo, with 140,000 \n     Americans troops bogged down and bleeding, caught in a cross \n     fire of intra Shi'a rivalry and Sunni-Shi'a civil war.\n       The challenge for us is not eliminating all Iranian \n     influence in Iraq, but forcing Iran to confront the specter \n     of a disintegrating Iraq or all-out war between different \n     Shi'a factions.\n       By drawing down, we can take away Iran's ability to wage a \n     proxy war against our troops and force Tehran to concentrate \n     on avoiding turmoil inside Iraq's borders and instability \n     beyond them.\n       Finally, would our responsible draw down accelerate \n     sectarian chaos?\n       Or would it cause Iraq's leaders and Iraq's Sunni Arab \n     neighbors to finally act responsibly? To date, both have used \n     our large presence as a crutch or an excuse for inaction. \n     When that stops, they will have to start to fill the vacuum \n     or put their interests at much greater risk.\n       We should debate the consequences of drawing down in Iraq. \n     But more importantly, we should talk about what both \n     President Bush and Senator McCain refuse to acknowledge: the \n     increasingly intolerable costs of staying.\n       The risks of drawing down are debatable. The costs of \n     staying with 140,000 troops are knowable--and they get \n     steeper every day: the continued loss of the lives and limbs \n     of our soldiers; the emotional and economic strain on our \n     troops and their families due to repeated, extended tours, as \n     Army Chief of Staff General George Casey recently told \n     Congress; the drain on our Treasury-- $12 billion every \n     month; the impact on the readiness of our armed forces--tying \n     down so many troops that, as Vice Chief of Staff of the Army \n     Richard Cody said, we don't have any left over to deal with a \n     new emergency; and the inability to send enough soldiers to \n     the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, where Al Qaeda \n     has regrouped and is plotting new attacks.\n       When I visited Afghanistan in February, General McNeil, who \n     commands the international force, told me that with two extra \n     combat brigades--about 10,000 soldiers--he could turn around \n     the security situation in the south, where the Taliban is on \n     the move. But he can't get them because of Iraq.\n       Even when we do pull troops out of Iraq, the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mullen, says he would want to send \n     them home for a year to rest and retrain before sending them \n     to Afghanistan.\n       The longer we stay in Iraq, the more we put off the day \n     when we fully join the fight\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\n     against the real Al Qaeda threat and finally defeat those who \n     attacked America 7 years ago.\n       It is long past time to clearly define our interests in \n     Iraq. It is not in our interest to intervene in an internal \n     power struggle among Shi'a factions. It is not in our \n     interest to back one side or the other, or get caught in the \n     cross fire of a Sunni-Shi'a civil war. It is in our interest \n     to start to leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind.\n       Even if we could keep 140,000 troops in Iraq, they will not \n     be the deciding factor in preventing chaos. Instead, we need \n     to focus all our remaining energy and initiative on achieving \n     what virtually everyone agrees is the key to stability in \n     Iraq: a political power sharing agreement among its warring \n     factions. I remain convinced that the only path to such a \n     settlement is through a decentralized, federal Iraq that \n     brings resources and responsibility down to the local and \n     regional levels.\n       We need a diplomatic surge to get the world's major powers, \n     Iraq's neighbors and Iraqis themselves invested in a \n     sustainable political settlement.\n       Fifteen months into the surge that President Bush ordered \n     and Senator McCain embraced, we've gone from drowning to \n     treading water. We are no closer to the President's stated \n     goal of an Iraq that can defend itself, govern itself and \n     sustain itself in peace. We're still spending $3 billion \n     every week and losing 30 to 40 American lives every month.\n       We can't keep treading water without exhausting ourselves \n     and doing great damage to our other vital interests around \n     the world. That's exactly what both the President and Senator \n     McCain are asking us to do.\n       They can't tell us when, or even if, Iraqis will come \n     together politically, which was the purpose of the surge in \n     the first place. They can't tell us when, or even if, we will \n     draw down below pre-surge levels. They can't tell us when, or \n     even if, Iraq will be able to stand on its own two feet. They \n     can't tell us when, or even if, this war will end.\n       Most Americans want this war to end. They want us to come \n     together around a plan to leave Iraq without leaving chaos \n     behind.\n       They're not defeatists. They're patriots who understand the \n     national interest--and the great things Americans can achieve \n     if we responsibly end a war that we should not have started.\n       I believe it is fully within our power to do that. Then, \n     with our credibility restored, our alliances repaired and our \n     freedom renewed, we will once again lead the world. We will \n     once again address the hopes, not play to the fears, of our \n     fellow Americans.\n       That is my hope for next November--and for the country we \n     all love.\n       May God bless America and protect our troops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3073-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX REFORM\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, the time for a honest, national \ndiscussion of fundamental tax reform is long overdue. Each year, April \n15 looms on the calendar as a day of reckoning for American taxpayers \nfacing a laborious and needlessly stressful process. Since enacting the \nTax Reform Act of 1986--legislation intended to simplify the filing \nprocess for taxpayers--more than 15,000 provisions have been added to \nthe Internal Revenue Code.\n  The irony of our complex Tax Code is that in order to take advantage \nof all the benefits and deductions for which they qualify, Americans \nhave to spend a significant amount of money to pay someone or something \nto do their taxes for them--thus decreasing the value of their return. \nAccording to the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, only \n13 percent of taxpayers are able to file without the help of either a \ntax preparer or computer software.\n  The Tax Foundation estimates that in 2005, individuals, businesses, \nand nonprofits spent an estimated 6 billion hours complying with the \nFederal income tax code, with an estimated compliance cost of more than \n$265 billion. This amounts to imposing a 22-cent tax compliance \nsurcharge for every dollar the income tax system collects.\n  Tinkering with the current Tax Code won't get the job done. Tinkering \nis what got us into this mess in the first place. We must enact \nfundamental tax reform--a complete overhaul of the system that would \nmake the Tax Code simple, fair, transparent, and conducive to economic \ngrowth and private savings.\n  Tax reform is not just a matter of simply saving taxpayers time and \neffort. This is about saving taxpayers real money. Comprehensive tax \nreform could save Americans the $265 billion in compliance costs. Now, \nthat would be a real tax reduction that wouldn't cost the Treasury one \ndime.\n  A new tax system is also vitally important to job creation and \neconomic growth. In addition to simplification for average families, we \nmust address one of the biggest problems with the current code: it \nrewards moving production activity--and the good-paying jobs that \naccompany such activity-- overseas. It taxes domestically produced \ngoods heavily and taxes foreign-made goods lightly. We have the second \nhighest corporate tax rate in the developed world, but we are near the \nbottom in corporate tax collections as a share of the economy. Such a \nsystem sounds absolutely perverse, but that is what we have in the \nUnited States.\n  Some of my colleagues will suggest that we can just increase marginal \nrates to raise the revenue we need. But in a competitive global \neconomy, I can't understand why we would choose such a self-defeating \napproach. Higher marginal rates on an already-broken tax system would \nonly discourage economic ingenuity and reduce U.S. competitiveness. \nRecent economic research concludes that in a global economy workers \nbear the brunt of higher corporate tax rates, through lower wages and \nfewer jobs.\n  The bottom line is Congress needs to take tax reform seriously. I am \nactively evaluating proposals that would simplify the Tax Code, save \ntaxpayers billions of dollars, expand the economy, and most \nimportantly, protect American jobs. I have already discussed the need \nfor such legislation with many of my colleagues, and I know there is \nbipartisan support in the Chamber for comprehensive and timely action.\n  We can start the process by enacting legislation to create a \nbipartisan commission to propose tax and entitlement reform legislation \nthat Congress must vote on under fast-track procedures, such as my SAFE \nCommission Act or the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal \nAction that has been proposed by Senate Budget Committee chairman Kent \nConrad and ranking Republican Judd Gregg. With or without such a \ncommission, Congress and the next President must move forward on \ncomprehensive tax reform that simplifies the code and creates jobs in \nthe United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3073-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3073-S3074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION PROCESS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, an editorial in Monday's New York Times \ncalled attention to a new academic study on the Supreme Court \nconfirmation process. The study, ``An Empirical Analysis of the \nConfirmation Hearings of the Justices of the Rehnquist Natural Court,'' \nwas conducted by Professors Jason Czarnezki of the Marquette Law \nSchool, William Ford of the John Marshall Law School, and Lori Ringhand \nof the University of Kentucky College of Law, and it was published in \nthe Spring 2007 issue of Constitutional Commentary. The study compares \nthe statements made by nine Supreme Court nominees--Justices Rehnquist, \nStevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and \nBreyer--at their confirmation hearings with their subsequent rulings on \nthe Court to determine whether their statements as nominees on stare \ndecisis, originalism, legislative history, and the rights of criminal \ndefendants were consistent with their rulings as Justices.\n  The authors found that a large gap often exists between what nominees \ntold the Senate Judiciary Committee and how they later ruled from the \nbench. For example, in their confirmation hearings, Justices Scalia and \nThomas indicated a stronger commitment to stare decisis than most of \ntheir colleagues did, yet on the Court they were the Justices most \nlikely to vote to overturn precedents. On none of the subjects was the \ncorrelation very strong between the testimony by the nominees at the \nSenate hearings and their rulings on the Court. The authors conclude \nthat Senators have a better chance at obtaining useful information in \nconfirmation hearings if they ``focus their questions on specific issue \nareas rather than `big picture' issues involving interpretative \nmethods.''\n  As the authors state, their results are far from definitive and are \nmeant only to start a conversation. The evidence is certainly \nsuggestive, however, and is consistent with what legal scholars have \nbeen saying for many years. Supreme Court nominees reveal very little \nsubstantive information at their\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\nconfirmation hearings. As a result, it is difficult for the Senate and \nthe American public to understand how these nominees will approach \ntheir role on the Court.\n  This trend was obvious in the confirmation hearings of Chief Justice \nJohn Roberts and Associate Justice Samuel Alito. Throughout their \nhearings, they offered only general platitudes, with little indication \nof how they would rule on the bench. They refused to answer specific \nquestions or to say how they would have voted in past cases, on the \nground that doing so might compromise their duty to decide every case \nwith an open mind.\n  Legal scholars are increasingly in agreement that political \nconvenience, not principle, has motivated much of this stonewalling. \nSince Supreme Court nominees all have years of legal experience and, if \nconfirmed, have lifetime appointments to the Court, they can be candid \nabout their views on many issues, including previously decided cases, \nwithout doing any damage to the judicial system or to the rights of \nfuture litigants.\n  Since Supreme Court confirmation hearings have become increasingly \nlacking in significant content, it is no surprise that researchers find \nweak correlations between what nominees say at the hearings and what \nthey do on the Court, and that academic and popular support for a more \nserious confirmation process continues to grow. Of course, no Senator \nshould try to undermine judicial independence by asking nominees to \nmake ``commitments'' to rule a particular way in a future case, but all \nSenators should insist that nominees participate in a serious \nconversation about the pressing legal issues of our time. Hopefully, \nSenators on both sides of the aisle can agree that, at a minimum, \nnominees should give full and forthright responses when asked about \ntheir views on specific legal questions. It does not compromise the \nintegrity or impartiality of the judiciary to require nominees to tell \nthe Senate what they honestly think about such questions. Their failure \nto do so has real costs for our democracy.\n  Madam President, I believe that this article will be of interest to \nall of us in the Senate in exercising our constitutional responsibility \nof advice and consent on judicial nominees, especially nominees to the \nSupreme Court, and I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times \neditorial and the article's abstract be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 14, 2008]\n\n                    How to Judge a Would-Be Justice\n\n       It is hard to imagine a more solemn responsibility than \n     confirming the nomination of a Supreme Court justice. And we \n     have worried, especially in recent years, that nominees are \n     far too carefully packaged and coached on how to duck all of \n     the hard questions.\n       A new study supports our fears: Supreme Court nominees \n     present themselves one way at confirmation hearings but act \n     differently on the court. That makes it difficult for \n     senators to cast informed votes or for the public to play a \n     meaningful role in the process.\n       The study--with the unwieldy title ``An Empirical Analysis \n     of the Confirmation Hearings of the Justices of the Rehnquist \n     Natural Court''--published in Constitutional Commentary, \n     looked at how nine long-serving justices answered Senate \n     questions, and how they then voted on the court. While it \n     does not say that any nominee was intentionally misleading, \n     it still found a wide gap.\n       Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, for example, \n     told the Senate that they had strong respect for Supreme \n     Court precedents. On the court they were the justices most \n     likely to vote to overturn those precedents. Justice David \n     Souter deferred more to precedent than his Senate testimony \n     suggested he would.\n       The authors examined one substantive area of the law: \n     criminal defendants' rights. There what the nominees--both \n     conservatives and liberals--told the Senate about their \n     support for defendants' rights was reasonably well reflected \n     in how they voted.\n       The study suggests that senators would be better off asking \n     ``very probing, specific questions,'' says Lori Ringhand, \n     associate professor of law at the University of Kentucky and \n     one of the paper's three authors.\n       As we see it, the study also delivers a larger lesson: \n     Senators should examine a nominee's entire legal career and \n     look for clear evidence that he or she is committed to \n     fairness, equal justice and an unstinting view of \n     constitutional rights.\n       The findings have particular resonance now because the next \n     president could nominate three or more justices, shaping the \n     law for decades to come. The Senate needs to upgrade the \n     confirmation process so it can perform its vital advice-and-\n     consent role more effectively.\n\n                 [From Social Science Research Network]\n\n An Empirical Analysis of the Confirmation Hearings of the Justices of \n                      the Rehnquist Natural Court\n\n  (By Jason J. Czarnezki, Marquette University; William K. Ford, John \n   Marshall Law School; and Lori A. Ringhand, University of Kentucky)\n\n       Despite the high degree of interest generated by Supreme \n     Court confirmation hearings, surprisingly little work has \n     been done comparing the statements made by nominees at their \n     confirmation hearings with their voting behavior once on the \n     Supreme Court. This paper begins to explore this potentially \n     rich area by examining confirmation statements made by \n     nominees regarding three different methods of constitutional \n     interpretation: stare decisis, originalism and the use of \n     legislative history. We also look at nominees' statements \n     about one specific area of law: protection of the rights of \n     criminal defendants. We then compare the nominees' statements \n     to decisions made by the Justices once confirmed. Our results \n     indicate that confirmation hearings statements about a \n     nominee's preferred interpretive methodologies provide very \n     little information about future judicial behavior. Inquiries \n     into specific issue areas--such as the rights of criminal \n     defendants--may be slightly more informative. We emphasize, \n     however, that this study is a preliminary look at this issue. \n     As such, we hope this piece stimulates discussion regarding \n     how to best use the wealth of information provided by \n     confirmation hearings to facilitate a better understanding of \n     the role those hearings do--or could--play in shaping the \n     jurisprudence of the Supreme Court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3074-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL A.

Madam President, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel and Dr. Victor Fuchs, \nphysicians and distinguished scholars, have recently written a \nparticularly important article that I wish to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate.\n  These two gentlemen have a long and impressive track record on the \nissue of reforming our Nation's broken health system, and their recent \narticle in the Journal of American Medicine (JAMA), ``Who Really Pays \nfor Health Care? The Myth of Shared Responsibility,'' is one that every \nSenator should reflect on.\n  Drs. Emanuel and Fuchs assert in their article that when millions of \nAmericans say that financing health care is a ``shared responsibility'' \nbetween ``employers, government, and individuals'' they are incorrect. \nThe authors say there is actually no such thing as ``shared \nresponsibility''--health costs in America come out of the hides of \nindividuals and households. Emanuel-Fuchs point out, for example, that \nmoney employers spend on health care for their workers would otherwise \ngo to workers' salaries and that Government cannot secure funds at all \nwithout reaching into our wallets for tax payments or money we lend to \nthem.\n  The work of these two scholars is particularly relevant because \nrecent public opinion polls show significant numbers of Americans would \nbe content ``to just keep the health care they have.'' This seems \nunderstandable. If\n\n[[Page S3075]]\n\nyou are not a regular reader of JAMA, you are likely to miss Dr. \nEmanuel and Dr. Fuchs describe how your take-home pay is going to keep \ngoing down without health reform that makes health care more \naffordable.\n  If Americans are kept in the dark about how much of the money spent \non employer-based health care produces little value, naturally, during \nthese times of economic uncertainty, many will be glad to just keep the \ncare they have got.\n  Senator Bennett and I, along with six other Democrats and six other \nRepublicans, believe it is time to modernize the employer-employee \nrelationship in health care. If employers choose to offer health \ncoverage in the future, and workers know how much money they are \nspending and can choose between the employer's health coverage and \nprivate sector alternatives, we are fine with that. Workers should, \nhowever, have the opportunity as Dr. Emanuel and Dr. Fuchs put it to \n``consider alternatives''. Americans can get more value from the 2.3 \ntrillion dollars being spent this year on their health care, and this \narticle is an important part of the discussion as to how to bring that \nabout.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article by Drs. \nEmanuel and Fuchs be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Who Really Pays for Health Care?\n\n\n                 the myth of ``shared responsibility''\n\n    (By Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D., Ph.D. and Victor R. Fuchs, Ph.D.)\n\n       When asked who pays for health care in the United States, \n     the usual answer is ``employers, government, and \n     individuals.'' Most Americans believe that employers pay the \n     bulk of workers' premiums and that governments pay for \n     Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (SCHIP), and other programs.\n       However, this is incorrect. Employers do not bear the cost \n     of employment-based insurance; workers and households pay for \n     health insurance through lower wages and higher prices. \n     Moreover, government has no source of funds other than taxes \n     or borrowing to pay for health care.\n       Failure to understand that individuals and households \n     actually foot the entire health care bill perpetuates the \n     idea that people can get great health benefits paid for by \n     someone else. It leads to perverse and counterproductive \n     ideas regarding health care reform.\n\n\n                   the myth of shared responsibility\n\n       Many sources contribute to the misperception that employers \n     and government bear significant shares of health care costs. \n     For example, a report of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n     Services states that ``the financial burden of health care \n     costs resides with businesses, households, and governments \n     that pay insurance premiums, out-of-pocket costs, or finance \n     health care through dedicated taxes or general revenues.'' A \n     New America Foundation report claims, ``There is growing \n     bipartisan support for a health system based on shared \n     responsibility--with the individual, employers, and \n     government all doing their fair share.''\n       The notion of shared responsibility serves many interests. \n     ``Responsibility'' is a popular catchword for those who \n     believe everyone should pull their own weight, while \n     ``sharing'' appeals to those who believe everyone should \n     contribute to meeting common social goals. Politicians \n     welcome the opportunity to boast that they are ``giving'' the \n     people health benefits. Employers and union leaders alike \n     want workers to believe that the employer is ``giving'' them \n     health insurance. For example, Steve Burd, president and \n     chief executive officer of Safeway, argued that decreasing \n     health care costs is critical to his company's bottom line--\n     as if costs come out of profits. A highly touted alliance \n     between Wal-Mart and the Service Employees International \n     Union for universal coverage pledged that ``businesses, \n     governments, and individuals all [must] contribute to \n     managing and financing a new American health care system.\n       The Massachusetts health care reform plan is constructed \n     around ``shared responsibility.'' The rhetoric of health \n     reform proposals offered by several presidential candidates \n     helps propagate this idea. Hillary Clinton, for instance, \n     claims that her American Health Choices plan ``is based on \n     the principle of shared responsibility. This plan ensures \n     that all who benefit from the system contribute to its \n     financing and management.'' It then lists how insurance and \n     drug companies, individuals, clinicians, employers, and \n     government must each contribute to the provision of improved \n     health care.\n       With prominent politicians, business leaders, and experts \n     supporting shared responsibility, it is hardly surprising \n     that most Americans believe that employers really bear most \n     of the cost of health insurance.\n\n\n                  the health care cost-wage trade-off\n\n       Shared responsibility is a myth. While employers do provide \n     health insurance for the majority of Americans, that does not \n     mean that they are paying the cost. Wages, health insurance, \n     and other fringe benefits are simply components of overall \n     worker compensation. When employers provide health insurance \n     to their workers, they may define the benefits, select the \n     health plan to manage the benefits, and collect the funds to \n     pay the health plan, but they do not bear the ultimate cost. \n     Employers' contribution to the health insurance premium is \n     really workers' compensation in another form.\n       This is not a point merely of economic theory but of \n     historical fact. Consider changes in health insurance \n     premiums, wages, and corporate profits over the past 30 \n     years. Premiums have increased by about 300% after adjustment \n     for inflation. Corporate profits per employee have \n     flourished, with inflation-adjusted increases of 150% before \n     taxes and 200% after taxes. By contrast, average hourly \n     earnings of workers in private nonagricultural industries \n     have been stagnant, actually decreasing by 4% after \n     adjustment for inflation. Rather than coming out of \n     corporate profits, the increasing cost of health care has \n     resulted in relatively flat real wages for 30 years. That \n     is the health care cost--wage trade-off.\n       Even over shorter periods, workers' average hourly earnings \n     fluctuate with changes in health care expenditures (adjusted \n     for inflation). During periods when the real annual increases \n     in health care costs are significant, as between 1987 and \n     1992 and again between 2001 and 2004, inflation-adjusted \n     hourly earnings are flat or even declining in real value. For \n     a variety of reasons, the decline in wages may lag a few \n     years behind health care cost increases. Insurance premiums \n     increase after costs increase. Employers may be in binding \n     multiyear wage contracts that restrict their ability to \n     change wages immediately. Conversely, when increases in \n     health care costs are moderate, as between 1994 and 1999, \n     increases in productivity and other factors translate into \n     higher wages rather than health care premiums.\n       The health care cost--wage trade-off is confirmed by many \n     economic studies. State mandates for inclusion of certain \n     health benefits in insurance packages resulted in essentially \n     all the cost of the added services being borne by workers in \n     terms of lower wages. Similarly, using the Consumer \n     Expenditure Survey, Miller found that ``the amount of \n     earnings a worker must give up for gaining health insurance \n     is roughly equal to the amount an employer must pay for such \n     coverage.'' Baicker and Chandra reported that a 10% increase \n     in state health insurance premiums generated a 2.3% decline \n     in wages, ``so that [workers] bear the full cost of the \n     premium increase.'' Importantly, several studies show that \n     when workers lose employer-provided health insurance, they \n     actually receive pay increases equivalent to the insurance \n     premium.\n       In a review of studies on the link between higher health \n     care costs and wages, Gruber concluded, ``The results [of \n     studies] that attempt to control for worker selection, firm \n     selection, or (ideally) both have produced a fairly uniform \n     result: the costs of health insurance are fully shifted to \n     wages.''\n\n\n                   the cost--public service trade-off\n\n       A large portion of health care coverage in the United \n     States is provided by the government. But where does \n     government's money for health care come from? Just as the \n     ultimate cost of employer-provided health insurance falls to \n     workers, the burden of government-provided health coverage \n     falls on the average citizen. When government pays for \n     increases in health care costs, it taxes current citizens, \n     borrows from future taxpayers, or reduces other state \n     services that benefit citizens: the health care cost--public \n     service trade-off.\n       Health care costs are now the single largest part of state \n     budgets, exceeding education. According to the National \n     Governors Association, in 2006, health care expenditures \n     accounted for an average of 32 percent of state budgets, \n     while Medicaid alone accounted for 22 of spending. Between \n     2000 and 2004, health care expenditures increased \n     substantially, more than 34 percent with Medicaid and SCHIP \n     increasing more than 44 percent. These increases far exceeded \n     the increase in state tax receipts. In response, some states \n     raised taxes, others changed eligibility requirements for \n     Medicaid and other programs, and still others reduced the \n     fees and payments to physicians, hospitals, and other \n     providers of health care services.\n       However, according to a Rockefeller Institute of Government \n     study of how 10 representative states responded, probably the \n     most common policy change was to cut other state programs, \n     and ``the program area that was most affected by state budget \n     difficulties in 2004 was public higher education. . . . On \n     average, the sample states projected spending 4.5 percent \n     less on higher education in FY 2004 than in FY 2003 and \n     raised tuition and fees by almost 14 percent on average. In \n     other words, the increasing cost of Medicaid and other \n     government health care programs are a primary reason for the \n     substantial increase in tuition and fees for state colleges \n     and universities. Middle-class families finding it more \n     difficult to pay for their children's college are unwittingly \n     falling victim to increasing state health care costs. Not an \n     easy--but a necessary--connection to make.\n\n\n                          policy implications\n\n       The widespread failure to acknowledge these effects of \n     increasing health care costs on wages and on government \n     services such as education has important policy implications. \n     The myth of shared responsibility perpetuates the belief that \n     workers are getting\n\n[[Page S3076]]\n\n     something while paying little or nothing. This undercuts the \n     public's willingness to tax itself for the benefits it wants.\n       This myth of shared responsibility makes any reform that \n     removes employers from health care much more difficult to \n     enact. If workers and their families continue to believe that \n     they can get a substantial fringe benefit like health \n     insurance at no cost to themselves, they are less likely to \n     consider alternatives. Unless this myth is dispelled, the \n     centerpiece of reform is likely to be an employer mandate. \n     This is regrettable and perpetuates the widely recognized \n     historical mistake of tying health care coverage to \n     employment. Furthermore, an employer mandate is an \n     economically inefficient mechanism to finance health care. \n     Keeping employers in health care, with their varied interests \n     and competencies, impedes major changes necessary for \n     insurance portability, cost control, efficient insurance \n     exchanges, value-based coverage, delivery system reform, and \n     many other essential reforms. Employers should be removed \n     from health care except for enacting wellness programs that \n     directly help maintain productivity and reduce absenteeism. \n     Politicians' rhetoric about shared responsibility reinforces \n     rather than rejects this misconception and inhibits rather \n     than facilitates true health care reform.\n       Not only does third-party payment attenuate the incentive \n     to compare costs and value, but the notion that someone else \n     is paying for the insurance further reduces the incentive for \n     cost control. Getting Americans invested in cost control will \n     require that they realize they pay the price, not just for \n     the deductibles and co-payments, but for the full insurance \n     premiums too.\n       Sustainable increases in wages require less explosive \n     growth in health care costs. Only then will increases in \n     productivity show up in higher wages and lower prices, giving \n     a boost to real incomes. Similarly, the only way for states \n     to provide more support for education, environment, and \n     infrastructure is for health care costs to be restrained. \n     Unless the growth in Medicaid and SCHIP are limited to--or \n     close to--revenue increases, they will continue to siphon \n     money that could be spent elsewhere.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Discussions of health care financing in the United States \n     are distorted by the widely embraced myth of shared \n     responsibility. The common claim that employers, government, \n     and households all pay for health care is false. Employers do \n     not share fiscal responsibility and employers do not pay for \n     health care--they pass it on in the form of lower wages or \n     higher prices. It is essential for Americans to understand \n     that while it looks like they can have a free lunch--having \n     someone else pay for their health insurance--they cannot. The \n     money comes from their own pockets. Understanding this is \n     essential for any sustainable health care reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3076-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CONGRATULATING MRS.

The 700,000 men and women of the CWA have consistently \nreelected Barbara by acclamation, most recently in 2005.\n  In addition, Barbara has worked to advance the rights of women in the \nworkplace. She serves on the board of the Union Network International, \nUNI, a 17-million member labor organization, and is president of the \nUNI World Women's Committee. For her accomplishments, Barbara has \nreceived the Women's Equity Action League Award, the International \nWomen's Democracy Center Global Democracy Award, the Midwest Labor \nPress Association's Eugene V. Debs Award, and the Ellis Island American \nLegend Award.\n  While Barbara has displayed impressive achievements as secretary-\ntreasurer of CWA, she has also found time to contribute to several \nother worthy organizations. She is cochair of the National Alliance to \nEnd Homelessness, a member of the Spinal Bifida Foundation and the \nElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and serves on the board of \ndirectors of the National Democratic Institute for International \nAffairs and the Faith and Politics Institute. Barbara has displayed a \ncommendable ability to advance the goals of each of these organizations \nand increase their impact.\n  Throughout her long and distinguished career, Barbara has worked to \nshatter the glass ceiling at the local, national, and international \nlevel. I am proud that she was honored last month before a record \ngathering of union women at the Women in Leadership Development \nConference in East Brunswick, NJ. Whether striving to advance the \nrights of workers, serving as an advocate for women, or volunteering \nher time on behalf of countless organizations, Barbara has been a \nstrong and effective leader. Barbara embodies the best of the union \nspirit and I thank her for her service and commitment to the CWA and \nworkers across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3077-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n                          HONORING SIGCO, INC.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, today I honor a small, privately \nowned manufacturing business from my home State of Maine with a \nremarkable dedication to serving the customer. SIGCO, Inc., of \nWestbrook is a glass and architectural metal fabricator and distributor \nthat exemplifies Maine's stellar manufacturing leadership in this \nNation.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship and cochair of the Senate Task Force on Manufacturing, \nI constantly see the vital impact that manufacturing has on the health \nof our Nation's economy. Small companies like SIGCO are absolutely \ncrucial to our Nation's manufacturing sector competing in a global \nenvironment, as they account for roughly 99 percent of American \nmanufacturers. This is why we must encourage and support the \ndevelopment of our Nation's small- and medium-sized manufacturers, and \nunderscore the numerous accomplishments of SIGCO and similar firms.\n  Established in 1986, SIGCO inherited a proud tradition of craftwork \nfrom Soule Glass Industries, a firm that preceded SIGCO as the local \nleader in quality glass manufacturing and metal fabrication. SIGCO has \ndemonstrated impressive growth in its operations throughout its \nhistory, and, in particular, over the past 4 years, by expanding from \n55 employees to 85 and relocating to a newly opened 60,000 square-foot \nmanufacturing facility. SIGCO produces and distributes architectural \nglass, frameless entrances, shower enclosures, aluminum entrances, \nacrylic, polycarbonate, and glazing supplies. The company also offers a \n5-year warranty on all sealed insulating glass units. SIGCO's target \nclientele are contract glaziers, retail glass shops, and window \nmanufacturers throughout New England who have come to trust SIGCO for \nits unrivaled craftsmanship and customer service.\n  SIGCO has demonstrated a consistency in both performance and \nfinancial strength, traits that have anchored the company in its \nachievement. Proof of SIGCO's accomplishments came when U.S. Glass \nmagazine recognized the firm as one of the most influential companies \nin the glass and metal industry, followed up by the magazine naming \ncompany president David McElhinny as one of the trade's most \ninfluential people. Mr. McElhinny's leadership has contributed greatly \nto SIGCO's remarkable expansion, and his years of experience provide \nthe company with a tremendously knowledgeable voice at the helm.\n  SIGCO is also known for its sophisticated production process. To \npromote efficiency, the company uses two industrial-type cutting lines \nin its plant. That said, SIGCO also offers individualized products upon \ncustomer requests. SIGCO notably uses an advanced edging process that \ncreates clean, ground, or seamed edges for the appropriate type of \nglass. On top of the cutting and edging processes, SIGCO uses new, \nstate-of-the-art equipment to drill holes and mill cutouts and notches. \nAdditionally, SIGCO uses a convection tempering oven to perfect their \nheat-treated products. Among a select number of licensees of the \nDecoTherm process, which allows companies to decorate glass without \nscreen printing or sandblasting, SIGCO can customize designs on glass \nproducts to provide quality and unique products to each customer. \nFinally, SIGCO is one of only five U.S. distributors of Tubelite \nstorefronts and entrances.\n  As former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli poignantly \nobserved, ``The secret of success is constancy to purpose.'' SIGCO \nembodies Disraeli's definition of success by exhibiting a consistent \ndedication to its mission, as well as never sacrificing the excellence \nof its products as the company grows and expands. Proudly representing \nMaine's ongoing contribution to the manufacturing sector, SIGCO and its \nemployees exemplify the hardwork and ingenuity for which Mainers are \nwell-known. I wish David McElhinny and everyone at SIGCO the best, and \nlook forward to their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3077-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING JIM ADAMS\n\n Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, today I recognize Jim Adams, a \nPittsfield, NH, resident who recently retired from a 35-year career \nwith the United States Postal Service.\n  After bravely serving his country for 4 years in the United States \nNavy, Mr. Adams began his postal career as a Manchester mail carrier in \n1973. During his 10 years in this position, Jim personified the Postal \nService maxim, ``neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night \nstays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed \nrounds,'' through many difficult New Hampshire winters, and \nunpredictable New England summers.\n  During this time, Jim took night classes and earned a degree in \nbusiness management from New Hampshire College which, along with his \ndedicated work ethic, helped propel him through the ranks of the Postal \nService.\n  After 3 years in the management ranks of local New Hampshire post \noffices, Jim spent time in both Syracuse, NY, and Washington, DC, \nlearning the ins and outs of the Nation's second largest employer. In \n1992, Jim was selected as the executive assistant to the Postmaster \nGeneral, becoming the first person ever to rise all the way through the \nranks from an entry level craft position to attain that post.\n  In 1997, Jim returned home to New Hampshire as the district manager \nfor customer service and sales, and in 2003, when the New Hampshire and \nVermont Districts merged, Jim assumed the responsibility for both \nStates. During this time, he oversaw 7,000 employees as they worked to \nensure more than 6 million pieces of mail arrived on time throughout \nboth New Hampshire and Vermont each day. In fact, over the last 4 years \nof his tenure, 98 percent of the mail in his district was delivered on \ntime; and during the past 6 years, New Hampshire has earned the highest \ncustomer service ratings in the Nation. All the while, Jim improved the \ndistrict's safety record from worst in the Nation to tenth best.\n  For all of Jim's success, his shining professional moment will be his \nleadership during the anthrax crisis that plagued the Nation shortly \nafter September 11, 2001. His personal involvement in handling the \ncrisis helped calm the fears of postal workers and citizens alike, and \nhe helped us all get through the fear and distress that went hand-in-\nhand with this highly volatile bioterrorist attack.\n  Over the course of his career, Jim had the opportunity to meet five \nPresidents and play a role in the development of several well \nrecognized commemorative stamps, including the World War II, Elvis, and \nPOW/MIA stamps. From a local boy delivering mail with 3-cent stamps in \n1973, to a district manager overseeing a $500 million budget in 2008--I \nwould say that is a career well done.\n  Jim's well rounded operations and managerial experience gave him a \nunique and comprehensive view of the organization, which he was able to \nput to work for the benefit of the millions of postal customers in his \ndistrict.\n  I have known Jim and his wife Sandra for many years and am sure they \nare looking forward to many relaxing years together with their children \nand grandchildren. He has dedicated himself to public service staying \ntrue to the ideal of placing the needs of others before those of \nyourself. Now I join with so many others in extending warm wishes as \nthey begin a well deserved retirement together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3077-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3077-S3078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:26 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5813.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \ngrants to designated States and tribes to carry out programs to reduce \nthe risk of livestock loss due to predation by gray wolves and other \npredator species or to compensate landowners for livestock loss due to \npredation; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Gray Wolf \nLivestock Loss Mitigation Act, which Senator Barrasso and I are \nintroducing today.\n  This program is a key step now that wolves will be delisted in \nMontana, Wyoming, and Idaho. The bill will help reduce livestock losses \ndue to wolves and help our ranchers who bear the financial burden of \nlosses due to wolves.\n  On March 28, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the gray \nwolves in the northern Rockies from the endangered species list. Wolves \nhave, over the last few years, experienced a remarkable recovery in the \nnorthern Rockies. They, in fact, have exceeded their population goals \nput in place when they were reintroduced.\n  I applaud the Fish and Wildlife Service for their decision to turn \nthe management over to the States, such as Montana, because Montana is \nready.\n  Each State in our region has developed its own management plan that \nwill treat wolves like other wildlife and keep their numbers at \napproved levels.\n  Today, tourists come to Yellowstone to see wolves. They are a symbol \nof the wildness of our region. But wolves also need to eat, and they \nkill animals in the process--some wild, some domestic. In the case of \nthe domestic livestock, such as cattle and sheep, that costs producers \ntime and money and reduces profitability.\n  Our States are taking action by initiating new programs that will try \nto prevent wolf kills by improved fencing, grazing practices, using \nguard dogs, and other means. They will also be compensating producers \nfor the losses due to wolves.\n  Yesterday, Montana's program began accepting claims. Since the \nFederal Government reintroduced wolves to the northern Rockies, it only \nmakes sense for the Fish and Wildlife Service to assist States in \nmanaging wolves even after the delisting.\n  Today, Senator Barrasso and I are introducing the Gray Wolf Livestock \nLoss Mitigation Act to provide the assistance States need in managing \nwolves in the future.\n  This program strikes the balance the public demands. It accepts the \npresence of wolves, but it also supports our livestock industry which \nis affected by that reintroduction of the wolves.\n  If wolves are a public asset deserving of reintroduction, the Federal \nGovernment ought to be a player at the table to mitigate their costs.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a look at this issue--it is an \nimportant one--particularly those colleagues from the Great Lakes \nregion and the Southwest who face similar problems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3082-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 517--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF APRIL 13-19, 2008, AS \n                      ``WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD''\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \nLevin, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Brown, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Casey, \nMrs. Murray, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Johnson) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 517\n\n       Whereas there are 20,000,000 children under the age of 5 in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas numerous studies, including the Abecedarian Study, \n     the Study of the Chicago Child-Parent Center, and the High/\n     Scope Perry Preschool Study, indicate that low income \n     children who have enrolled in quality, comprehensive early \n     childhood education programs--\n       (1) improve their cognitive, language, physical, social, \n     and emotional development; and\n       (2) are less likely to--\n       (A) be placed in special education;\n       (B) drop out of school; or\n       (C) engage in juvenile delinquency;\n       Whereas the enrollment rates of children under the age of 5 \n     in early childhood education programs have steadily increased \n     since 1965 with--\n       (1) the creation of the Head Start program carried out \n     under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.);\n       (2) the establishment of the Early Head Start program \n     carried out under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et \n     seq.); and\n       (3) the enactment of the Child Care and Development Block \n     Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.);\n       Whereas many children eligible for, and in need of, quality \n     early childhood education services are not served;\n       Whereas only about one-half of all preschoolers who are \n     eligible to participate in Head Start programs have the \n     opportunity to do so;\n       Whereas less than 5 percent of all eligible babies and \n     toddlers in the United States receive the opportunity to \n     participate in Early Head Start;\n       Whereas only about 1 out of every 7 eligible children \n     receives assistance under section 658C of the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858a) to--\n       (1) enable the parents of the child to continue working; \n     and\n       (2) provide the child with safe and nurturing early \n     childhood care and education;\n       Whereas, although State and local governments have \n     responded to the numerous benefits of early childhood \n     education by making significant investments in programs and \n     classrooms, there remains--\n       (1) a large unmet need for those services; and\n       (2) a need to improve the quality of those programs;\n       Whereas, according to numerous studies on the impact of \n     investments in high-quality early childhood education, the \n     programs reduce--\n       (1) the occurrence of students failing to complete \n     secondary school; and\n       (2) future costs relating to special education and juvenile \n     crime; and\n       Whereas economist and Nobel Laureate, James Heckman, and \n     Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System, Ben S.

Res. 518\n\n       Whereas the month of April has been designated ``National \n     Child Abuse Prevention\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\n     Month'' as an annual tradition initiated in 1979 by President \n     Jimmy Carter;\n       Whereas the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System \n     figures reveal that more than 900,000 children were victims \n     of abuse and neglect in the United States in 2006, causing \n     unspeakable pain and suffering for our most vulnerable \n     citizens;\n       Whereas more than 4 children die as a result of abuse or \n     neglect in the United States each day;\n       Whereas children younger than 1 year old accounted for \n     approximately 44 percent of all child abuse and neglect \n     fatalities in 2006, and children younger than 3 years old \n     accounted for approximately 78 percent of all child abuse and \n     neglect fatalities in 2006;\n       Whereas abusive head trauma, including the trauma known as \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome, is recognized as the leading cause of \n     death among physically abused children;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome can result in loss of vision, \n     brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death;\n       Whereas 20 States have enacted statutes related to \n     preventing and increasing awareness of Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas medical professionals believe that thousands of \n     additional cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome and other forms of \n     abusive head trauma are being misdiagnosed or are undetected;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome often results in permanent, \n     irreparable brain damage or death of an infant and may result \n     in extraordinary costs for medical care in only the first few \n     years of the life of the child;\n       Whereas the most effective solution for preventing Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome is to prevent the abuse, and it is clear that \n     the minimal costs of education and prevention programs may \n     prevent enormous medical and disability costs and \n     immeasurable amounts of grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have demonstrated that \n     educating new parents about the danger of shaking young \n     children and how to protect their children from injury can \n     significantly reduce the number of cases of Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome;\n       Whereas education programs raise awareness and provide \n     critically important information about Shaken Baby Syndrome \n     to parents, caregivers, childcare providers, child protection \n     employees, law enforcement personnel, health care \n     professionals, and legal representatives;\n       Whereas National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week and \n     efforts to prevent child abuse, including Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome, are supported by groups across the United States, \n     including groups formed by parents and relatives of children \n     who have been killed or injured by shaking, whose mission is \n     to educate the general public and professionals about Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome and to increase support for victims and the \n     families of the victims in the health care and criminal \n     justice systems;\n       Whereas the Senate previously designated the third week of \n     April 2007 as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness \n     Week''; and\n       Whereas the Senate strongly supports efforts to protect \n     children from abuse and neglect: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the third week of April 2008 as ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'';\n       (2) commends hospitals, child care councils, schools, \n     community groups, and other organizations that are--\n       (A) working to increase awareness of the danger of shaking \n     young children;\n       (B) educating parents and caregivers on how they can help \n     protect children from injuries caused by abusive shaking; and\n       (C) helping families cope effectively with the challenges \n     of child-rearing and other stresses in their lives; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States--\n       (A) to remember the victims of Shaken Baby Syndrome; and\n       (B) to participate in educational programs to help prevent \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nmy colleague, Senator Alexander, to proclaim the third week of April as \n``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week.''\n  First recognized by our late colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, \nShaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week is one step the Senate can take \neach year to raise public awareness of Shaken Baby Syndrome, represents \none of the most devastating forms of child abuse in this country. This \nform of abuse not only results in severe injury and lifelong disability \nin some cases, it results in the deaths of hundreds of children each \nyear.\n  In recognition of the need to eliminate child abuse and to raise \nawareness about the issue, the month of April has been designated \n``National Child Abuse Prevention Month,'' an annual tradition that was \ninitiated in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter. As we focus more \nclosely on the prevention of child abuse this month, awareness and \nprevention of Shaken Baby Syndrome should be an important component of \nthese efforts.\n  The facts demonstrate the need for our efforts: Based on the most \nrecent statistics available, about 1530 children died of abuse in 2006. \nWhile each of those deaths is a tragedy, it is estimated that 300 of \nthose children were victims of an inflicted head injury. Nearly all of \nthose children were under 5 years of age, and two-thirds had not \nreached their first birthday. The total annual cost of child abuse and \nneglect in the United States is estimated to be $103.8 billion a year.\n  However, there is good news: Programs that educate new parents about \nthe danger of shaking and how they can protect their child have been \nshown to be remarkably effective. Eleven years ago, a pilot project to \neducate parents before they left the hospital began in Buffalo, New \nYork. Since that time, the incidence of inflicted head injury is 50 \npercent lower in the Buffalo area. Today, New York and eight other \nStates require hospitals to provide parents with education that gives \nthem the knowledge to keep their children safe, and regional and local \nprograms have begun in other States. Since Texas began in 1998, several \nstates now require that licensed child care providers bee ortant \ntrained about the causes, consequence and prevention of Shaken Baby \nSyndrome, important knowledge when more than 8 million children under \nage 5 are in child care during the work week. In Wisconsin, Illinois \nand New York, education programs are being designed for middle-school \nand high-school students: tomorrow's parents, tonight's babysitters.\n  While awareness of the vulnerability of young children to inflicted \nbrain injuries is important, we are learning that effective education \nprograms work best when they enlist the support of parents and other \ncaregivers, and give them the knowledge and techniques they need to \nkeep young children safe.\n  I, like many of my colleagues, am a parent. My children are still \nyoung and my parenting memories are perhaps more fresh than those of \nsome other members. The overwhelming majority of my memories are ones I \nwill cherish for a lifetime. But, I also recall exhaustion, anxiety and \nmoments of frustration and anger. While national surveys show such \nmoments are a normal part of being a parent, they are rarely spoken of.\n  Education and awareness can give every parent the opportunity to \nlearn how to cope with frustrating moments, and to keep their children \nsafe. Understanding this, last year I introduced the Shaken Baby \nSyndrome Awareness Act of 2007. This initiative provides for the \ncreation of a public health campaign, including the development of a \nNational Action Plan to identify effective, evidence-based strategies \nfor prevention and awareness of Shaken Baby Syndrome, and establishment \nof a cross-disciplinary advisory council to help coordinate national \nefforts. Through this legislation I hope to reduce the number of \nchildren injured or killed by abusive head trauma, and ultimately \neliminate Shaken Baby Syndrome.\n  With the support of the Centers for Disease Control, in 2008 \nPennsylvania and North Carolina will begin statewide initiatives to \nsupport the efforts of hospitals to educate new parents. This builds on \nthe program that began 11 years ago in Buffalo, New York and it builds \non the efforts of doctors, nurses, educators, child care providers, \nprevention organizations and parent advocates across America who have \nbeen working to prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome and other inflicted abuse.\n  I would like to recognize those efforts, and the efforts of many \nothers, including those formed by parents and relatives of children who \nhave been killed or injured by shaking, who work to increase awareness \nof how parents can help protect their children from this devastating \nform of child abuse. Among those who are working toward the end of \npreventing the tragedy of child abuse and who are supportive of this \nresolution are: Association of University Centers on Disabilities, \nBrain Injury Association of America, Child Welfare League of America, \nChildren's Healthcare is a Legal Duty, Children's Safety Network, \nCongress of Neurological Surgeons, Easter Seals, Hannah Rose \nFoundation, National Association of Child Care Resource & Referral \nAgencies, National Association of State Head Injury Administrators, \nNational Center for Learning Disabilities,\n\n[[Page S3084]]\n\nNational Child Abuse Coalition, National Exchange Club Foundation, \nPrevent Child Abuse America, Shaken Baby Prevention, Inc., Shaken Baby \nSyndrome Prevention Plus, The Arc of the United States, The Center for \nChild Protection and Family Support, The National Association of \nChildren's Hospitals and Related Institutions, The National Shaken Baby \nCoalition, United Cerebral Palsy, Voices for America's Children, D.C. \nChildren's Trust Fund, and National Family Partnership. I would like to \nthank Senators Menendez, Casey, Bayh, Clinton, Schumer, Hatch, Murray \nfor their support of this worthwhile initiative.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution designating the third week \nof April 2008 as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week,'' and \nI urge members who take part in the many local and national activities \nand events recognizing the month of April as National Child Abuse \nPrevention Month to take the opportunity to visit a local hospital, \nchild care center or school, learn what they are doing to help parents \nprotect their children from injury and recognize those efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3084-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4529.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 517 submitted earlier today by \nSenator Salazar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 517) designating the week of April \n     13-19, 2008, as ``Week of the Young Child.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the ``Week of \nthe Young Child.'' With 20 million children under the age of 5 in this \ncountry, these children are our country's future, and we must support \nand invest in our future. Providing children with access to quality \nearly education programs will help to ensure that all children are not \nonly ready for school, but ready to succeed and reach their full \npotential.\n  In Connecticut, early care and education centers were established to \nprovide quality early education to children of low- and moderate-income \nfamilies. These centers, which are in communities all over the State, \nwould not exist without a combination of State and Federal funds. \nConnecticut's centers are accredited by the National Association for \nthe Education of Young Children and seek to support and promote the \ncognitive, physical, social, and emotional development of children.\n  The Children's Center of New Milford, CT, is one of these funded \nearly care and education centers. The center offers quality care on a \nsliding-fee scale to approximately 80 families. In addition to \nproviding educational and social opportunities, the center also \nprovides 80 percent of a child's daily nutritional needs including \nbreakfast, a hot lunch, and an afternoon snack.\n  Many of the parents helped by the center provide the workforce for \nsmall and large companies. They are employed by fast food stores, \ndepartment stores, grocery stores, local restaurants, and nursing \nhomes. Without the funded centers, these parents would not be able to \nafford childcare, and their children would not be able to benefit from \nthe various educational, social, and emotional supports the centers \nprovide.\n  One Connecticut parent wrote to me about how a quality pre-K program \nhas changed her child's life saying: ``My three year old loves books. \nMy three year old interacts well with others. My three year old knows \nhow to express himself without anger. My three year old will grow up to \nbe a good citizen. My three year old is a product of good parenting and \na quality pre-K program. As a single working parent, I rely on a pre-K \nprogram to fill the gaps when I am unavailable to nurture and teach my \nchild.''\n  I also heard from an elementary school Spanish teacher who discussed \nthe benefits he has seen when children who come from non-English \nspeaking families attend quality pre-K programs saying: ``The ability \nto learn with peers and children who do speak English at home helps \nthese children so that they are not further behind their peers when \nthey start kindergarten.''\n  Funding quality early education programs such as these is essential \nto support the children, parents, communities, and future of our \nNation. I thank Senators Salazar and Cochran for their leadership with \nregard to the resolution designating the ``Week of the Young Child'' \nand proudly support them in their valuable efforts.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 517) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 517\n\n       Whereas there are 20,000,000 children under the age of 5 in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas numerous studies, including the Abecedarian Study, \n     the Study of the Chicago Child-Parent Center, and the High/\n     Scope Perry Preschool Study, indicate that low income \n     children who have enrolled in quality, comprehensive early \n     childhood education programs--\n       (1) improve their cognitive, language, physical, social, \n     and emotional development; and\n       (2) are less likely to--\n       (A) be placed in special education;\n       (B) drop out of school; or\n       (C) engage in juvenile delinquency;\n       Whereas the enrollment rates of children under the age of 5 \n     in early childhood education programs have steadily increased \n     since 1965 with--\n       (1) the creation of the Head Start program carried out \n     under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.);\n       (2) the establishment of the Early Head Start program \n     carried out under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et \n     seq.); and\n       (3) the enactment of the Child Care and Development Block \n     Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.);\n       Whereas many children eligible for, and in need of, quality \n     early childhood education services are not served;\n       Whereas only about one-half of all preschoolers who are \n     eligible to participate in Head Start programs have the \n     opportunity to do so;\n       Whereas less than 5 percent of all eligible babies and \n     toddlers in the United States receive the opportunity to \n     participate in Early Head Start;\n       Whereas only about 1 out of every 7 eligible children \n     receives assistance under section 658C of the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858a) to--\n       (1) enable the parents of the child to continue working; \n     and\n       (2) provide the child with safe and nurturing early \n     childhood care and education;\n       Whereas, although State and local governments have \n     responded to the numerous benefits of early childhood \n     education by making significant investments in programs and \n     classrooms, there remains--\n       (1) a large unmet need for those services; and\n       (2) a need to improve the quality of those programs;\n       Whereas, according to numerous studies on the impact of \n     investments in high-quality early childhood education, the \n     programs reduce--\n       (1) the occurrence of students failing to complete \n     secondary school; and\n       (2) future costs relating to special education and juvenile \n     crime; and\n       Whereas economist and Nobel Laureate, James Heckman, and \n     Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System, Ben S. Bernanke, have stated that investment in \n     childhood education is of critical importance to the future \n     of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of April 13-19, 2008, as ``Week of \n     the Young Child'';\n       (2) encourages the citizens of the United States to \n     celebrate--\n       (A) young children; and\n       (B) the citizens who provide care and early childhood \n     education to the young children of the United States; and\n       (3) urges the citizens of the United States to recognize \n     the importance of--\n       (A) quality, comprehensive early childhood education \n     programs; and\n       (B) the value of those services for preparing children to--\n       (i) appreciate future educational experiences; and\n       (ii) enjoy lifelong success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/16/senate-section/article/S3103-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, APRIL 17, 2007\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.
