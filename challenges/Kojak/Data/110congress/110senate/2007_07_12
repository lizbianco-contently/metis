Let me say a few words about the guest Chaplain. Mr. Zed is \na resident of Reno, NV. He serves as director of interfaith relations \nof the Hindu temple in Reno and is a spokesman for the Indian \nAssociation of Northern Nevada. He serves as the Hindu chaplain in \nnorthern Nevada and northern California hospitals. He teaches at \nTruckee Meadows Community College in Reno.\n  In addition to his tireless work in the Hindu faith, he is also \nactive in the community doing many different activities . He serves on \nthe governing\n\n[[Page S9070]]\n\nboard of the Northern Nevada International Center, is a member of the \nReno Police Chief Advisory Board, and is a member of the Diversity \nAction Plan Committee of the Washoe County School District.\n  Mr. Zed was born in India. That is where he studied to become a Hindu \nchaplain. He holds degrees, including a master's degree from San Jose \nState University, in mass communications. He has a master's degree in \nbusiness administration from the University of Nevada Reno.\n  I have had a long-standing association with the Indian community. I \nwent to college in Logan, UT, Utah State University, a cold, cold \nplace. Brigham Young, when he sent people to colonize the West, had \npeople come back from Cache County to tell him that it couldn't be \nsettled because it froze there every month of the year. Well, that is \nnot quite true, but it freezes all but a couple months of the year. It \nis a wonderful community and a great university. It has grown a lot \nsince I was there.\n  I lived off campus. I went there 2 years. I went to a junior college \nthe first 2 years. I lived off campus. I was married. I would drive up \nthat hill to the campus, and walking every day were students. They were \nIndians, coming from India to the United States to study. Utah State \nspecialized in engineering and agriculture. These young men came from \nIndia to study at Utah State University. I would give them rides. I did \nthat for 2 years, put as many in the car as would fit. When it came \ntime to graduate, one of them came to me and said: Could you and Mrs. \nReid stay over a day. We would like to do a traditional Indian feast \nfor you.\n  Well, I am from Searchlight. I didn't know what they were talking \nabout. But we had that traditional Indian feast. Many of them were \ndressed similar to Mr. Zed. That was an eye opener for me. They had all \nthis Indian food. I am a guy from Searchlight. We like beans and rice \nand potatoes and, when we were lucky, some round steak. My mother used \nto pound it so it would be tender and we could eat it. It was unusual \nfood for somebody from Searchlight, but we enjoyed it. It was a lot of \nfun. They gave us a number of gifts when the feast was over, and it was \nreally a feast. It was all traditional Indian food.\n  I don't remember all they gave me, but I do remember one item. It is \nin my office in the Capitol. That was many years ago. We have had five \nchildren since then and lots of grandchildren. But it was a little \nstatue of Gandhi, hand carved. It is ivory. It is done so well, you can \npull the staff out of his hand. It is done really well. I have \nprotected and saved that all these years. It is in my office. I have \nalways had it there.\n  The reason I mention that is that if people have any misunderstanding \nabout Indians and Hindus, all they have to do is think of Gandhi. Here \nis a man who changed the world, a man who believed in peace. We heard \nthe prayer: Peace, peace, peace. If there was ever a time, with this \ninternational war on terror that we are fighting now, where people have \nto understand how important peace is, think of Ghandi, a man who gave \nhis life for peace, a tiny little man in physical stature but a giant \nin morality. Gandhi is the man that Martin Luther King, Jr., followed. \nHis nonviolence was all based on the teachings of Gandhi. As a result \nof Gandhi, we had the civil rights movement, led by another man small \nin stature. Larger than Ghandi, Martin Luther King was not a giant of a \nman physically, but he was a giant of a man morally, just as Gandhi.\n  I think it speaks well of our country that someone representing a \nfaith of about a billion people comes here and can speak in \ncommunication with our Heavenly Father regarding peace. I am grateful \nhe is here. I am thankful he was able to offer this prayer of peace in \nthe Capitol. I say to everyone concerned, think of Gandhi. If you have \na problem in the world, think what this great man has done to bring \npeace and nonviolence to a troubled world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9070-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, when Lady Bird Taylor met the man she \nwould marry in the fall of 1934, her first reaction was to pull back. \n``Lyndon came on very strong,'' she said. ``My instinct was to \nwithdraw.''\n  And when an assassin's bullet thrust her into the national spotlight \non another fall day in 1963, she withdrew again. America remembers this \nremarkable woman for the quiet dignity with which she let a nation and \na stricken wife mourn the loss of a President they loved. And our first \nreaction to her in those days of mourning was gratitude.\n  Now we mourn her passing, after a long tumultuous life that was \nmarked above all by quiet service and a love of beauty.\n  She was nothing like her husband.\n  Lyndon Johnson was an overpowering figure who filled up every room he \nentered. His personality still reverberates through these walls. But he \nalways knew what he needed to get ahead in life, and he saw in Lady \nBird the tact and gentility he saw lacking in himself.\n  He asked her to marry him on their first date.\n  And soon the aspiring politician would marry this shy and pretty \nrancher's daughter. Sam Rayburn said it was the best thing Lyndon \nJohnson ever did.\n  Lady Bird brought a deep love of nature from east Texas to the White \nHouse, and she shared it with America. Residents and tourists in \nWashington have her to thank for the natural beauty that surrounds us \nhere and that makes us proud to call this city our Nation's Capital.\n  Millions of travelers and commuters have her to thank for the flowers \nthat line our roads. The blues, reds and yellows that light up \nAmerica's highways are a living, lasting legacy to the woman who guided \nthe Highway Beautification Act into law.\n  A friend to every First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt, Lady Bird \nJohnson stepped out of the national spotlight as quietly as she stepped \ninto it, again respecting the national mood at another painful moment \nin our history.\n  She outlived her famous husband by more than three decades, and we \ndidn't hear or see much of her over the years. But she'd remind us from \ntime to time that she was still here, quietly accepting an honor for \nher husband or launching some good environmental work. And we were \nalways glad to see her. She became for us a kind of living assurance \nthat beauty and grace outlive tragedy and loss.\n  We will miss her. We mourn with her daughters, Lynda and Luci, and \ntheir families. And we join them in honoring a very good American life \nthat was spent in generous service to family and country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9070-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today, I want to reiterate something I \ntalked about on Monday and maybe elaborate a little bit. I am one of \nthe cosponsors of an amendment that several people will be discussing \ntoday, amendment No. 2020--it is primarily offered by my colleague, \nSenator Coleman, and myself and Senator DeMint and Senator Thune and, I \nbelieve, some others also--to prohibit the reimplementation of the \nFairness Doctrine.\n  Over the past few weeks, the Fairness Doctrine has received quite a \nbit of attention. The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives had \na vote on June 28, just a couple weeks ago. The House voted 309 to 115 \nto prohibit the\n\n[[Page S9071]]\n\nFCC from using funds to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine.\n  Now, the Fairness Doctrine is a regulation the FCC developed to \nrequire FCC-licensed broadcasters to provide contrasting viewpoints on \ncontroversial issues. However, the FCC conducted a review of this \nregulation in 1985. I remember this well. This was back during the \nReagan administration. They concluded--and I am quoting now the FCC:\n\n       [W]e no longer believe that the Fairness Doctrine serves \n     the public interest.\n\n  In explaining why the FCC reached this conclusion, the FCC wrote--I \nam quoting again further--\n\n       [T]he interest of the public is fully served by the \n     multiplicity of voices in the marketplace today and that the \n     intrusion by government----\n\n  The intrusion by government----\n\n     into the content of programming unnecessarily restricts the \n     journalistic freedoms of broadcasters. The FCC's refusal to \n     enforce the Fairness Doctrine was later upheld in the DC \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       That is a little bit of the history that took place, and \n     there was not much controversy back in those days. Everybody \n     pretty much agreed this is something that should be driven by \n     the market, driven by the people, as opposed to being spoon-\n     fed to the people by some governmental agency or anybody \n     else.\n\n  So you might ask, why would a regulation that was found to be \nunnecessary over 20 years ago be controversial today? I can tell you \nwhy that is. It is because--and I happened to be in the middle of this \nwhen it happened--on June 22 I said something on a talk radio show that \nbecame quite controversial having to do with a statement I had made to \na couple of the Senators of a more liberal standing in the Senate.\n  They believed the content--which it is--of talk radio has a huge bias \ntoward the conservative viewpoints. Now, I had made the statement--and \nI hate to sound rash when I do this, but I want to be accurate--I said: \nWell, you guys don't really understand. This is market driven. The \nmarket is driving it. There is no market out there for your liberal \ntripe.\n  So it happened, coincidentally, that the day after I made that \nstatement, the Center for American Progress came out with this report. \nIt is called ``The Structural Imbalance of Political Talk Radio.'' Now, \nI am not critical of the people who are behind this. It is the people \nfrom the Clinton White House. Clearly, it is John Podesta, Mark Lloyd, \nand many others who are in charge of this program. I am not sure. I \nhave heard that the Center for American Progress is supposed to be \nmaybe another viewpoint from the Heritage Foundation. You hear all \nkinds of things. But this is what is interesting in this report. First \nof all, they go through and document the fact that in talk radio 91 \npercent of the content is conservative. I do not disagree with that. \nThey say only 9 percent is progressive, or I would say liberal. I do \nnot disagree with that.\n  After they make their case, they try to state that there has to be a \ncorrection for it. I am going to read just a few excerpts from this \nreport.\n  They said:\n\n       These findings--\n\n  Now, the findings we are talking about are the 91 percent--\n\n     may not be surprising given general impressions about the \n     format, but they are stark and raise serious questions about \n     whether the companies licensed to broadcast over the public \n     airwaves are serving the listening needs of all Americans.\n\n  Now, that is really interesting, ``the listening needs of all \nAmericans.'' What are the listening needs of all Americans? Who is \ngoing to determine that? Anyway, that is what they seem to be hanging \ntheir hat on. They said:\n\n       Our conclusion is--\n\n  I am reading from this report which is from the Center for American \nProgress. That is John Podesta and Mark Lloyd and the rest of that \ngroup.\n\n       Our conclusion is that the gap between conservative and \n     progressive talk radio is the result of multistructural \n     problems in the U.S. regulatory system.\n\n  It goes on to explain this. And then--I am kind of a slow learner. \nBut after I figured out what they were talking about, they were talking \nabout there are regulations that could be violated, or the intent of \nregulations could be in violation here. So they talk about some \nprescribed regulations to correct this problem.\n\n  Now I move to page 11 of this report, and they come to this \nconclusion. They said:\n\n       If commercial radio broadcasters are unwilling to abide by \n     these regulatory standards or the FCC is unable to \n     effectively regulate in the public interest, a spectrum use \n     fee should be levied on owners to directly support local, \n     regional, and national public broadcasting.\n\n  You cannot get more socialistic than that in the comments. Now, the \nwhole idea they are saying that not only then would talk show hosts who \nhave a strong bias in one way or another lose their shows--let's say \nSean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, any of the rest of them--but they also \nwould have to be fined and that money would go to support public \nbroadcasting. Now, that is what caused the interest after 20 years.\n  When I say it is market driven, if you do not believe that, look at \nthe effort by Al Franken and other liberals who tried to start Air \nAmerica. Air America was designed to be on the liberal side. The \nproblem was, nobody wanted to listen to it. So this is the problem that \nis out there, that people want to get away from what is market driven.\n  We went through this same exercise, I might add, not too long ago, \nabout a year ago, I think it was. We had various--let's see, Armed \nForces Radio. I have it here somewhere. There are three different radio \nstations that reach our troops around the world--not just in Iraq and \nAfghanistan but around the world. So there was an effort to prescribe \nprogramming so it would be equally liberal and conservative. Then there \nwas an uproar by our troops over there because they did not want that. \nSo through their publications, the Army Times and some other \npublications, they determined what they wanted to listen to, and it was \nprimarily conservative.\n  So that is what has brought this thing up, and several people in the \nHouse and several people in the Senate--in this body--have said: We \nneed to get the FCC to reinstitute the Fairness Doctrine.\n  Now, the amendment that was passed in the House of Representatives by \nthat huge margin I just mentioned was to prohibit the FCC from changing \nits viewpoint as far as the Fairness Doctrine is concerned.\n  I have been outspoken on this issue for some time. For example, on \nthe Defense authorization legislation we made quite an issue out of \nthis. By the way, I might want to add, we won that battle. We ended up \nnow so they are getting the programming they want, and it happens to \nbe--this is quite a coincidence--it happens to be about the same--91 \npercent versus 9 percent--that the people are demanding today in terms \nof the market. The same principle applies again.\n  I have long said that talk radio is market driven. There simply is \nnot much market for some of this other stuff that is out there. Some \nSenators have made it clear they intend to reinstate the Fairness \nDoctrine, but free speech is fundamental to what it means to be an \nAmerican, and it must be protected. Reimposing some form of the \nFairness Doctrine threatens first amendment rights. We all know that. \nBut really what is most important is it gets to be very similar to some \nof these countries we criticize all the time where the government is \ntrying to take over what comes through their airwaves.\n  So I am pleased to join my many colleagues, including Senators \nColeman, DeMint, and Thune, in supporting this amendment, and I urge \nthe Senate to speak just as definitely against the Fairness Doctrine.\n  I have a letter from the National Association of Broadcasters. In \nthis letter--I will not read the whole thing--it winds up by saying:\n\n       In the 20 years since elimination of the Fairness Doctrine, \n     there has been a veritable explosion in alternative media \n     outlets. Today, there are over 13,000 radio stations, more \n     than 1,700 TV stations, nine broadcast TV networks, hundreds \n     of cable and satellite channels, scores of mobile media \n     devices and an infinite number of Internet sites that cater \n     to every political persuasion and ideology. The Internet now \n     enables consumers to obtain, and communicate to the world, \n     virtually unlimited content.\n\n  Of course, this is a strong endorsement of our position by the \nNational Association of Broadcasters. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S9072]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                              of Broadcasters,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: I write today to express our strong \n     opposition to a reinstatement of the so-called ``Fairness \n     Doctrine.''\n       This discredited regulation, which stemmed from the 1940s \n     and was eliminated two decades ago, required television and \n     radio broadcasters to present contrasting points of view when \n     covering controversial issues of public importance. In the \n     Federal Communications Commission's 1985 Fairness Report, the \n     FCC asserted that the doctrine no longer produced its desired \n     effect and instead caused a ``chilling effect'' on news \n     coverage that may also be in violation of the First \n     Amendment.\n       I write to you today urging you to oppose any attempt to \n     resurrect this long-discarded regulation. Free speech must be \n     just that--free from government influence, interference and \n     censorship.\n       The so-called Fairness Doctrine would stifle the growth of \n     diverse views and, in effect, make free speech less free. \n     Newsgathers, media outlets and reporters will be less willing \n     to present ideas that might be controversial. In fact, FCC \n     officials found that the doctrine ``had the net effect of \n     reducing, rather than enhancing, the discussion of \n     controversial issues of public importance,'' and therefore \n     was in violation of constitutional principles. (``FCC Ends \n     Enforcement of Fairness Doctrine,'' Federal Communications \n     Commission News, Report No. MM-263, August 4, 1987.)\n       In the 20 years since elimination of the Fairness Doctrine, \n     there has been a veritable explosion in alternative media \n     outlets. Today, there are over 13,000 radio stations, more \n     than 1,700 TV stations, nine broadcast TV networks, hundreds \n     of cable and satellite channels, scores of mobile media \n     devices and an infinite number of Internet sites that cater \n     to every political persuasion and ideology. The Internet now \n     enables consumers to obtain, and communicate to the world, \n     virtually unlimited content.\n       Bringing back the Fairness Doctrine is unnecessary, \n     unwarranted, and unconstitutional.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David K. Rehr.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 15 minutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, if the Senator will amend his consent \nrequest so that both sides have equal additional time in morning \nbusiness, there will be no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I modify my request that I have 15 minutes \nand my colleague have 15 minutes as well.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. No objection. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I first thank my colleague from Oklahoma \nfor bringing to the floor this important issue of free speech in \nAmerica, and the bill that would help to keep the FCC from imposing gag \nrules on talk radio and other media. But that is not the purpose of my \ntrip to the floor today.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the ongoing effort in the \nSenate to block earmark reform. It has now been 175 days--over 6 \nmonths--since we passed our earmark transparency rules. Yet they still \nhave not been enacted.\n  As my colleagues know, we passed two important earmark transparency \nrules back in January that, first, require public disclosure of \nearmarks and, second, prohibit Congress from adding secret earmarks \nbehind closed doors in conference committees where they cannot be \nopenly debated or voted on. Both of these rules were unanimously \nsupported by the Senate. But now--over 6 months later--Democrats are \ninsisting that we change or drop these rules behind closed doors.\n  I asked the majority leader before July 4 if we could agree to \nprotect these earmark reforms in conference, but he said no. I am not \nasking for an ironclad agreement. He said they would change in \nconference. I asked him what changes he wanted to make to these \nimportant earmark rules that had passed unanimously, but so far we do \nnot have a response.\n  In fact, in CongressDailyAM, they put it quite clearly when they \nsaid:\n\n       [Democrats] could not guarantee that DeMint's earmark \n     language would survive negotiations with the House.\n\n  I would only correct one thing about that quote. This was actually \nNancy Pelosi's language, modified slightly by Senator Durbin, and voted \non unanimously in the Senate. They are hardly my earmark requirements.\n  Well, there you have it. After stalling and blocking the enactment of \nthese important ethics reforms for over 6 months, and after coming up \nwith every excuse in the book to put them off, the Democrat leadership \nis now beginning to admit they plan to kill earmark reform.\n  It is now day 175 of business as usual in the Senate, and the party \nthat said it would clean up the culture of corruption in Washington is \nalready embracing it.\n  The majority leader and the majority whip made several statements on \nthis issue on the Senate floor the other night, and I want to address \nthem.\n  First, the majority leader said that my efforts to protect earmark \nreform were a ``ploy,'' a ``diversion,'' and a ``smokescreen'' to stop \nthe ethics bill.\n  This accusation is completely false, and these two Senators are \nprobably the only two people in America who believe it. I voted for the \nlobbying and ethics bill, and I even supported going to conference. In \nfact, I came to the floor on Monday and asked for consent to adopt the \nearmark transparency rules and to go to conference with the House on \nthe ethics bill. But the other side objected because they only want to \nmove forward on the ethics bill if they can gut the earmark reforms in \nsecret.\n  The truth is, the only thing stopping the lobbying and ethics bill \nfrom moving forward is the Democratic leadership and their desire to \nkill meaningful earmark reform behind closed doors. They may want to \nhide their opposition to transparency by accusing me of having a secret \nplan to kill the bill, but Americans know the truth. They know folks in \nCongress love earmarks and will do anything to keep this process secret \nand easy for Members to designate money to their pet projects. It is \nclear, the only thing stopping this bill is obstruction to earmark \nreform.\n  Next, the majority leader said it was a ``fantasy'' for anyone to \nthink they would kill earmark reform behind closed doors. Again, I am \nnot sure how these things can be said with a straight face. Several \nSenators on the other side, including the majority leader himself, have \npublicly said they intend to change these rules behind closed doors, \nbut they won't say how they are going to change them. If this is all a \nfantasy, then why won't they tell us what they plan to do with these \nreforms? This is supposed to be a bill about transparency, but the \nother side wants to rewrite it in secret.\n\n  But setting aside for a moment the fact that they have publicly \nadmitted they plan to change these rules, we need to realize it is \nearmark reform we are talking about here. The culture of earmarking \nruns very deep in this town, and it is no fantasy that there are many \nin this body on both sides of the aisle who want to preserve that \nculture.\n  Next, the majority leader said Democrats are already complying with \nthe rule and therefore we should trust them. The truth is the earmark \ndisclosure the Democrats have given us is spotty at best. In fact, the \nCongressional Research Service says only 4 committees out of 18 have \nimplemented even an informal disclosure rule. Even worse, it says these \nfour informal rules cannot be enforced on the floor of the Senate.\n  The Defense bill we are debating right now is a perfect example. The \ncommittee put out a partial list of the earmark sponsors, but it has \nfailed to make public the letters from these earmark sponsors \ncertifying that they have no financial interest in the projects they \nhave requested. This is a recipe for more Duke Cunninghams. It is a \nrecipe for corruption.\n  Congressional Quarterly put it quite clearly when it stated:\n\n       The earmarks--listed in the defense bill for the first time \n     ever--would not have been\n\n[[Page S9073]]\n\n     published at all had most Democrats on the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee gotten their way.\n\n  But the Democratic leadership wants us to trust them anyway. They \nwant us to trust the people writing the earmarks to follow the rules \nwithout any accountability. It won't work, and the Defense bill is a \nperfect example.\n  It is also important to note that the Democrats have done nothing to \naddress the practice of adding secret earmarks in closed door \nconference committees. As my colleagues know, one of our earmark \ntransparency rules prohibits this awful practice. The Democrats in the \nHouse have been trying to get away with adding their earmarks in secret \nwithout any oversight, and now Senate Democrats are blocking a rule to \nstop it on our side.\n  Everyone knows the game around here. Everyone knows if you want a \nquestionable earmark, you wait until the bill gets to conference and \nthen you slip it in where it cannot be seen, where it cannot be \ndebated, and where it cannot be stopped. Nothing has been done to stop \nthis practice. The majority leader may believe Democrats have been \ntransparent enough, but it is clear they have not. That is why we need \na rule that will hold us all accountable.\n  Next, the majority leader said I am preventing the Congress from \n``restoring the faith'' of the American people in their Government. \nCongress will never restore faith with the American people until it \naddresses earmarks. As long as Members of Congress can direct Federal \ntax dollars to the special interest of their choosing with little or no \naccountability, we will see more bribes, more indictments, more prison \nsentences, and more Duke Cunninghams. Ethics reform is not complete \nwithout earmark reform. Americans know what I am talking about. That is \nwhy we need to get this right.\n  Next, Senator Durbin said if I would only look at the bills, I would \nsee the Democrats have fully complied with the proposed rules. The \ntruth is if Senator Durbin would look at the earmark disclosure rule--\nwhich he wrote--he would know it requires Senators to certify they have \nno conflict of interest in the earmark, and that these certifications \nwill be made public on the committee Web site. If he would do some \nchecking and go to the Armed Services Committee Web site, he would see \nthere are no letters there for all the earmarks that were added to the \nDefense authorization bill we are currently debating. That is one \nexample of how the majority is skirting the rules and it is one example \nof why they don't want a formal rule that would stop them from pulling \nthese tricks.\n  But setting aside their failures to be fully transparent, if Senator \nDurbin believes they are in full compliance with the earmark rules, \nthen why is he so opposed to enacting them? What is he afraid of? If \nthey are already complying with these rules, why not formalize them so \nthey can be actually enforced?\n  The truth is they are not fully complying with the rules and they \nhave no plan to. They have been earmarking at will for years and they \ndon't want anything that would make them more open or transparent.\n  The majority leader also said my desire to protect earmark reform is \na ``guise'' to kill the ethics bill. Again, this is completely false. \nFor me, this is about reforming the way we spend American tax dollars. \nThat is my motive. I am one who believes that the culture of earmarks \nis what drives the culture of corruption, and I know many others agree. \nThe only ``guise'' here is the guise the Democrats are putting up to \nhide their opposition to earmark reform. They keep saying they want to \ngo to conference on the ethics bill, but they refuse to tell us what \nthey plan to do with the earmark reform once they get there. Instead, \nthey say ``trust us.''\n\n  Democrats keep saying they want an ethics bill, but the truth is they \ndon't want earmark reform. They have called it a ``petty issue'' and a \n``trifle.'' It is all a guise. We all know what this debate is about--\nit is about earmarks and whether we are going to have business as usual \nin the Senate.\n  The other side wants us to change the way people outside of Congress \nbehave--such as the lobbyists who bring their issues to us--but they \ncompletely oppose changing anything on earmarks, because this limits \ntheir own ability and it forces them to be accountable. That is the \nreal guise here.\n  The majority leader appears to be so opposed to meaningful earmark \nreform that he is willing to cancel the August break in order to \npressure me to allow them to gut these reforms in secret. From my \nperspective, cancelling the August break to debate earmark reform would \nnot be a bad thing. We need to debate this, because there are many here \nin the Senate who still don't get it. They still don't understand that \nAmericans are sick and tired of business as usual in Washington.\n  The majority leader also said the other night that he may try to \nforce this down our throats, as he tried to force the immigration bill \ndown our throats by filing a number of cloture motions. The other side \nsays what I am doing to force them to protect earmark reform has never \nbeen done before and would set a bad precedent. They actually think \npeople will believe that nobody has ever objected to going to \nconference, that no one has ever objected to sending a bill to a back \nroom where it can be changed at will.\n  What I am doing is exactly what Senator Reid did for years when he \nwas in the minority. According to the Congressional Research Service, \nthe Senator who has blocked the most attempts to go to conference over \nthe past three Congresses is Senator Harry Reid. On several occasions \nhe has demanded specific guarantees or concessions in exchange for \nallowing a bill to go to conference.\n  Senator Reid knew then what he seems to have forgotten now: that a \nconference committee is not an entitlement. A bill is not entitled to \ngo to conference where it can be changed behind closed doors. It is a \nluxury the majority leadership has used, but he is not entitled to it. \nThere are a number of ways we can reconcile the differences between the \ntwo bills. The Senator from Nevada knew this before, but now that he is \nthe majority leader, he seems to have forgotten.\n  All of this can be easily solved in a bipartisan way. All my friends \non the other side need to do is accept these rules which were \nunanimously supported by the Senate back in January. And if for some \nreason they believe these rules need technical changes, then they \nshould tell us what they are going to do to change them so we can work \nit out in the open instead of behind closed doors.\n  I hope my friends on the other side will change their minds. These \nare Senate rules that I am talking about, and there is no reason why we \nneed to be negotiating with the House on them. All my friends on the \nother side have to do is stop blocking earmark reform and stop trying \nto change the rules in secret, and we can move on.\n  Americans have seen the ethical problems associated with earmarks. \nThey have watched what happened to Duke Cunningham and they have seen a \nnumber of Members of Congress forfeit their seats on appropriations \ncommittees due to conflicts of interest. Americans understand that \nlobbying and ethics reform will not be complete if we don't do anything \nto shine the light on the process.\n  Mr. President, could I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator has 1 \nminute 10 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I am more long-winded than I thought here.\n  Let me conclude, although we will need to continue this debate.\n  My goal is to get the lobby and ethics reform bill to conference. But \na key part of that bill has always been earmark reform. The House has \npassed earmark reform as a House rule. We have passed the rule on the \nSenate side, but we have not adopted it. There is no reason to send a \nSenate rule that governs how we do business to a conference with the \nHouse. I wish to see this body accept this as a rule that has been \nunanimously voted on so we can move on to conference with lobby and \nethics reform.\n  I am not holding up ethics reform or lobbying reform; I am asking \nthis body to do what we have already voted on, and that is to accept \nthe rule that we will be transparent about earmarks and how we spend \nAmerican tax dollars.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I believe I have 15 minutes to speak \nin morning business; is that correct?\n\n[[Page S9074]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that time, plus the additional \ntime granted to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, the American people have demanded a \nnew direction in Iraq, and the momentum building toward that change is \nstrong. It is not difficult to understand why. More than 3,600 brave \nAmerican troops have lost their lives. Tens of thousands have returned \nhome gravely injured--gravely injured. The war now costs Americans $10 \nbillion every month in Iraq, with total spending now exceeding that of \nthe Vietnam war. It has ruined our international standing.\n  Despite all this, little has changed on the ground. Violence has \nworsened. Sectarian fighting goes on virtually unabated, with deadly \nattacks taking a severe and relentless toll. While courageous Americans \ndie, Iraqi politicians argue and stall.\n  Leaving U.S. troops caught in the morass of Iraq has not made that \ncountry more secure and, more important, it does not make our country \nmore secure. To stay President Bush's course will continue to cost our \nmen and women in uniform their lives and their physical and mental \nhealth. It will continue to drain our national Treasury and further \nerode what little good will remains for America around the world. It \nwill leave our military with overstrained troops, overstressed \nfamilies, and equipment and resources in disrepair. We are breaking our \nmilitary in Iraq.\n  It is time for a change. The American people know this. Democrats \nand, to their credit, many Republicans in this Congress know this. \nAnyone who is listening or looking with clear eyes knows this. Yet \nafter years of misjudgments, years of misleading slogans, years of \nmisplaced priorities, and years of failure, this President still \nrefuses to do what he must do: Change course in Iraq and bring our \ncourageous American troops home.\n  Just the other day, the President reasserted his intention to stay \nthe course, to continue this war indefinitely, an open-ended \ncommitment, a blank check, with no prospects for redeployment or a new \ndirection. Again, President Bush has failed to listen to the millions \nof Americans who have called on him and who have called on us to bring \nthe war to an end. Enough is enough. It is time for a change.\n  Mr. President, a Member of this body recently said this about our \nNation's course in Iraq:\n\n       In my judgment, the costs and risks of continuing down the \n     current path outweigh the potential benefits that might be \n     achieved. Persisting indefinitely with the surge strategy \n     will delay policy adjustments that have a better chance of \n     protecting our vital interests over the long-term.\n\n  I happen to agree with those words spoken by the very distinguished \nSenator, Richard Lugar of Indiana, but what I like the most about them \nis the voice of reason and thoughtfulness they impart to this debate. \nThere has been too little of that to date. The questions we face over \nthis war in Iraq are serious questions, and they demand seriousness and \nreason from those who would grapple with them. Senator Lugar's \nstatement reflects that thoughtfulness, reflects that reason, in the \nmidst of a debate which has all too often been characterized by a lack \nof those characteristics.\n  Look at this administration, which too often communicates not with \nreason but with slogans and sound bites: ``Stay the course.'' ``Global \nwar on terror.'' ``Cut and run.'' ``Precipitous withdrawal.'' People \nwatching this continuing debate, mark when you hear the phrase \n``precipitous withdrawal.'' You are hearing the end of reason, and \nsloganeering. This is no service to the people of our country, not when \nserious and difficult problems must be solved. Just look where this \nslogan leadership has gotten us so far. It is a dishonor roll of \nfailure: weapons of mass destruction, nonexistent; occupation planning, \nincompetence; reconstruction efforts, failed; the strain on our troops \nand their families, disabling; the treatment of our wounded troops, \ndisgraceful; expenditures, massive; fraud, run rampant; the confidence \nof the American people, forfeited after cascades of false optimism and \nphony good news.\n  It is time, as Senator Lugar's words exemplify, to pursue \nintelligent, thoughtful, and realistic decisions about our course in \nIraq, decisions that will protect our national interest. It is time to \nput the slogans away and thoughtfully extricate ourselves from a \ndisastrous mess.\n  I hope we can take these steps forward in the Senate together. I am \nencouraged that several Republican friends have stated clearly that \nthey cannot support the President's failed course in Iraq and are \nseeking real change.\n  As I have said many times in this Chamber, our strategy to effect \nchange in Iraq requires the rapid and responsible redeployment of our \ntroops. As I told the President directly when I met with him several \nmonths ago, I see the prospect of U.S. redeployment as the most \npowerful force at our disposal in this conflict now. That prospect of \nredeployment of American troops will eliminate the insurgents' argument \nthat America is an occupying army, taking away from them a powerful \nrecruiting tool for militant extremists. It will spur Iraq's political \nleaders to step forward, to quit slow-walking us through their own \ncivil war and take responsibility for the security and governance of \ntheir own country. It will confront neighboring nations with a real \nimpetus to assume more positive roles in assuring the region's \nstability. It will help restore the faith of the world in the \nleadership, the integrity, the good judgment, and the good will of our \ngreat country.\n  The President's surge plan is not the new direction Americans are \ncalling for. It is a tactic--a tactic that can only be effective as \npart of a larger coherent strategy. And strategy, in turn, largely \ndepends on whether the overarching dynamic works in America's favor. In \nthis regard, America is presently on the worst possible footing.\n  A redeployment of our troops creates the potential to change this \noverarching dynamic for the better, freeing us to focus on more \neffective strategies to counter al-Qaida and to stabilize the region. \nIraqi leaders will have to reach compromises with each other because \ntheir vision for their country's future will no longer be drawn with a \nmajor U.S. military presence in it. In the time it will take to bring \nour massive deployment of troops home, we can send a clear signal to \nIraqi leaders and to Iraq's neighbors that America is standing down and \nit is time for them to stand up. We can help them do that.\n  This is a critical step, and thoughtful, reasoned, political, and \ndiplomatic leadership will be essential to take advantage of the new \ndynamic a redeployment offers. I will confess that I am deeply troubled \nthat this administration may not have the credibility it needs to \naccomplish this difficult task, even if it were of a mind to try.\n  This Congress can help set favorable conditions for executive action. \nWe cannot legislate diligence, we cannot legislate thoughtfulness, we \ncannot legislate competence, and it is not clear that this \nadministration is viewed as capable of those qualities any longer. It \nmay take new faces and new voices to represent our country credibly in \nthis process. Fortunately, there are many talented and accomplished \npeople in this country whose perspectives and experience can help build \nAmerica's credibility and prestige around the world. It will be a \nsignificant diplomatic challenge, but it presents a significant--\nperhaps historic--diplomatic opportunity.\n  That executive responsibility--the need to put ourselves in that \ndiplomatic arena--does not relieve us in the Senate of our duty to \ncontinue to press forcefully on behalf of the millions of Americans who \ndemanded a change in Iraq, to apply reason, thought, and our best care \nand judgment to a problem that has not yielded to sloganeering. We will \nkeep the pressure on this President and his administration, whose \ninability to admit failure is leading our precious Nation deeper and \ndeeper into disaster in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first, what a remarkable ally the junior \nSenator from Rhode Island has been these few months he has been in the \nSenate. For his eloquence and help on many\n\n[[Page S9075]]\n\nissues--particularly this issue--I thank him. I greatly enjoyed \nlistening to his remarks.\n  It has been 52 months since military operations began in Iraq. We \nhave now been engaged in the Iraq war longer than we were in World War \nII. Approximately 3,600 Americans have died and 25,000 have been \nwounded. More than 4 million Iraqis have fled their homes, and tens of \nthousands, at a minimum, have been killed. With President Bush's surge \nwell underway, violence in Iraq has exploded to unprecedented levels \nand American troop fatalities are up 70 percent. In short, from all \nsides, the situation in Iraq is an unmitigated disaster.\n  As if that weren't bad enough, our national security continues to \nsuffer as the administration's single-minded focus on Iraq prevents us \nfrom adequately confronting threats of extremism and terrorism around \nthe globe. Indeed, violence and instability continue to fester \nelsewhere at a great cost to our national security.\n  Last November, when the American people cast their ballots, they \nexpressed their opposition to this war loudly and clearly. As the \nsituation continues to deteriorate, they have raised their voices still \nlouder. I know my colleagues hear their voices, as more and more of \nthem step forward to call for a long overdue change of course.\n  At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, those voices continue to \nfall on deaf ears. Time and again, the President has made it clear that \nnothing--not the wishes of the American people, not the advice of \nmilitary foreign policy experts, not the concerns of members of both \nparties--will discourage him from pursuing a misguided war that has no \nend in sight.\n  Congress cannot wait for this President to change course in Iraq \nbecause you and I know he has no intention of doing so. He has made it \nclear that he will continue to pursue massive military engagement \ndespite the wishes of the American people, despite the fact that our \nmilitary is stretched to the breaking point, and despite the fact that \nour presence in Iraq has been, according to our own State Department, \n``used as a rallying cry for radicalization and extremist activity in \nneighboring countries.''\n  So it is up to us in Congress to listen to the American people, to \nsave American lives, and to ensure our Nation's security by redeploying \nour troops from Iraq. We have the power and we have the responsibility \nto act, and to act now. That is why I will support the amendment \noffered by Senators Levin and Jack Reed. By passing binding deadlines \nfor both beginning and ending redeployment, the Senate can take a \nstrong step toward bringing our involvement in this war to a close.\n  I especially applaud Senators Hagel, Smith, and Snowe for putting \nprinciple ahead of party by cosponsoring this amendment. I hope their \nexample inspires still more Senators to realize that it is not enough \nto just criticize the war or just call on the President to change \ncourse and that we don't need to--in fact, we cannot afford to--wait \nfor more reports and more time before taking decisive action.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment doesn't go as far as I would like. I am \nconcerned that the exception in the amendment, particularly for \n``providing logistical support'' to Iraqi troops, would give the \nadministration too much wiggle room to ``repackage'' its military \nmission instead of redeploying our brave servicemembers. Nonetheless, I \nam pleased to see so many colleagues--on both sides of the aisle--\nrecognizing, at last, that the President's course in Iraq has failed, \nthat Congress needs to act, and that we can and must safely redeploy \nour troops.\n  Other amendments that have been proposed fall short because they \ndon't require the troops to be redeployed. It is not enough to pass \nsomething that sounds good but doesn't move us toward ending the war. \nWeak, feel-good amendments may give people political comfort, but that \nwon't last long. We can fool ourselves, but we can't fool the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, it is increasingly clear that the war in Iraq has \nbecome the defining aspect of our engagement in this part of the world \nand that it, coupled with this administration's inconsistent efforts to \npromote democracy and the rule of law, has unfortunately alienated and \nangered those whose support and cooperation we need if we are to \nprevail against al-Qaida and its allies.\n  Our role in the war in Iraq has generated a level of political \nturbulence throughout the region and beyond. It has given way to a new \nvariety of al-Qaida-style militants. These militants are gaining \nprominence in many countries that have traditionally been our allies. \nThe longer we remain in Iraq, the longer these new strains of extremism \nwill threaten the security of the region and, in turn, threaten our \nNation. As long as the President's policies continue, Iraq will \ncontinue to be what the declassified National Intelligence Estimate \ncalls a ``cause celebre'' for a new generation of terrorists.\n  Al-Qaida and its affiliates are not a one-country franchise. Yet this \nadministration continues to pretend otherwise, such as calling Iraq the \ncentral front in the war on terror. Al-Qaida's networks have not \nrelinquished their global fight to focus exclusively on Iraq. By \ndeploying our troops from Iraq, we can focus on developing a \ncomprehensive global strategy to combat them around the globe.\n  As I said, the administration's policies in Iraq are an unmitigated \ndisaster. But there is a way to mitigate that disaster, to lessen the \nburdens it is imposing on our troops, our national security, our \ntaxpayers, and our country. And that is to redeploy our troops from \nIraq.\n  There is no reason to delay this decision until September. We know \nnow what we will know then, and we know it isn't pretty. We have \nalready read in the Pentagon's first quarterly surge report that \nviolence has increased throughout much of the country in recent months, \nand we know there is no military solution to Iraq's problems. The only \nquestion is how long we are prepared to wait and how many Americans we \nare willing to have killed before we act.\n  As my colleagues know, the majority leader and I have introduced \nlegislation that would safely redeploy our troops by setting a date, \nafter which our funding for the war would be ended. That is what \nCongress did in 1993 with respect to our military mission in Somalia. I \ncontinue to believe we must be prepared to take that step again to \nfinally put an end to the war in Iraq.\n  However, if the Levin-Reed amendment wins the support of a majority \nof the Senate, I believe that will be an important step forward, and I \nwill likely not insist on a vote on the Feingold-Reid amendment at that \ntime. If our efforts to end the war don't succeed, however, I will \noffer Feingold-Reid as an amendment to the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill when it is considered by the Senate. Of course, I \nhope that will not be necessary, but it will depend on whether enough \nof my colleagues are prepared to back up their words with action, to \nlisten to the American people, and to say enough is enough.\n  This war doesn't make sense. It is hurting our country, and it is \ntime to end it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nAlabama may proceed in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9075-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9075-S9076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have great respect for my colleague, \nSenator Feingold. If I am not mistaken, he opposed the authorization of \nmilitary force in Iraq and has consistently opposed that policy. I am \nnot supportive of the Levin amendment. I think it would result in a \nprecipitous, irresponsible, and dangerous redeployment of our soldiers, \nconfusing to our allies, placing our soldiers who remain in Iraq at \ngreater risk, and placing the Iraqi soldiers, many of whom, indeed, are \nstanding with us right now to fight al-Qaida in Iraq, making their \nlives more dangerous. In fact, they are taking more casualties than we \nare. It is not correct to say they are not performing. We wish they \nwould perform much better. We wish the Government was stronger. But, in \nfact, we are at this very moment shoulder to shoulder in operation \nafter operation around Iraq.\n  I will note this. This is not a little, bitty nation we are leaders \nof. This is the United States of America, a great nation. Two months \nago, the Congress\n\n[[Page S9076]]\n\nof this great Nation voted to fund the surge in Iraq, and this Senate \nvoted 99 to 0 to confirm General Petraeus to lead that surge. We \nrequired an interim report on July 15 on how things are going and a \nmore serious, comprehensive report from General Petraeus himself in \nSeptember. OK? That is what we did, and that is what we are doing.\n  For the last, I believe, 3 weeks, the surge has been complete. For \nonly 3 weeks have we had the full complement of troops as part of this \nsurge. Already some things have happened militarily that are good in \nIraq.\n  So before we get the general's report in September, without anything \nother than our own opinions from reading newspapers and watching TV and \nsitting in our air-conditioned offices, we are now going to come along \nand abrogate what this great Nation did 2 months ago because of some \npolitical pressure or some spot they saw on the evening news, placing \nour soldiers at risk, undermining the policies we are asking them to \nexecute at this very moment. Even pushing for that at this time I think \nis irresponsible.\n  I wish to be on record as saying I understand the difficulties we are \nfacing in Iraq. I understand the courage our soldiers are displaying. I \nunderstand the risks they are subjected to right now, and we want to \nsee the situation improve. All of us do. But we voted for this policy. \nThe surge has just started. We need to give General Petraeus a chance \nto proceed with it and not flop around irresponsibly and come up with a \nwithdrawal policy that is so rapid that I am not even sure the military \ncan effectively carry it out under the Levin amendment. As a matter of \nfact, they cannot effectively carry it out.\n  Mr. President, I guess we are still in morning business. I see my \ncolleague, Senator Nelson from Florida, whom I respect so greatly. He \nchairs the Strategic Subcommittee of which I am pleased to be the \nranking member.\n  I believe I am to be recognized in a few minutes on a separate \namendment, but if Senator Nelson has some comments he would like to \nmake at this time, I will consider yielding to him and see what our \nschedule is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9076-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes amendment \n     numbered 2024, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1218. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES ON PROTECTION OF THE \n                   UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES AGAINST IRANIAN \n                   BALLISTIC MISSILES.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress finds that Iran maintains a nuclear \n     program in continued defiance of the international community \n     while developing ballistic missiles of increasing \n     sophistication and range that pose a threat to both the \n     forward-deployed forces of the United States and to its North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies in Europe; and \n     which eventually could pose a threat to the United States \n     homeland.\n       (b) Policy of the United States.--It is the policy of the \n     United States--\n       (1) to develop and deploy, as soon as technologically \n     possible, in conjunction with its allies and other nations \n     whenever possible, effective defense against the threat from \n     Iran described in subsection (a)(1) that will provide \n     protection for the United States, its friends, and its North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization allies; and\n       (2) to proceed in the development of such response in a \n     manner such that any missile defenses fielded by the United \n     States in Europe are integrated with or complementary to \n     missile defense capabilities that might be fielded by the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nKyl, Dole, Inhofe, and Thune be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9077]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I don't know if my colleague from \nFlorida wants to make a comment now.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. After the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be glad to yield to Senator Nelson if he wishes \nto share some thoughts.\n  The amendment offered today, simply put, acknowledges that we have a \ngrowing threat to peace and security that arises from Iran's nuclear \nand missile program, and this amendment would make it the policy of the \nUnited States to develop effective defenses against this threat as soon \nas possible.\n  The amendment also emphasizes the need to ensure that the defenses we \ndeploy are coordinated with existing programs of our NATO allies. A \nnumber of Senators and Members of the House want to be sure that we \ncoordinate with the NATO allies, and this amendment would call for \nthat.\n  Sadly, the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to threaten the United \nStates and our allies and that threat must be recognized and \nconfronted. My amendment signals the resolve of the United States to do \nthat. At a time when Iran is openly threatening to destroy the United \nStates and our various allies--and is providing weapons, such as \nexplosively formed penetrators, or EFPs, which we have pretty clearly \ntraced to Iran today, and that are killing our soldiers in Iraq and \nAfghanistan--demonstrating our understanding of the seriousness of \ntheir threat and their purpose is critical for us to have clear \nthinking and sound policy. So I appreciate my colleagues, such as \nSenator Lieberman, who spoke eloquently and offered an amendment on the \nneed to confront Iran's support of worldwide terrorism, which we voted \non yesterday--in a very strong vote.\n  I see missile defense as another facet of confronting and facing this \nthreat. Even in the Middle East, where anti-Israel sentiments are all \ntoo common, Iran is the only country in the Middle East where the \nPresident openly calls for the destruction of Israel. Shortly after \ntaking office in 2005, Ahmadi-Nejad, the President, rallied supporters \nat a conference, and the conference was called ``A World Without \nZionism.'' In that speech he said, ``The current skirmishes in the \noccupied land are part of a war of destiny. The outcome of hundreds of \nyears of war will be defined in Palestinian land. As the Imam said''--\nand here he is referring to the Ayatollah Khomeini--``Israel must be \nwiped off the map.''\n  But Israel isn't the only target of Iran's crash program to develop \nlong-range missiles with nuclear warheads--long-range missiles they are \nnow developing. He is developing also nuclear warheads. In the same \nspeech Ahmadi-Nejad was quoted as saying this: ``Anybody who recognizes \nIsrael will burn in the fire of the Islamic nation's fury.''\n  That includes, of course, the United States--us--and our allies in \nEurope and the Middle East. For anyone who doubts that Ahmadi-Nejad's \nthreat was meant to include America, he has also been quoted as saying \nthis: ``And God willing, with the force of God behind it, we shall soon \nexperience a world without the United States and Zionism.''\n  A world without the United States. It does not get much more \nstraightforward than that. Arnaud de Borchgrave, an experienced world \nobserver and editor at large of the Washington Times and United Press \nInternational, had a piece in the Washington Times yesterday, and he \npointed out some of the examples of the kind of extremism, real \nextremism, we have seen from the Iranian leadership.\n  Now, let me say this: The Iranian people are good people. They have \nquite an educated population, certainly for that area of the world. \nThere is no need and no justification for Iranian leadership to betray \nthose people, the people of that historic nation, with these kinds of \npolicies. In truth, President Ahmadi-Nejad and certain clerics are \ndamaging the history, the economy, the people, and the reputation of \nIran. There is no reason for this. It should not continue. \nUnfortunately, it is reality. And while we can hope for change, change \ndoes not seem likely in the short run.\n  While the people of Iran may, and I think do, oppose this extremism, \nthe President and the extremists, certain mullahs and others, seem to \nbe firmly in control of the country and determined to pursue a radical \nand extremist ideology and policy. It is not only a tragedy for Iran \nthat this is occurring but for the whole world.\n  Mr. de Borchgrave lists some of the statements that are more than \nsufficient to alert the world to the dangers and the intentions of the \nleaders of Iran today. This is what he wrote yesterday, and I quote:\n\n       Whether Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad said he wants \n     to wipe Israel off the map is still contested, even by anti-\n     mullah Iranian-Americans. But that he wants to wipe out the \n     Jewish state, there can be no doubt. As he completes his \n     visits to every Iranian town, the collection of his \n     pronunciamentos is edifying reading.\n       Culled from a wide variety of sources, ranging from the \n     Agence France Presse, the French national news agency, to the \n     London Daily Telegraph, to the Suddeutsche Zeitung Online, to \n     France's Le Monde and Liberation, Mr. Ahmadi-Nejad spells out \n     the target and the strategy: ``This regime--here he is \n     talking about Israel--will one day disappear. The Zionist \n     regime is a rotten tree that will be blown away by one storm. \n     The countdown for the destruction of Israel has begun. \n     Zionists are the personification of Satan.''\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       In the case of any unwise move by the fake regime of \n     Israel, Iran's response will be so destructive and quick the \n     regime will regret its move forever. The west invented the \n     myth of the massacre of the Jews (in World War II) and placed \n     it above Allah, religions, and profits.\n\n  So he continues to assert that the Holocaust was a myth, invented by \nthe West.\n  What about his strategic plan?\n\n       We don't shy away from declaring Islam is ready to rule the \n     world. The wave of the Islamist revolution will soon reach \n     the entire world. Our revolution's main mission is to pave \n     the way for the reappearance of the 12th Imam, the Mahdi, a \n     5-year-old boy who vanished 1,100 years ago and who will lead \n     the world into an era of peace and prosperity, but not before \n     the planet is first convulsed by death and destruction.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Soon, Islam will become the dominating force in the world \n     occupying first place in the number of followers among other \n     religions. Is there a craft more beautiful, more sublime, \n     more divine than the craft of giving yourself to martyrdom \n     and becoming holy? Do not doubt, Allah will prevail and Islam \n     will conquer mountaintops of the entire world. Islam can \n     recruit hundreds of suicide bombers a day. Suicide is an \n     invincible weapon. Suicide bombers in this land showed us the \n     way and they enlighten our future. The will to commit suicide \n     is one of the best ways of life.\n\n  This is the President of a country that is steadfastly moving forward \nto develop nuclear weapons and steadfastly advancing its ability to \nlaunch intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n  What does he say about nuclear power?\n\n       By the grace of Allah we will be a nuclear power and Iran \n     does not give a damn about the IEA, the International Energy \n     Agency, their demands to freeze enrichment of nuclear fuel. \n     Iran does not give a damn about resolutions.\n\n  That is the U.N. Resolutions. Those are his words. There are other \ncomments. He goes on to say, as I indicated earlier, at this conference \non the world without Zionism--the President of Iran said:\n\n       To those who doubt, to those who say it is not possible, I \n     say accomplishment of a world without America and Israel is \n     both possible and feasible.\n\n  You can say this is an exaggeration. You can say this is not \nrealistic. But I suggest that is the repeated statements of the leader \nof a very dangerous nation, a nation with real capabilities. They are \ndeveloping a nuclear capability and an expanding and growing missile \ncapability. I think yesterday Senator Lieberman, after the vote on his \namendment, summed it up very well. This is what he said:\n\n       The threat posed by Iran to our soldiers, to our allies, to \n     our national security is a truth that cannot be wished or \n     waved away. Congress today began the process of confronting \n     it.\n\n  We also need to take one more step in that process by making clear \nthat we are not going to leave our Nation or our allies in Europe \nvulnerable to any missile threats from Iran.\n  Most Senators were in the room a few weeks ago when the Director of \nNational Intelligence, ADM Mike McConnell, gave us a classified \nbriefing and described in detail the threat posed by Iran. Having \nreceived that briefing, I think few of us would doubt that Iran does \npose a threat to the security of the United States and our allies. It \nis a threat to us. It is not something we need to be intimidated about. \nWe don't need to back down to Iran. Militarily\n\n[[Page S9078]]\n\nthere is no doubt in the mind of this Senator or any objective \nobserver's mind what would happen if a conflict developed here. But we \nneed to be realistic, we need to seek to avoid conflict, but we need to \npursue policies that will make sure we don't allow our citizens to fall \nunder a risk of a nuclear missile attack.\n  So they are pursuing, under Ahmadi-nejad's leadership, the means to \nkill millions of people with the single push of a button. When Iran's \nShehab-3 missiles are paraded through the streets of Iran, they are \ndraped with banners stating, ``Israel must be wiped off the map.'' That \nis what they put on their missiles. With a range of 1,300 kilometers \nand a payload capacity of over 700 kilograms, the Shehab-3 has the \ncapacities to implement Ahmadi-Nejad's genocidal agenda. Iran is also \nworking hard to develop missiles that can reach Europe and the States. \nThe Shehab-4 is well along in development and will reportedly be able \nto reach most of continental Europe. The Shehab-5 and Shehab-6 have \nalso been discussed in open sources. They are developing those advanced \nmissiles. These sources claim these models will have the capacity to \nreach the eastern seaboard of the United States.\n  Iran's ability to develop nuclear warheads for those missiles are \nproceeding apace as well. In April, in a speech at the Natanz nuclear \nenrichment facility, there in Iran, Ahmadi-Nejad stated:\n\n       I declare that as of today our dear country has joined the \n     nuclear club of nations and can produce nuclear fuel on an \n     industrial scale.\n\n  International Atomic Energy Agency later confirmed that Iranian \nenrichment capabilities were developing rapidly while our knowledge and \nunderstanding of their nuclear program was decreasing. This uncertainty \nis very disturbing.\n  Yesterday, the Washington Post reported the construction of an \nunderground tunnel complex near its enrichment facilities at Natanz. It \nappears, therefore, that Iran is preparing to protect and hide its \nnuclear capabilities.\n  Nothing about Iran's behavior recently suggests that it will use \nthese capabilities in a responsible manner. In fact, to the contrary, \nwe expect Ahmadinejad to use nuclear-tipped missiles to threaten, \nblackmail, and terrorize the nations that oppose its radical agenda and \nusing them, actually using them based on some of the extreme statements \nhe has made, cannot be placed out of the question.\n  We all remember last March when Iran seized 15 British sailors and \nheld them as hostages. Imagine a time in the not-too-distant future \nwhen Iran could take the whole city of London as a hostage with a \nnuclear threat. According to reports in the Washington Post, the \nintelligence community assesses that Iran's ICBMs and its nuclear \nweapons capability will both mature in 2015. That is not that far away. \nAs a result, the cities of the eastern seaboard and of Europe are \nexpected to face the threat of nuclear attack from Iran in less than 8 \nyears.\n  Keep in mind that 2015 is the midpoint of the estimated range. Iran's \ncapability could come online in 2017, later, or even by 2013, if things \nproceed faster than expected. That may seem like a long way away, but \nan adequate defense will take a long time to build and we need to start \nnow. According to the Missile Defense Agency, even if Congress fully \nfunded the European defense site--which I hope that we will. We refer \nto it as the ``third site,'' and it is funded every year--the system \nwould not be up and running until 2013. Any delay to that schedule--\nwhich could happen for a number of reasons--could open up a window of \nvulnerability during which Iran would have the means to attack us and \nour allies, perhaps with nuclear weapons, and we will have no means of \ndefending the American people or our allies against them.\n\n  The good news is we have it in our power to prevent this window of \nvulnerability and keep it from opening if we commit as a nation to \ndoing so. My amendment represents an opportunity for the Senate to go \non record with such a commitment. An effective missile defense, which \nwe would promptly begin to deploy, could convince the Iranian \nleadership that developing such missiles for their nuclear weapons is a \nfutile undertaking. Perhaps we may have already missed, however, that \nopportunity to actually deter them in this way, making it all the more \nimportant that we get moving on development of the means to defend \nourselves and our allies.\n  This amendment is more than about setting U.S. policy on missile \ndefense, it is about sending a message to the rest of the world, our \nfriends and enemies alike, that we take this Iranian threat seriously \nand we intend to stand up to it. The debate over the third site is \nbeing watched with great interest around the world. Some may be drawing \nconclusions about our commitment to meet this threat head on and \ndoubting that we are committed. In fact, I will note that we \neffectively deployed and continue to upgrade a national missile defense \nsystem that can meet the North Korean missile threat, which is somewhat \nmore advanced than Iran's but not a lot. We know we have this \ncapability and we should do it with Iran also.\n  Imagine sitting in Mr. Ahmadi-nejad's shoes today. He provides \nsophisticated weapons to our enemies in Iraq, killing hundreds of \nAmerican troops in the process. In response, one of our colleagues \nproposed legislation to prohibit the President from attacking Iran \nwithout congressional authorization. Ahmadinejad rushes headlong toward \na nuclear weapon and long-range delivery capability and both the Senate \nand the House cut funding for missile defenses that could neutralize \nthe threat. Ahmadi-Nejad must not feel like his bluster and threats \nwill be effective.\n  They will not be. Imagine the conclusions that Vladimir Putin is \ndrawing from those media reports. In February of 2007, Mr. Putin and \nthe Russian Army Chief of Staff, Yury Baluyevsky, threatened to \nunilaterally withdraw from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, \nwhich prohibits the United States and Russia from deploying arsenals of \nshort- and medium-range missiles in Europe. Mr. Putin later suspended \nRussia's obligations under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, \nwhich historically allowed NATO and the Warsaw Pact to remove much of \nthe military personnel and material that was arrayed along Europe's \ncentral front during the height of the Cold War.\n  Finally, in June of this year, Putin directly threatened to focus \nRussia's nuclear arsenal on ``new targets in Europe.'' Putin claimed \nthat ``the strategic balance in the world is being upset'' and that \nRussia ``will be creating a system of countering that anti-missile \nsystem.''\n  These threats coincided with Russian tests of an advanced ICBM, the \nRS-24, by Russia.\n  It ought not. Of course, any third site in Europe will be ineffective \nagainst the massive missile capability of Russia. We don't have any \ncapability of doing that. We can create a system that will be very \neffective against anything the Iranians can do in the decades to come \nbut not Russia. Our plans have no intention of affecting Russia. But we \nalso need not be affected by Mr. Putin's bluster or that we be slowed \ndown in our legitimate interests in protecting our country and our \nallies from Iranian threats by these kinds of comments from the \nRussians.\n  We reduced somewhat--not greatly--but $84 million in funding for the \nthird site in Europe. Colleagues felt that money could not be \neffectively spent. They did not believe it was necessary in this year's \nbudget. The problem might be that some would conclude the action by our \ncommittee in taking those steps to trim the budget would be a plan to \nkill missile defenses in Europe.\n  Yesterday, an article in the Christian Science Monitor entitled \n``Obstacles Ahead for Missile Defense,'' stated the Senate was opposed \nto building defenses against Iranian missiles, in effect, saying:\n\n       In Washington, the Democratic-controlled Congress appears \n     reluctant to fund the move, scrambling its near-term \n     prospects.\n\n  I don't think that is true. I think there is bipartisan support for \ncreating a missile defense system, but a firm belief exists on the part \nof my Democratic colleagues that we should not go so fast that it is \nnot done wisely.\n  We have reached a proposal in the legislation as written that we can \nlive with. However, there has been some confusion as to our seriousness \nin this commitment.\n\n[[Page S9079]]\n\n  In fact, on July 5 the Washington Post ran an article entitled, \n``Senate Panel Faults Missile Defense Plan.'' In the article, the Post \nstates:\n\n       Democrats in Congress are building a legislative roadblock \n     for the Bush administration's plan to place elements of a \n     missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic.\n\n  It is an incorrect perception. It undermines our alliance \nrelationships by causing our allies to think we are not committed in a \nserious way to building a missile defense system that would be \neffective against Iranian attacks and be protective of Europe. So I \nthink it is therefore incumbent upon us to clarify the Senate's stance.\n  The Poles and the Czechs and other NATO allies have all undertaken \nthe momentous challenge of winning over their populations to the idea \nof American missile defenses in Europe. They have battled anti-\nAmericanism, pressure from Europe and Russia, because they value our \nfriendship, but more importantly because they realize Europe may soon \nbe vulnerable to Iranian nuclear intimidation and potential nuclear \nattack unless steps are taken to develop defenses now.\n  I think it would be a slap in the face and unbefitting to our Nation \nif we were to pull the rug out from under these projects after our \nallies have stepped up and been supportive of them. We cannot stand \nidly by, my colleagues, when a madman threatens to destroy the United \nStates and to wipe from the map allies of the United States, then \ndefies the international community by developing the means to carry out \nthese threats.\n  We are the most powerful military in the world, but some people doubt \nour seriousness and our commitment. In the Middle East, in particular, \nthis perception of weakness can be a fatal error. So I think it is \nappropriate for us to make clear to Iran and to Russia and to our \nallies worldwide that we understand that the Iranian danger is clear \nand present.\n  We must leave no uncertainty in anyone's mind that we intend to \ndefend ourselves and our allies from this threat. Our security, the \nsecurity of our allies, and the credibility of our commitments are all \nat stake. I will just add that while the Iranian actions are very \ntroubling, they should be taken very seriously. Iran's words cannot be \nignored.\n  I would say one thing further. We have no reason to be intimidated by \nIran. We have the capability of defending ourselves, our military, and \nour interests, and the leaders in Iran need to know this. This Senator \nis prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to defend our national \ninterests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, with regard to the Sessions \namendment, it would establish a U.S. policy concerning defense against \nIranian ballistic missiles stating that the United States will develop \nand deploy effectively defenses against Iranian ballistic missiles as \nsoon as technologically possible.\n  I think everyone agrees with that idea. I would suggest that this is \neffectively our policy today, and, indeed, is the policy of the bill \nand is so stated in the bill before us, that we are already developing \nand deploying a number of missile defense programs to provide such \neffective defenses.\n  For example, the United States has already deployed the Patriot PAC-3 \nsystem to the region to provide defensive capability for our forward-\ndeployed forces in the region. We are also developing and deploying the \nAEGIS BMD system, and we are developing the THAAD system. All of these \nsystems will provide effective defense capability against Iran's \nexisting and near-term missile capabilities.\n  However, we do not have sufficient capability today with these \nsystems to provide the level of protection that our combatant \ncommanders need. Our senior military commanders readily acknowledge \nthat fact, including the combatant commander of the U.S. Strategic \nCommand, General Cartwright. He is responsible for global integrated \nmissile defense. He readily acknowledges that fact.\n  For that reason, the bill before the Senate authorizes an additional \n$315 million to increase or accelerate these three crucial near-term \nmissile defense programs. And what they do is to provide increased \nprotection for our forward-deployed forces, our allies, and our friends \nin the region.\n  In other words, we are already putting this policy in effect. That is \nthe true measure of our determination to provide effective defenses \nagainst Iran's ballistic missiles.\n  Now, I understand the Republican leader wants to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, would the Senator yield 1 minute for my \nresponse?\n  I thank Senator Nelson for his comments. I agree with him that, \nproperly read, our legislation does what he says. But I even had a \nmilitary person think that perhaps we had done something to weaken our \ncommitment. I think others, such as the Washington Post, may have \noverinterpreted some of the things that are in that language. I believe \nthis would be a good way to clarify our policy. I thank him for his \nleadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before I speak on the amendment \nconcerning the withdrawal from Iraq offered by Senator Levin, I would \nlike to make a few comments about the benchmarks report required by the \nsupplemental bill that was signed in May and released by the President \njust this morning.\n  We knew when the Senate passed the conference report that according \nto the legislation we were requiring a benchmark report in July and a \nbenchmark report in September. Why were these dates important? First, \nwe knew that July was important because the Baghdad security plan is \nnow fully manned, something that was achieved less than 1 month ago.\n  Congress wanted to send a clear signal to the Iraqi Government that \nfull cooperation and sacrifice in executing the Baghdad security plan \nwas imperative and that the hard work of political compromise must \nbegin. We have done that.\n  Second, General Petraeus informed the Senate that he and Ambassador \nCrocker would provide an assessment of the counterinsurgency plan to \nthe President, as we all know, in September. Having heard that, the \nSenate thought it reasonable that we would be provided the same \nassessment and that we could form a reasoned legislative response to \nthat report.\n  What have we learned? We have learned that progress is mixed, that \nmany of our military tasks assigned to the military have been achieved, \nand that we have not seen sufficient progress on the political \nbenchmarks. The Congress decided in May that 1 month of a fully manned \nsurge was an insufficient period to call the Petraeus plan a success or \na failure. Certainly, the young soldiers and marines risking their \nlives today on the streets of Baghdad and Ramadi would agree, and they \ndeserve our patience.\n  Some of our colleagues have quite reasonably refrained from drafting \nnew amendments that would revisit the actions taken by this Senate back \nin May until they have at least reviewed the benchmarks report \ndelivered just today.\n  I would encourage my colleagues to review the report, as I intend to, \nand to hear what General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have to say in \nSeptember. There is much at stake and, frankly, they deserve to be \nheard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2087\n\n  Now on another matter, Mr. President, the Senate will soon take up \nthe Levin amendment. But before we do, I think it is important that we \ntake a look at what it says.\n  The Levin amendment says:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall commence the reduction of \n     the number of United States forces in Iraq not later than 120 \n     days after the date of enactment of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Now, exactly what would this reduction involve--10,000 troops, \n20,000, 50,000, all of them? Can we at least get maybe a ballpark \nfigure? The Levin amendment does not quite give us one. It only says \nU.S. forces will have a ``limited presence'' after this reduction. What \nis a ``limited presence''?\n  Does it mean limiting our presence in Al Anbar, which everyone agrees \nhas been a stunning success in our fight against al-Qaida? Does it mean \nlimiting our presence in Baghdad? In the\n\n[[Page S9080]]\n\nKurdish areas to the north? What does ``limited presence'' mean? The \nLevin amendment does not say. We are left to guess.\n  The Levin amendment says the members of our Armed Forces will only be \nfree to protect the United States and coalition personnel and \ninfrastructure, to train Iraqi security forces, and to engage in \ntargeted counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida. What does \n``targeted'' mean? The Levin amendment does not tell us.\n  It says:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall complete the transition of \n     United States forces to a limited presence and missions by \n     April 30.\n\n  But how will we know when he has completed the transition? And how \nmany forces would have to be moved in order for the Secretary of \nDefense to comply with the bill's mandate to complete it? The amendment \nis silent on that question as well.\n  If there were more to this amendment, I might have more questions, \nbut there is not. That is it. The supposedly groundbreaking policy \nshift that the Democratic majority has been circling around is nothing \nmore than a page and a half of vague policy proposals; in fact, an \nempty shell. Do they really expect us to send this to conference and to \nsee what might happen? That is wise war policy? That is a responsible \nalternative to the current policy? That is the alternative they give us \nto the Petraeus plan, a doctrine that has been widely acclaimed as the \nlast word on counterinsurgency, which is showing signs of success less \nthan a month after it was fully manned?\n  Look, Democrats and Republicans voted to go into Iraq based on the \nsame intelligence the President had. It is dishonest and it is \nunhelpful to turn every debate on this war into a discussion of how and \nwhy we entered it in the first place.\n  More than 150,000 American troops are there. They are now fighting \nthe same group that attacked and killed thousands of innocent Americans \non \n9/11, who attacked many others before and since, and who are plotting \nto kill thousands more even as we speak. There is one thing we should \nbe concerned about in discussing this war, and it is the one thing we \nnever hear about from the other side; that is, inning the fight against \nal-Qaida.\n  Now, the President has recognized that previous strategy failed to \nfocus on the insurgency and al-Qaida. He changed course. Now we are \nfighting them head on with the Petraeus plan. At full manning, this \nstrategy has been in place for less than a month. We will get a report \non its progress in September. What sense does it make to short-circuit \nthat strategy right now, especially when the only alternative we are \ngetting from the other side is a page and a half of questions.\n  Yesterday, the spokesman for the Multi-National Force in Iraq gave us \nan update on al-Qaida's operations in Iraq. He reminded us that al-\nQaida members refer to Iraq as their central front. This is al-Qaida \nmembers who say it is their central front. He told us al-Qaida and its \naffiliates are the greatest source of the spectacular attacks that are \nfueling sectarian violence in Iraq.\n  He told us that in recent months, more and more Iraqis have started \nto reject al-Qaida and its ideology and are finally fighting back. \nTroops are getting good, actionable intelligence from these people \nwhich they are using to disrupt al-Qaida networks and safe havens in \nand around Baghdad. He showed us a chart that illustrated some of our \nrecent successes against the enemy. Our Armed Forces in Iraq killed or \ncaptured 26 high-level al-Qaida leaders in May and June alone. Eleven \nof them were emirs who were city or local al-Qaida leaders; seven were \nsmuggling foreigners, weapons, and money into Iraq; five were cell \nleaders; and three were leaders of IED networks. Last month, our troops \nuncovered an al-Qaida media hub near Samarra. They have concluded that \nbetween 80 and 90 percent of suicide attacks in Iraq are carried out by \nforeign-born terrorists who have killed some 4,000 Iraqi citizens just \nover the last 6 months.\n  These are some of the concrete realities on the ground. This is what \nis actually happening, not what people over here seem to be talking \nabout. We are fighting al-Qaida head-on, and we are making progress. \nWould the Levin amendment force us to turn our backs on al-Qaida again? \nWe have no idea. It really doesn't say. But it could. That is something \nwe should all keep in mind as we begin this debate, whether we are \nwilling to go with this or with the Petraeus plan.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support the provisions in the 2008 \nDefense authorization bill that seek to prevent premature deployment of \nmissile defenses in Europe, and I continue to have serious concerns \nabout the operational effectiveness and cost of these technologies. I \nvoted for the amendment offered by Senator Sessions because Iran may \ndevelop the capacity to threaten our allies with nuclear weapons and \nbecause the amendment supports development of an ``effective defense'' \nwhen it is ``technologically possible.'' I will continue encouraging \nthe administration to work with the international community to engage \ndirectly with Iran.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Sessions amendment No. \n2024, as modified, be set aside until 4 p.m. today and that no \namendment be in order to the Sessions amendment; that at 4 p.m. today, \nthere be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled between \nSenator Sessions and myself or our designees; that upon the use of that \ntime, without further intervening action or debate, the Senate proceed \nto vote in relation to the Sessions amendment, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, but I \nwould like to clarify with the chairman that we intend to not only take \nup the wounded warrior amendment but also, if there are other \namendments, if we debate and discuss wounded warrior and there is time \nfor that--we want to tell our colleagues that there are some 98 pending \namendments that have not been addressed as of yet, and we would like to \naddress those as soon as possible since we will obviously have a very \nbusy week on this bill next week as well as today. We have 4\\1/2\\ hours \nbetween now and the next vote.\n  My other question to the distinguished chairman is, Is it his desire \nthat we perhaps have another amendment that could be voted on at that \ntime?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona. It is our \nhope that we can complete the debate on the wounded warriors \nlegislation. I did intend to offer that as soon as this unanimous \nconsent agreement is agreed to. Those who wish to speak on the wounded \nwarrior legislation we invite to come to the floor in the next few \nhours. If the debate on that legislation is completed before 4 o'clock, \nthe Senator from Arizona is correct, we would then, hopefully, have a \nvote on the wounded warriors amendment immediately after the vote on \nthe Sessions amendment. If debate on the wounded warriors legislation \nis completed before 4 o'clock, as he indicated, there would then be an \nopportunity for another amendment to be offered as designated by the \nranking member. I believe, in terms of alternating, it is now our turn. \nI will be offering, on behalf of many Senators, on a bipartisan basis \nthe wounded warrior legislation. Then it is our understanding the next \namendment would be from the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Michigan. I understand there \nwere already several amendments to the wounded warrior legislation, \nwhich have been accepted on both sides, which we will be presenting. I \nwould ask the indulgence of the chairman to make a brief statement \nbefore we take up the wounded warrior amendment bill. Would that be OK? \nIt is not on wounded warrior.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection whatsoever to Senator McCain being \nrecognized immediately after our UC is accepted--if it is--for a \nstatement. Then it would be the understanding that I\n\n[[Page S9081]]\n\nwould then be recognized to introduce the wounded warrior amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nMichigan. I know he shares my concern about the work that needs to be \ndone in the next few days to try to get this bill completed. We do urge \nour colleagues to come forth with relevant amendments. As I mentioned, \nthere are at this time, obviously, a number of amendments my colleagues \nwill want considered and debated, including two very big amendments on \nIraq, the Salazar-Alexander amendment, as well as the Reed-Levin \namendment which I am sure will take up considerable time. Before we \nmove to the wounded warrior bill, which I praise for its bipartisanship \nand its effort to bring together both sides of the aisle to address one \nof the most compelling issues of our time, and that is the treatment of \nthe men and women who are serving in the military--I will have more \nremarks about that later--I would like to draw my colleagues' attention \nto an editorial that ran last Sunday in the New York Times titled ``The \nRoad Home.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that editorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 8, 2007]\n\n                             The Road Home\n\n       It is time for the United States to leave Iraq, without any \n     more delay than the Pentagon needs to organize an orderly \n     exit.\n       Like many Americans, we have put off that conclusion, \n     waiting for a sign that President Bush was seriously trying \n     to dig the United States out of the disaster he created by \n     invading Iraq without sufficient cause, in the face of global \n     opposition, and without a plan to stabilize the country \n     afterward.\n       At first, we believed that after destroying Iraq's \n     government, army, police and economic structures, the United \n     States was obliged to try to accomplish some of the goals Mr. \n     Bush claimed to be pursuing, chiefly building a stable, \n     unified Iraq. When it became clear that the president had \n     neither the vision nor the means to do that, we argued \n     against setting a withdrawal date while there was still some \n     chance to mitigate the chaos that would most likely follow.\n       While Mr. Bush scorns deadlines, he kept promising \n     breakthroughs--after elections, after a constitution, after \n     sending in thousands more troops. But those milestones came \n     and went without any progress toward a stable, democratic \n     Iraq or a path for withdrawal. It is frighteningly clear that \n     Mr. Bush's plan is to stay the course as long as he is \n     president and dump the mess on his successor. Whatever his \n     cause was, it is lost.\n       The political leaders Washington has backed are incapable \n     of putting national interests ahead of sectarian score \n     settling. The security forces Washington has trained behave \n     more like partisan militias. Additional military forces \n     poured into the Baghdad region have failed to change \n     anything.\n       Continuing to sacrifice the lives and limbs of American \n     soldiers is wrong. The war is sapping the strength of the \n     nation's alliances and its military forces. It is a dangerous \n     diversion from the life-and-death struggle against \n     terrorists. It is an increasing burden on American taxpayers, \n     and it is a betrayal of a world that needs the wise \n     application of American power and principles.\n       A majority of Americans reached these conclusions months \n     ago. Even in politically polarized Washington, positions on \n     the war no longer divide entirely on party lines. When \n     Congress returns this week, extricating American troops from \n     the war should be at the top of its agenda.\n       That conversation must be candid and focused. Americans \n     must be clear that Iraq, and the region around it, could be \n     even bloodier and more chaotic after Americans leave. There \n     could be reprisals against those who worked with American \n     forces, further ethnic cleansing, even genocide. Potentially \n     destabilizing refugee flows could hit Jordan and Syria. Iran \n     and Turkey could be tempted to make power grabs. Perhaps most \n     important, the invasion has created a new stronghold from \n     which terrorist activity could proliferate.\n       The administration, the Democratic-controlled Congress, the \n     United Nations and America's allies must try to mitigate \n     those outcomes--and they may fail. But Americans must be \n     equally honest about the fact that keeping troops in Iraq \n     will only make things worse. The nation needs a serious \n     discussion, now, about how to accomplish a withdrawal and \n     meet some of the big challenges that will arise.\n       The United States has about 160,000 troops and millions of \n     tons of military gear inside Iraq. Getting that force out \n     safely will be a formidable challenge. The main road south to \n     Kuwait is notoriously vulnerable to roadside bomb attacks. \n     Soldiers, weapons and vehicles will need to be deployed to \n     secure bases while airlift and sealift operations are \n     organized. Withdrawal routes will have to be guarded. The \n     exit must be everything the invasion was not: based on \n     reality and backed by adequate resources.\n       The United States should explore using Kurdish territory in \n     the north of Iraq as a secure staging area. Being able to use \n     bases and ports in Turkey would also make withdrawal faster \n     and safer. Turkey has been an inconsistent ally in this war, \n     but like other nations, it should realize that shouldering \n     part of the burden of the aftermath is in its own interest.\n       Accomplishing all of this in less than six months is \n     probably unrealistic. The political decision should be made, \n     and the target date set, now.\n       Despite President Bush's repeated claims, Al Qaeda had no \n     significant foothold in Iraq before the invasion, which gave \n     it new base camps, new recruits and new prestige.\n       This war diverted Pentagon resources from Afghanistan, \n     where the military had a real chance to hunt down Al Qaeda's \n     leaders. It alienated essential allies in the war against \n     terrorism. It drained the strength and readiness of American \n     troops.\n       And it created a new front where the United States will \n     have to continue to battle terrorist forces and enlist local \n     allies who reject the idea of an Iraq hijacked by \n     international terrorists. The military will need resources \n     and bases to stanch this self-inflicted wound for the \n     foreseeable future.\n       The United States could strike an agreement with the Kurds \n     to create those bases in northeastern Iraq. Or, the Pentagon \n     could use its bases in countries like Kuwait and Qatar, and \n     its large naval presence in the Persian Gulf, as staging \n     points.\n       There are arguments for, and against, both options. Leaving \n     troops in Iraq might make it too easy--and too tempting--to \n     get drawn back into the civil war and confirm suspicions that \n     Washington's real goal was to secure permanent bases in Iraq. \n     Mounting attacks from other countries could endanger those \n     nations' governments.\n       The White House should make this choice after consultation \n     with Congress and the other countries in the region, whose \n     opinions the Bush administration has essentially ignored. The \n     bottom line: the Pentagon needs enough force to stage \n     effective raids and airstrikes against terrorist forces in \n     Iraq, but not enough to resume large-scale combat.\n       One of Mr. Bush's arguments against withdrawal is that it \n     would lead to civil war. That war is raging, right now, and \n     it may take years to burn out. Iraq may fragment into \n     separate Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite republics, and American \n     troops are not going to stop that from happening.\n       It is possible, we suppose, that announcing a firm \n     withdrawal date might finally focus Iraq's political leaders \n     and neighboring governments on reality. Ideally, it could \n     spur Iraqi politicians to take the steps toward national \n     reconciliation that they have endlessly discussed but refused \n     to act on.\n       But it is foolish to count on that, as some Democratic \n     proponents of withdrawal have done. The administration should \n     use whatever leverage it gains from withdrawing to press its \n     allies and Iraq's neighbors to help achieve a negotiated \n     solution.\n       Iraq's leaders--knowing that they can no longer rely on the \n     Americans to guarantee their survival--might be more open to \n     compromise, perhaps to a Bosnian-style partition, with \n     economic resources fairly shared but with millions of Iraqis \n     forced to relocate. That would be better than the slow-motion \n     ethnic and religious cleansing that has contributed to \n     driving one in seven Iraqis from their homes.\n       The United States military cannot solve the problem. \n     Congress and the White House must lead an international \n     attempt at a negotiated outcome. To start, Washington must \n     turn to the United Nations, which Mr. Bush spurned and \n     ridiculed as a preface to war.\n       There are already nearly two million Iraqi refugees, mostly \n     in Syria and Jordan, and nearly two million more Iraqis who \n     have been displaced within their country. Without the active \n     cooperation of all six countries bordering Iraq--Turkey, \n     Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria--and the help of \n     other nations, this disaster could get worse. Beyond the \n     suffering, massive flows of refugees--some with ethnic and \n     political resentments--could spread Iraq's conflict far \n     beyond Iraq's borders.\n       Kuwait and Saudi Arabia must share the burden of hosting \n     refugees. Jordan and Syria, now nearly overwhelmed with \n     refugees, need more international help. That, of course, \n     means money. The nations of Europe and Asia have a stake and \n     should contribute. The United States will have to pay a large \n     share of the costs, but should also lead international \n     efforts, perhaps a donors' conference, to raise money for the \n     refugee crisis.\n       Washington also has to mend fences with allies. There are \n     new governments in Britain, France and Germany that did not \n     participate in the fight over starting this war and are eager \n     to get beyond it. But that will still require a measure of \n     humility and a commitment to multilateral action that this \n     administration has never shown. And, however angry they were \n     with President Bush for creating this mess, those nations \n     should see that they cannot walk away from the consequences. \n     To put it baldly, terrorism and oil make it impossible to \n     ignore.\n       The United States has the greatest responsibilities, \n     including the admission of many more refugees for permanent \n     resettlement.\n\n[[Page S9082]]\n\n     The most compelling obligation is to the tens of thousands of \n     Iraqis of courage and good will--translators, embassy \n     employees, reconstruction workers--whose lives will be in \n     danger because they believed the promises and cooperated with \n     the Americans.\n       One of the trickiest tasks will be avoiding excessive \n     meddling in Iraq by its neighbors--America's friends as well \n     as its adversaries.\n       Just as Iran should come under international pressure to \n     allow Shiites in southern Iraq to develop their own \n     independent future, Washington must help persuade Sunni \n     powers like Syria not to intervene on behalf of Sunni Iraqis. \n     Turkey must be kept from sending troops into Kurdish \n     territories.\n       For this effort to have any remote chance, Mr. Bush must \n     drop his resistance to talking with both Iran and Syria. \n     Britain, France, Russia, China and other nations with \n     influence have a responsibility to help. Civil war in Iraq is \n     a threat to everyone, especially if it spills across Iraq's \n     borders.\n       President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have used \n     demagoguery and fear to quell Americans' demands for an end \n     to this war. They say withdrawing will create bloodshed and \n     chaos and encourage terrorists. Actually, all of that has \n     already happened--the result of this unnecessary invasion and \n     the incompetent management of this war.\n       This country faces a choice. We can go on allowing Mr. Bush \n     to drag out this war without end or purpose. Or we can insist \n     that American troops are withdrawn as quickly and safely as \n     we can manage--with as much effort as possible to stop the \n     chaos from spreading.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is worth spending a few moments to discuss this \neditorial because it is not often that one of America's flagship papers \ndeclares as lost a war which 160,000 brave American soldiers are trying \nmightily to win.\n  Beginning with its first line in this remarkable editorial, ``It is \ntime for the United States to leave Iraq without any more delay than \nthe Pentagon needs to organize an orderly exit,'' the Times editorial \nadvocates a precipitous withdrawal of American forces. It does so \nconceding that such a withdrawal is likely to increase the chaos and \nbloodshed in Iraq, not decrease it, and that a redeployment could \nprompt ``reprisals, further ethnic cleansing, even genocide.'' A \nremarkable statement that a newspaper that frequently calls for the \nUnited States to bring its national power to bear for moral purposes, \nnot the least of which in the Darfur region of Sudan, could so easily \nthrow out consequences that are so terrible.\n  In the opinion of the New York Times, apparently genocide is not \nworth fighting to prevent, nor is it worth fighting to prevent \n``potentially destabilizing refugee flows'' hitting Jordan and Syria or \nto stop Iran from filling the power vacuum left behind by our departure \nor disrupting a likely terrorist sanctuary. No, none of these things \nare worth fighting for in the Times' opinion because it has concluded \nthat ``keeping troops in Iraq will only make things worse.''\n  This misunderstanding clouds the entirety of the editorial. The Times \nappears to believe that because things have been mismanaged since 2003 \nand because violence remains at unacceptably high levels, things simply \ncan't get worse, so we should withdraw and at least save ourselves. But \nthis is sheer folly. Things in Iraq, however bad they have been and \nremain, could get far, far worse. Anyone who recalls Cambodia or Rwanda \nor any of the other places that have seen killing on a massive scale \nknows just how terrible violence can be when it spirals out of control.\n  The consequences of a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq include \nemboldening terrorists, inducing a wider regional war, fanning the \nflames of a Sunni-Shia conflict, putting millions of lives at risk, and \ndestabilizing an area key to America's strategic interests.\n  The editorial States bluntly, ``Whatever [the President's] cause was, \nit is lost,'' because ``additional military forces poured into the \nBaghdad region have failed to change anything.'' That is a remarkable \nstatement, a remarkable statement. ``Additional military forces poured \ninto the Baghdad region have failed to change anything.'' I just came \nback from a visit. I know I have been pilloried for saying that there \nhas been progress in Iraq. Well, they can pillory General Petraeus and \nthey can pillory their own reporters who have clearly pointed out that \nthere have been measurements of success--and a long, long way to go, \nbut the fact is, there has been some success.\n  The fact is, in Baghdad, as General Petraeus attests, it is \ndemonstrably untrue that additional military forces poured into the \nBaghdad region have failed to change anything. In Baghdad, U.S. \nmilitary and Iraqi forces are establishing joint security stations and \npatrolling the city together to manage violence. Since January, \nsectarian violence has fallen. The total number of car bombings and \nsuicide attacks has declined in May and June, and the number of Iraqis \ncoming forward with information is rising.\n  The President offered an assessment today. There are some areas of \nsuccess. There are some areas of no movement, and there are some areas \nof failure, particularly where the Iraqi Government is concerned. We \nshould know that. In an area south of Bagdad, commanders report \nincreasing numbers of local tribes siding with the coalition against \nal-Qaida and similar effects north of the city.\n  This editorial makes the breathtaking assertion that the war in Iraq \nis ``a dangerous diversion from the life-and-death struggle against \nterrorists.'' Someone from the editorial board must have neglected to \ninform our troops on the ground, who, when I visited them last week in \nBaghdad and Anbar, spent several hours briefing me on their \ncounterterrorism operations. The editors must have also neglected to \nspeak with General Petraeus, who has called Iraq ``the central front of \nal-Qaida's global campaign.''\n  In case terrorists remain in Iraq and seek to plan attacks outside \nthe country, the Times has an answer. The United States can set up \nbases in Kuwait and Qatar and even in northern Iraq because:\n\n       . . . the Pentagon needs enough force to stage effective \n     raids and airstrikes against terrorist forces in Iraq.\n\n  Yet I wonder whether the Times has thought through any of the \nlogistical issues associated with waging a counterterrorism effort from \na neighboring country. Do we send American counterterrorism teams into \nIraq for these operations? Do they remain in place? How are they \nsupplied? We have seen for 3\\1/2\\ years that such efforts are much less \nsuccessful when our troops are confined to forward operating bases than \nwhen our soldiers are deployed among the population, in the cities. I \ncan hardly imagine how difficult it would be to wage the same struggle \nnot from forward operating bases but from a neighboring nation.\n  These troops would not be needed to help stop an incipient civil war \nbecause, as the Times tells us, ``that war is raging, right now.'' Iraq \nmay fragment into separate states, the editorial goes on, but \n``American troops are not going to stop that from happening.''\n  Well, a couple days ago, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari \nexplained that the dangers of a quick American pullout from Iraq could \ninclude a civil war. I suspect the foreign minister means a real, full-\nscale civil war, one that dwarfs the violence taking place today. I \nalso suspect the foreign minister understands there is no clear \ndelineation between sectarian violence, whether or not it constitutes \ncivil war, and terrorist activity. Al-Qaida bombed the mosque in Samara \nin a deliberate attempt to foment sectarian violence. Zarqawi wrote of \nhis plans to target the Shia before his own death. Walking away from \nIraq would not simply leave an ongoing sectarian struggle simmering \naway at its own pace, sealed off from the world. Civil war in Iraq has \nreal implications for American national security interests.\n  After the withdrawal prompts the terrible consequences that even the \nNew York Times foresees, it will be incumbent upon the United States to \nameliorate the fallout. This, the editorial page tells us, can be done \nby talking to Iran--by talking to Iran--to pressure it to ``allow \nShiites in southern Iraq to develop their own independent future.''\n  At a time when Iranian operatives are already moving weapons, \ntraining fighters, providing resources, and helping plan operations to \nkill American soldiers and damage our efforts to bring stability to \nIraq, I think it is a pretty safe bet that Tehran will not be open to \nmany of Washington's entreaties following a withdrawal. The much more \nlikely course is that Iran will comfortably step into the power vacuum \nleft by a U.S. redeployment. When it does so, though, the Times would \nhave Washington ``persuade Sunni powers like Syria not to intervene on \nbehalf of Sunni Iraqis.'' My\n\n[[Page S9083]]\n\nfriends, that would be a tough sell, to put it mildly, if the Iranians \nare in the regional ascendance.\n  Perhaps the root of the New York Times' misconception of the war in \nIraq is crystallized by a sentence in its final paragraph. It expresses \nfierce opposition to ``allowing Mr. Bush to drag out this war without \nend on purpose.'' ``Allowing Mr. Bush to drag out this war without end \non purpose.'' I think all of us would oppose any war without end or \npurpose, but this does not describe the conflict in Iraq. We remain in \nIraq to bring enough security to allow the Government to function in a \nway that will protect the people of Iraq and, as a result, the national \ninterests of the United States. That is the purpose and the end goal of \nthis war, as I see it.\n  But do not take my word for it, Mr. President. Ask the thousands of \nbrave men and women who are putting themselves in harm's way every day. \nI had the privilege to once again visit many of them in Iraq last week, \nand I can tell my colleagues they understand the purpose. I wish I \ncould say the same of our journalistic friends in New York.\n  Mr. President, I wish to remind my colleagues about the statements \nthat have been made by various people who are experts on Iraq and are \nrespected national security advisers, including people such as Brent \nScowcroft and Henry Kissinger, and many others who have been involved \nin this issue, many of whom, like General Zinni, were opposed from the \nbeginning to the conflict but now believe setting a date for withdrawal \nwill be a disaster of monumental consequences.\n  I hope the editorial page of the New York Times would listen to some \nof those people. For example, Henry Kissinger, who recently said that \nsetting a date for withdrawal will lead to chaos in the region; \nincluding people such as General Zinni, who had opposed our \nintervention in Iraq to start with, who said setting a date for \nwithdrawal would have catastrophic consequences.\n  I have seen some interesting op-ed pieces in my time. I have rarely \nseen one that is farther off the mark than the editorial in last \nSunday's New York Times. I am convinced that if we pursued that course, \nas the editorial leads: that the war is lost, and it is time for the \nUnited States to leave Iraq without any more delay, and the Pentagon \nneeds to organize an orderly exit--is a remarkable statement by one of \nthe largest newspapers in America.\n  Henry Kissinger--I think we can find wisdom in several suggestions \nput forward by him. But we also should heed his words, as well as many \nothers. He is correct to say: ``precipitate withdrawal would produce a \ndisaster,'' one that ``would not end the war but shift it to other \nareas, like Lebanon or Jordan or Saudi Arabia,'' produce greater \nviolence among Iraqi factions and ``embolden radical Islamism'' around \nthe world.\n  My friends, I hope the editorial writers for the New York Times would \npay attention to Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaida's deputy chief, who said \nthat the United States is merely delaying our ``inevitable'' defeat in \nIraq, and that ``the Mujahideen of Islam in Iraq of the caliphate and \njihad are advancing with steady steps towards victory.''\n  Their target is not Iraq. Pay attention to their words. Their target \nis the United States of America.\n  Recall the plan laid out in a letter from Zawahiri to Abu Mus'ab al-\nZarqawi before his death. That plan is to take shape in four stages: \nestablish a caliphate in Iraq, extend the jihad wave to the secular \ncountries neighboring Iraq, clash with Israel--none of which will \ncommence until the completion of stage one--expel the Americans from \nIraq.\n  If the New York Times editorial board does not pay attention to the \nwords of people like me and General Scowcroft and General Zinni and Dr. \nKissinger, and many other people who are experts, I would hope they \nwould pay attention to the words of Zarqawi, Zawahiri, and others who \nhave made very clear what their intentions are in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, at this time I yield the floor and ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Levin offer the wounded warrior legislation or \nwhatever he wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The senior Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I did not have a chance, because the \nSenator was speaking, to ask the Senator from Arizona if there would be \nany objection if instead of offering the wounded warrior amendment at \nthis time that I yield to the Senator from North Dakota for a statement \non an amendment, a different amendment that he intends to offer. I \nthink his statement would last 15 minutes or 20 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Arizona withdraw his \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I withdraw it. I just wonder how long, again.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 15 or 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator withdraws the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator from Michigan to \namend the request to immediately following the remarks of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota that then there would be the offering of the wounded \nwarrior amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota be recognized for up to 20 minutes to speak on an \namendment that he would intend to offer at a later time, and \nimmediately following that I then be recognized to offer the wounded \nwarrior legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Michigan \nand my colleague from Arizona as well.\n  I believe my colleague, Senator Conrad from North Dakota, may well \njoin me, if he is able to.\n  I want to describe an amendment we have filed. We will attempt to \noffer it at some point, but I have filed an amendment, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, and I want to describe it briefly. As I do, \nlet me say this: I understand, and have always understood, it is far \neasier, when making a case, to make the negative side than the positive \nside. I understand, and have always understood, it is easier to \nrecognize failure than it is to recognize success. I respect everyone's \nviews on this issue, this issue of the war in Iraq, the fight against \nterrorism. It is a passionate debate we have in this Chamber and in \nthis country. I respect the views of everyone who stands and offers \ntheir thoughts about what this country ought to do.\n  We need to get this right. The future of this country, perhaps the \nfuture of the world, depends on our ability to get this right. But I \nhave been waking up in the mornings and picking up the morning papers \nand seeing statements in the papers that have bothered me a lot.\n  I want to mention, as we bring to the floor of the Senate a piece of \nlegislation authorizing the spending for our military of $640 billion \nroughly--$640 billion--and we are building anti-ballistic missile \ndefense systems, we are building ICBMs, we are building tanks and \nplanes and ships, we are doing all these things, and we are spending a \nlot of money--but, even as we do all that, let me review something \nelse, if I might.\n  It has been 6 years since Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida attacked us \nwith 19 people and box cutters, hijacking airplanes loaded with fuel \nand killing innocent Americans--thousands of them.\n  Six years since those attacks. A long time.\n  It has been 6 long years, and yet Osama bin Laden is still free \ntoday. He has not been brought to justice.\n  It has been 6 long years, and al-Qaida is stronger today than it has \nbeen in years, according to all of the reports recently released.\n  It has been 6 years, and al-Qaida is now rebuilding its terrorist \ntraining camps, along with the Taliban, in a safe harbor.\n  It has been 6 years, and they are reconstituting their ability to \nattack us. Yes, al-Qaida and the Taliban are reconstituting their \noperational capability in a safe hideaway in Pakistan. It is called a \n``secure hideaway in Pakistan'' officially.\n  It remains the greatest threat to the United States, even after these \n6 long years: after two wars in two countries, after trillions of \ndollars spent on those wars and for homeland security, after the deaths \nof thousands of our military, and after the wounding of tens of \nthousands of our military.\n\n[[Page S9084]]\n\n  Yesterday, we heard from the No. 2 person, al-Zawahiri. He has \nreleased about a dozen tapes in the last year. Previously, we heard \nfrom Osama bin Laden. They are free, and they have escaped justice, and \nthey are exhorting their followers to attack and kill, and al-Qaida is \nreconstituting.\n  All this after six years.\n  Let me describe a couple of things.\n  On, January, 11, 2007, in testimony before the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, the top intelligence person in our country \nsaid:\n\n       Al Qaeda continues to plot attacks against our Homeland and \n     other targets with the objective of inflicting mass \n     casualties. And they continue to maintain active connections \n     and relationships that radiate outward from their leaders' \n     secure hideaway in Pakistan.\n\n  Our top intelligence person in this country said they have a secure \nhideout in Pakistan. John Negroponte said that. He was the Director of \nNational Intelligence at the time. That was only a few months ago.\n  Here is what he also said:\n\n       Al Qaeda is the terrorist organization that poses the \n     greatest threat to US interests, including to the Homeland.\n\n  January 2007. That is not from the New York Times or the Washington \nPost, that is the testimony from John Negroponte, who at that point was \nthe top intelligence official in our Government. Al Qaeda had a secure \nhideaway in Pakistan and remained the greatest threat to the U.S.\n  Now, 2 days ago, I read in the paper that the head of our Homeland \nSecurity agency has a ``gut feeling'' about a new period of increased \nrisk--a ``gut feeling.''\n  Well, let me show you what we had in August of 2001: a Presidential \ndaily briefing. This was released, by the way, about 3 years ago. This \nwas the Presidential daily briefing, and I have it in my hand, dated \nAugust 6, 2001. The title is ``Bin Laden determined to strike in the \nU.S.''\n  That was the Presidential daily briefing in August of 2001. ``Bin \nLaden determined to strike in the U.S.''\n  July of 2007, almost six years later, top administration officials \nsay that ``Al Qaeda is better positioned to strike the West.'' That's \nthe secret intelligence assessment of the National Counter Terrorism \nCenter.\n  Think of that for a moment. Six years have passed. Six years have \npassed since the attacks of September 11, 2001. But, here we are \ndebating a $640-plus billion authorization bill for armaments of every \nkind, and the greatest threat to our country today, according to the \ntop intelligence Director in this Government, is al-Qaida and its \nnetwork. And they operate from a secure hideaway in Pakistan. And, they \nare rebuilding their operational capability. Six years later.\n  What has happened? What is happening? Well, we wake up in the morning \nand we read what is happening: Officials are worrying of a terror \nattack this summer. Michael Chertoff says he has a ``gut feeling'' \nabout that. Other U.S. counterterrorism officials who spoke on \ncondition of anonymity shared Chertoff's concern. This article says:\n\n       Al-Qaida and like minded groups have been able to plot and \n     train more freely in the tribal areas along the Afghan-\n     Pakistani border in recent months.\n\n  I have been in that area. I have flown over the Afghanistan and \nPakistani area border. I understand what it looks like. I understand \nyou can't see where one country starts and another country begins. I \nunderstand how difficult all this must be. But I don't understand how \nthis administration has decided, after 6 long years, that it doesn't \nmatter so much that we haven't captured Osama bin Laden. The President \nhimself said that. He doesn't worry much about Osama bin Laden. That's \na direct quote. I can get it for you. That's exactly what he said: \nDon't worry much about him.\n  Well, our country ought to worry about him. The leadership of al-\nQaida is the leadership of the organization that attacked this country \nand who, even now, we are told, are planning additional attacks against \nthis country. So how is it in all this time that has elapsed that Osama \nis still on the loose and that al-Qaida is getting stronger and \nstronger.\n  How is it that this is so even after the President said ``If you \nharbor terrorists, you are the same as terrorists to us; there will be \nno safe harbor.'' There was a safe harbor in Afghanistan for the \nterrorists. The Taliban gave them a safe harbor, so we went to war in \nAfghanistan. We drove out the Taliban and got rid of the safe harbor. \nThat's what we did back in 2001 and 2002.\n  But, apparently now, there is another safe harbor for Osama bin Laden \nand al-Qaida. After 6 long years, they have another safe harbor. It's \nin Pakistan or on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan. They have \nterrorists training camps there. They are rebuilding. They are \nplanning. Just like they did before.\n  We must do something about this. We must not ignore this warning. We \nmust act now.\n  Senator Conrad and I have filed an amendment and we will offer it \nwhen we get the opportunity. It will do a couple of things. No. 1, it \nwill insist we be given classified briefings on a quarterly basis on \nthe hunt for Osama bin Laden and the leadership of al-Qaida.\n  It will require that every quarter the Defense Department and the \nDirector of National Intelligence provide Congress with a classified \nbriefing telling us what is being done by the resources of this \nadministration and the resources that are given in this Defense \nauthorization bill to apprehend and bring to justice Osama bin Laden, \nal-Zawahiri, and others who led the attacks against this country and \nwho even today plan additional attacks against our country.\n  This is an urgent matter. This isn't just going after those who \nattacked us yesterday. It's about going after those seeking to attack \nus today and tomorrow.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the McClatchy Newspaper, on June 26, 2007, reported \nthat ``Al-Qaida regroups in a new sanctuary on the Pakistani border,'' \nsenior U.S. military intelligence and law enforcement officials say. It \nreported that ``While the U.S. presses its war against insurgents \nlinked to al-Qaida in Iraq, Osama bin Laden's group is recruiting, \nregrouping, and rebuilding in a new sanctuary along the border between \nAfghanistan and Pakistan.''\n  Six years after the attacks in this country, this is what we read.\n  Now, we are in a war in the country of Iraq. I understand there are \nsome in this Chamber who say this is the beachhead against al-Qaida. It \nis not. Does al-Qaida exist in Iraq? Yes, it does. But most of what is \nhappening in Iraq is sectarian violence: Shia killing Sunni, Sunni \nkilling Shia, Sunni and Shia killing American soldiers. Yes, al-Qaida \nexists in Iraq, but al-Qaida has largely come to Iraq as a result of \nwhat has been happening in Iraq. It was not and is not the central \nfight with respect to the war on terror.\n  I spoke about this previously with respect to an amendment of this \ntype. Incidentally, Senator Conrad and I have gotten this amendment \npassed by the Senate previously, but it gets dropped in conference. My \nhope is it will pass the Senate once again and this time--this time, at \nlong last--it will not be dropped in conference.\n  Finally, on a quarterly basis, at least, we will be able to get \nclassified information about whether this administration is pursuing \nand bringing to justice those who attacked this country on 9/11, 2001, \nand those who, according to the papers this morning and yesterday \nmorning and the morning before that, continue to plot those attacks \nagainst this country.\n  How much longer will we be asked to read these stories, in most cases \nby unnamed administration officials?\n\n       ``Senior leaders of al-Qaida operating from Pakistan over \n     the past year have set up a band of training camps in the \n     tribal regions near the Afghan border,'' according to \n     American intelligence and counterterrorism officials. \n     ``American officials said there was mounting evidence that \n     Osama bin Laden and his deputy, al-Zawahiri, have been \n     steadily building an operations hub in the mountainous \n     Pakistani tribal area north of Waziristan.''\n\n  Those are the reports. They have been the same for a year or so now. \nEvery couple of months we read this.\n  I think it is important to ask the question--as we describe a piece \nof legislation that will offer $640-plus billion for the Department of \nDefense--I think it is important for us to ask the question as to \nwhether at least a portion of this is dedicated to bringing to justice \nthose who attacked this country.\n\n  If the head of our intelligence service is correct when he says that \n``Al-Qaida\n\n[[Page S9085]]\n\nis the terrorist organization that poses the greatest threat to U.S. \ninterests, including to the Homeland,'' then why is the central fight \nnot a fight to apprehend and bring to justice the leadership of al-\nQaida?\n  Why are they free today? Why are they in a secure area? Why are they \nharbored in a secure area where they are plotting attacks against our \ncountry and other countries? Why does that exist? It seems to me, at \nleast in part, it must be a matter of will. The central fight, in my \njudgment, ought to be the fight to bring to justice those who attacked \nour country.\n  Now, with respect to Iraq, this country is going to leave Iraq. That \nis not the question. The question is when and how.\n  The American people are not going to continue year after year after \nyear asking American soldiers to be in the middle of a civil war in \nIraq. It simply will not be the case that the American people will \nallow that to happen. So we are going to leave Iraq; the question is \nhow and when. We will debate that via several amendments over the \ncoming days.\n  But my point this morning is to say, while we debate Iraq and debate \nthe circumstances of American troops largely in the middle of a civil \nwar in Iraq, the question remains: Why? Why, after 6 years, does Osama \nbin Laden remain free? Why does he remain in a secure hideaway and \nremain apparently at the top, along with al-Zawahiri, in charge of al-\nQaida, plotting attacks against free people? Why is that still the \ncase?\n  Shouldn't we, finally, at last, at long last as a country, insist \nthat our major objective be to bring to justice the leaders of al-Qaida \nand destroy the al-Qaida network? That is the real fight against \nterrorism.\n  There is so much to say about so many subjects on the Defense \nauthorization bill, but when we talk about defending our country's \ninterests, we can go back some years and recall that we were in the \nmiddle of a Cold War, where we knew who the enemy was. The enemy was a \nnation state. In that case, the Cold War was the Soviet Union; the \nSoviet Union and the United States built large arsenals of nuclear \nweapons to stand each other off in something called mutually assured \ndestruction.\n  Times have changed. The Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore. Now, the \nmajor threat to our country is not a nation state. It is not an \norganization that has an ``army'' that wears uniforms. The greatest \nthreat to our country now, according to testimony before the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence of our country's most senior intelligence \nofficial, the Director of Intelligence, Mr. Negroponte, is clear:\n\n       Al-Qaida is the terrorist organization that poses the \n     greatest threat to U.S. interests, including to the Homeland.\n\n  If that is the case, then where is the strategy in the use of all the \nresources we provide in this legislation to the administration? Where \nis the strategy to bring to justice those who attacked this country? \nRegrettably and unfortunately, I think that strategy has not existed \nfor far too long.\n  As I indicated, I have filed the amendment I have written and the \namendment that I and Senator Conrad, who joins me in this amendment, \nwill attempt to have considered by the Senate. I assume it will be \nconsidered following the consideration of several others of the Iraq \namendments that have already been noticed. The amendment we have filed \nrequires classified reports on a quarterly basis. It also will double \nthe reward that has been offered from $25 million to $50 million for \napprehending or information leading to the apprehension of Osama bin \nLaden.\n  We gave the current administration substantial authority to boost the \nreward 2 years ago. It did not do that. We believe that, because \nnothing seems to happen with this administration on this issue, it is \nimportant for the Congress to push and to insist.\n  In this amendment, we ask for four key things. We ask that the \nclassified briefings be given to Congress telling us the likely current \nlocation of the al-Qaida leadership. All of the information suggests \nthat senior leaders in this administration know generally where that \nlocation is.\n  We ask for a description of the ongoing efforts to bring the \nleadership of al-Qaida to justice and a report on the Governments of \nthe countries in which al-Qaida is allowed to exist and allowed to \nrebuild. We ask for reports on whether they are fully cooperating with \nus and what they are doing to help us apprehend those who attacked our \ncountry.\n  So that represents my interest in trying to address this issue. Once \nagain, I have spoken to Senator Levin previously on this issue. In \nfact, we have previously passed a similar amendment through the Senate, \nand I appreciate his cooperation in doing so. I would ask of Senator \nLevin if he would give us some consideration. We filed the amendment, \nand we will ask to follow it up and have it considered at some \nappropriate point.\n  He, of course, manages this bill and has the juggling requirement to \nmeet all the needs for time that people have. I see my colleague, \nSenator Conrad, is coming to the floor, and I think I have a few \nminutes remaining. As he joins us to speak of his interest in this \namendment, let me ask Senator Levin, if I might, while we are waiting \nfor Senator Conrad, would we have an opportunity either this week or \nnext week to be able to consider our amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, that would be our plan and our hope. \nPerhaps the Senator from North Dakota could remind me, did we clear \nthis amendment or was there a rollcall vote on this?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The amendment was cleared, I believe. We actually offered \nit twice, but I believe it was cleared.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would hope we could clear it again, and if not, there \nwill be a spot for the Senator to offer the amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We would like, if necessary, a rollcall vote on the \namendment and I thank you for your consideration. As I said, Senator \nConrad will take the remaining time, so at this point I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining of the unanimous \nconsent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 45 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time does Senator Conrad, if I could address him, \nneed? We were delaying introducing the wounded warriors legislation in \norder to give the Senator an opportunity to speak on the amendment \nwhich he plans on offering. Is that the same amendment which----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator could let us know about how long \nit would be?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator McCain is not here, but I doubt that he would have \nany objection, so therefore I take the liberty of asking unanimous \nconsent that Senator Conrad be recognized for 10 minutes and then I be \nrecognized to introduce the wounded warrior legislation. Senator Akaka \nis also here, and I am wondering if he has any objection.\n  Mr. AKAKA. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the September 11, 2001 attack by al-Qaida, \nled by Osama bin Laden, is seared on the soul of the Nation. I know it \nis a day I will never forget. President Bush vowed then to bring Osama \nbin Laden and his al-Qaida terrorist allies to justice.\n  Days after 9/11, President Bush said:\n\n       This act will not stand; we will find those who did it; we \n     will smoke them out of their holes . . . we will bring \n     them to justice.\n\n  Every American shared those feelings. Similar to Pearl Harbor, the \ndate of 9/11 became a seminal moment for our Nation, a day we cannot \nand must not forget. But it has now been nearly 6 years--2,130 days--\nsince the attacks of 9/11--that's more time than America took fighting \nfascism in World War II.\n  Osama bin Laden is still at large. In fact, he and al-Qaida are \ngaining strength, by all accounts. Two weeks ago in Great Britain, we \nsaw a failed attempt to target airports with car bombs. Two years ago, \nLondon subway bombings killed 52 and injured 700--bombings which may be \nlinked to al-Qaida.\n  Today's newspapers report U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded \nthat\n\n[[Page S9086]]\n\nal-Qaida has rebuilt to its pre-9/11 strengths. These analysts say al-\nQaida is ``considerably operationally stronger than a year ago'' and \nhas ``regrouped to an extent not seen since 2001.'' The reports suggest \nal-Qaida has created ``the most robust training program since 2001, \nwith an interest in using European operatives'' and is ``showing \ngreater and greater ability to plan attacks in Europe and the United \nStates.''\n  Private experts agree al-Qaida is now stronger than before. According \nto the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, the \nnumber of al-Qaida operatives worldwide has grown from 20,000 6 years \nago to 50,000 today.\n  What is going on here? What does it say to jihadists around the world \nthat a terrorist mastermind such as bin Laden can kill 3,000 Americans \nand remain alive and untouched 6 years later? What does it say that he \nand his allies are gaining strength?\n  There can be only one conclusion: The President got our priorities \nwrong. Before finishing with al-Qaida and capturing bin Laden, \nPresident Bush lost focus.\n  We know who attacked us on 9/11. It was Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, \nnot Saddam Hussein and Iraq. Yet the painful truth is the \nadministration got our priorities wrong. The President pulled troops \nand intelligence specialists out of Afghanistan and the search for \nOsama bin Laden and the leaders of al-Qaida and instead attacked Iraq.\n  USA Today reported:\n\n       In 2002, troops from the 5th Special Forces Group who \n     specialize in the Middle East were pulled out of the hunt for \n     Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to prepare for their next \n     assignment: Iraq. Their replacements were troops with \n     expertise in Spanish culture.\n\n  Are people hearing this? We pulled experts in the Arab language and \nMiddle East culture out of the hunt for Osama bin Laden, an Arabic \nspeaker who led the attack on us, and we put those troops over into the \nhunt for Saddam Hussein in Iraq and replaced them with experts in \nSpanish culture. There are not many Spanish speakers in Afghanistan and \nPakistan.\n\n       The CIA, meanwhile, was stretched badly in its capacity to \n     collect, translate, and analyze information coming from \n     Afghanistan. When the White House raised a new priority, it \n     took specialists away from the Afghanistan effort to ensure \n     Iraq was covered.\n\n  I believe this will go down in history as a profound mistake. We lost \nfocus. The President took us on a path that proved to be a distraction. \nInstead of following up on Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, we got \ndiverted and directed our energy and attention to Saddam Hussein and \nIraq. I believe the priorities were wrong.\n  The former head of the CIA's bin Laden unit called the invasion of \nIraq ``a godsend to Osama bin Laden.'' So I have to ask why--why did we \nallow our post-9/11 focus on bin Laden to be distracted? Why didn't we \nhave enough forces on the ground at Tora Bora to get the job done and \ncapture bin Laden and his al-Qaida allies? The answer, I believe, \nunfortunately is clear: The administration made a strategic error and \nshifted its focus from Afghanistan to Iraq. I believe, as I have said \nbefore, that that was a profound mistake.\n  I spent the last 2 years of my high school years living in the Arab \nculture. I attended an American Air Force base high school in Tripoli, \nLibya. In that culture, it is critically important not to allow someone \nto go uncaptured and unaccounted for who launched an attack. If you \ndon't finish business with those who attack you, they only grow in the \npublic mind. That is absolutely the wrong message to send.\n  Last September, the administration once again showed it is not \nfocused on al-Qaida. President Bush's national strategy for combating \nterrorism includes only one passing reference to Osama bin Laden. Last \nSeptember, the White House issued an updated strategy for \ncounterterrorism. In a 23-page document, bin Laden's name appears only \nonce.\n  This man ordered the killing of 3,000 innocent Americans, but in the \nadministration's report on fighting terrorist threats, he is only an \nafterthought.\n  It has now been 2,130 days since President Bush said ``We will find \nthose who did it; we will smoke them out of their holes . . . we will \nbring them to justice.'' Those were absolutely the right sentiments and \nthe right plan. Unfortunately, the President's strategy has failed. He \nhas not found Osama bin Laden. He has not smoked him out of his hole, \nand he has not been brought to justice. Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida \noperatives continue to threaten this Nation.\n  I believe that is unacceptable. We must capture or kill Osama bin \nLaden. We must bring his entire network of terrorists to justice. I \nbelieve deeply that stopping al-Qaida should be our top priority.\n  Our amendment makes that clear. It is very simple. It says that \ncapturing or killing Osama bin Laden and dismantling al-Qaida should be \nour top priority.\n  Our amendment has two parts. First, it doubles the bounty on Osama \nbin Laden. Whether we capture or kill him, it is past time that he be \nbrought to justice. I urge my colleagues to join us in sending that \nmessage.\n  Second, our amendment requires a clear report to Congress, laying out \nthe administration's strategy for bringing bin Laden and al-Qaida \noperatives to justice.\n  I urge my colleagues to make it this Nation's top military priority \nto bring Osama bin Laden to the justice that he deserves as the world's \nmost notorious terrorist.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2019 to Amendment No. 2011\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the care and management of wounded warriors)\n\n  Mr. Levin. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2019, the dignified \ntreatment of wounded warriors amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. LEVIN], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n     Byrd, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Obama, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Cornyn, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Thune, Mr. Reed, Mr. Martinez, Mr. \n     Brown, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Tester, Mr. Nelson of \n     Nebraska, Mr. Bayh, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Webb, Mrs. \n     McCaskill, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bond, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Salazar, \n     Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Lott, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. \n     Hutchison, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2019 to 2011.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Monday, July 9, 2007, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am offering this with Senators McCain, \nAkaka, Warner, Murray, Graham, and about 40 other Senators who are \nlisted on the amendment.\n  This amendment, in bill form, was introduced on June 13 of this year. \nIt was marked up and unanimously agreed to by the Armed Services \nCommittee on the 14th of June. It was reported to the full Senate on \nthe 18th of June. As of now, as I indicated, we have over 40 \ncosponsors. The ideas of many Senators and parts of legislation \nchampioned by many Senators are incorporated in this amendment.\n  This is truly a bipartisan amendment. It is an amendment that has had \na huge amount of input by many Senators. Although I would prefer the \nSenate consider this important legislation as a stand-alone provision, \na stand-alone bill, because of the shortage of floor time, we now offer \nit as an amendment to the national defense authorization bill. If it is \nadopted as an amendment, and assuming that our Defense authorization \nbill is passed, we would then seek to have it introduced and passed \nimmediately thereafter as stand-alone legislation, so we would have it \nin two forms--one as an amendment to the bill and the other as a stand-\nalone bill passed by the Senate, so it could go immediately to the \nHouse, without waiting for a conference on the authorization bill \nbetween the Senate and the House, which would delay the passage of this \nvery important legislation.\n  Shortfalls in the care and treatment of our wounded warriors came to \nour\n\n[[Page S9087]]\n\nattention as a result of a series of articles in the Washington Post in \nFebruary. These articles described deplorable living conditions for \nsome servicemembers in an outpatient status. They described a bungled \nbureaucratic process for assigning disability ratings that determine \nwhether a servicemember will be medically retired with health and other \nbenefits for himself and his family. They describe a clumsy handoff \nbetween the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs as the military member transitions from one department to \nanother. The Nation's shock and dismay, when hearing about these \nproblems, reflected the American people's support, the American \npeople's respect, and the American people's gratitude to the men and \nwomen who put on our Nation's uniform. Those men and women deserve the \nbest--not shoddy medical care and bureaucratic snafus.\n  The Armed Services Committee and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nheld a rare joint hearing to identify the problems our wounded soldiers \nare facing. These committees have continued to work together to address \nthese issues, culminating in the amendment we offer today. The \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs has also marked up separate legislation \nthat will be offered as an amendment to our amendment. Their \nlegislation will ensure that the Veterans' Administration appropriately \naddresses the problems our seriously wounded and injured servicemembers \nface after they transition to VA care.\n  The amendment we are introducing addresses the issues of inconsistent \napplication of disability standards. It addresses disparate disability \nratings, substandard facilities, lack of seamless transition from the \nDepartment of Defense to the Veterans' Administration, inadequacy of \nseverance pay, care and treatment for traumatic brain injury and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, medical care for caregivers not eligible for \nTRICARE, and it addresses the need to share medical records between the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Our amendment addresses the issue of inconsistent disability ratings \nby requiring that the military departments use VA standards for rating \ndisabilities, unless the Department of Defense rating is higher. So it \nwould take the higher of the two ratings under our legislation. Our \namendment adopts a more favorable statutory presumption for determining \nwhether a disability is incident to military service. We do that by \nadopting the more favorable VA presumption.\n\n  We require two pilot programs to test the viability of using the VA \nto assign disability ratings for the Department of Defense. We also \nestablish an independent board to review and, where appropriate, \ncorrect unjustifiably low Department of Defense disability ratings \nawarded since 2001.\n  Our amendment addresses the lack of a seamless transition from the \nmilitary to the Veterans' Administration by requiring the Secretary of \nDefense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to jointly develop a \ncomprehensive policy on the care and management of injured \nservicemembers who will transition from the Department of Defense to \nthe VA.\n  We establish a Department of Defense and a Department of Veterans \nAffairs interagency program office to develop and implement a joint \nelectronic health record.\n  The amendment authorizes $50 million for improved diagnosis, \ntreatment, and rehabilitation of military members with traumatic brain \ninjury, TBI, and post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. We require the \nestablishment of centers of excellence for both TBI and PTSD to conduct \nresearch, train health care professionals, and a number of other \nthings.\n  We provide guidance throughout the Department of Defense in the \nprevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, and rehabilitation of TBI \nand PTSD. And the amendment requires that the Secretary of Defense, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, report to Congress \nwith comprehensive plans to prevent, diagnose, mitigate, and treat TBI \nand PTSD.\n  The amendment increases the minimum severance pay to 1 year's basic \npay for those separated with disabilities incurred in a combat zone or \ncombat-related activity and 6 months basic pay for all others. This is \nquadrupling or doubling, depending on the circumstance, of the current \narrangement.\n  Our amendment also eliminates the requirement that severance pay be \ndeducted from disability compensation for disabilities incurred in a \ncombat zone.\n  Our amendment also addresses the problem that exists because \nmedically retired servicemembers who are eligible for TRICARE as \nretirees do not have access to some of the cutting-edge treatments that \nare available to members still on active duty.\n  The amendment does that by authorizing medically retired \nservicemembers to receive the Active-Duty medical benefit for 3 years \nafter the member leaves active duty, and this can be extended to 5 \nyears where medically required.\n  The amendment authorizes military and VA health care providers to \nprovide medical care and counseling to family members who leave their \nhomes and often leave their jobs to help provide care to their wounded \nwarriors.\n  The dignified treatment of wounded warriors amendment requires the \nSecretary of Defense to establish standards for the treatment of and \nhousing for military outpatients. These standards will require \ncompliance with Federal and other standards for military medical \ntreatment facilities, speciality medical care facilities, and military \nhousing for outpatients that will be uniform and consistent and high \nlevel throughout the Department of Defense.\n  In summary, the dignified treatment of wounded warriors amendment is \na comprehensive approach that lays out a path for the Department of \nDefense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to address shortfalls in \nthe care of our wounded warriors in the Department of Defense and \nthrough the transition to care in the VA system. With the amendment we \nwill be discussing in a moment, that has been adopted by the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee under the chairmanship and leadership of Senator \nAkaka, this bill will also address shortfalls in the VA system itself \nafter the transition to the Veterans' Administration of our wounded \nwarriors. Those warriors deserve the best care and support that we can \nmuster. The American people rightly insist on no less.\n  There are a number of organizations which support this legislation. I \nwill read from a release that was issued by one of those organizations. \nThis is the Wounded Warrior Project:\n\n       [This] is a nonprofit organization aimed at assisting those \n     men and women of the United States armed forces who have been \n     severely injured during the war on terrorism in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan, and other hot spots around the world.\n\n  A description of this project is:\n\n       Beginning at the bedside of the severely wounded, Wounded \n     Warrior Project provides programs and services designated to \n     ease the burdens of these heroes and their families, aid in \n     the recovery process and smooth the transition back to \n     civilian life.\n\n  Just one paragraph from their release is the following:\n\n       With this legislation, the Senate is telling our nation's \n     wounded warriors that they have heard their concerns and are \n     ready to take appropriate actions to ensure that these brave \n     men and women are taken care of in a manner befitting their \n     sacrifices. . . . This wide ranging legislation will improve \n     the provision of health care and benefits to injured military \n     personnel and make the system much more efficient as well.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement of the Wounded Warrior \nProject and the statement of the Fleet Reserve Association be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have a number of amendments which have \nbeen cleared, 10 amendments which have been cleared which we will \ndescribe in a few moments after Senator McCain speaks and after Senator \nAkaka speaks. We will describe those second-degree amendments that have \nbeen cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  Again, I especially thank my ranking member, Senator McCain, and all \nthe members of our committee for the extraordinary work they have put \nin on this legislation. It is, as I mentioned, comprehensive and \ndesperately needed.\n  I also thank Senator Akaka, who is chairman of our Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, for his leadership because that committee has worked very \nclosely\n\n[[Page S9088]]\n\nwith our committee on this joint project. This is truly not just a \njoint effort between two committees but just about every Member of this \nbody has had a role and a voice in this legislation. It is one of the \nbest examples, I believe, of not only bipartisan action that I have \nseen in the Senate, but also a very speedy action and, we believe, very \nthorough consideration as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nWounded Warrior Project (WWP) Applauds Senate Armed Services Committee \n     for New Legislation to Assist Severely Wounded Servicemembers\n\n       Jacksonville, FL, June 14, 2007.--Today, the Wounded \n     Warrior Project (WWP) applauded the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee for the introduction of the ``Dignified Treatment \n     of Wounded Warriors Act'', a comprehensive piece of \n     legislation that will greatly assist severely wounded \n     servicemembers. WWP was particularly pleased to note that the \n     bill included several of the legislative proposals that the \n     organization has proposed and supported.\n       ``With this legislation, the Senate is telling our nation's \n     wounded warriors that they have heard their concerns and are \n     ready to take appropriate actions to ensure that these brave \n     men and women are taken care of in a manner befitting their \n     sacrifices'', said WWP Executive Director, John Melia. ``This \n     wide ranging legislation will improve the provision of health \n     care and benefits to injured military personnel and make the \n     system much more efficient as well''.\n       The ``Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act'' is \n     sponsored by Senators Levin (D-MI), McCain (R-AZ), Akaka (D-\n     HI), Warner (R-VA), Clinton (D-NY) and others. Among the \n     provisions included in the legislation, the bill would \n     require the Department of Defense (DOD) to adopt a Pre-\n     Deployment Cognitive Assessment tool to help identify \n     Traumatic Brain Injury or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in \n     returning servicemembers. Additionally, it would require DOD \n     to work with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on \n     developing a caregiver training program for family members of \n     brain injured servicemembers, and reform the disability \n     evaluation and ratings system that military personnel must \n     navigate prior to retirement from service. The bill would \n     also create an overlap of DOD and VA benefits to allow \n     wounded warriors to benefit from the strengths of both \n     systems without having to choose access to one over the \n     other.\n       In addition to these provisions, at this morning's Senate \n     Armed Services Committee hearing, eight amendments suggested \n     by WWP were adopted into the bill.\n       ``These provisions have grown out of our direct interaction \n     with our wounded warriors'', Melia said. ``We strongly \n     encourage the Senate to pass this bill and to work with the \n     House of Representatives to ensure these vital initiatives \n     are included in the final version of the bill that will \n     hopefully reach the President's desk. We stand committed to \n     assisting in any way.''\n\n\n                     about wounded warrior project\n\n       Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) is a non-profit organization \n     aimed at assisting those men and women of the United States \n     armed forces who have been severely injured during the war on \n     terrorism in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots around the \n     world.

Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin: The Fleet Reserve Association (FRA) \n     strongly supports your pending amendment to the FY 2008 \n     Defense Authorization bill that include the provisions of \n     ``The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act'' (S. \n     1606), to improve the management of medical care, the \n     disability rating system, and quality of life issues for \n     wounded members of the Armed Forces. This amendment is \n     important and will address significant long standing problems \n     associated with the coordination of care between the \n     Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.\n       FRA appreciates your leadership on this issue and shares \n     your concern about adequate care for wounded service members. \n     The Association stands ready to assist you in its passage in \n     the 110th Congress. The FRA point of contact is John Davis, \n     FRA' s Director of Legislative Programs at john@fra.org.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Joseph L. Barnes,\n                                     National Executive Secretary.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I begin by echoing the remarks of the \nchairman of the committee that we appreciate the partnership with the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, a partnership led by Senator Akaka and \nSenator Craig. We have worked closely together in trying to come up \nwith one of the most aptly titled pieces of legislation that I have \never been involved in, the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act.\n  It is important to point out that we are making this part of the \nDefense authorization bill, which we believe has a very good chance of \nbeing signed by the President, as the quickest way to get this \nlegislation enacted. There was a great deal of discussion back and \nforth as to whether it should stand by itself or should be part of the \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  I know I speak for all of us, and that is if something happens to \nthis legislation, we would come back with a separate piece of \nlegislation so that we can make sure we act as quickly as possible.\n  We were all deeply disappointed by the conditions at Walter Reed that \nwere reported in February of this year and the problems that our \nwounded warriors faced after their inpatient care was complete--living \nin substandard conditions at building 18, being treated poorly, \nbattling a Cold-War disability evaluation process and, for some, \nfalling through the cracks.\n  Since February of 2007, there have been many encouraging changes. \nFirst and foremost, Secretary Gates insisted on accountability for the \nleadership failures that led to the tragedy at Walter Reed.\n  In April of this year, the Army stood up a new warrior transition \nbrigade at Walter Reed to attend to the needs of wounded and ill \nsoldiers in both Active and Reserve components. This model of soldiers \ncaring for soldiers is now spreading throughout the Army.\n  I think we are on the right track to address the problems at Walter \nReed, but there is much more to be done. And I emphasize, we all \nrecognize there is much more to be done. But I do believe this \nlegislation is a very important and valuable contribution to the effort \nthat must be ongoing. We must match the heroism of the wonderful young \nmen and women who have given so much for our country.\n  Let me tell you who some of my heroes are: SGT Ted Wade was \ngrievously wounded in Iraq in 2004, who together with his young wife \nSara has bravely battled for 4 years the maze of health care and \nbenefit evaluations of the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and \nSocial Security; lost medical records, confusing and conflicting \nmedical and physical evaluations, and Sara even lost her job. These \nbrave young people have also lost time. Four years is too much to ask \nof someone who has given so much for his country.\n  SFC Jeff Mittman is a brave Army soldier who was wounded 2 years ago \nby an RPG that tore away a significant portion of his face. Today, Jeff \nis still on active duty, though he returns to Walter Reed frequently \nfor special surgery. Together with his wife Christy, they have \ncontinued to raise their children. Jeff is back at school. As a \ntestament to his heroism, Jeff says of his extraordinary injuries: ``I \ngot hit hard, but I'll walk it off.'' This weekend, he and his family \nwill celebrate the second anniversary of his being alive.\n  SGT Eric Edmondson, a soldier who suffered severe traumatic brain \ninjury in October 2005 and was thought to be without hope of recovery, \ntoday is standing on his own, thanks to the work of his remarkable \ntherapist and his own strong determination to survive.\n  Petty Officer Mark Robbins is a Navy Seal who lost his eye from a \nsniper's bullet after saving the lives of his buddies in an RPG attack \nin Iraq in April of this year. Mark, who walked to the medical \nevacuation helicopter on his own after being wounded, is recovering \ntoday at his home in San Diego. His determination to carry on in the \nfight in spite of his injury is not the exception among our young men \nand women, it is a tribute.\n  I also think it is appropriate from time to time, even though what \nhappened at Walter Reed was a disgrace and a scandal and a source of \nnational shame, and it is important that we continue to emphasize that \nthere are thousands and thousands of people who work in our armed \nservices hospitals and clinics and also in veterans affairs who are \npresent at our hospitals, who take care of our aging veterans from the \n``greatest generation,'' Korea, and the Vietnam war. These people labor \nmost of the time without credit, most\n\n[[Page S9089]]\n\nof the time without publicity, and do a magnificent job.\n  The system is broken, not the people--not the people--who serve with \ndedication and patience and care, and love our veterans in a way which \nshould be an example to all of us, and we should never forget that as \nwe try to fix a broken system.\n  As I mentioned, these are some of America's heroes, my heroes, who \nhave sustained terrible wounds, whose lives have been saved by the \nfinest medical professionals in the world, and who, with their \nfamilies, face the challenge of a long recovery and rebuilding their \nlives.\n  This legislation, the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act, \nwill make a difference in the lives of our wounded warriors and their \nfamilies. It bridges the gap in health care coverage for the severely \nwounded and ensures their access to the broadest possible range of \nhealth care options.\n  It authorizes additional care and support for families who are caring \nfor the wounded. It requires the Secretary of Defense and Veterans \nAffairs to develop and implement new policies to better manage the care \nand transition of our wounded soldiers. It empowers a special board to \nreview disability ratings of 20 percent or less and to restore to a \nwounded soldier, if appropriate, a higher disability rating or retired \nstatus.\n  Mr. President, that issue alone, of disability ratings, is one that, \nfrankly, the Senator from Michigan and I cannot understand why it \ncontinued; that from one medical evaluation board, a certain level of \ndisability and compensation would be adjudged while on active duty, go \ndirectly to the VA, and then another assessment is made with a \ndifferent level of disability. It is just nonsensical. And I would like \nto say to all my colleagues, and I know we share a responsibility as \nwell, we blamed the military, we blamed the VA, and we blamed a lot of \npeople, but part of the responsibility lies right here with those of us \nwho are supposed to have been paying better attention than we did. So I \nwish to make that perfectly clear, that I personally--and the \nCongress--share in the responsibility for having not fixed this system \nand some of the problems that have existed for a long time.\n  This legislation empowers a special board, as I mentioned, to review \ndisability ratings. It authorizes additional funding for traumatic \nbrain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, encouraging public and \nprivate partnerships to address these signature injuries of the war, \nand supports efforts to erase the stigma associated with seeking care.\n  We found out, much to our sorrow, that in this kind of conflict, \nbrain injuries are probably far more prevalent than almost any other \nconflict in which our Nation has engaged. We also have found out, thank \nGod, that we are able to save a higher percentage of those wounded than \nwe have in any other conflict--again, a testimony to the incredible \nprofessionalism of those who labor and work with dedication in our \nmilitary medical health care system.\n  The legislation improves benefits related to the administrative \nseparation from the military due to injury, increasing severance pay \nfor servicemembers with disabilities incurred in a combat zone, and \neliminating the requirement that severance pay be deducted from VA \ndisability compensation for disabilities incurred in a combat zone--\nanother remarkable situation which should have been fixed long ago. It \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to immediately implement pilot \nprojects to test improvements to the disability evaluation systems, to \nfundamentally change and improve those antiquated systems. It requires \nthe Secretary of Defense to inspect and improve medical treatment in \nresidential facilities and to study the accelerated construction of new \nfacilities at the National Medical Center at Bethesda. The current \nfacilities of Walter Reed have served the Nation well, but we can, and \nmust, do better.\n  This legislation is an important step toward restoring trust for \nAmerica's wounded and our veterans, but it is not our final \ndestination. Our work also must be informed by the Presidential \nCommission on Care for America's Wounded, cochaired by one of my \npersonal heroes, Senator Dole, an enduring American hero. This report \nwill be filed in another few weeks, and I am confident we will work to \nimplement the recommendations of that report as quickly as possible.\n  I am pleased that the Senate Committees on Armed Services and \nVeterans' Affairs held a joint hearing on the care of the wounded \nearlier this year. On June 27, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nreported a bill, portions of which will be offered as an amendment to \nthe underlying bill. These add new resources for traumatic brain injury \nand mental health evaluations provided by the VA and extend the \neligibility for care for combat veterans from 2 to 5 years.\n  I believe additional conversation and legislation are needed to \nensure that veterans with service-connected illnesses and disabilities \nhave timely access to quality health care service through the Veterans' \nAdministration. Given the strain on the veterans health system and the \nlimits of our resources, I believe this can best be achieved through \npartnerships with civilian health care specialists, based on the health \ncare needs of our wounded veterans. I don't think there is anybody in \nthe world who is better qualified and better trained to address direct \ncombat injuries. I do believe there are many areas of health care in \nAmerica that are better at certain types of illnesses, certain types of \nmental therapy that is required, and other areas where health care \nspecialists exist. Those health care specialists should be made \navailable to our veterans. I am a fiscal conservative, as everybody \nknows, but in this area, the care and treatment of wounded warriors and \nveterans, we cannot retreat, no matter what the cost.\n  I wish to again thank the distinguished chairman of this committee \nfor his leadership. I again thank Senator Akaka, Senator Craig, and \nevery member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee as well as the Armed \nServices Committee for our coming together and coming forward with this \nlegislation. I only regret that it was needed.\n  I repeat the words of President George Washington in 1789, as I have \nso often during these times:\n\n       The willingness with which our young people are likely to \n     serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly \n     proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier \n     wars were treated and appreciated by their country.\n\n  Again, I thank all the members of the committee, and I thank Ted and \nSara Wade, Jeff and Christy Mittman, Eric Edmondson, Mark Robbins and \nhis parents, and all of our wounded and their families. The solution to \nyour trials requires cooperation among us all--in Congress, within the \nexecutive branch, and among veterans in military service organizations. \nWith this amendment, I believe we are on the right path.\n  Again, I want to add my appreciation for the veterans service \norganizations--the VFW, the DAV, the AMVETS, the American Legion, and \nso many veterans organizations that labored day after day, in obscurity \nbut with courage and with dedication on behalf of our veterans. Without \nthem, we would not have received the valuable guidance and information \nand knowledge they have provided us as they address these challenges \nevery single day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Hawaii would \nyield for a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Certainly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nremarks of the Senator from Hawaii, the Senator from Washington and the \nSenator from New York be recognized on this side to speak, and if there \nare Senators on the Republican side who wish to speak, that they be \ninterspersed with those three Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2019\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking member \nfor their leadership in bringing about changes that will make a huge \ndifference in the military and in our country as well. Later today, I \nintend to offer, along with my good friend and\n\n[[Page S9090]]\n\nranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Senator Craig, an \namendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2008 that would complement the outstanding work already done by the \nArmed Services Committee with the dignified treatment of wounded \nwarriors amendment.\n  Our amendment seeks to enhance the care servicemembers receive once \nthey transition to veteran status. It would improve the capability of \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs to care for veterans with traumatic \nbrain injuries. It would also improve access to VA mental health and \ndental care, address the issue of homelessness among newly discharged \nservicemembers, and recognize the importance of the National Guard and \nReserve in the VA's outreach programs.\n  This amendment is a direct outcome of the close collaboration between \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee \nfollowing our April 12 joint hearing. I was delighted to work with \nChairman Levin of the Armed Services Committee, Ranking Member Craig of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee, and others on this important \namendment. I also thank Senators Rockefeller, Murray, Obama, Brown, and \nMikulski for their cosponsorship of the amendment.\n  Our amendment includes provisions recently approved by the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs at our markup on June 27 and represents the VA \nCommittee's work to address the seamless-transition issues in \ncollaboration with the Armed Services Committee's work on S. 1606, the \nDignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act. Our actions here today, \nMr. President, represent true collaboration between the two \ncommittees--a model for how the Department of Veterans Affairs and \nDefense should be working together.\n  At the heart of our amendment are improvements to TBI care. Ranking \nMember Craig and I worked on these TBI provisions, and they have \ngarnered the support of many organizations, including the American \nAcademy of Neurology, the Brain Injury Association of America, the \nCommission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, and the \nDisabled American Veterans.\n  The VA was caught flatfooted by the large number of devastating TBIs \nresulting from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our amendment \nwould require individual rehabilitation plans for veterans with TBI and \nauthorize the use of non-VA facilities for the best TBI care available. \nIt would require the VA to implement and research an education program \nfor severe TBI through coordination with other Federal entities \nconducting similar research. There is also a pilot program for \nassisted-living services for veterans with TBI. This is comprehensive \nTBI legislation.\n  The amendment also addresses the amount of time a newly discharged \nservicemember has to take advantage of the unfettered access to VA care \nfor which they are eligible. Under current law, any Active-Duty \nservicemember who is discharged or separated from active duty following \ndeployment to a theater of combat operations, including members of the \nGuard and Reserve, is eligible for VA health care for a 2-year period \nwithout reference to any other criteria. Our amendment would extend \nthis period to 5 years.\n  There are two primary reasons for allowing a greater period of \neligibility: protection from budget cuts and ensuring access to care \nfor health concerns--such as mental health or readjustment problems--\nthat may not be readily apparent when a servicemember leaves active \nduty. In recent years, funding for VA health care has too often been \ndelayed by the legislative and appropriations process, leading to \ndelayed or denied care for veterans with lower priorities for VA care. \nVeterans who have served in a combat theater deserve to have their \nhealth care guaranteed for at least the 5 years immediately following \ntheir discharge.\n  With regard specifically to mental health and readjustment issues, 2 \nyears is often insufficient time for symptoms related to PTSD and other \nmental illnesses to manifest themselves. In many cases, it takes years \nfor these invisible wounds to present themselves, and many \nservicemembers do not immediately seek care. Experts predict that up to \n30 percent of OIF and OEF servicemembers will need some type of \nreadjustment service. Five years would provide a more appropriate \nwindow in which to address these risks. With over 1.4 million Americans \nhaving served in OIF and OEF and with over 600,000 of those members \nalready eligible for VA health care because they have left active duty \nor, in the case of Reserve Forces, have been demobilized, extending \nthis eligibility will help smooth their transition to civilian life.\n  To further address the mental health needs of separating \nservicemembers, we have included a provision in our amendment that \nwould require the VA to provide a preliminary mental health examination \nwithin 30 days of a veteran's request for it.\n  I thank Senator Obama for his work on this provision.\n  We have learned from past wars that the longer mental health needs go \nunmet, the more difficult and extended the recovery.\n  Additionally, as servicemembers separate from active duty and become \nveterans, the threat of homelessness always exists as they reintegrate \ninto society.\n  We have all heard the sad and shocking statistic that one out of \nevery three homeless persons on the street at any given time is a \nveteran.\n  To further assist transitioning service members, our amendment \nrequires the VA to conduct a demonstration project to identify those \nwho are at risk of becoming homeless upon discharge or release from \nactive duty. The demonstration project would provide referral, \ncounseling, and support services for these individuals.\n  It has been proven through previous VA efforts that this process can \nreduce the incidence of homelessness and other problems among veterans.\n  This amendment also addresses the issue of the VA's outreach to \nmembers of the Guard and Reserves.\n  In the ongoing global operations, the reserve components have been \nused on an unprecedented scale. When these citizen soldiers redeploy \nand demobilize it is essential that the VA include them in outreach \nefforts.\n  To recognize the importance of the Guard and Reserve, and to \nacknowledge their contribution to the Nation's efforts, this amendment \nwould redefine the VA's definition of outreach to include specific \nreference to the Guard and Reserve.\n  Finally, the amendment also addresses VA dental care for separating \nservicemembers by extending the window to apply for VA dental benefits \nfollowing discharge from active duty. This amendment extends from 90 \ndays to 180 days the application period for such benefits.\n  Recently returned servicemembers face significant readjustment, and \ndental concerns may not be a top priority. In addition, members of the \nNational Guard and Reserve are often given 90 days of leave following \ndischarge from active duty, and, upon return to their units, the \nopportunity to apply for dental benefits has passed.\n  The extension to 180 days would improve access to care and facilitate \nsmoother transition from military to civilian life.\n  Our amendment touches on many of the issues that are affecting \ntransitioning servicemembers and newest veterans. It truly complements \nthe outstanding work that was done by the Armed Services Committee to \ntake care of wounded warriors. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis amendment when it comes before the Senate. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I know Senator Murray is going to be recognized now under \nour existing unanimous consent agreement. I ask, after she is \nrecognized and after Senator Schumer, who is also in the sequence, is \nrecognized, that Senator Carper of Delaware be recognized following \nSenator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nIsakson be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it is an honor to me to be here today \nto speak about the amendment that is currently before the Senate, the \nDignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors\n\n[[Page S9091]]\n\nAct. This is a critically important amendment for the Senate and a \ncritically important action for Congress and for the United States of \nAmerica in finally making sure that we take care of those who have \nserved this country so honorably, the men and women who are serving us \noverseas.\n  Madam President, 4\\1/2\\ years ago, the President asked Congress to go \nto war in Iraq. I stood on this floor as one of a handful of Senators, \n23 of us who, at that time, said no. I said no because I didn't believe \nwe had a clear mission. I didn't believe we should take our eye off the \nball of the war on terror and the al-Qaida threat that was confronting \nour Nation, and I believed we did not have in place a long-term plan \nfor military action in Iraq. I have never regretted that vote.\n  But when I spoke on the floor opposing the action of the President, I \nsaid once our troops were sent to war, no matter how we voted on it, it \nwas our responsibility to make sure we took care of them when they came \nhome. This country has failed to do that.\n  I had to sit out here on the Senate floor and fight, literally, vote \nafter vote to get this Senate to pay attention to the fact that we had \nmen and women coming home, waiting in long lines to get their VA \nbenefits, who were not able to get an appointment to see a doctor, who \nwere unemployed, who were being sent back to the front time and time \nagain, whose families were falling through the cracks because of the \nlong deployments, and that we had military facilities that were \nincapable of dealing with the thousands of men and women who were \ncoming home and who were injured.\n  Today, finally, we are coming to a point where, through the hard work \nof our VA Committee, Armed Services, and others, we have brought to the \nSenate a bipartisan amendment that I hope passes overwhelmingly this \nafternoon, that begins to address the critical needs which our soldiers \nare facing.\n  Since this war began 4\\1/2\\ years ago, I have taken the time to stop \nand talk to our men and women when they have come home. I have seen the \ntears in their eyes as they wait on medical hold not for days, not for \nmonths, but for more than a year, fighting the very service they swore \nto serve, to get their benefits. They were given ratings that were far \ntoo low in order to keep them in the military rather than allowing them \nto get out and get on with their lives. I have talked to men and women \non medical hold, who were trying to get through a complex system of \nratings for help, whose advocates themselves, advocates to help them \nget through the system, were soldiers who had post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome and had difficulty themselves dealing with their own lives, \nlet alone advocating for a servicemember who is trying to get through a \ncomplex system.\n  I have talked personally to men and women who, after not once, not \ntwice, but maybe dozens, if not more than 100 times, being close to \nexplosives, came home and couldn't understand why they couldn't \nremember their children's names or where they put their car keys or \neven where they lived because they had traumatic brain injury, but no \none had diagnosed it correctly.\n  I have talked to too many parents and spouses and family members who \nhave told me horrific stories of their very proud servicemember who has \ncome home, left the service, and been left at home medically dealing \nthemselves drugs because they have post-traumatic stress syndrome and \nno one had taken the time to find them or their family to educate them \nabout the services they need.\n  When we agree to this legislation, this amendment today, we will \nfinally have taken a very direct step in helping the men and women who \nhave served this country so honorably.\n  Madam President, 4\\1/2\\ years ago, when the President asked us to go \nto war in Iraq, he talked about weapons of mass destruction, he talked \nabout al-Qaida, he talked about the mission to fight the war on \nterror--but what he has never talked about, in my opinion, is taking \ncare of those men and women who have served us honorably. Today, the \nSenate is going to talk about those men and women who have served us \nand what we need to do for them.\n  Several months ago, Bob Woodruff presented an amazing television \nseries to us about traumatic brain injury and its impact on men and \nwomen as they make their way through medical hold and finally go out \nand get into communities and are lost in the system. Traumatic brain \ninjury is not something that can be treated today and you are fine \ntomorrow. It is a lifelong, debilitating injury. We do not have out in \nthe country today the capability of making sure those men and women are \nnot lost.\n  We have seen too many times, when men and women who have post-\ntraumatic stress syndrome can't keep a job, and they find themselves at \nhome and, tragically, cases of suicide because of that.\n  We have to address the costs and the issues that face our men and \nwomen, and proudly stand here and make sure we are doing everything we \ncan. This year, with the Democratically controlled majority, we have \nfinally moved forward for the first time to put in place a strong \nbudget to take care of our veterans. We have finally, for the first \ntime when we passed the supplemental war spending, actually added \ndollars to care for our veterans.\n  Today the step we are taking has more to do with the policies these \nmen and women fight when they come home. They are in a system in the \nservice that rates them one way, and when they finally get discharged, \nthey go through a veterans system that rates them in an entirely \ndifferent way. The two systems do not talk to each other. They do not \nelectronically talk to each other. Soldiers lose their medical forms. \nThey are fighting systems. They can't get the benefits they deserve \nbecause they are fighting paperwork.\n  No one should fight for our country overseas and come home and have \nto fight paperwork. That is what this amendment will do, is make sure, \nfinally, that the VA and the DOD speak in the same language and treat \nthese men and women as a single person and not just a pile of \npaperwork.\n  This amendment has teeth. It will require the Department of Defense \nand the Department of Veterans Affairs for the very first time to come \nback to us by January 1 of next year with a series of comprehensive \npolicies that will make sure our rating systems are the same; that \ntheir electronic systems that track our men and women speak to each \nother; that no one gets lost because their advocate is dealing with his \nor her own health care issues. It will make sure we can go back with \npride to the men and women who have served us and say we have made a \ntremendous effort for them.\n  We have seen partisan battles through many years on the floor of the \nSenate. Today we are going to see a time when we come together as \nRepublicans and Democrats to say there is one group of Americans who \ndeserve us to speak with one voice, and that is the men and women who \nhave served us. Regardless of how we feel about this war, regardless of \nhow we want to end it--I want to end it more than anyone--I want to \nmake sure the men and women who served us are taken care of. This \namendment makes a dramatic step forward.\n  I think it is important to know, even if we were able to get enough \nvotes to end this war today, the men and women who have served us will \nneed our help and our support and our dollars for years to come--\nwhether they have lost a limb, whether they have traumatic brain \ninjury, whether they have post-traumatic stress syndrome. They have \nborne the burden of this war. It is incumbent upon this country to bear \nthe burden of their care. This amendment takes a major step forward, \nand I hope today we have 100 percent of the Senators on the floor \nsaying yes to the men and women who served us so honorably.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, before the Senator from New York is \nrecognized under our unanimous consent agreement, I especially thank \nthe Senator from Washington. She has been one extraordinary advocate \nfor this cause of our veterans. She is a symbol of the effort that so \nmany people in this Senate have put into this legislation, but I just \nwant to especially identify her because she, along with Senator Akaka \nand other members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, has joined with \nus as one. I thank her particularly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S9092]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask my friend, the chairman, if perhaps we might, \nafter the Senator from Washington is recognized, by unanimous consent, \ngo through the managers' amendments following that and then proceed \nwith the debate, or is the Senator from New York also recognized?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The sequence is the Senator from New York, then the \nSenator from Delaware. But how long will this take?\n  Mr. McCAIN. For us to go through the package, a maximum of 3 or 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Are we ready with the list?\n  Mr. McCAIN. If that is all right, maybe between the two Senators we \ncan do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I wish to thank both my \ncolleague from Michigan, who does such a profoundly great effort on \nthese proposals and these bills, for the thought and the care and the \nsensibility that goes into it. I also wished to say that my colleague \nfrom Washington, I wished to add my voice, she has been a clarion \nvoice, talking about veterans and their needs and their care long \nbefore the issue was front and center, long before the Walter Reed \nscandal emerged, long before we were able to take over the Senate and \nput the money of this Nation where its voice has been, and that is \nbehind our veterans.\n  Now, the amendment that was offered that my colleague from Washington \ntalked about, the dignified treatment of wounded warriors, to honor \nthose who serve us with medical care and treatment they need is another \nopportunity to demonstrate our support for our troops.\n  I hope my colleagues will all join us in this amendment and do what \nis right for those who serve. Unfortunately, yesterday, my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle blocked another effort to support our \ntroops with appropriate time at home between deployments. Yesterday \nthey blocked Senator Webb's amendment addressing the serious challenges \nour military is facing both abroad and home.\n  I am disappointed that most of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle felt it was more important to simply go along with the wishes of \nthe President than support our troops, the brave men and women who are \nfighting for us in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  We are putting our most valuable military resource at risk by failing \nto provide our troops with the resources they need to complete their \nmission. By that, I mean we are not allowing them enough time to \nrecover in between their deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  My State is home to one of the Nation's finest military academies, if \nnot the finest in the United States, the U.S. Military Academy at West \nPoint. West Point produces many of our military's finest leaders.\n  But while West Point continues to produce excellent soldiers, the \nArmy is unable to keep them. Unfortunately, graduates of West Point are \nleaving the military at five times the rate they did before the Iraq \nwar. Roughly half of the West Point classes of 2000 and 2001 have left \nthe Army. That is an extremely severe indictment of the President's \npolicies in Iraq.\n  When these patriots, these young men and women who want to serve \ntheir country and enroll in this great institution leave so quickly, \nwhich has been uncharacteristic, it says something very severe about \nthe wrong direction our Nation's military policy is pursuing.\n  That is not all. This January, 3,200 members of the valiant 10th \nMountain Division, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, stationed in Fort Drum, NY, \nlearned that their tour had been extended by 4 months. They had been \nfighting in Afghanistan for nearly 12 months and found out, right as \nthey were to come home, they would have to remain in Afghanistan for an \nadditional 4 months.\n  That is why I supported Senator Webb's amendment. We have asked so \nmuch our of our brave men and women who continue to sacrifice their \nlives and place themselves in harm's way to defend our Nation. At the \ncurrent troop rotation rate, we are simply running our troops into the \nground.\n  This hurts us at home, both in declining retention rates and the rise \nof mental health issues associated with multiple deployments to Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  As I have said before, I am disappointed that some have felt it was \nmore important to support the President than to support the troops, the \nbrave men and women who are fighting for us in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  But despite the refusal of the other side to join us in the Webb \namendment, Congress will not stop supporting our troops, as we carry on \nthe fight to transform our failing policy in Iraq to a mission that \nreflects the current situation on the ground.\n  When the President vetoed our supplemental spending bill, we vowed \nthat we would continue to ratchet up the pressure as the President \nbecomes more and more isolated in his views. Well, here we are. This \nweek we in Congress continue to work toward a solution in Iraq that \nchanges our mission from policing a civil war to more on what should be \nour first and foremost goal, counterterrorism. Now the pressure on this \nadministration is rising as the people speak out and demand change and \nmore and more Republicans are joining with us and the Democratic \nCongress in looking toward a change in mission for our troops.\n  As more Republicans join us in our fight to transform the mission on \nthe ground, the President has only responded with threats and empty \nrhetoric. So let me be clear: President Bush has to realize we are not \ngoing to give up our goal of changing our mission. We will not back \ndown, we will not be deterred, we will not rest until the mission \nchanges; that mission that costs $10 billion a month, because this \nadministration has continued to pursue its policy in fear, empty words, \ncharges that people are not patriotic, charges that people are not \nsupporting the troops, even though that is exactly what we are trying \nto do here and have been doing. That is not going to work. This debate \nis not going away.\n\n  Even though the President continues to stall, telling the country to \nwait until September when his general issues a report that everyone \nelse in our country and around the world already seems to know, that \nour current policy in Iraq is not working, we will move now to change \nthe course in Iraq.\n  The President would be wise to work with us to change the mission \nnow, not wait until September when this report is issued. If the report \nhad any degree of honesty or integrity, it will show that the mission \nis not working.\n  I speak to soldiers all the time, from NCOs and privates to one- and \ntwo-star generals. So many of them, when they talk to you privately, \nbelieve the mission is not, cannot, and will not work. It seems almost \neveryone knows this. There are many in the military, particularly in \nthe higher ranks, who are loyal to the President, as they should be; he \nis the Commander in Chief, but in the hearts and minds of so many of \nour soldiers, they know the policy is not working.\n  Every day that we wait, our troops continue to be caught in the \ndangerous crosshairs of a civil war; every day that we wait, the \nAmerican people grow more dissatisfied with our failed strategy; every \nday we wait, more members of your party realize we must change course \nand call for it.\n  So the Senate, led by Chairman Levin and our great military expert in \nthis body, the only West Point graduate in this body, Senator Jack Reed \nof Rhode Island, the Senate has an opportunity to send the President \neven tougher language regarding our policies regarding Iraq.\n  This amendment does all the right things. It changes the current \nmission to force protection, training Iraqi security forces, and \nperforming targeted counterterrorism operations. But it also calls for \na substantial reduction in our forces in Iraq by next April, and it \nrequires these changes. It is not laudatory, wishful thinking such as \nsome of the other amendments. It is the only amendment that is before \nus that requires a change of course in Iraq.\n  That is the right policy for many reasons. First, our troops are \ncaught in the middle of a civil war in Iraq. They patrol the streets of \nBaghdad, while Sunnis and Shias shoot at one another. Our soldiers are \ncaught in the crossfire. That is not where they belong; a point\n\n[[Page S9093]]\n\nthat I, along with many of my colleagues, have been making for a long \ntime.\n  It is clear the Sunnis, the Shias, and the Kurds dislike each other \nmore than they like any central government of Iraq. No number of \nAmerican troops will change that no matter how hard they try and how \nvaliant they are. The Sunnis, Shias and Kurds also have to work this \nout for themselves.\n  Second, we need to focus on Afghanistan, where the planning for 9/11 \ntook place, where al-Qaida is growing in strength. We are not nearly \ndoing enough in Afghanistan to counteract the ever-increasing \nproduction of opium there, a problem that threatens the ever fragile \nGovernment.\n  Not only does opium production fuel the heroin trade around the \nglobe, but the heroin funds terrorists who aim to attack the United \nStates and our allies around the world.\n  Our soldiers have fought long and hard to rid Afghanistan of \nterrorists and Taliban. However, as the drug trade continues to surge \nand consume the Nation, their heroic efforts may be undone. The Taliban \ndraws its strength from the drug trade in order to prevent them from \nreclaiming the country. We need to crack down on the drugs that fuel \ntheir regime.\n  Secretary Chertoff's report said al-Qaida is stronger today than it \nwas before 9/11. That is as severe an indictment of the President's \nIraq policy as there could be. The very forces who struck us on 9/11 \nare growing stronger in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, and around the world, \nwhile we are bogged down in Iraq.\n  Could there be any fact that demands change more than that? We were \nattacked on 9/11 by al-Qaida. The next day, 2 days, 3 days later, I was \nthere as the President stood on that pile of rubble and took the \nmegaphone from the firefighter and said: We will beat al-Qaida and we \nwill beat the terrorists.\n  They are now stronger than they were before that day. What is wrong? \nCharacteristically and depressingly, the President said al-Qaida is \nactually weaker than before 9/11, contradicting the report released by \nhis Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  The President says al-Qaida is weaker. The Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity has issued a report saying they are stronger. This is so \ntypically unfortunate of this administration. This is a rerun of the \nweapons of mass destruction issue that occurred long ago. Make up your \nmind on what you want to do, ignore all the facts, and no matter what \nthe people around you say, no matter what the American people say, vote \nfor it.\n  Unfortunately, we have become bogged down in a civil war in Iraq no \none has bargained for, as al-Qaida grows stronger in other parts of the \nworld. Being caught in the crosshairs of a sectarian struggle not only \nputs our troops in harm's way, it means we are not focusing our \nresources, our energy, and our soldiers on what is the most important \nthing, which is defeating al-Qaida and terrorists.\n  Our mission today was not the original mission, and that is why we \nmust change, why it must change to put the focus back on \ncounterterrorism. Every day we continue to follow the President's Iraq \npolicy is another day al-Qaida can strengthen.\n  That is not just my assessment. That is the feeling of this Congress, \nincluding more and more Members on the other side of the aisle; it is \nthe feeling of a majority of the American people and so many in the \nintelligence agencies.\n  Today, the President claimed there are some signs of success in Iraq. \nBut this administration's sign of success is very different than most \npeoples'. The Government of Iraq has failed to meet few of the \nlegislative benchmarks set out by the administration itself. Violence \nin Baghdad and across Iraq continues unabated. Thousands of refugees \nare fleeing Iraq every day. Iran continues to support efforts to \ndestabilize the region. Yet the administration still refuses to admit \nwe need to change our failing policy in Iraq.\n  President Bush and his few remaining allies continue to cling to the \nfiction that our present course can somehow turn the situation around. \nThe American people know better. This Congress knows better. That is \nwhy we keep pushing and pushing and pushing to change the mission in \nIraq to one that reflects the reality on the ground.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the Levin-Reed amendment. It is \nthe only amendment that requires a change in direction in Iraq. All of \nthe others have good intentions, but they are hortatory. They are \noffered with good intentions, but they allow people to say: I want a \nchange in policy, but I am not going to force the President to do so. \nThe American people know better. They know that if you really want to \nchange the course of what we are doing in Iraq and change the course in \nthe war on terror, then you must support Levin-Reed. You can't stand \nfor something that says: Well, please, Mr. President, consider doing \nthis, as the other amendments do, because the President won't. The \nPresident has been intransigent despite all of the facts on the ground. \nIt is clear this administration has lost its way in Iraq, and this \namendment charts the right course forward and requires them to follow \nit. Despite the stubbornness of the administration, despite their \ncontinuing to ignore what is happening in this world, we need to \ntransform our mission in Iraq, and we must do it now.\n  I hope, I pray, for the future of our war on terror and for the \nfuture of this country, that the Levin-Reed amendment gets the required \n60 votes and we move forward as a nation together and set our policy \nright once and for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, Senator Carper had to leave the Chamber \nfor a moment. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin now be \nrecognized and then Senator Carper be recognized under the sequence \npreviously ordered. That is always subject to a Republican coming \nbecause they would be interspersed among the listed Senators on this \nside of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I salute the Senator from Michigan. As \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, he brings an important bill \nto the floor. This is a bill which decides how we are going to \nauthorize funds for America's military. We are enjoying the blessings \nof liberty in this country because of men and women in uniform who are \nwilling to fight and die and keep this land free. This bill each year \ntries to make certain they have the resources to fight and be \neffective, to keep America safe. It is a huge responsibility with which \nthis committee and this chairman have been entrusted. I thank the \nchairman, Senator Levin, and his Republican counterpart, Senator \nMcCain, for their fine work.\n  I wish to echo the words said by Senator Schumer about the amendments \nbefore us. One of the most important elements of this debate is what is \ngoing to happen in Iraq. If we don't make a decision in Congress to \nchange the direction in Iraq, we all know what will occur. President \nBush has made it clear. He has said he will leave it to the next \nPresident to start removing troops. That means 18 more months of war. \nIt means 18 more months of American casualties. It means 18 more months \nof expense for American taxpayers. It means a war that will continue \nwith no end in sight. We have it within our power in the Senate through \nthis bill to change that course, to have a new direction in Iraq.\n  I will support the amendment offered by Senator Levin and Senator \nJack Reed of Rhode Island. They have been two of our best leaders on \nthis issue because they are so committed to it and study it so \ncarefully. They have it right.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment says that within 120 days, American soldiers \nwill start coming home. It says that by April 1 of next year, our \nmission will change. We will no longer have a combat force protecting \nIraq. We will have specific, defined missions. Our combat forces will \ncome out. We will be there to fight the al-Qaida terrorists, to train \nIraqi soldiers, and to protect American assets and the American \nsoldiers who are coming home. That is it. At that point, the Iraqis \nhave to take over. It is their country. It is their future. At some \npoint, they have to stand up and assume the responsibility. The Levin-\nReed amendment says explicitly that is what we are going to do.\n  There are many other amendments that will be considered. Some of my\n\n[[Page S9094]]\n\nclosest friends are going to offer amendments. Senator Ken Salazar and \nSenator Lamar Alexander have a bipartisan amendment to bring in the \nIraq Study Group approach. There is nothing wrong with the Iraq Study \nGroup. We praised the Iraq Study Group when they made their report last \nDecember. Had the President lived by their recommendations, we might be \nin a different place at this moment in time. But we are not. We are \nembroiled in this war, and we need to change it.\n  I have read the Salazar-Alexander amendment in its entirety. I can \ntell you that if you vote for this amendment, not a single soldier will \ncome home, not one. They leave to the President the authority to make \nthe decision about when to end this war. We know what his view is. This \nPresident is out of touch with the reality in Iraq. He is out of touch \nwith the American people. The Salazar-Alexander amendment will not \nchange that. The Levin-Reed amendment will. It will say to the \nPresident that the American people, through their elected \nrepresentatives in the Senate, want to change this policy, and we will \ndo it by law. That is the way to change it, not by sending a message to \nthe President hoping for the best.\n  I will support the Levin-Reed amendment. I believe the Salazar-\nAlexander amendment would have been a good thing to do a year ago when \nthe Iraq Study Group issued its report. Today, it doesn't reach the \nresult we want to reach in an effective time.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2019\n\n  I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member for their work \non the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act being offered today \nas an amendment to the Defense authorization bill. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this effort.\n  I also would like to thank Senators Warner, Murray, Graham, Obama, \nWebb, Hagel, Cantwell, Clinton, and Baucus, who are co-sponsors of my \nMilitary and Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act--much of \nwhich is included in the amendment before us today.\n  Traumatic brain injury is the signature injury of the Iraq war. The \nwidespread use of Improvised Explosive Devices, IEDs, has taken a \nterrible toll. Even those who have walked off the battlefield without \nvisible scars often find they have suffered the internal trauma of a \ntraumatic brain injury.\n  The provisions from my bill that have been included in this amendment \nwill reduce the number of our wounded soldiers who fall through the \ncracks and are left to fend for themselves as they struggle to recover \nfrom a traumatic brain injury.\n  We have made tremendous progress in battlefield medical care.\n  During Vietnam, one in three service members who were injured died. \nIn Iraq and Afghanistan, 1 in 16 who are injured die. But with the \nchanges in warfare and in medical technology, more of our service \nmembers are coming home with serious brain injuries from Iraq and \nAfghanistan than from any other recent conflicts.\n  For some of these wounded warriors, the greatest battle comes at home \nwhen they seek care. Many of these returning troops need long-term \ntreatment and rehabilitation long after their discharge from active \nduty, as they fight to overcome the severe disabilities that a \ntraumatic brain injury can cause.\n  For others, there is a different story. Some service members don't \neven realize they have suffered a traumatic brain injury until long \nafter their discharge, because we don't do a very good job of \nidentifying and treating those who may have suffered a brain injury.\n  Fortunately, many of those who suffer a brain injury are able to \nrecover fairly quickly. But for some, the experience is life-altering, \neven life-shattering. We must not fail them in their time of need.\n  Consider the case of SGT Eric Edmundson. In October 2005, he suffered \na severe head concussion when a roadside bomb exploded near him. He was \ncared for at Walter Reed Hospital, but then was transferred to a VA \nfacility where he and his family felt he was not receiving the kind of \ntreatment that would allow him to continue to make progress in \nrehabilitation.\n  He would have been stuck there if the family had not found a creative \nway to obtain the care he needed by ensuring that Eric could receive \ntreatment and rehabilitation at one of the premiere rehabilitation \nhospitals in the nation: the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. Two \nweeks ago, I attended a ceremony at the Rehabilitation Institute of \nChicago in which Eric walked out of the hospital.\n  Now consider the case of SGT Garrett Anderson of Champaign, IL. \nGarrett went to Iraq with the Illinois National Guard. After 4 months \nthere, an IED exploded next to his armored humvee in Baghdad. The blast \ntore off his right arm below the elbow, shattered his jaw, severed part \nof his tongue, damaged his hearing, and punctured his body with \nshrapnel.\n  He spent 7 months at Walter Reed, where he received excellent care in \nWard 57, the famous amputee ward. However, the outpatient care that \nfollowed has been filled with paperwork and redtape. It was months \nbefore the VA recognized that Garrett had suffered a traumatic brain \ninjury, and he has not received the kind of treatment for brain injury \nthat could make a significant difference in the trajectory of his \nrehabilitation.\n  We need to change the way we handle patients with traumatic brain \ninjury, so that they receive the care they need at the time they need \nit, and the provisions from my Military and Veterans Traumatic Brain \nInjury Treatment Act that have been included in this amendment will do \njust that.\n  These provisions include: requiring the Secretary of Defense, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of the Veterans Administration, to \ndevelop a comprehensive program to prevent, diagnose, mitigate, treat, \nand otherwise respond to traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic \nstress disorder; and requiring predeployment cognitive screening as a \nbaseline for evaluating potential brain injuries.\n  Other principles from my bill have been included in this broader \namendment to apply to all service members, and not only those who have \nsuffered from traumatic brain injuries. For example, this amendment \nwould require: a uniform policy and procedures to ease a service \nmember's transition from the DOD to VA; a 3-year period in which a \nmedically retired service member can obtain the same medical benefits \nas those on active duty; a joint electronic health record for DOD and \nVA; and outreach to members and their families regarding the benefits \nto which they are entitled.\n  Indeed, we must do much more for all of our wounded warriors, and the \ndignified treatment of wounded warriors amendment is a comprehensive \npolicy governing their care. This bipartisan amendment also would \nrequire: medical care and job placement services for family members \nproviding care for severely injured service members; establishment of \nCenters of Excellence in the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, \ntreatment, and rehabilitation of traumatic brain injury and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder; improvements in the disability system for \nservice members; and improved housing facilities for injured patients.\n  Our Nation's service members deserve swift action on this effort to \nimprove the treatment they will receive if they are wounded or suffer a \ntraumatic brain injury.\n  I can't imagine the anguish that must be associated with such an \ninjury, but I can imagine the kind of medical system I would like to \nhave in place if it were my son or daughter struggling to recover from \nsuch an injury. This legislation reflects that vision.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who have contributed to this legislation \nand I urge all Senators to support this measure.\n  I wish to elaborate on a story as to why I have added provisions in \nthis amendment. This is about American soldiers coming home who are \nwounded and how they are treated. Those of us--and I think it includes \nalmost everyone in the Senate who has taken the time to go to military \nhospitals and VA hospitals--know that, sadly, after promising to these \nmen and women that if they will take the oath to defend America, we \nwill stand by them when they come home, we have broken our promise time \nand again.\n  This story illustrates why this is needed and why I have added some \nlanguage which I hope will help. It is the\n\n[[Page S9095]]\n\nstory of a brave young soldier named Eric Edmundson, 7 years in the \nArmy, 27 years of age, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in Iraq. \nAs a result of that injury, he went through surgery, and during the \ncourse of surgery, there was a problem: His brain was deprived of \noxygen for a period of time. He was rushed to Walter Reed Hospital, \nwhere he went through more surgery and more effort and then finally was \ndischarged from Walter Reed to Richmond, VA, to the VA hospital. Eric \nwent into that hospital in a very bad state. He really hadn't made much \nof a recovery. His father, his mother, his wife, and his sister were \nall by his side praying for the best and hoping for the best treatment.\n  After a period of time, the people at the Richmond VA hospital came \nto the family and said: We have bad news about Eric. We need for you to \npick out a wheelchair because he is going to spend the rest of his life \nin a wheelchair in a nursing home. His father says not only no, but \nhell no; I am going to fight for my son; he is not going to spend the \nrest of his life sitting in this wheelchair. His father quit his job in \nNorth Carolina and became a full-time advocate for his son, this fallen \nsoldier. He fought the Government to make sure his son had the best. \nLet me tell you what happened.\n  Eventually, he went on the Internet and found the Rehab Institute of \nChicago, one of the best. He insisted that his son go to this rehab \ninstitute. The Government said they wouldn't pay for it. He said: I am \nsending him anyway. He had him admitted and finally persuaded the \nGovernment to start paying for his treatment.\n  Ten weeks ago, I walked into the hospital room of Eric Edmundson. \nHere was this bright, smiling young man sitting in a wheelchair. He \nfollowed me with his eyes as I walked into the room, and I stood before \nhim and said: Eric, how are you doing? He can't speak. He just smiled, \nlooked at me, and nothing happened.\n  Four weeks ago, I went back to that hospital room to visit with the \nfamily and this young soldier. His mom and dad said: Eric has a present \nfor you. I thought: What could this be? They walked over and they \npropped him up by his elbows, and he took four steps. There wasn't a \ndry eye in that hospital room. We were all crying, including Eric. He \nwas walking.\n  His dad said to me--and this was right before Memorial Day: A month \nfrom now, he is going to walk out of the front door of this hospital. I \nwas there on June 30, the day of his official discharge. Eric Edmundson \nwalked out of the front door of that hospital. He had been given up on \nby a VA system that didn't have the 35 years of experience the Rehab \nInstitute of Chicago has. He had been given up on by so many others. \nBut America can't give up on these soldiers. We can't relegate a 27-\nyear-old soldier to a lifetime in a nursing home because we are afraid \nto refer him to the best hospital in America. That is wrong.\n  This amendment will help. This amendment for our wounded warriors \nwill help them move forward in the system and have greater \nopportunities. Sad to say, it doesn't go far enough. There has to be a \npoint in this system where the military hospitals of America and the VA \nhospitals will concede there may be a better hospital for this soldier, \nthis sailor, this marine, this airman, and we cannot deny them that \ncare. We have to give them that care. This bill doesn't include that. I \nam disappointed.\n  We asked these brave young men and women to fight our enemies \noverseas. They shouldn't come home wounded and have to fight their \nGovernment. That is what the Edmundson family had to do. We should make \ncertain no other family of any other soldier ever faces that in the \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there was an agreement previously that we \nwould alternate back and forth. If that is what Senator Isakson is \nseeking to implement, they have a right to do so. I would note to \nSenator Carper that we did agree that if a Republican did wish to \nspeak, they would be recognized in an alternate way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following sequence be accepted for \nthe Democratic Senators, subject to that same understanding that \nRepublican Senators would be interspersed: After Senator Carper, \nSenator McCaskill, Senator Brown, and then Senator Lincoln would be the \norder on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, in relation to that unanimous consent, I \nask unanimous consent that following the presentation by Senator Carper \nfrom Delaware, Senator Hutchison of Texas be the next one recognized on \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, we have had a tenuous debate, and it is \ngoing to go a while. I first commend Senator Levin on this amendment. I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of it. Although we have differences on many \nthings, I don't think there is a difference in this Chamber on the \nprovision of services and health care to our wounded warriors as they \ncome home. As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have been \npleased to work with Senator Akaka and Senator Craig on many of the \nprovisions in this legislation. I thank Senator Carper for allowing me \nto take a few minutes.\n  I appreciate the remarks by the Senator from Illinois about what he \nhas done in this bill. As I listened to many of the discussions about \nthe things we need to fix, I think sometimes we forget to remember all \nthe things we are doing well. I wish to talk about two things.\n  One, I wish to let the men and women of the U.S. Department of \nDefense medical services and the Veterans' Administration know how much \nI appreciate what they are trying to do and what they have been trying \nto do. Let me illustrate that by telling a very brief story.\n  I go to Walter Reed periodically anytime there is a wounded Georgia \nveteran there. I also see other veterans, but I make it a point to make \nsure that the parents or a spouse of every one of those veterans has my \nphone number and knows they have an advocate in Washington as long as \nthey are at Walter Reed.\n  One of my visits to Walter Reed just happened to be on the Monday \nfollowing the breakout of the story about building 19 or 18, the \nbuilding that was in bad shape. That was a national story and reflected \npoorly on Walter Reed and on us.\n  When I got there, I first went to visit Corporal Pearson, a Georgian, \nactually from my home county, who had been wounded. I gave him my phone \nnumber, and asked for his father's phone number. I left from there to \ngo to see Building 18. I went over there and saw the condition Building \n18 was in, and I, too, knew we could do much better.\n  On the way to my office at Russell, I called from my car on my cell \nphone to the corporal's father and left a message for him to call me \nback. He called me that night. I told him how much I appreciated his \nson's service, and I wanted him to know, while he and his wife were in \nGeorgia and his son was at Walter Reed, they could use me as a family \nmember, if they would, to give them any assistance he might need at the \nhospital.\n  He thanked me for that. He said: Senator Isakson, just do one thing \nfor me. I have been watching all this on the news about that building, \nand I am sorry about that, but if anybody asks you, tell them my son \nhas been in Walter Reed for 10 days, and my wife and I were with him \nevery day until yesterday, and I have never seen anybody receive finer \ncare.\n  I pass that on not to in any way mask those places where we do have \ndifficulties and need improvement--many of them recognized in this \nparticular amendment--but as we talk about things we want to make \nbetter, we cannot forget that day in and day out the loyal American \nservice men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces medical corps at Walter \nReed and in the VA who are doing a phenomenal, lifesaving job, a better \njob than has ever been done in the history of warfare. I want to put in \nthat compliment and pat on the back for them.\n  Secondly, with regard to the wounded warrior amendment, this \naddresses so many things we have learned from the trauma of the types \nof wounds that are coming from the type of warfare we are fighting in \nIraq. We are saving so many more of our wounded warriors on the \nbattlefield, but because of that we\n\n[[Page S9096]]\n\nhave many more who need long-time care, long-time attention, and \nspecific attention. This wounded warrior amendment goes a long way \ntoward doing that.\n  I particularly compliment the authors of the amendment, and all of us \non the Veterans Committee, on the new referral system that is put in \nhere for the diagnosis of PTSD, and how that has been greatly improved \nin the number of people who can actually make that referral back to \nVeterans Affairs or the Veterans' Administration or back to DOD, if \nthey are still on active duty.\n  I also want to brag for a second about General Shoomaker at Walter \nReed. One of the things we talk about--and Senator Durbin's remarks \naddressed this--is the difficulty we have been having with the handoff \nof health care from leaving DOD to going to the VA. That has been a \nproblem, and we have a record number of people who are being handed off \nonce their service is over, while they still have treatment necessary, \nfrom DOD to VA.\n  General Shoomaker was at Fort Gordon in Georgia prior to coming to \nWalter Reed, when he was asked to come in and straighten out the \ndifficulties Walter Reed had. While at Fort Gordon, General Schoomaker \nhad been the real catalyst for what is said in the military to be the \nbest seamless transfer of wounded warriors from DOD to the Veterans \nAdministration.\n  Today, now, for those who are coming home with amputations, who are \nin need of long-term therapy, long-term treatment, long-term care, who \ngo from active duty, are severed honorably, to go into veterans status, \nthey have created a seamless transfer in that rehab at Augusta, which \nis recognized as second to none. I know the recommendations in this \namendment which will be adopted by this body will go a long way toward \nimproving the systems by which those transfers take place.\n  I am pleased to rise to thank those in our military and the care they \ngive, and know there are areas where we can do better. I commend \nSenator Levin and the many cosponsors of this particular amendment for \nall the work and time that has gone into it.\n  As we have a very tenuous and difficult debate, it is important for \nthe American people to know every Member of this Congress appreciates \nthe care that is given by our military doctors and our military medical \npersonnel and understands we can do better. As we deal with the trauma \nthat comes from the type of conflict we are now in, this wounded \nwarriors amendment will see to it that the care, the referral, the \ndiagnosis, the treatment, and the transfer are better now than they \nhave ever been before.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask to be advised when I have consumed \n20 minutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I come today to address the Chamber and our colleagues on the subject \nof cost-effective airlift in the 21st century. Before I do that, \nthough, I wish to preface my remarks with this:\n  Today, we have received an interim report from the administration on \nwhether progress is being made in Iraq--specifically, progress with \nrespect to the 18 benchmarks that were required in legislation we \nenacted in May of this year. From the news accounts this morning, there \nare few surprises. The U.S. military, as expected, is doing its job--a \ntough job. The problem is, the Iraqi Government and too many of its \nelected leaders are not.\n  The Iraqi Parliament remains hamstrung by profound, seemingly \nirreconcilable differences. Despite months of American prodding, the \nIraqi lawmakers have yet to agree on any of the major issues before \nthem: how to share oil wealth, how to share power, when to schedule \nelections, de-Baathification, how to settle the sectarian differences \nthat so badly divide their country.\n  We also have news this morning that al-Qaida is once again on the \nmove, bringing to the forefront how the President's policies in Iraq \nhave effectively created not fewer terrorists but more and, \nunfortunately, made our country, I fear, less safe.\n  According to U.S. intelligence estimates, al-Qaida has rebuilt its \noperations to levels we have not seen since just before the September \n11 attacks. These reports indicate that the al-Qaida network is \nregrouping along the Afghan-Pakistani border. The CIA says there is \nevidence of more training, more money, more communications, and \nincreased activity among al-Qaida. The results of such activity, as we \nknow too well, could be deadly.\n  This new report tells me we have diverted too many of our resources \nto fighting a war that simply cannot be won by military might alone, \nand in doing so we have lost ground on the war on terror. Osama bin \nLaden remains at large 6 years after 9/11, and has seemingly taken \npeaceful refuge somewhere in Afghanistan or Pakistan. That is \nunacceptable.\n  This week and next, we are going to be taking a series of votes on \nhow best to change the course in Iraq and refocus our energy on where \nit belongs--rooting out al-Qaida and going after their terrorist \nnetworks abroad and at home in a way that makes sense and will better \nguarantee success.\n  Part of that means, beginning later this year, that we begin to \nredeploy a portion of our troops from Iraq to put additional pressure \non, and encouragement for, the Iraqi Government to do what it must do \nto help bring peace to their nation. Part of that means refocusing our \nefforts on how to win the war on terror, smoke out Osama bin Laden, \nand, in doing so, make our world a safer place.\n  I hope our President will work with our colleagues and with me to \nchart a winning course on the war on terror. We cannot get there alone. \nThis is something we must do together.\n  Having said that, I want to now focus on cost-effective airlift in \nthe 21st century.\n  The Senate is writing legislation this week intended to equip our \nArmed Forces to meet our national security threats and keep our country \nsafe. Doing so is one of the foremost responsibilities of this body.\n  Our Armed Forces are charged with providing our Commander in Chief \nwith flexible options for responding to a wide variety of threats \nacross the globe. In Iraq, our Armed Forces are keeping the lid on a \ncivil war and protecting civilians from terrorists.\n  In Korea, our Armed Forces are charged with guarding an ally's border \nand deterring aggression on the part of a large conventional military.\n  In the Pacific and the Persian Gulf, our Armed Forces protect \nAmerican interests through the projection of naval power and carrier-\nbased air power.\n  At home, our National Guard provides our Nation's Governors with \ncritical response capability to cope with natural disaster, such as \nHurricane Katrina.\n  At times, it can seem as though the demands on our military are \npractically limitless. Unfortunately, the resources available for \nequipping our military to meet these demands are not. At a time when \nour Federal budget remains mired in the red, we need to be looking for \nways to meet our military requirements in a fiscally responsible \nmanner.\n  I have come to the floor today to talk about one way we can do that. \nI have come to the floor, as I have said, to discuss cost-effective \nairlift in the 21st century.\n  Although the air men and women of our strategic airlift fleet rarely \nreceive the attention they deserve, the reality is our military could \nnot perform any of their missions I described if it were not for their \nhard work and dedication. Strategic airlift involves the use of cargo \naircraft to move personnel, weaponry, and material over long \ndistances--often to combat theaters on the other side of the globe. \nDuring Operation Desert Storm, U.S. aircraft moved over 500,000 troops \nand more than 540,000 tons of cargo. During the current war in Iraq, \nairlift sorties have made up the majority of the nearly 30,000 total \nsorties flown by U.S. military aircraft.\n  Strategic airlift enables our military to respond to threats wherever \nthey occur in the world real time. Not only must our fighting men and \nwomen be transported to the fight, they must be continuously \nresupplied. Airlift makes that possible.\n\n[[Page S9097]]\n\n  Most of the supplies, materiel, and weaponry moves abroad aboard \nships. Almost all of our personnel and a good deal of cargo, however, \nare transported by aircraft. That airlift is provided by a combination \nof U.S. military airlift and commercial aircraft. The three military \naircraft doing most of the heavy lifting are the C-5, the C-17, and the \nC-130. Together, they provide what I call an ``air bridge''--an ``air \nbridge''--to Iraq, Afghanistan, and to other troubled spots around the \nworld.\n  Over the past 10 years, the United States has reduced its Cold War \ninfrastructure and closed some two-thirds of its forward bases. \nTherefore, to maintain the same level of global engagement, U.S. forces \nmust now deploy more frequently and over greater distances. Since 9/11, \nthe scale and pace of operations has increased dramatically.\n  There have been several efforts in recent years to quantify our \nmilitary's strategic airlift requirement. The most recent one is the \nMobility Capabilities Study, which was commissioned by the Pentagon, \nand was completed in February of last year. It concluded that the \nNation's airlift requirement could be met with a fleet of 112 C-5s and \n180 C-17s.\n  Our current strategic airlift fleet--including aircraft currently \nflying and aircraft on order--consists of 111 C-5s and 190 C-17s. An \nupdate to the Mobility Capabilities Study included in the President's \nbudget this year confirmed that this mix is sufficient to meet our \nairlift needs.\n  The problem at the moment is not that we have too few aircraft; the \nproblem is that most of the C-5s in our airlift fleet are not as \nreliable as they could be. There are two ways in which we could choose \nto address this problem: One, we could fix the aircraft we have, or, \ntwo, we could purchase new aircraft.\n  Families face a similar choice when they have a problem with their \ncar. Should they fix their car or should they buy a new one? Usually \nfamilies make this decision based on one of three factors: Can the car \nthey have be fixed? If it can, is it cheaper to fix than buying a new \none? If the car can be fixed, and it is cheaper to fix than buying a \nnew one, do they have so much money that they can afford--in spite of \nthe greater cost--to go ahead and buy a new car anyhow?\n  We should ask ourselves the same question when it comes to paying for \nmilitary aircraft within the confines of a responsible Federal budget.\n  Let's look at this first chart about meeting our Nation's airlift \nneeds. We pose on the chart three questions: Can the aircraft we have \nbe fixed? Can they be fixed for less than the cost of purchasing new \naircraft? Or, finally, can we afford to buy new aircraft anyhow, even \nif it is unnecessary and more costly?\n  The answer to the first question is, yes, the aircraft can be fixed. \nThe answer to the second question--can it be fixed for less than \npurchasing a new aircraft--is, yes, it can. Can we afford to buy new \naircraft anyhow, even though it is unnecessary and may be more costly? \nThe answer to that, I believe, is no.\n  First, let's consider the question of whether the aircraft we have \ncan be fixed. There are currently programs in place to fix C-5s. The C-\n5s are being upgraded with new engines, new hydraulics, new avionics, \nand more than 70 other improvements throughout the aircraft. The \ncontractor responsible for these upgrades has committed to the Air \nForce that the improvements to these aircraft will result in at least a \n75-percent mission capable rate. That is up from 60, 65 percent today.\n  If that level of reliability can be achieved, our current fleet of C-\n5s and C-17s is sufficient to meet our airlift needs now and for the \nforeseeable future. That is the conclusion of both the military's \nlatest analyses of our airlift needs and an independent study done by \nthe Institute for Defense Analyses. To date, 3 C-5s--one a C-5A and two \nof them C-5Bs--have received the complete upgrades that are eventually \nplanned for the entire C-5 fleet. General Schwartz, who is commander of \nthe U.S. Transportation Command, has said he is encouraged by the \nperformance of these aircraft and believes the target mission-capable \nrate of at least 75 percent will be met and possibly exceeded. General \nSchwartz isn't the only one giving the modernized flights high praise.\n\n  One of the modernized B models came to the Dover Air Force Base about \n2 months ago for their annual inspection. I had the opportunity to see \nit and talk to the crew. I asked one of the pilots aboard the aircraft \nwho has some 4,000 flight hours on the C-5, ``How does it fly?'' His \nresponse: ``Like a rocket.''\n  While most acknowledge that C-5s can be fixed, there are those who \nargue that many of them are not worth fixing. I have heard two versions \nof this argument. The first is that even if most of the fleet can and \nshould be fixed, at least 25 or 30 of the older C-5As are such ``bad \nactors'' that they should be retired. Unfortunately, those who have \nmade this claim have done little to substantiate their claim. Congress \nhas asked the Air Force to provide a list of these bad actors by tail \nnumber. To date, as far as I know, the Air Force has not done so. A \nrecent analysis by the Congressional Research Service suggests a \npossible reason why. Perhaps these bad actors do not exist.\n  Let's look at this chart, my second chart here: The C-5 reliability \nargument. These are the words paraphrased from the Congressional \nResearch Service: An examination of C-5 reliability and maintainability \nstatistics for the past three fiscal years does not identify any \nobvious subset of the C-5 fleet that stands out as notably `bad \nactors.'\n  The other version of the ``some of the C-5s are not worth saving'' \nargument draws a line in the sand, not between a set of bad actors and \nthe rest of the fleet but between the older C-5As and the newer C-5Bs. \nIt is a common perception that the C-5As do not perform as well as the \nC-5Bs, but that perception again is contradicted by the facts. Again, \nto quote the CRS study, the recent CRS study--I think it was released a \ncouple of months ago:\n\n       C-5A performance and reliability is not uniformly inferior \n     to C-5B performance. Over the past three years, for example, \n     the C-5A fleet has averaged a higher mission departure \n     reliability rate of over 83 percent than the C-5B fleet, \n     which is right around 81 percent.\n\n  However, some claim that even if C-5As are not uniformly less \nreliable, inevitably they will incur structural problems because they \nare older than the C-5B models. This claim continues to be made even \nafter the Air Force established a Fleet Viability Board in 2003 to \nevaluate the C-5A fleet and render judgment on the suitability for its \ncontinued service. The board 4 years ago reviewed all the relevant data \nand concluded that the C-5A fleet is structurally sound and viable for \nat least 25 years and probably longer. To be sure--to be sure--the Air \nForce actually tore a C-5A apart in late 2005 to inspect it from top to \nbottom and end to end. The aircraft was given a clean bill of health.\n  The evidence at hand strongly suggests, at least to me, that we could \nfix the aircraft we have. Here is the question, though: Can we fix them \nfor less than it would cost to replace them with new aircraft? On this \npoint, it is not even close.\n  Before I go on to explain why that is the case, let me pause for a \nmoment to say that as a former naval flight officer--I served 5 years \nactive duty, 18 years in the Reserve; I have about 3,500 hours in a P-3 \nNavy aircraft. Let me say I am a great admirer of the C-17 aircraft. I \nhave supported, and I suspect the Presiding Officer has supported, \nacquisition of additional C-17 aircraft out of the 190 that have been \nbought so far. Having said that, it is a highly reliable workhorse. Its \nmission-capable rate hovers around 85 percent. It can land on large \nairfields and small airstrips, all of which highly commend the aircraft \nto us, and that is why we ordered and bought so many of them. In my own \nState, the Dover Air Force Base has begun receiving a squadron of 13 C-\n17s. We are delighted. We are excited. We are enthusiastic about their \narrival.\n  Having said that, let me add that the cost of modernizing a C-5 is \nroughly one-third--let me say that again--the cost of modernizing a C-5 \nis roughly one-third the cost of purchasing a new C-17. Modernizing a \nC-5 is roughly one-third of the cost of purchasing a new C-17. \nMoreover, the C-5 can carry twice as much cargo as the C-17. By \nmodernizing a C-5, we buy twice as much hauling capacity for one-third \nthe cost. Let me say that again. By modernizing a C-5, we can buy twice \nas much hauling capacity for one-third the cost.\n\n[[Page S9098]]\n\n  Now, I know some dispute these figures. First, they argue that \nmodernizing a C-5 costs more than one-third of the cost of purchasing a \nnew C-17. They do so by suggesting that the C-5 reengineering program \nis experiencing dramatic cost growth. Again, the facts say otherwise. \nAccording to CRS, claims that the cost of C-5 modernization has risen \nsubstantially--and this is what CRS says; this is a quote--``appear to \nbe somewhat at odds with official cost reports from the Department of \nDefense Comptroller.''\n  The Defense 2006 Select Acquisition Report for the C-5 reengineering \nprogram showed average procurement unit cost growth of under 3 percent. \nNow, it is never good news when a program cost growth goes over \nexpectation, even by a little. However, 2.9 percent cost growth is not \nparticularly remarkable when compared to other Defense acquisition \nprograms.\n  Moreover, CRS reports that:\n\n       Projections of future cost growth are driven in large part \n     by the Air Force's decision to slow down the C-5 \n     modernization production and to extend it by two years.\n\n  Over the last 5 years, the Air Force has pushed this program further \nand further out into the future--not 2 years but 5 years. Because \nstretching out the program leads to insufficient production rates, \ncosts have increased.\n  The contractor responsible for modernizing C-5s has offered the Air \nForce a firm fixed-price contract in order to guarantee no more cost \noverruns. All the Air Force has to do to nail down a definite, \naffordable price is not stretch out the program any further. The ball \nis in the Air Force's court. If the Air Force does not choose to keep \nthe program on schedule, thereby securing an affordable, fixed price, \none has to wonder--at least I wonder--whether the Air Force is \ninterested in making the most cost-effective choice for taxpayers.\n  Advocates of retiring C-5s have also disputed the fact that a C-5 can \ncarry twice as much as the C-17. In fact, they have begun to refer to \nC-5s as ``C-17 equivalents'' for purposes of meeting our airlift needs.\n\n  However, the C-5 clearly boasts a greater payload capacity than the \nC-17, as this chart shows. This is the C-5 and C-17 capabilities \ncomparison. Let's look at it: The C-5 and the C-17. MA tanks, the C-5 \ncarries two, the C-17 carries one; Bradleys, the C-5 carries four, the \nC-17 carries two; Apache helicopters, the C-5 carries six, the C-17 \ncarries three; multiple launch rocket systems, the C-5 carries four, \nthe C-17 carries two. And Patriot missile launchers, the C-5 carries \ntwo and the C-17 carries one.\n  Despite the fact its cargo capacity in cubic feet for the C-5 is only \n60 percent greater than the C-17, the C-5 hauls double the load in \nseveral cases and actually makes more efficient use of its cargo space \nwhen transporting large weapons systems, I think as we see here. \nDespite the size advantage of the C-5, advocates of retiring the C-5 \nstill make two arguments to ignore the vehicle's greater hauling \ncapacity.\n  First, they point out the C-5s currently have reliability problems \nthat negate the C-5s' greater size and capacity. The problem with this \nargument is we are addressing C-5 reliability problems through the \nmodernization process that our friends in the Air Force continue to \ndelay. The second argument I hear for overlooking the C-5's superior \nhauling capacity is it doesn't actually matter in practice. Some claim \nthat since both C-5s and C-17s generally fly missions carrying less \nthan the full weight they are capable of carrying, it makes little \nsense to compare what they are capable of carrying when fully loaded. \nWell, my office was told the reason C-5s and C-17s generally carry less \nthan the capacity is they ``cube out'' first. That means the limiting \nfactor is more often the number of pallets these aircraft can carry, \nrather than the weight they carry. However--here is an important \npoint--this point reinforces that C-5s actually carry twice as much as \nthe C-17s, since C-5s have 36 pallet positions and C-17s have only 18.\n  So can we fix the aircraft we have for less than the cost of \nreplacing them with new aircraft? I believe the answer is yes.\n  Let's look at this last chart, some of the benefits of the C-5. This \nis a paraphrase of the CRS report that came out a couple months ago. \nThis is what the paraphrase is. It says: Current cost estimates of \nmodernizing the C-5 are about one-third that of a new C-17, and the C-5 \nwill carry twice the payload of the C-17.\n  Not my words but those of CRS.\n  We can fix the aircraft, the C-5As and Bs that we have, and it is \nclearly less expensive to do that than to buy new aircraft. But can we \nafford to purchase new aircraft anyhow, even though it is unnecessary \nand exceedingly costly? In 2006, the Federal Government, our Federal \nGovernment, ran a deficit of just under a quarter of a trillion \ndollars. OMB tells us the deficit for 2007 this year will be around \n$200 billion. We are rapidly approaching the retirement of the baby \nboomers, which will put unprecedented strain on Social Security, on \nMedicare, and on Medicaid. In short, we are spending beyond our means, \nand we are using the Social Security surplus to mask an even larger \noperational deficit.\n  The Defense Science Board tells us that:\n\n       Each year of additional C-17 production beyond 2008 will \n     represent an additional $2.4 billion acquisition and $2 \n     billion to $3 billion life cycle cost commitment.\n\n  I would ask: Aren't there better ways we could use some of this money \nthan purchasing aircraft the military has not requested, credible \nstudies suggest to me--and I think to others--that we don't need?\n  Even if we confine our focus on the Air Force budget, it is clear \nthere are better uses for this money. The strategic airlift fleet--C-5s \nand C-17s--is the youngest of the Air Force's aircraft fleets--the \nyoungest--not the oldest, the youngest. If we have several billion \ndollars lying around, I would suggest there are other fleets in the Air \nForce inventory in more urgent need of new aircraft than the strategic \nairlift fleet, including tankers, C-130s, to name a few. Yet if you ask \nthe Chief of Staff of the Air Force, he will tell you this is the \nreason the Air Force is not and will probably not put money in its own \nbudget to retire C-5s and replace them with new aircraft.\n  When we actually sit down and do the math, it is difficult to argue \nthat C-5s, with wings and fuselages that have another 30 or 40 years of \nuseful life, should be retired and replaced with new C-17s. It is even \nmore difficult to argue that it is cost-effective to do so.\n  The only reason left to consider for why we would possibly want to \nretire C-5s and replace them with new C-17s is that the C-17s can \nperform missions that C-5s cannot.\n  It is true that C-17s and C-5s have different attributes. The C-17 \ncan land on short, austere runways that the C-5 cannot. But it is \nimportant to keep in mind that only a small minority of strategic \nairlift missions involve taking off from or landing on short, austere \nrunways. On the other hand, the C-5 can carry outsized cargo that the \nC-17 cannot carry.\n  In fact, the evidence suggests that if we have a deficit, in terms of \nmatching our capabilities with our needs, it is that we have too few \nmodernized C-5s, not too few C-17s. For instance, during Operation \nEnduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, the Department of Defense has been \nforced to lease a Russian aircraft called the An-124 to carry outsize \nand oversize cargo because C-17s cannot carry this cargo, and not \nenough C-5 aircraft have been available.\n  An-124s are Russian aircraft that are comparable to the C-5s. \nActually, they are a little bigger than C-5s. It is ironic that some \nare talking about retiring C-5s when the C-5s we have are insufficient \nto meet our needs and we must rely on an even larger Russian aircraft \nto help fill the gap.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor on more than one occasion \nduring my time in the Senate to discuss this issue. I want to be honest \nwith you; sometimes we act as though our usual obligation to be careful \nstewards of the taxpayers' dollars does not apply when it comes to \ndefense spending. I want to remind my colleagues of this: When we spend \nbeyond our needs, there is an opportunity cost. We end up shortchanging \nour troops in the field, failing to provide them with the body armor \nand up-armored vehicles they need, or we end up shortchanging our \ntroops when they come home, failing to actually tend to their physical \nand psychological needs, which is a problem and concern we hope to \naddress by the\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\namendment that was discussed before me.\n  Let me finish today by commending the leadership of the Armed \nServices Committee and its SeaPower Subcommittee, which has \njurisdiction over this issue. They have shown a commitment over the \nyears to identifying the facts on this issue and making decisions based \non the facts.\n  The Defense bill reported out of the Armed Services Committee--the \nbill before us today--retains the requirement in current law that we \nfully flight-test three C-5s that have been modernized before making \nany further C-5 retirement decisions. The committee also approved \nreport language requiring the Air Force to provide Congress with a \nreport this year, giving us an up-to-date assessment on the performance \nof these three C-5s which have undergone modernization upgrades, as \nwell as the projected cost of upgrading of the rest of the C-5 fleet.\n  I thank the members of the committee and the chairman and Senator \nMcCain, as well as their staffs, for their work on this issue. I hope \nwe pass this Defense authorization bill which is before us. I hope the \nSenate will insist on its position in this regard in the conference \nwith the House.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nSenator McCaskill's remarks, Senator Collins be recognized on the \nRepublican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Levin and Senator \nMcCain for making this amendment a priority. I also thank Chairman \nAkaka, Senator Murray, and many others who worked on this issue for a \nlong time.\n  I was honored to have the opportunity to be one of the first in the \nSenate to file a bill on the subject of wounded warriors after the \nWalter Reed scandal broke. It was an interesting process for me because \nI spent time at Walter Reed and, of course, I got the official tour. \nThen I sat down and talked to the soldiers there. It was in those \nconversations that I learned about some of the problems we are trying \nto address in this important amendment. Many of the things Senator \nObama and I included in our legislation have, in fact, been included in \nthis amendment. Overall, it is going to make a real difference in these \nwarriors' lives and their families' lives--how they are treated within \nour health care system as they return from battle, as they return from \ntheir service, while they are still in the Active military.\n  I won't go into the details of the amendment. Many others have spoken \nabout it. Suffice it to say that, overall, it is going to make a huge \nimprovement in the physical disability system and being able to \nmaneuver through the system in a way that is not punitive, making that \ntransition from the Active military to the veterans system much \nsmoother and easier to navigate. It is going to support the families of \nthese men and women. That was what struck me. Some of these family \nmembers who are going to Walter Reed to care for these men and women \nwho have given so much for us--they were not being treated with \nconsistency, not getting some of the benefits they deserved because, \nfrankly, they were doing us a favor by being there and caring for their \nloved ones. We also address that.\n  Certainly, we have more assistance and advocacy for outpatients. That \nwas the meat of the problem at Walter Reed. It wasn't the quality of \nthe medical care they were receiving; it was the way the outpatients \nwere being treated, the facilities they were in, the priority they were \nbeing given, and were their needs being met, particularly in the area \nof substance abuse, and were they being met in the area of mental \nhealth care. I think this amendment will go a long way toward \ncorrecting the underlying problems in the system that allowed the \nscandal at Walter Reed to become the focus of the American public for \nso many weeks early in the year.\n  I also, with some regret, repeat some words I have said before. The \nreason I regret having to repeat these words is because when I gave \nthis speech 14 months ago, I believed at the time I gave this speech \nthat there would be change after the election. I believed in my heart \nthat the people in Washington would listen like they had not listened \nbefore. But because they have not, I think it is important to repeat \npart of the speech I gave on Harry Truman's birthday, in May of last \nyear, as I talked about the war in Iraq and the reasons I thought it \nwas important to make a change in the Senate.\n\n  I grew up in rural Missouri, in the heart of a Nation that I was \nraised to love and revere. I grew up surrounded by strong men and women \nwho had won a great world war, a war fought against tyranny. My father \nwas a decorated veteran of that war whom I rarely recall ever hearing \nspeak about combat. As I grew older, his silence spoke volumes to me, \nnot only about the modesty of his generation but about what Dwight \nEisenhower later called the ``agony of the battlefield.''\n  I grew up in a family of Missouri Democrats, Roosevelt people, Truman \npeople, but one of the first political speeches my father asked me to \nread was President Eisenhower's farewell address that he gave in 1961. \nReading his speech again later in my life, I found myself deeply moved \nby his words. I respect his eloquence as he spoke of this country's \nfundamental decency and greatness. He called upon America to live up to \nits ideals by always using our greatest strength wisely in the service \nof peace and liberty. He warned us to be aware of arrogance, yet \nmaintain our readiness to sacrifice.\n  I was raised to believe that sacrifice in the defense of our freedom \nis an American ideal and that from our earliest days, Americans have \nwillingly given of themselves in our defense and in the defense of \nothers. I have always known and felt and believed that, through \ngeneration after generation, that willingness has made us safe.\n  So as I grew up in Missouri, our country seemed on the verge of its \ngreatest period, a time of joy and growth and undeniable strength; a \ntime when all would finally share in our Nation's great bounty, when \nour military would be used wisely to benefit ourselves and the world; a \ntime, too, when long-closed doors would finally open and we would live \nup to the ideal of America that lit all the continents with hope and \npromise and made us admired and respected across so much of the globe. \nI did not think then that an American leader would ever squander the \ntrust of our people or the admiration of the world that had been won \nwith such courage and at such a cost. But that is what has happened.\n  In the days after 9/11, this Nation was united, as it was after Pearl \nHarbor. The world bled for us and stood at our side. Our historic \nallies offered all possible aid. New allies in Asia and the Middle East \nemerged, all agreeing to support us in a war on terror.\n  But that has changed. America was misled into a different war, not \nagainst al-Qaida. Instead, we went to war with Iraq. Fearful of weapons \nof mass destruction, we believed they were a threat to the world. We \nhad a plan to destroy the terrorists. We were strong. But there were no \nweapons of mass destruction. We did not have a plan to destroy the \nterrorists. We did not even have a plan to take care of Iraq.\n  Now our strength has been compromised. The President and his \nadministration have led us into a quagmire, alienated our allies, \ndiminished our national morale, cost us billions of dollars, thousands \nof precious lives, and maimed many thousands more. Even our Nation's \ntop military authorities have cited enormous mistakes, while this \nadministration refuses to listen to them.\n  Those were words of a speech I gave 14 months ago, and this \nadministration still refuses to listen. I have listened. I have \nlistened to Missourians. I have listened to General Petraeus. I have \nlistened to the President. I have listened to the experts who have come \nin front of our Committee on Armed Services, including former generals, \ngenerals who have served in Iraq, and maybe most importantly, I have \nlistened to brave soldiers in Iraq.\n  I sat across a breakfast table and looked at a young man and said: \nBut are you worried if we begin pulling out of Iraq that it will be \nchaos?\n  And this young man from Missouri, from a State that I love and he \nloves, and a country that we want to protect\n\n[[Page S9100]]\n\nmore than anything, looked at me and said: Ma'am, we are in chaos. We \nneed to get out of here.\n  I implore the Commander in Chief to listen to America, to listen to \nthe people of this country who figured this out months ago. We are \nstuck in a situation that is squandering the lives of our bravest, and \nit is also squandering the future of our Nation because of the \nfinancial toll it is taking on our budget.\n  It is time that we change course in Iraq. We have an opportunity to \nspeak louder than any American voice can speak. We have an opportunity \nto say to the President of the United States: You must change course. \nIt is time to bring our combat troops home from Iraq.\n  We need to begin that process quickly, and we need to begin to \nrefocus our efforts on fighting terrorism around the world, going after \nal-Qaida, making our military strong, restoring our prominence in the \nworld with allies that matter, understanding that the strength of our \nNation rests with a strong military that we must protect and not wear \nthin, and, finally, realize that America is speaking with a strong \nvoice. This is a democracy. If we cannot listen to those who sent us \nhere, we have failed our duty in this great Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \nthat is being offered by Senator Levin and Senator McCain that will add \nto this legislation the wounded warriors bill that we worked so hard on \nin the Armed Services Committee.\n  I also wish to acknowledge the great leadership of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, Senator Larry Craig and Senator Daniel Akaka.\n  This is an unusual case where two Senate committees worked together \nin a bipartisan way to produce legislation that will help improve the \ncare of our veterans, our wounded warriors, and their families.\n  All of us were outraged by the reports of substandard conditions at \nWalter Reed Hospital. But our investigation of those conditions \nrevealed other problems with the system--disparities in the award of \ndisability ratings, poor treatment of our soldiers and marines after \nthey had left the military hospitals, a lack of a smooth transition \ninto the VA medical system. These are just some of the problems that \nwere uncovered. I believe this legislation contains the reforms that \nare going to make a real difference in ensuring high quality, \nconsistent medical care for those who have given so much.\n  I have become particularly concerned about the treatment of those who \nare suffering from traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury, or \nTBI, has emerged as the signature injury of the Iraq war. Bomb blasts \nare the most common cause of injury and death in Iraq. While \nimprovements in body armor and protective gear have enabled our troops \nto survive attacks that once would have proven deadly, they still do \nnot fully protect against damage from blasts from roadside explosives \nor suicide bombers.\n  As many as 28 percent of the 1.4 million troops who have served in \nIraq and Afghanistan have been exposed to bomb blasts and may have \nsuffered at least some form of traumatic brain injury. Mr. President, \n60 percent of the blast victims treated at Walter Reed have been \ndiagnosed with mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury.\n  I visited one such soldier recently at Walter Reed, a 19-year-old \nsoldier from Maine who is faced with making an agonizing medical \ndecision while he is suffering the effects of a mild case of TBI. I \nthought: How terribly difficult it was for this brave young man to be \nfaced with making a decision about whether to amputate his foot while \nhis judgment is impaired by a traumatic brain injury, an injury that \nwas not initially diagnosed. And that is one of the problems.\n  I have worked very closely with the Senator from New York, Mrs. \nClinton, to come up with a better system for screening soldiers for TBI \nbecause while the evidence of brain injury may be dramatically clear in \nsome cases, in others there may be no outward or visible sign of the \ntrauma. It can take days, weeks, or even months before the symptoms of \nTBI are readily apparent. As a consequence, as with this soldier, a \nmild case of TBI may go misdiagnosed or untreated, particularly if the \nservicemember has sustained more obvious injuries.\n  Soldiers with TBI often have symptoms affecting several areas of \nbrain function. Headaches, sleep disorders, and sensitivity to light \nand noise are common. Attention, memory, language, and problem-solving \nabilities can be affected. Some of the more troubling symptoms can be \nbehavioral: mood changes, depression, anxiety, emotional symptoms. \nMoreover, sometimes the symptoms of TBI overlap with post-traumatic \nstress disorder, making it difficult to distinguish between the two.\n  Sadly, failure to accurately diagnose or treat TBI can result in \nfrustration, inadequate medical treatment, and a series--an endless \nseries--of hardships for our returning veterans and their families.\n\n  So I am very pleased the wounded warriors bill includes an expansion \nof research into TBI and, perhaps most important, provisions authored \nby Senator Clinton and myself that will address problems resulting from \nthe misdiagnosis, or the failure to diagnose at all, cases of TBI. The \nbill will improve the screening process that our troops go through \nbefore deployment to improve TBI diagnoses after deployment.\n  While many wounded servicemembers receive cognitive evaluations upon \ntheir return, if there is no baseline test conducted prior to the \ninjury, it can be very difficult to assess the injury, and it can lead \nto questions about the validity of postdeployment assessment. So our \namendment requires a baseline assessment to be done prior to the \ndeployment.\n  I end by saying that the idea for this predeployment assessment came \nto me from a neurologist in Maine who treated a soldier back from Iraq \nwho had a traumatic brain injury that had been missed. It was severely \ninterfering with his recovery. Fortunately, this neurologist was able \nto make the correct diagnosis and see that this brave soldier who had \nsacrificed so much got the care and treatment he needed.\n  I believe the provisions in the wounded warriors bill, the amendment \nbefore us, will greatly reduce the chances of misdiagnosis in the \nfuture. There are many other provisions in this bill that are going to \nimprove the treatment and care for those who have served their country \nso well and sacrificed so much, but I did want to highlight these \nprovisions of special interest to me.\n  Again, I salute the leaders of the Armed Services Committee and the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee for their dedication and hard work. All of \nus have learned so much, and each and every one of us is committed to \nensuring the highest quality of care for those who have sacrificed so \nmuch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in November, voters in my State of Ohio and \nacross this Nation shouted from the ballot box: The Iraq war must end. \nThey demanded we refocus our efforts on securing our homeland so that \nthe darkest day in our Nation's history, \n9/11, is never repeated. With Democrats in control of Congress this \nsession, we immediately began to work to end the war. We set out to \nimplement the full recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, \nrecommendations that will go a long way toward making our country \nsafer.\n  By working to end the war in Iraq and passing the commission's \nrecommendations, we are executing a strategy to combat terrorism. Make \nno mistake, ending the war in Iraq is a counterterrorism strategy. \nGlobal terrorist attacks have increased sevenfold since we invaded \nIraq--sevenfold. Unfortunately and tragically, our continued engagement \nin Iraq is the best thing that ever happened to jihadist recruitment.\n  Democrats brought to this Chamber not just one piece of legislation \nto redeploy our troops out of Iraq but many. And each time, every time, \neither Republicans defeated the measure in Congress by threatening \nfilibuster or the President vetoed it in the White House--each time, \nevery time.\n  Two days ago, the President was in my State in Cleveland trying to \nbuy more time for this war. The President has yet to define \n``victory.'' He has yet to tell us how many years it will take\n\n[[Page S9101]]\n\nto achieve whatever his definition of ``victory'' is. Will we be in \nIraq for 5 more years, for 10 more years, for 15 more years? Will more \nthousands of U.S. service men and women die, tens of thousands? The \nPresident has yet to hold himself and his administration accountable \nfor fomenting a civil war and breeding more global terrorism.\n  The President is proud of his stubbornness. He should be ashamed.\n  The path he is wed to has simultaneously increased the threat of \nterrorism and reduced our Nation's capacity to protect against it. \nStubbornness is not leadership. Defensiveness is not leadership. \nFinger-pointing is not leadership. Supporting the President's strategy \nin Iraq because you support the President is not leadership. Lives are \nat stake. Our homeland security is at stake. Global stability and \nsecurity are at stake.\n  Yesterday we learned that al-Qaida is at pre-9/11 strength. That is \nfrightening news, and it is cause for outrage because it did not have \nto be that way, and it does not have to be that way.\n  We learned yesterday that the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan \nis fostering the next generation of al-Qaida at an alarming rate. What \nkind of signal exactly does the President and his supporters think we \nsend by failing to secure the region where we know al-Qaida lives and \ntrains and plans, according to military analysts, with relative \nfreedom--the same region that served as the breeding ground for global \nterrorism through al-Qaida before 9/11, the same region we now know \nthat al-Qaida trained in for the deadliest attack on our Nation's soil, \nthe same region where Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind 9/11, is \nbelieved to be hiding, free to plot the next attack on our homeland.\n\n  Over the objection of military advisers, the 9/11 Commission, and the \nvoice of a nation, the President stubbornly insists upon staying the \ncourse with a failed policy in Iraq. Staying the course with the \nPresident's failed Iraq policy hasn't forced our Government to take its \neye off the ball, it has caused us to drop it.\n  Prior to World War II, the French built the Maginot Line, assuming \nthis line would prevent Germany from attacking France. History proved \nthe French wrong. The President's strategy in Iraq is the Maginot Line \nof the 21st century. It imperils our Nation by mistakenly focusing our \nattention in the wrong direction.\n  We have dropped the ball on capturing Osama bin Laden. We have \ndropped the ball on securing Afghanistan. We have dropped the ball on \nimplementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Anyone who thinks \nthose aren't signals al-Qaida is paying close attention to is sorely \nmistaken.\n  Supporting the President's policy doesn't just fail to effectively \ntarget terrorism, it puts a bull's-eye squarely on our Nation. Ending \nthe war in Iraq isn't just about bringing our troops home. It isn't \njust about ensuring veterans get the health care and the benefits they \nhave long been denied. It isn't just about a new direction in our \nforeign policy. It is about returning our focus to where it must be if \nour Nation, our communities, and our families are to remain safe. \nEnding the war in Iraq is about reengaging in full force on the war on \nterror.\n  I applaud my Republican friends who have chosen to stand up to the \nPresident. More and more of them have taken steps of bravery with every \nvote we bring to the floor. But it is not enough. With every lost vote, \nwe add more lives to the list of the men and women lost in Iraq. With \nevery lost vote, we empower al-Qaida.\n  In the Senate, those of us committed to ending this war of choice and \nsecuring our Nation will keep fighting to end the war. I appreciate the \nleadership of Senator Webb, of Senator Hagel, Senator Reid, and Senator \nLevin, all of whom have shown courageous leadership on this crisis of a \ngeneration. Together, we are going to change this policy. The safety of \nevery American depends on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Idaho yield for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Idaho has completed his remarks, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry, be recognized; after Senator Lincoln, if \nthere is a Republican here, they would then come next and that, after \nthat, after Senator Lincoln, Senator Kerry be the next Democrat in \nsequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I would \nnot object, for the purposes of planning, I know we have a vote at 4. \nDoes Senator Lincoln have an estimate as to how much time she will \ntake?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, I would not object, but it \nis my understanding we are trying to go back and forth. Is there a \nRepublican who is lined up at this point? If not, I think the Senator \nfrom Arkansas is going to speak for about 10 minutes and if I could \nproceed after her.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. Senator Craig is here. I know of no additional \nspeakers. I think it is legitimate, since the Senator from \nMassachusetts is on the floor. I would agree that following Senator \nCraig, Senator Lincoln and then Senator Kerry proceed.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me first of all thank the chairman and \nthe ranking member for bringing this legislation to the floor and for \nincluding in it the wounded warrior amendment. Let me also thank the \nsenior Senator from Arizona for his leadership on what has been a \ncritical and important issue for our country and, at best and at worst, \nvery divisive. I have not seen him step back one moment from the \ndefense of our men and women in uniform and the mission they are \nconducting in Iraq, and I thank Senator McCain for that kind of \nleadership. It is tremendously important for our country that we have \nthat quality of leadership, knowledge, and understanding; to be able \nnot only to travel there and understand but to come back to this \ncountry and articulate it.\n  I must also say I was disappointed when the Senator from Missouri \ntalked about lives squandered in Iraq. I am sorry, but every young \nIdahoan who has died in Iraq was not a life squandered. To me, that \nyoung man or woman was a hero in defense of their Nation, in defense of \na nation trying to be free, and an expression from our Nation of that; \nfor preserving for this generation of Americans a sense of freedom and \nindependence in a very difficult world. Lives squandered? I am sorry, I \nchoose other words. The difference between a life squandered and that \nof an American hero is a distinct difference.\n  Today, we are here to talk about wounded warriors. We are also here \nto talk about something my chairman of the VA Committee, Danny Akaka, \nand I have brought forward in an amendment that will be considered and, \nwe hope, handled by the chairman and the ranking member and our whole \nSenate in a unanimous way to deal with traumatic brain injury \nimprovements and transitional benefits that I and Senator Akaka and all \nour colleagues have worked on for those who are in the active service \nand about to become veterans.\n\n  Certainly, the Presiding Officer, now serving on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, has openly participated with us in making sure the \nword ``seamless transition'' is not just something in our vocabulary, \nbut it is a reality of moving men and women from active service into a \nveteran status; and for those who were injured and are eligible for \nbenefits, to make sure that transition is, in fact, seamless.\n  I would like to speak for a moment on an amendment we are offering \nthat deals with that. Senator Akaka a few days ago laid out a number of \nprovisions that are in this amendment and was on the floor earlier to \nspeak to it, and I wish to address some of those on the floor at this \nmoment but not to travel that path again.\n  First, I am proud of the comprehensive nature of the language dealing \nwith those suffering from traumatic brain injury in this amendment. \nEnactment of these provisions will ensure that injured servicemembers, \nveterans, and their families will receive a detailed plan from a VA \ntreatment team\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\noutlining their care and a rehabilitation program. They can be certain \nthe plan will be reviewed and updated often, even at their request.\n  They will benefit from new investments in research into mild, \nmoderate, and serious traumatic brain injury. Most important to me, \nthey will have the comfort of knowing the Secretary can provide TBI \ncare in a private, non-VA facility anytime the Secretary determines \nthat doing so would be optimal to the recovery and rehabilitation of a \npatient.\n  Through time and hearings, we have discovered in the VA Committee \nthat while the Veterans' Administration and their health care delivery \nsystems are, by the nature of what they do, the best in the country, \nwith some of the cutting-edge technology that is available in the \nprivate sector, we are not yet up to speed in the VA public sector. So \ngiving the Secretary this flexibility and option says to our veteran, \nwho may well be suffering from TBI: You are going to get the best that \nis available, private or public, at the time you need it. That is the \nway it ought to be.\n  In other words, whenever it is in the best interest of the patient's \nrecovery, then the VA can purchase private care until that care may be \navailable within the system itself.\n  These are a few of the very important provisions in this amendment \nthat I believe will make the care and treatment of our wounded \nservicemembers and veterans even better.\n  I would also like to point out our actions with this amendment \nreflect a pledge we made a few months ago when the Veterans' Committee \nand the Armed Services Committee held a joint hearing to receive \ntestimony on needed changes to the transition programs of health care \nbenefits. At that time, many of us stated our intention to make a good-\nfaith effort to work on these issues under our respective committees' \njurisdictions and to merge them back together again at the earliest \npossible opportunity. Senator Akaka and Senator Levin certainly were \ngood to their word as we worked to bring those together, and that is \nexactly what is reflected in these amendments that are currently before \nthe Senate and will be when we bring the other amendment forward. So I \nam very proud to tell the Senate that both committees have done their \nwork and lived up to their bargain.\n  I wish to compliment the Senators from Michigan and Arizona, as I did \nearlier, for the work they have done on the Armed Services Committee in \nproducing the wounded warrior bill that is now pending to this \nauthorization bill as amendment No. 2019. That bill, coupled with the \namendment Senator Akaka and I are now offering, will provide a \ncomprehensive approach to improving the benefits and services of those \nwho are severely injured in service and those who need transitional \nassistance.\n  Finally, I also think this amendment is very important because it \ndemonstrates Congress can break down the walls of jurisdiction and \nterritory and do the right thing at the right time for the right \npeople. In this case, it is America's brave young men and women who are \nstanding in harm's way, and as a result of their bravery and their \nheroism may sustain some level of injury.\n  I and other Senators have been very critical of the bureaucratic \nroadblocks we oftentimes see in DOD or the VA. But I must tell you we \nsee a merging now and a breaking down of those barriers and roadblocks \nthat ought to be done when we find those difficulties arising. So I \nbelieve that if we are going to demand these two agencies break down \ntheir walls of territory and jurisdiction, then we can demonstrate the \nsame. These amendments recognize and demonstrate that. I am proud we \nare doing so today.\n  I wish to thank, again, Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain for \ntheir support throughout the process, and I wish to thank Chairman \nAkaka for his leadership. I also wish to compliment the staff of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee--Gary Leeling, Dick Walsh, and Diana \nTabler--for working in a collegial way with our staffs on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee to make all of this effort very possible in the way \nthat it is being presented on the floor.\n  Mr. President, to my colleagues, the chairman and the ranking member, \nI appreciate the opportunity to come speak on these critical issues, \nand once again the cooperation between the VA Committee and their \nstaffs, and the Armed Services Committee and their staffs, I think, is \na model of how we get things done in the appropriate way and in the \ntimely way necessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Craig for all \nthe work he and his committee put in on this bill. I know he and \nSenator Akaka and members of that committee have played a major role. \nTheir amendment reflects additional work, and we are very grateful. I \nknow every veteran in this country and their families are grateful.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain and I, at \nthis time, be allowed to offer six second-degree amendments which have \nbeen cleared--they shouldn't take more than a few minutes--prior to \nSenator Lincoln being recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2131 to Amendment No. 2019\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Durbin and \nMcCain, I call up amendment No. 2131, a second-degree amendment to our \namendment. It requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a \ncomprehensive plan for the provision to members of the Armed Forces \nwith traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress disorder. The \namendment has been cleared, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2131 to amendment No. 2019.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

I thank the \nChair and thank our good friends from Arkansas and Massachusetts for \ntheir understanding and, of course, my good friend from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I have a special thanks to the \nchairman and ranking member for their leadership on such a critical \nissue at such a critical time in our Nation. Their leadership and their \nability to work together have certainly brought us together here on \nthis issue and many others. I am grateful to them for that.\n  I rise today on behalf of the brave men and women of our National \nGuard and Reserve who have sacrificed so greatly for our freedom. They \nare the policemen and the doctors, the schoolteachers and mayors in \ncommunities all across our great land. They are also the beloved sons \nand daughters, fathers and mothers and families in our neighborhoods, \nin mine and yours, all across this Nation. Our Nation has turned to \nthem in unprecedented numbers to help defend our freedoms around the \nworld. With pride and courage, they have answered their Nation's call. \nWe have seen also in their call to duty the great contribution they \ngive in our communities because, as they are deployed, we see in our \ncommunities where perhaps our mayors or our school principals or our \nfire chiefs have to be replaced temporarily as they are gone.\n  Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, nearly 600,000 of \nthese citizen soldiers, including several thousand from my home State \nof Arkansas, have been activated to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan. More \nthan 132,000 have pulled multiple tours of duty. In doing so, they have \nserved and continue to serve with distinction in some of the worst \nconditions imaginable. It is time, now, for us as a nation and as a \nbody here in the Senate to begin providing them with benefits that are \nmore commensurate with their increased sacrifice.\n  One area in particular is the educational benefits provided under the \nMontgomery GI bill. These benefits were signed into law in 1984, a time \nwhen members of the Selected Reserve were seldom mobilized. \nConsequently, standard Montgomery GI benefits reflected that reality. \nBut, unfortunately, it is not the same reality we see today. That is \nwhy I have offered two amendments to the 2008 Defense Authorization \nAct. These two amendments are a part of a bill that I have helped work \nwith my colleague from Arkansas, Congressman Snyder, to put together in \nthe Total Force GI bill that we have introduced on behalf of our Guard \nand Reserve. These two proposals offer two very big steps toward \nmodernizing the Montgomery GI benefit to better reflect the increased \ncommitment our Guard and Reserve are making to protect our Nation.\n  I am extremely proud to be joined by 13 of my colleagues, including \nthe Presiding Officer, from both sides of the aisle and over 40 \nmilitary veterans and higher education groups, working together as the \npartnership for veterans education. So many of us all well know how \ncritically valuable education is to each and every one of us, to our \nfamilies, to the success of our economics and our country, and we want \nto see a part of that a possibility for our veterans.\n  The first amendment, which is amendment No. 2072, would place both \nSelected Reserve Montgomery GI programs under the same umbrella in law \nas the Active-Duty program. Under the current structure, Active-Duty \nbenefits have continued to increase in recent years, while the benefits \nfor our hard-working reservists have remained untouched. As a result, \nthe value of the Montgomery GI benefits has plummeted for members of \nthe Selected Reserve, despite their increased service, from 47 percent \nof Active-Duty benefits in 1985 to now only 29 percent of those \nbenefits today. This amendment would establish one program with one set \nof rules that would cut inconsistent and inequitable structuring of \nbenefits by ensuring that all future benefits are upgraded equitably \nand are easier to administer.\n  An identical provision has been included in the House-passed version \nof the Defense authorization bill. My hope is that my colleagues will \njoin me in including this amendment in our Defense authorization bill \nto truly reflect not only our gratitude but certainly, without a doubt, \nwhat our guardsmen and reservists deserve after the incredible and \ncourageous commitment they have made to this country.\n  The second amendment is amendment No. 2074, and it is identical to an \namendment that was passed unanimously by the Senate last year. This \namendment would allow operational reservists to have portability of \ntheir Reserve Education Assistance Program--it is called their REAP \nbenefit--for up to 10 years upon their separation from service.\n  In establishing REAP, which is their Reserve Education Assistance \nProgram, Congress took steps to enhance educational benefits for \nactivated members of the Selected Reserve, but we failed to address \ntheir lack of readjustment or transition components. As a result, \nActive-Duty servicemembers have up to 10 years after their separation \nof service to utilize their Montgomery GI benefit, while operational \nreservists, whom they are often fighting alongside, without a doubt, \nmust forfeit all of the educational benefits they have earned once they \nseparate from the Selected Reserve.\n  That is incredible. We have guardsmen and reservists who are serving \nalongside Active-Duty military. They are seeing the same dangers, the \nsame\n\n[[Page S9105]]\n\nchallenges, the same pain, the same separation from family, for \nrelatively the same amount of time. Yet when they come home and they \nleave the Guard, they no longer have access to those educational \nopportunities. How unfair. How important it is right now for us, as \nthese returning veterans have an opportunity to begin to transition \nthemselves back into their communities, back into their existing jobs \nor new jobs--the need for education is paramount, and making sure we \nmake it available for them is absolutely essential.\n  To this day, the Montgomery GI benefits continue to be the only \nbenefits that those who have served Selected Reserve activated duty in \nthe war on terror may not access when they eventually separate or \nretire. In addition, members of today's Selected Reserve are so busy \ntraining and deploying that they have little time to actually use their \neducational benefits; therefore, their ability to use their benefits \nwhile serving is curtailed because of repeated deployment and denied \nentirely once they finish their service. We are talking about \neducation. We are talking about empowerment. We are talking about \nsomething they deserve, they have earned, and we should be making sure \nwe make available to them.\n  I would like to give an example. Take, for instance, Jamaal Lampkin, \nwho is a 28-year-old native of Malvern, AR, whose story was recently \nreported in USA Today. Jamaal spent 13 months with the U.S. Army \nReserve in Iraq. After his distinguished tour of duty, which included a \nPurple Heart, he did not have time to utilize the enhanced educational \nbenefits he had earned prior to the conclusion of his service \nobligation. To do so, he had to reenlist and risk the chance of being \nredeployed at some point. How unbelievable, for someone who had given \nof himself and offered himself in service to this great Nation to come \nback and find that after that tour of duty, those benefits were gone.\n  In his records, here in this article, he said:\n\n       I had the proud opportunity to serve my country in Iraq and \n     I just wanted to move on.\n  He, and those like him, certainly deserve as much. We must act on \nbehalf of these brave Americans because they deserve a policy more \nreflective of their sacrifice. Jamal fought and was wounded alongside \nactive-duty servicemembers, but because of an inequity of the law, he \nis denied the same opportunity to utilize those educational benefits he \nhas rightly earned, benefits that serve as a primary means of helping \nour service men and women make that difficult transition back into \ncivilian life after serving in combat.\n  Some have raised concerns this amendment would have an effect on \nretention because it would provide a postservice portability of \nbenefits. I wholeheartedly disagree. There are many valid personal and \nfamily reasons that influence a volunteer's decision to serve. Military \nanalysts have consistently noted that reenlistment bonuses and lump sum \ncash payments have been effective in meeting and exceeding reenlistment \ngoals in the Active and Reserve forces, not the educational benefits \nthat are deferred over time.\n  That is why we have seen an unprecedented increase in the amount \nspent on these bonuses in recent years. At a time when one branch of \nour military is spending over $1 billion in cash bonuses, the least we \ncan do is provide a fraction of those costs on investing in our citizen \nsoldiers. After all, doing so only serves to enhance our Nation's \ncompetitiveness through the development of a more highly educated and \nproductive workforce.\n  Young high school graduates in Arkansas and across this great country \nthinking about furthering their education and whether to join the \nNational Guard or Reserves should know they will earn Montgomery GI \nbenefits by enlisting, and even more if they are called up to duty.\n  When it is time to reenlist, they can keep all earned educational \nbenefits with the opportunity to earn more by staying in or they can \ntake with them in civilian life the benefits they have earned when they \nwere called up to defend our great Nation.\n  As the daughter of a Korean war veteran, I was taught from an early \nage about the sacrifices of our troops and the sacrifices our troops \nhave to make to keep our Nation free. I have been grateful for the \nservice of so many of our brave men and women from the State of \nArkansas and across this Nation. On behalf of them and their families, \nI will continue to fight to ensure they are provided with the benefits, \nthe pay, and the health care they have earned.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord letters of endorsement from the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, the National Reserve Association, the American Legion, the Air \nForce Sergeants of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the \nEnlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Air Force Sergeants\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                   Temple Hills, MD, July 9, 2007.\n     Hon. Blanche Lambert Lincoln,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: On behalf of our 130,000 AFSA \n     members, I want to express our staunch support of the two \n     amendments you are proposing regarding total force \n     educational assistance enhancement. In recent years our \n     military operations tempo requirements have been shared by \n     members of the active duty, guard and reserve forces. Guard \n     and Reserve forces now train and deploy alongside our active \n     forces seven days a week, 365 days a year; therefore, \n     opportunities for their use of educational benefits are \n     diminished. These two amendments afford our total force a \n     better balance of educational opportunities.\n       The first amendment will provide operational reservists \n     with 10-year portability of educational benefits, thus \n     mirroring those of our active duty force. Unlike current \n     restrictive guidelines, this amendment will allow them to use \n     the benefits they have earned after leaving tours of active \n     duty. The second amendment will integrate the reserve MGIB \n     programs into Title 38. This will allow for single source \n     oversight of a more balanced approach to total force \n     educational benefits. Both amendments will serve to enhance \n     educational opportunities for AFSA's growing number of guard \n     and reserve members.\n       Senator Lincoln, thank you for your continued focus on \n     total force educational benefits. We stand ready to support \n     you in this endeavor and others of mutual concern to our \n     members should the need arise. Please feel free to contact \n     me, or my Deputy Director of Military and Government \n     Relations, Ruth Ewalt.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Richard M. Dean,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2007.\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: On behalf of the 2.7 million members \n     of The American Legion, I am writing to strongly endorse the \n     amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act (S. \n     1547) that you propose to introduce to provide an extension \n     of the delimiting date for the use of Montgomery GI Bill \n     benefits for those members of the Reserve components who have \n     been called to active duty and to recodify Title 10 Chapters \n     1606 and 1607 to Title 38.\n       The American Legion supports passage of major enhancements \n     to the current All-Volunteer Force Education Assistance \n     Program, better known as the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB). This \n     amendment would extend the delimiting date of the Reserve \n     Educational Assistance Program (REAP) to ten years after \n     separation from the Selected Reserve and Ready Reserve. \n     Furthermore, this amendment would recodify Title 10 Chapters \n     1606 and 1607 (MGIB-SR and REAP) to Title 38 and thereby \n     place these two programs under the same authority as the \n     active duty MGIB, but leaving kickers under Title 10. We note \n     that the current make-up of the operational military force \n     requires that adjustments be made to support all Armed Forces \n     members.\n       As the distinctions between the Active and Reserve Forces \n     continue to fade, the difference between the Active and \n     Reserve Forces of the MGIB should disappear accordingly. \n     Benefits should remain commensurate with sacrifice and \n     service. Today, approximately 40 percent of troops in Iraq \n     are National Guard personnel or Reservists. Many members of \n     the Reserve components would not be eligible to receive \n     benefits while they are members of the Reserve components due \n     to frequent mobilizations and other factors, yet they have \n     honorably served their country in the Armed Forces. By \n     extending the delimiting date to ten years after completion \n     of service, Reservists will have an additional opportunity to \n     use their MGIB benefits. Additionally, by enacting this \n     legislation, future MGIB rates of the Reserve components \n     would increase lock-step with the active duty rates and \n     eliminate any inconsistencies.\n       The American Legion feels that all veterans should be \n     treated equally regardless of\n\n[[Page S9106]]\n\n     their Reserve National Guard status. An individual who was \n     called to duty and served honorably should not have to remain \n     in the Selected Reserve to use their earned benefits. We \n     support legislation that would allow all Reservists and \n     National Guard members to use their education benefits after \n     separation regardless of disability status and if their \n     enlistment contract expires.\n       In closing, The American Legion strongly endorses your \n     proposed amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act \n     and thanks you for your continuing support of America's \n     veterans and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James E. Koutz,\n     National Economic Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n         Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United \n           States,\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 10, 2007.\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       The Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the \n     United States (EANGUS) is the only military service \n     association that represents the interests of every enlisted \n     soldier and airman in the Army and Air National Guard. With a \n     constituency base of over 414,000 soldiers and airmen, their \n     families, and a large retiree membership, EANGUS engages \n     Capitol Hill on behalf of courageous Guard persons across \n     this nation.\n       On behalf of EANGUS, I'd like to offer our letter of \n     support for your amendment to H.R. 1585, the ''National \n     Defense Authorization Act of 2008.'' Your amendment would \n     move Chapter 1606 and Chapter 1607 benefits from Title 10 to \n     Title 38. The amendment is cost neutral, corrects an \n     actuarial budgeting issue in the original language, but keeps \n     educational kickers with DOD under Title 10.\n       With the active component Montgomery GI Bill under Title 38 \n     and the Selected Reserve program under Title 10, there are \n     inconsistencies and inequities in the benefits for the same \n     level of sacrifice by the service member. This would \n     establish one program with one set of rules under one \n     committee which can do nothing but better the educational \n     future of our service members.\n       Thank you for your continued support of our military and \n     veterans.

Your amendment would \n     allow members of the Selected Reserve who are activated for \n     90 days or more or have already earned their Chapter 1607 \n     Montgomery GI Bill benefits to have portability of their 1607 \n     benefits upon the conclusion of their service, for up to 10 \n     years from their last date of service. This provision would \n     apply only to their 1607 benefits (those benefits earned \n     through activated service) and not their 1606 benefits (their \n     standard Selected Reserve educational benefits).\n       A very small segment of our nation's population has \n     volunteered to defend the remainder of America during this \n     long war. National Guard and Reservists called to active duty \n     to defend the nation in the War on Terrorism are the only \n     group of veterans who have no access to their MGIB benefits \n     after completing their service commitment. It sends a signal \n     that their service and sacrifice are not valued. As our \n     nation's defenders, they deserve the same readjustment \n     benefit as all other service men and women.\n       Thank you for your continued support of our military and \n     veterans.

We applaud \n     this action as an essential first step in MGIB reform and \n     respectfully recommend that you and Senate colleagues co-\n     sponsor identical language as an Amendment to the Senate \n     defense authorization.\n       In addition, MOAA thanks you for your work last year in \n     pressing for a 10-year readjustment benefit for mobilized \n     reservists who earn MGIB entitlement under Chapter 1607 of 10 \n     U.S. Code. We recommend that you again sponsor this critical \n     equity provision.\n       Guard and Reserve servicemembers called to active duty to \n     defend the nation in the War on Terror are the only group of \n     veterans who have no access to their MGIB benefits after \n     completing their service commitment. That's not only unfair, \n     but it sends a signal that their service and sacrifice are \n     not valued.\n       A fraction of our population--about 1%--is defending the \n     rest of the nation during this long, difficult and complex \n     war. We, the protected, must do all we can to ensure our \n     National Guard and Reserve warriors realize their full \n     potential as soldiers and citizens during and after their \n     service.\n       MOAA and our colleagues in The Partnership for Veterans' \n     Educational thank you most sincerely for your leadership in \n     sponsoring amendments that honor the service and sacrifice of \n     our Guard and Reserve warrior-citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Norbert R. Ryan, Jr.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: On behalf of the 2.4 million members \n     of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and our \n     Auxiliaries, I would like to offer our support for your \n     Amendment providing operational reservists with a 10-year \n     portability of their Chapter 1607 (REAP) MGIB benefits.\n       Currently, active duty service members have up to ten years \n     after their separation of service to utilize their MGIB \n     benefits, while operational reservists must forfeit ALL of \n     the educational benefits they earned on active duty once they \n     separate. This benefit continues to be the only one that \n     those who have served Selected Reserve activated duty in the \n     War on Terrorism may not access when they eventually \n     separate. Also, members of today's Selected Reserve are so \n     busy training and deploying that they have little time to \n     actually use their MGIB benefits. Their ability to use the \n     benefit while serving is curtailed because of repealed \n     deployments and denied entirely once they finish their \n     service. This amendment would remedy this problem facing \n     Guard and Reserve members.\n       The original GI Bill helped to create the middle class \n     through easing the transition from active duty to civilian \n     life, improving access to education and creating an \n     unprecedented number of opportunities for millions of \n     Americans. The GI Bill is a central transition tool aiding \n     generations of Americans to reconnect and improve their \n     families' lives.\n       Thank you for introducing this amendment and we look \n     forward to working with you and your staff on this important \n     legislation. Your stalwart support for America's veterans, \n     and all who stand in defense of our nation, is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dennis Cullinan,\n     National Legislative Service.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Naval Reserve Association,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 10, 2007.\n     Senator Blanche Lincoln,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: On behalf of the Naval Reserve \n     Association, and 76,000 current members of the Navy Reserve, \n     I am writing to thank you for your untiring support of our \n     military men and women and in particular for your efforts to \n     establish a ``total force'' GI Bill that matches educational \n     benefits to service and sacrifice.\n       NRA strongly supports your intention to sponsor floor \n     amendments to the Senate version of the national defense \n     authorization act that would forge a Montgomery GI Bill \n     (MGIB) that better supports armed forces recruitment and \n     helps our veterans including returning Guard and Reserve \n     warriors to realize their full potential as citizens and \n     soldiers.\n       The House favorably endorsed a provision in its defense \n     bill that authorizes the transfer of reserve educational \n     benefits programs from the Armed Forces code to Title 38, the \n     laws governing veterans' benefits. We applaud this action as \n     an essential first step in MGIB reform and respectfully \n     recommend that you and Senate colleagues co-sponsor identical \n     language as an Amendment to the Senate defense authorization.\n       In addition, NRA thanks you for your work last year in \n     pressing for a 10-year readjustment benefit for mobilized \n     reservists who\n\n[[Page S9107]]\n\n     earn MGIB entitlement under Chapter 1607 of 10 U.S. Code. We \n     recommend that you again sponsor this critical equity \n     provision.\n       Guard and Reserve servicemembers called to active duty to \n     defend the nation in the War on Terror are the only group of \n     veterans who have no access to their MGIB benefits after \n     completing their service commitment. That's not only unfair, \n     but it sends a signal that their service and sacrifice are \n     not valued. Since 9-11, over 585,000 Guard and Reserve \n     members have been called to serve during this critical time.\n       A fraction of our population--about 1%--is defending the \n     rest of the nation during this long, difficult and complex \n     war. We must do all we can to ensure our National Guard and \n     Reserve warriors realize their full potential as citizens \n     during and after their service as Sailors, Airmen, Marines, \n     Soldiers, and Guardsmen.\n       NRA and our colleagues in The Partnership for Veterans' \n     Education, and the TMC thank you most sincerely for your \n     leadership in sponsoring amendments that honor the service \n     and sacrifice of our Guard and Reserve warrior-citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            C. Williams Coane,\n\n                                              RADM, USN (retired),\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Again, I urge my colleagues--I strongly urge my \ncolleagues--to support these amendments. These are the right things to \ndo on behalf of these unbelievable individuals, these unbelievable \nAmericans, these citizen soldiers who leave their homes and their jobs. \nThey leave their communities and their families to go in the bravest of \nmanners to defend this great country, to defend our freedom. It is the \nleast we can do for those we owe so much and to reassure future \ngenerations that a grateful nation will not forget them when their \nmilitary service is complete. And, more importantly, that we will \npartner with them to reach the ultimate in their potential, the \nultimate in their desire to make themselves the best they can be when \nthey return home.\n  I encourage any colleagues to support both of our amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2019\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise today to speak to the Levin-Reid-\nKerry et. al amendment with respect to Iraq. Today the President made a \npartial report on Iraq. And while it is true there has been some \ntactical military success, no amount of spinning, no amount of focus on \nthe military component can obscure the bottom line reality in Iraq \ntoday.\n  That reality is clear. There has been no meaningful political \nprogress. In the long run, that is the only progress that matters, that \nmakes a difference to our policy because it is the politics that is \nproducing the killing and the chaos in Iraq.\n  Unless and until Iraqis resolve their fundamental political \ndifferences, any security gains will be temporary at best, particularly \ngiven the numbers of troops that are committed to that security, and \ngiven the difficulties that we already understand in terms of \ndeployment schedules.\n  That is a fundamental underlying reality that colleagues in the \nSenate need to focus on. Any tactical gain in the short term, whether \nit is in Anbar Province, Diyala, or elsewhere, is welcome now, but the \nfact is, it is fundamentally temporary absent the political resolution \nthat is critical to ultimately ending the violence.\n  So moving the goalposts, dressing up the failure to meet strict \nbenchmarks as progress, those are, frankly, rationalizations for \nfailure over the long term. They are not plans for success. It is hard \nwhen you measure the absence of political progress over the course of \nthe last months against these temporary tactical gains. It is very \ndifficult to suggest that we are doing anything except sort of \ncommitting American forces, troops, to a kind of holding action for \nhope, hope that there is some turn and some kind of outcome.\n  I think most of us would rather have the U.S. military committed to \nwhat we all consider to be a winning strategy, not a hopeful strategy. \nMeanwhile, in the middle of the President's report, partial report \ntoday, another, frankly, more chilling and important report tells us \nthat while we have been bogged down and distracted in Iraq, al-Qaida, \nwhich the President keeps referring to as the central enemy, al-Qaida \nhas found a safe heaven in Pakistan. Al-Qaida has rebuilt its \norganization.\n  Today, top intelligence officials tell the United States that al-\nQaida is better positioned to strike the West than they have been at \nany time since 9/11. I think any American hearing this, after these \nseveral thousand lives have been sacrificed in Iraq, to hear that al-\nQaida, which is the principal focus of the war on terrorism, is \nstronger today after all of these billions of dollars and lives lost in \nIraq, is a stunning turn of events, shocking turn of events, one that \nought to stop everyone in the Senate to collectively turn our policy to \nwhere it ought to be, which is the focus on al-Qaida and not the focus \nin Iraq.\n  In fact, what has happened in Anbar Province proves that al-Qaida can \nbecome more of a minimalist kind of threat in Iraq itself when measured \nagainst the threat of the political killing that is taking place \nbetween Sunni and Shia, Shia and Sunni.\n  Our principal focus, notwithstanding this report from our own \nintelligence agencies, is where? It is on Iraq. Not principally where \nit ought to be, in Afghanistan and northwest Pakistan. Iraq is not just \na distraction from the fight against terrorists, it is, frankly, al-\nQaida's best fundraising tool. It is al-Qaida's best organizational \nmagnet. You did not have to wait until September in order to understand \nwhat is happening today and what will continue to happen in the absence \nof any measure of political progress.\n  So what we need is not a step away by the Senate, not some sort of \ndelaying tactic to wait for the magic of hope to produce itself in \nSeptember, what we need is the hard work of the Senate to produce a \npolicy for change now. Two days ago I heard some of my colleagues come \nto the floor and question why we are having this debate now when the \nWhite House is going to report on the escalation in September?\n  I heard the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, say: This is not the \ntime to alter the policy we established about 2 months ago.\n  I heard Senator Kyl from Arizona say: We need to wait for the report \nin September before making judgments about what to do next.\n  I heard the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, ask--and these \nare his words: Why do we have to keep taking up the Iraq issue when we \nknow full well in September there will be a major debate on this issue?\n  Well, I have respect for all of the opinions of all colleagues in the \nSenate. I particularly have respect and know how much my friend, my \ncolleague from Arizona, cares about American troops and understands the \nprice of war. But I think that is the wrong question. Those are the \nwrong questions.\n\n  The American people understand why we ought to debate this issue now. \nThe answer is very simple, and it is very compelling. It is because \nAmerican soldiers are dying now, and because the escalation, the \npurpose of the escalation--which was to provide cover for the Iraqi \npoliticians to make compromises--can be judged a failure now.\n  When a policy is not working, you do not wait for an artificial \ntimeline to fix it; you fix it now. The very same voices who have come \nto the floor for years condemning artificial deadlines now want to wait \nfor more Americans to die and more Iraqis to kill each other, until the \nartificial deadline of September, regardless of what the facts tell us \ntoday.\n  I believe they want to do it so President Bush can deliver his \nreport, even though we know today what the heart of that report will \nbe. In fact, the President delivered a partial report today. I think \nmost people understand, because it is obvious, that the facts are \nbeginning to accelerate the need to be able to have a more rapid \nresponse.\n  The report in September, I guarantee my colleagues, will reflect \nexactly what we see today. Violence will be up in some places, and it \nwill be down in others. There will be some tactical successes. Our \nmilitary will deserve the credit for those, and our soldiers will have \nearned those tactical successes the hard way. But no matter what \nsacrifices they have made, and they will have made extraordinary \nsacrifices, the fact remains that absent the political differences, \nwhich already we are hearing they will not make, and they are not \nprepared to engage in, absent that, the civil war will be raging on and \nsquabbling Iraqi politicians and sectarian forces will refuse to \ncompromise. And, most importantly, despite the so-called breathing room \nthat\n\n[[Page S9108]]\n\nthe escalation was supposed to provide, there will be no real political \nprogress.\n  What is happening now is as disturbing as anything I have seen in the \n23 years that I have been in the Senate. I came here in 1985 during the \nheight of the Cold War. President Reagan was at that time leading us in \nan effort to try to confront the continued nuclear confrontation under \nwhich we had lived since the end of World War II. I think all of us \nremember well what a critical moment of confrontation that was.\n  But I came here principally on this issue of war and peace. It was \nalso a time when we were deeply caught up in an illegal war in Central \nAmerica, and the issue of the contras came to dominate the debate in \nWashington for a period of time. I mention that because the issues of \nthe lessons of war and how America goes to war and what we do has been \nsomething that has been at the center of my involvement in public life.\n  I must say, what I see today happening, I regret, reminds me of what \nI thought was a lesson that we had learned in the course of the Vietnam \nwar, and something that we had always resolved to avoid.\n  Many of us remember how then-President Nixon continued our \ninvolvement because he didn't want history to judge him as having lost \na war, notwithstanding that he didn't begin it, he inherited it. So we \ncontinued our intervention in a civil war for pride and to save face, \nnot because we had a winning strategy. Presidents and politicians may \nhave the luxury of worrying about losing face or worrying about their \nlegacy, but the Senate has the responsibility to worry about young \nAmericans and innocent civilians who are losing their lives now for a \npolicy that is failing now.\n  In recent weeks, some have reminded me of a question I asked when I \nreturned from service in Vietnam almost 40 years ago, when I spoke from \nmy heart about what I thought was wrong with that war. Back in 1971, I \nwas privileged to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nand raised the question: How do you ask a man to be the last man to die \nfor a mistake? I never thought I would be reliving that question again. \nI never thought I would have parents of young Americans killed in Iraq \nlook me in the eye and tell me: Senator, my son died in vain.\n  On a personal level, I happen to disagree with that statement. I \nthink each of my colleagues probably does also. I believe that any \nAmerican--I heard the Senator from Idaho talking about this--no matter \nthe bad decisions made in Washington, no matter the faults of the \npolicy, any American who gives up life or limb for love of country has \nnever done so in vain. Because service to country under any \ncircumstances is the highest calling there is. I would like to be able \nto tell those parents that their sons and daughters died for a policy \nthat was equal to their service and equal to their sacrifice. I thought \nwe had learned something from Vietnam. I thought we had learned \nsomething from a war that went on and on, a war that was escalated long \nafter Presidents and policymakers knew that no number of American \ntroops could end the civil war between the Vietnamese. Here we are back \nin the same place today, where no number of American troops in Iraq can \nend a civil war between Iraqis.\n  I think most of our colleagues understand this war in Iraq was a \ndisastrous mistake and the policy being pursued today which doesn't \nresolve the fundamental differences that are propelling Iraqis to kill \nIraqis is itself a mistake. So we are seeing a war prolonged and \nprosecuted not for a winning strategy. No general has come to us, no \nadministration official has come to us in 407, where we meet for our \nsecret briefings, or in any committee and said: This is a winning \nstrategy. What we have is a hope, a wing, and a prayer that somehow \nthese Iraqis are going to come together and make some decisions.\n  But we don't even have the kind of leverage diplomacy that war \ndeserves to maximize the ability of those people to come together. We \nare seeing a war prolonged to prosecute it not for a winning strategy \nbut for a refusal to accept reality.\n  What is that reality? We have heard it from General Casey, General \nAbizaid, General Petraeus, from the Secretary of State, from the \nPresident, and the Vice President--there is no military solution.\n  Each Member has to ask themselves in these next days, what is our \nresponsibility to our soldiers and to our country--not to our political \nparty, not to an ideology. What is our responsibility to the soldiers \nand to country? I think it is pretty straightforward. It is to get the \npolicy right, not in September but now.\n  The only question on this Senate floor now is whether we are going to \nhave the courage to change the policy and get it right. The only \nquestion is whether we are going to stop this administration from \nadding to the thousands of mistakes compounded one upon the other or \nwhether we are going to say: Well, we would like to do it. We kind of \nhave the responsibility to. We hear people in cloakrooms privately \nsaying: I think it is wrong. Boy, it is screwed up. But it doesn't \ntranslate into votes. It is that simple. If you think the policy is \nbroken now, then we ought to fix it now, because lives are at stake, as \nare the interests of our country. Our security is at stake, and the war \non terror is at stake.\n  If anybody needs a reminder of the urgency, I say to them \nrespectfully: You don't have to wait until September to get a reminder. \nAll you have to do is go out to Arlington Cemetery almost any day of \nthe week. You can see the many military funerals but particularly those \nof servicemembers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can see the \nprecise military honor given to each of those soldiers, the flags \ndraping the coffin rippling in the breeze. You can see the honor guard \nfolding that flag meticulously into that sharp triangle of blue and \nwhite stars and then handing it to the loved ones, the wife, the \nmother, husband, father. Then hear those words: On behalf of a grateful \nnation, and watch people crumble.\n  We are losing about 100 soldiers a month. I ask my colleagues: How \nmany more times is that scene going to be repeated between now and \nSeptember? How many more times is that scene going to be repeated \nbefore this institution does what it is supposed to do? How are you \ngoing to feel in September if you finally wind up saying: Well, I think \nthe policy is broken now? And what will happen with respect to the \nparents of those soldiers and their families, those who gave their \nlives so we could wait for a report to tell us the obvious, what we \nknow today?\n  Over a year ago, Senator Feingold and I came to the Senate floor and \nwe asked our colleagues to confront this very reality, to recognize the \nfact that our own generals knew even then there was no American \nmilitary solution to an Iraqi civil war, to acknowledge that the \npolitical progress necessary for the Iraqis to end their civil war \nwould come only if America compelled them to act by imposing meaningful \ndeadlines and leveraging those deadlines with legitimate diplomatic \neffort. That was 1 year ago. We got 13 votes. People said at the time: \nWell, we are not ready. I am not there yet. One thousand Americans have \ndied since then. I ask those folks: What about now? Are you ready now \nor will it take another thousand?\n  It is not the numbers per se, because America has lost many more \npeople in other wars. What it is is the numbers measured against the \nstrategy and the progress. That is where our responsibility lies. By \nany measurement, we have a requirement to respond now. Those 13 votes \nhave now grown to more than 50 votes today, but still the policy is the \nsame.\n  Today Senator Levin and Senator Reed, myself and others are asking \nthe Members of the Senate to look hard at what we are proposing. Don't \nfall prey to the quick hit, easy stereotype, political denunciation of \nwhat is happening here. This is a legitimate policy proposal which, if \nit were joined in in a bipartisan way, would send a critical message to \nIraqis and to folks in the region about the dynamic that has to change \nin order to truly meet all of our strategic interests in that region.\n\n  I have heard some people use descriptions that it is a recipe for \nfailure. Well, measured against what, No. 1? No. 2, it is the only way, \naccording to most of the experts outside the Senate, to actually \nleverage a shift in behavior by the Iraqis who today believe they can \ncontinue to play the American presence off for their own political \npurposes. The fact is, it is only by shifting\n\n[[Page S9109]]\n\nto a different deployment, which is what we do. There is no \nprecipitous, complete withdrawal from Iraq, to the chagrin of some \npeople who think there absolutely should be. There is a responsible, \ncalculated, carefully timed process by which, together with our own \ndeployment schedules, we have laid out an ability for the President to \ncontinue to finish the training, to chase al-Qaida and prosecute the \nwar on terror, and to protect American forces.\n  According to the Iraq Study Group, according to all of the outside \nanalyses that have looked at this issue, the fact is, those are the \nonly legitimate things we ought to be called on to do a year from now. \nNobody is talking about next month or 2 months from now that suddenly \nIraq would be abandoned. The fact is, we have come to a moment where \nthe private hand wringing we see in the elevators and in private \nconversations has run its course. It is time to speak one's conscience \npublicly through votes, not privately.\n  It is legitimate to suggest that to wait until September for a \nreport, where most of the intelligence community and most of the \nobservers we have talked to who have followed this issue closely and \nreport to us appropriately tell us themselves that there is precious \nlittle, if any, advance with respect to the political compromise, makes \nit exceedingly difficult to be able to suggest that. I think we have \nlost 523 Americans who have died since the escalation started. In the \nnext 2 months at the rate of 100 a month, you are looking at over 200 \nthat we know will die for a policy that remains a mistake over those \nnext 2 months.\n  Let me lay out for a moment where we are with respect to this \npolitical solution, because it makes the picture even more stark. It \nhas been over 1 year now since the Maliki government took power. What \nhave we asked of them? What have they agreed to? What have they \naccomplished?\n  Virtually nothing accomplished politically. But it is not the first \ntime the Iraqis have not met any of the requests made of them and items \nagreed to. The fact is that 9 months ago was the deadline for Iraqis to \napprove a new oil law and a provincial election law. Neither one has \nbeen approved. Eight months ago was the deadline for a new de-\nBaathfication law to help bring the Sunnis into the government. Guess \nwhat. It hasn't been approved, and nothing happened as a consequence of \nits not being approved. Seven months ago was the deadline for Iraqis to \napprove legislation to disarm the militias. Absolutely no progress has \nbeen made on this crucial legislation and the militias continue to \nwreak havoc. Six months ago was the deadline for Iraqis to complete a \nconstitutional review process. The constitutional committee hasn't even \ndrafted proposed amendments, and the Iraqis remain far apart on basic \nissues such as federalism and the fate of the divided city of Kirkuk.\n  So we find ourselves today no closer to a political solution than we \nwere when the Maliki government took power over 1 year ago, but over \n1,100 American troops have given their lives since that time. We are no \ncloser than we were in January when the President decided to disregard \nkey elements of the Iraq Study Group and announced the escalation, but \nover 600 additional American troops have died since then. Without real \ndeadlines to pressure the Iraqis to a new reality, we will not be able \nto leverage their behavior. If you can't do it that way, having seen \nthat we can't do it this other way, it may be that you can't do it, in \nwhich case American troops should not be caught in the middle of what \nthey are determined to pursue.\n  One-third of the Cabinet in Iraq, including the major Sunni party, is \ncurrently boycotting the Government. Iraq's Parliament, which cannot \neven muster a quorum more than once every week or two, is reportedly \nstill going to go on vacation for the entire month of August without \nhaving met their schedule.\n  It is pretty hard to discern how you turn to the parent of a troop \nwho is maimed or killed in the course of the month of August while the \nIraqi politicians are vacationing without even meeting one of the \npolitical requirements that has been set out. So I think there is a \nguarantee they are not going to meet the political progress before \nSeptember, absent some change that is not currently on the horizon.\n  The front page of Sunday's Washington Post tells us pretty much all \nwe need to know:\n\n       [T]he Iraqi government is unlikely to meet any of the \n     political and security goals or timelines President Bush set \n     for it in January when he announced a major shift in U.S. \n     policy.\n\n  So time is not on our side, and it has not been on our side for a \nlong time, and no escalation is going to change that.\n  The President keeps telling us, and tells Americans, that we must not \nabandon the fight against al-Qaida in Iraq and leave them with a safe \nhaven. Well, how many times do we have to say it? We all agree with \nthat. That is not even on the table. No one is talking about abandoning \nIraq to al-Qaida. No one is talking about not continuing to prosecute \nthe war against al-Qaida.\n  In fact, in the Levin-Reed-Kerry amendment there is a specific \nstatement with respect to a specific provision with respect to the \nPresident's need to continue to prosecute al-Qaida in Iraq. We all \nagree with that. That is not the issue. What it is is a phony argument, \nand I think our troops and the country deserve better than a phony \nargument. We deserve more than a Presidential straw man in a debate \nwhile real men and women are fighting and putting their lives on the \nline for us.\n  Our bill keeps in place the troops necessary to prosecute al-Qaida. \nOur bill keeps in place the troops necessary to complete the training \nof Iraqis to stand up for themselves. Our bill keeps in place the \ntroops necessary to protect American facilities and forces. And 1 year \nfrom now that is all our mission ought to be.\n  We have troops in many other parts of the region--Kuwait, Bahrain, in \nthe Gulf, and many other places--and we have the ability to do what we \nneed to do to represent our interests with respect to Iran and with \nrespect to the region. But we must redefine our mission and focus on \nour vital national interests, and chief among those is fighting al-\nQaida smartly.\n  I believe it is fundamentally wrong to sacrifice over 100 American \ntroops per month as we stretch our military past the breaking point for \na policy that we know does not address the fundamental issues and \nresolve those issues. The troops deserve to know they are being asked \nto sacrifice for real progress. It is wrong to keep spending over $10 \nbillion each month--$456 billion in total--for this war of choice. We \ncannot continue telling Americans that refereeing an Iraqi civil war is \nworth more in our blood and treasure than it would have been to provide \nHead Start for a year to 60 million of our children or to provide \nnearly 4 years of health care to every child in America or to provide a \ntenfold increase in foreign aid to express the real face and values of \nAmerica all over the world.\n  In fact, all of the money that has been spent in Iraq could have \nfunded a Middle East development plan nearly four times as large as the \nMarshall Plan, a plan that would have helped reduce radicalism rather \nthan enflame it.\n  We also cannot continue to squander our moral authority and offer al-\nQaida a greater recruiting tool than they could ever have hoped to \ncreate for themselves.\n  So my hope is we would work to find a genuine bipartisan majority in \nthe Senate, a majority of conscience, a pragmatic and patriotic \nmajority committed to work across party lines to right a failed policy \nin Iraq and leave in place a sustainable strategy.\n  Now, let me say a word about that to my colleagues.\n  We keep hearing the words ``precipitous'' and ``failure.'' None of us \nwant failure. We want success. What we are hearing today is--we may \nhave differing views about how you get it; it is not often talked \nabout, but it is clear, and I think it should be talked about--that if \nwe are unsuccessful in seeking the kind of political compromise \nnecessary, there will be a lot of killing that will continue, and there \nwill be people who have put themselves on the line to fight for their \nown future and for democracy whom we will have obligations to. We need \nto live up to them.\n  That is another lesson of Vietnam.\n  We need desperately to work together in the best traditions of the \nSenate and the country to find what I\n\n[[Page S9110]]\n\nthink is real common ground--that we have interests in the region, \ninterests in Iraq, interests with respect to the Middle East peace \nprocess, that we will have long-term interests and obligations no \nmatter who is President of the United States or how we approach this \nand that we need to shift course in order to get to that place.\n  Now, some have insisted on seeing this entire issue exclusively \nthrough the prism of victory or defeat over an enemy in battle. But \nthat simply is not the reality of what we see in Iraq today in a civil \nwar. Iraq is a chaotic society, a failed state. The real question is: \nHow do you work together to craft a strategy that is sustainable \nmilitarily, politically, financially, and diplomatically? There are \nareas of broad bipartisan agreement for those who are willing to do \nthat work of building consensus.\n  First of all, I think there is agreement there will be some residual \npresence among at least the majority of the people on our side of the \naisle. In addition, all of us are concerned that our redeployment from \nIraq must not happen in a manner that draws us back into a greater \nconflict at a later date. We ought to be working together to lay the \ngroundwork not just for the next few months but for the next years down \nthe road throughout the region.\n  There is broad agreement that we must refocus our mission on what \nought to be our core objective: fighting terrorists. Indeed, in the \nalternative, we are creating more terrorists daily as a result of our \npolicy than if we were to shift it.\n  So refocusing the mission means American troops should be hunting and \nkilling al-Qaida and not being killed on patrol through the streets of \nBaghdad in the middle of a civil strife where they become a target of \nopportunity for any person who wants to create a headline.\n  It means training Iraqis to patrol Iraqi streets and refocusing our \nmission on preventing this war from spreading into a regional conflict.\n  And finally--and this is perhaps most important of all because you \ncannot get to any of the other things if you do not do this; and we \nhave not done it--we need to embark on a major diplomatic outreach to \nrestore America's influence and credibility in the Middle East. I will \noffer an amendment asking the Senate to go on record supporting a \nstanding conference for the region, including the Permanent Five of the \nUnited Nations and all the regional partners and neighbors and parties, \nin order to reclaim the diplomatic initiative in Iraq and throughout \nthe region.\n  This debate also ought to be part of a larger framework. In Lebanon, \nthe Siniora Government is hanging on by a thread as it confronts Sunni \nextremists sympathetic to al-Qaida in the north and Shia extremists led \nby an empowered Hezbollah in the south. Iran and Syria have stepped \ninto the vacuum, leading reconstruction efforts after the last war and \ncreating a greater connection to the people in the street as a result. \nNow they are rearming Hezbollah for the next war. The Palestinians have \nfought a brief civil war that left an emboldened Hamas in control of \nGaza, and again Iran and Syria stand poised to take advantage of that.\n  Never has there been a more important moment to try to move together \ncollectively, diplomatically in that effort. None of these events, \nfrankly, should have taken us by surprise because King Abdullah of \nJordan loudly warned of three civil wars last year. Yet time and again \nwe seem to be taken by surprise when events on the ground spin out of \ncontrol, and then we are left scrambling to patch together an ad hoc \nresponse from half a world away. That simply cannot continue. It is not \nin our interest. It certainly is not in the interest of the region.\n  So we need a reliable multilateral regional forum for preventing \nthese situations from becoming crises--and for responding when they do. \nThat is why we have to lead the effort to convene Iraq's leaders and \nkey regional players in the effort to do that.\n  In the end, we need to reach for the best traditions of the Senate \nand look back to the bipartisan accomplishments of men such as \nRepublican Senator Arthur Vandenberg, who chaired the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and worked closely with Democratic President Harry \nTruman, and together they helped to create--were the principal leaders \nin creating--a new world order and a winning strategy in the Cold War. \nThey cooperated on a series of institutions and treaties--NATO, the \nIMF, the U.N. Charter, the Marshall Plan--and all of those outlived \nboth of them.\n  When Arthur Vandenberg passed away in 1951, the Chaplain at his \nfuneral said:\n\n       We thank Thee that in the gathering storm of aggression \n     which now rages, Thy servant Arthur H. Vandenberg, in a time \n     that called for greatness, grew into greatness.\n\n  This is a long time since the time of Arthur Vandenberg and Harry \nTruman, but for the Senate to live up to its own obligations and \npossibilities, I believe we ought to go back to the politics that stops \nat the water's edge when it comes to foreign policy. I think we ought \nto grab that opportunity here and now to change our policy in Iraq. \nWhy? Not for partisan advantage but to strengthen our country in the \npursuit of our interests in the region and to truly support our troops \nand provide the kind of direction that will strengthen America and \nstrengthen us in the war on terror.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I support this amendment for the \ndignified treatment of wounded warriors. It creates a comprehensive \npolicy for the care and management of wounded military servicemembers \nand addresses the health care needs of servicemembers and their \nfamilies. We urgently need this provision for a seamless transition \nfrom military to civilian life.\n  The policy and standards for the DOD and the Veterans' Administration \nin this provision will streamline medical and physical disability \nevaluation processes between the two agencies, allowing for more \nimmediate attention to the care of our wounded instead of focusing on \npaperwork for the board. This is an exhausting process.\n  The care of our wounded servicemembers' families is addressed by \nreimbursing them for related expenses such as travel to medical \nappointments, or providing medical care to those family members who are \nproviding support to severely injured servicemembers.\n  This is needed legislation to continue and enhance treatment and \ndiagnosis for traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress \ndisorder, by developing Centers of Excellence, establishing \nrequirements for research, and developing a standard process for pre \nand post deployment screenings. The amendment will assure a fully \ncoordinated system and it improves the medical tracking process and \nestablishes protocols for quality assurance for deployed \nservicemembers.\n  This legislation also directs a jointly integrated policy, created \nand administered by the Department of Defense and the Veterans' \nAdministration, to better manage and transition servicemembers exiting \nactive service to civilian life.\n  It requires these two Departments to develop a joint electronic \nmedical record by 2010.\n  It establishes a joint DOD-VA program office that is responsible for \nthe development, testing, and implementation of the joint health \nrecord.\n  This will expedite the transition of servicemembers to the VA and \nallow for immediate and uninterrupted treatment by VA clinics and \nhospitals.\n  The policies set forth in this amendment will enhance the care for \nthe severely ill or injured by ensuring those former servicemembers who \nwere injured between 2001 and 2012 will receive medical and dental care \nup to 5 years after separation from the military.\n  These initiatives are all very much in need to better provide the \nsupport and care our dedicated servicemembers deserve, especially after \nputting their lives on the line.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the \nDignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act. This legislation will \nbring long needed reforms to the transition process between the \nDepartment of Defense and the VA.\n  The controversy at Walter Reed again brought to light the \nshortcomings in the process our returning veterans must deal with in \ntheir difficult transition from soldier to civilian. Just as the living \nconditions that came to light are unacceptable, so too are the \ncountless stories detailing the maze of forms, hearings, and medical \nevaluations that prevent so many of our veterans from getting the \nhealth care and benefits they need and a grateful nation wishes to \nprovide them.\n\n[[Page S9111]]\n\n  Too often, it seems that rather than thanking the soldier for their \nsacrifice, this system sets up yet another battle of bureaucracy. Too \noften, it seems that the system is stacked against the very soldiers it \nis designed to help. Too often, veterans must seek out their own \ntreatment options and benefits or risk missing deadlines and losing \nbenefits. It doesn't have to be this way. We have an obligation not \nonly to fulfill the promises we make to America's fighting men and \nwomen, but to do so in a manner that ensures the benefits we owe them \nare made readily available.\n  That this bill will push DOD and VA to prepare a comprehensive and \ncoordinated strategy to help the soldier in their transition to \ncivilian is a critical correction to a long-flawed process. Currently, \nsoldiers can be discharged with little more than directions to the \nnearest VA and a stack of paperwork a team of lawyers would struggle to \ncomplete. The chasm that currently exists between DOD and VA has \nswallowed too many bright and talented individuals trying to put their \nlife back together after sacrificing so much for this great Nation.\n  This amendment requires a comprehensive policy on the transition of \nour wounded soldiers back to civilian life. It will push the reform of \nsuch problem areas such as the medical hold status, a situation in \nwhich soldiers can sit for months on end with their life on hold while \nDOD decides what to do with them; the medical evaluation process where \nsoldiers' disability ratings are chronically underrated; and improved \nsharing of records between DOD and VA, amazingly not a common practice \neven in this day and age.\n  I am particularly proud to support this bill because of the priority \nit places on treatment of traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic \nstress disorder. Medical research still has a long way to go before we \ncan wholly treat TBI's and PTSD, but this bill goes a long way towards \ncreating an extensive strategy for diagnosing and rehabilitating \nservicemembers afflicted with these conditions.\n  We must lift the stigma and educate soldiers that these conditions \nare as real as a bullet wound, and can be just as deadly. This bill \ndoes just that. The emphasis on pre-and post-deployment assessments \nwill revolutionize the military's process of diagnosis and treatment.\n  Due to the unique nature of these injuries and the delay in symptoms \nthat so often occurs, many veterans have gone without treatment and \nsuffered a lifetime of pain and anguish because we have not had these \nsafeguards in place. Thankfully, with this bill the Congress is saying, \n``no longer.'' No longer will we stand idly by while veterans are \ndischarged from DOD and fade into the shadows of society. No longer \nwill we turn a blind eye to cries for help from America's bravest. No \nlonger will we ignore the needs of veterans who have sacrificed so much \nfor their country.\n  I am proud to support this proposal extending health care to \nmedically retired servicemembers for 3 additional years. Sometimes we \nforget that when these veterans leave the military, they leave behind \ntheir career, their pay and their way of life. By allowing them steady \naccess to health care, we give them some sense of normalcy as they \nbegin a new chapter in their lives.\n  I do believe there is much work left to be done, and as a Congress we \nmust remain vigilant to ensure that the spirit as well as the letter of \nthis legislation becomes law and the reforms are carried out to their \nfullest. One way of remaining vigilant in the pursuit of a smooth \ntransition from solider to veteran is to provide resources to outside \nwatchdogs to help ensure transparency and advocacy in the process. That \nis why I have introduced the Veterans Navigator Act, which will provide \n$25 million in Federal grants over the next 5 fiscal years to create a \npilot program to fund ``Navigators'' to help veterans enter the system \nand will build on existing programs run by veterans service \norganizations, VSOs, and other experienced organizations. While the \ndignified treatment of wounded warriors amendment will bring about many \nlong-overdue reforms to the transition process, veteran navigators \ncould be particularly critical as independent nongovernmental sources \nof information and advice for the veteran during their transition. In \nfact, navigators could play a vital role in the successful \nimplementation of the changes made in the Dignified Treatment of \nWounded Warriors Act, as they can be watchdog and counsel, \nwhistleblower and advocate. In short, because the veteran navigators \nwill not be part of the government system, they will be better able to \nadvocate for veterans.\n  The very least that we can do is ensure that all of these brave men \nand women are able to access the medical benefits to which they are \nentitled and the care which they require, particularly in this, their \ntime of greatest need. At some point in each of our lives, we might \nneed a guiding hand to help us find our way. These brave men and women \nwent out across the world for us, with this bill I believe we are \nstepping out for them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, providing for our men and women in \nuniform, and their families, is our highest priority on the Armed \nServices Committee, and this bill will provide a comprehensive approach \nto caring for those, who through their courage, have sacrificed greatly \nfor our country. Our Nation owes these brave men and women nothing less \nthan the finest possible care.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, if it is \nagreeable with Senator Levin, that Senator Stabenow be allowed 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, that, of course, would be fine with me, \nbut we have a vote scheduled at 4 o'clock. If that is going to delay \nthat vote, we better clear that with folks who may be relying upon a 4 \no'clock vote.\n  Madam President, how long will the Senator from Michigan wish to \nspeak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Ideally, 10 minutes, 8 minutes--somewhere in that \nrange--7, 8 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, then I join in that unanimous consent \nrequest that the Senator from Michigan be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So 3 minutes after 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Now the vote will be delayed until about 5 after 4 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first, I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts for his eloquence and passion and knowledge \nand leadership on all of these critical issues related to Iraq and what \nwe need to be doing to keep our country safe.\n  I thank also Senator Carl Levin, our senior Senator from Michigan, \nfor all his wonderful leadership as he has moved this bill and so many \nother bills through the Congress that deal with supporting our troops, \nbeing a strong military, and now making sure we are there for our \ntroops when they come home.\n  I thank also Senator John McCain for his graciousness today, as well \nas for his work with Senator Levin. I thank Senator Danny Akaka, \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and Larry Craig, the \nranking member, for their bipartisan effort.\n  This has truly been an excellent example of what we can do when we \nwork together on something such as the wounded warrior amendment, which \nI am proud to be a cosponsor of. But the bipartisan effort, the effort \nbetween two committees of the Senate, working together, has been \nwonderful, and we now have an amendment in front of us, the Levin-\nMcCain and others amendment, that is critically important to pass.\n  I stand here today as a daughter of a World War II Navy vet and the \nwife of an Air Force vet of 14 years, and I am very proud of what we \nare doing and what our new majority is doing to advocate for our troops \nand our veterans.\n  For too many soldiers and marines, the flight out of Iraq or \nAfghanistan is the first step in a long journey back to the lives they \nleft at home.\n  Those wounded in combat face a second tour of duty--a tour of duty \nmarked by long hours of rehabilitation, often painful medical \nprocedures, and a physical or psychological adjustment to a life lived \nwith the scars of war.\n  When the men and women of our Armed Forces put on the uniform, they\n\n[[Page S9112]]\n\nare making a promise to defend America. In return, we promise them that \ntheir Nation will be there for them when they come home.\n  Our Armed Forces truly are the finest patriots our Nation has to \noffer--truly. As members of an all-volunteer military, charged with \ndefending the greatest democracy on Earth, our soldiers and sailors and \nairmen and marines have proven their bravery, courage, and honor time \nand again. They don't need more empty promises. What they need and what \nwe owe them is a system that works for them when they are wounded, \neither physically or mentally, in the service of our country.\n\n  I am very proud of the fact that our new majority has made both \nsupporting our troops and our veterans one of our very top priorities. \nThe budget resolution we passed earlier this year places fully funding \nveterans' health care, working with all of our veterans service \norganizations, as one of our very top budget priorities. Now we have in \nfront of us another important way to support our troops coming home who \nare wounded.\n  We are a nation at war. We know that. We are currently ill-equipped \nto deal with the human consequences of that war.\n  The administration's failed planning for this war did not end at the \nborders of Iraq. It stretched into Walter Reed Hospital and into every \nveterans' health care facility, into every community that has sent an \nable-bodied son or daughter off to fight, only to be faced with the \nrealities of an injured veteran returning home. Repeated redeployments \nhave only compounded the problem, as we talked about yesterday, as we \ndebated the important Webb amendment which, I might add, was passed and \nsupported by 56 Members, although we could not break the filibuster of \nthe Republican caucus. Mental health injuries have increased \ndramatically as troops have been forced to face their second, third, \nand fourth combat redeployments. The lack of time between redeployments \nhas increased the physical danger to our troops by sending them back on \nthe front lines, overtired, underequipped, and without the increased \ntraining they need.\n  Our heavy reliance on our National Guard has resulted in wounded \nveterans returning to cities and towns all across our country, often to \ncommunities that are far away from veterans' health care facilities or \nthe traditional infrastructure of the military health care system. Our \ntroops deserve better in Iraq, and they deserve better when they come \nhome.\n  Earlier this year a bright light was turned on the deplorable \nconditions faced by some of our returning wounded veterans at Walter \nReed. The true tragedy of these events is that they are merely a \nsymptom of larger problems with a system that too often has let our \nsoldiers and veterans down. I am very proud of the leadership coming \nfrom our caucus, our leader, Senator Reid, and our caucus leadership, \nin focusing the light of day and taking action that has brought us \ntoday to this very important amendment. There is no room for \nbureaucratic or political squabbling when it comes to the treatment of \nour soldiers and our veterans. The system should serve one mandate and \none mandate only: providing the highest quality service available to \nall of them, while causing them the least amount of personal hassle and \nfrustration.\n  Senator Levin's wounded warrior amendment is a much needed step, and \nit is a needed systemwide approach that has been put together on a \nbipartisan basis. It addresses many problems that plague this far too \noften burdened and difficult process while enhancing health care for \nwounded service men and women, including treatment of traumatic brain \ninjury and post-traumatic stress disorder, which has been viewed now as \nthe signature injury of this war.\n  The number of casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan is growing every \nday. These brave men and women don't have time to wait. They need their \ncountry to step up right now, and that is what we have the opportunity \nto do together with this amendment.\n  We have many disagreements in this body. The various pieces of \nlegislation we face on a daily basis require robust debate and \noftentimes we find ourselves on different sides of the issue of the \nday. I can't imagine, though, how any one of us would oppose this \namendment. The facts are simple. The system is broken and in need of \nrepair. The ones paying the price are our soldiers, our veterans, and \ntheir families. We need to make changes and we need to make them now.\n  This was a war of choice in Iraq, not of necessity. But dealing with \nthe consequences of this war is unquestionably a necessity. Our troops \nhave done their job and now we need to do ours. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the wounded warrior amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2024\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 2024 offered \nby the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, this amendment, which has been \nmodified in agreement with my colleagues on the Democratic side of the \naisle to reach an amendment I think we can all support, would state it \nis the policy of the United States that we should have a system that \nwill protect the United States and its allies against Iranian ballistic \nmissiles. The findings are that Congress finds that Iran maintains a \nnuclear program in continued defiance of the international community, \nwhile developing ballistic missiles of increasing sophistication and \nrange that pose a threat to the forward-deployed forces of the United \nStates and to its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in Europe, \nand which eventually pose a threat to the United States homeland.\n  That is the problem we are dealing with. So we would state with \nclarity, so there is not any doubt about it--and I think our bill we \npassed in committee does that, but some have misinterpreted it, in my \nopinion--that it would state that it is our policy to develop and \ndeploy as soon as technologically possible, in conjunction with allies \nand other nations wherever possible, an effective defense against the \nthreat of Iran as described in the previous paragraph.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And to develop an appropriate response.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, the amendment as modified is \nwithin the provisions of the funding in the underlying bill, because \nthe bill would authorize an additional $315 million to increase or \naccelerate several near-term missile defense programs that are \nspecifically designed to protect our forward-deployed forces, our \nallies, and our friends, for example, the Patriot PAC-3, the Aegis BMD \nprogram, and the THAAD system. So it is entirely consistent.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from South Dakota \n(Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  The result was announced--yeas 90, nays 5, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 245 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--90\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n\n[[Page S9113]]\n\n\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--5\n\n     Feinstein\n     Leahy\n     Sanders\n     Tester\n     Webb\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Biden\n     Dodd\n     Johnson\n     Obama\n     Vitter\n  The amendment (No. 2024), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the next order of business we agreed upon \nwill be to dispose of the wounded warrior legislation. There are three \npending amendments which have now all been cleared. They need to be \nprepared and accepted. It may take us 20 minutes or so. Then there will \nbe a vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, if I can tell my friend, I think it will \nonly take us about 2 minutes since we are in agreement, and then we can \nmove to wounded warriors, for the benefit of our colleagues.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Five minutes before a vote can begin, that will be fine. \nThe sooner the better. We are all happy with that schedule. Is Senator \nDorgan on the floor?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield. I will be happy to yield in a \nminute to the Senator from Vermont. The next business, if it is \nagreeable with the ranking member, will be to dispose of the Dorgan \namendment, at which point we are going to Levin-Reed. Is my \nunderstanding correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the Dorgan amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Dorgan amendment is an al-Qaida amendment. We are \ntrying to work out a UC that involves a series of amendments around \nLevin-Reed, including the Cornyn amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is our intention to set it up so there is at least a \nside by side offered by Senator Cornyn, and there may be additional \nside by sides, if necessary. Is that our basic agreement?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Assuming cloture is invoked and we get to a vote on Levin-\nReed, at that point there will be a side by side in this UC with the \nCornyn amendment, but we have to leave open the possibility, then, of a \nside by side for an amendment with Cornyn.\n  Now I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator will just give me \n4 minutes. Vermont has lost per capita more men and women in Iraq and \nAfghanistan than any other State. One is being interred tomorrow. I \nwonder if I may have 4 minutes to speak about that person in morning \nbusiness because the family will be here tomorrow for interment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, the \ndistinguished bill managers and I have been talking about a procedure \nwhereby I was under the understanding that I would be allowed to lay \ndown my amendment. It would be then set aside, and then later there \nwould be an attempt to structure a side by side with the Reed-Levin \namendment and the Cornyn amendment perhaps for next week, but it will \nhave to be done by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, the staff is preparing a UC \nwhich covers the entire subject. It is too complex for us to say \nsomething and get into more trouble. Let's just get the UC.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I may respond, it is the intention to make sure there \nwould be a side by side if the procedure, if it comes up----\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we get to a vote on Levin-Reed, it is our intention, \nand it will be implemented in a UC, that Senator Cornyn's amendment, \nwhich he wanted to be voted on side by side, would be voted on side by \nside, but we then need to have the opportunity to have a side by side \nwith the Cornyn amendment. I am just cautioning everybody, because we \nhave already had enough confusion on this subject, that we should wait \nfor the staff to prepare that UC so everybody is satisfied.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. My question, Madam President, is, my understanding is the \nCornyn amendment would be laid down this evening perhaps, then set \naside while we work on the UC that the distinguished chairman referred \nto and perhaps set it up for a vote next week. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. My understanding is the current procedure, where we are, \nwe alternate amendments. So the Senator from Arizona, the ranking \nmember, can designate anybody he wishes on his side to offer an \namendment. But in terms of laying aside what comes up, when it is voted \non, and side by sides, that part has to be resolved by a UC.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If I may ask one more question, Madam President, is it \nthe Senator's intention that following the disposition of the wounded \nwarriors amendment that it would be in order for the distinguished \nranking member on our side to lay down the Cornyn amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are going to try to dispose of the Dorgan amendment \nimmediately afterward. But the next time the Senator from Arizona can \ndesignate a Member on his side, it is his intention to have the Senator \nfrom Texas recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, before the Senator from Vermont speaks, \nI assure the Senator from Texas that there is no intention of depriving \nhim of a side by side; that the intention is to frame the UC such that \nthere is a side by side, but there is a little parliamentary side of \nit. I hate to take the time of all of our colleagues, but that is the \nintent and the agreement between the two of us to get it done. I will \nhave the next amendment after the Dorgan amendment, and I will \nrecognize him at that time. Then we will work out the modalities.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, in that regard, while the two managers \nare on the Senate floor, on Tuesday, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, and I came to the floor to offer our \namendment--at least to get it filed--on habeas corpus, which has been \njoined by many Senators on both sides of the aisle. That was objected \nto.\n  I am just wondering: We have been trying every day since. Can the \nmanagers give me some idea of when Senator Specter and I may begin the \ndebate on that amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, may I say this is one time I am glad I \nam not in the majority.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am trying to figure out how to respond to Senator \nMcCain. I am not sure I have a good response.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The amendment is filed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are going to move to the Iraq legislation immediately \nafter the disposition of the Dorgan amendment, subject to the Cornyn \namendment, which will be next which is being figured out in a UC. We \nare then going to go to the Iraq legislation, the Levin-Reed \nlegislation, so I cannot tell the Senator from Vermont how long the \ndebate on that legislation is going to last. There are many people who \nwish to be recognized thereafter, and I cannot at this time tell him \nwhich one from our side will be the one to be selected. I don't want to \nmake that choice now.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand the response of the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Michigan, but I wonder if he might \ngive some indication to this Senator whether he believes that at some \ntime an effort can be made to bring forward--the amendment has been \nfiled. I was erroneous. It has been filed. But assuming it is germane, \nsome time the amendment, Specter-Leahy, et al, amendment will be \nbrought forth.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is certainly my intention that Senators have that \nopportunity. The Senator from California has asked, a number of other \nSenators have asked, and it is my hope and intent that Senators will \nhave an opportunity to offer amendments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would renew my unanimous consent \nrequest. Back to where I started.\n\n[[Page S9114]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Vermont Fallen\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this week, the Senate is engaged again in \nan intense debate about one of the most pivotal issues facing our \nNation and its families right now--the ongoing war in Iraq. There is \ngreat division in the country and in the Congress on many of these \nissues, but I believe there is one area where we remain united, and \nthat is in support and appreciation of our troops and their families \nand friends here at home.\n  The Nation shares the sorrow and grief over the loss of so many fine \nAmericans in war. Our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have \ncome at the cost of precious American lives. No one knows that pain \nmore than those loved ones left behind--the spouses, the parents, the \nsons, and the daughters who are left to pick up the pieces. A gaping \nhole of unimaginable proportions opens with each and every one of these \nfamily losses.\n  Families in Vermont have gone through more than their share of the \npain. Vermont has suffered the highest per capita casualty rate of any \nState in the Nation during these ongoing operations. We are a State of \njust over 600,000 people, and many of our State's sons and daughters \nare part of the Vermont National Guard, the Reserves, and the Active-\nDuty Forces. Twenty-six servicemembers with Vermont ties have given \ntheir lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. Behind the names of those \nVermonters are dozens of families and hundreds of friends facing that \nall-too-real and perhaps unknowable loss. When I go to these funerals \nand I look around in the church or the synagogue where the funeral is \nbeing held, I see so many people I have known from childhood days and \nrealize they, too, are members of the family of those who have died.\n  Earlier this year, dedicated students at Vermont's Norwich University \nproduced a documentary about these families coping with the loss of \ntheir loved ones. Titled ``Vermont Fallen,'' the film documents how \nmany of these family members have reacted, how they have tried to cope. \nIn the darkest and saddest of times, this project has helped a new \nVermont family to emerge, brought together by community screenings of \nthe film. They have been able since then to turn to each other for \ncomfort.\n  The Norwich students' project has offered a glimpse into the searing \nand highly personal grief and mourning that has touched thousands of \nAmerican families and scores of American communities across Vermont and \nacross the country. They have produced a tribute that speaks directly \nto each human heart.\n  Tomorrow, at Arlington National Cemetery, one of our fallen, 1LT Mark \nDooley, will be interred. Lieutenant Dooley selflessly died in the line \nof duty in Iraq in 2005. He was a member of the police department in \nWilmington, VT, a lovely town that is nestled right in southern \nVermont, almost on a midline with the Green Mountains. My wife Marcelle \nand I went to the police station after his death just to sign the \ncondolences and to announce our condolences. Lieutenant Dooley's \nparents will also be there, as well as other members of his family, and \nin a sense, every Vermonter will be there.\n  Joining the Dooleys, lending their unique understanding of the \nspecial bond that comes from it, will be the families of the ``Vermont \nFallen.'' I hope the Dooleys and what has now become their extended \nfamily will find comfort in one another. They deserve to be in the \nthoughts, the hearts, and prayers of all Vermonters and every American \nas they gather at Arlington. They are in the thoughts and prayers of \nthe Members of the Senate.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a list of the ``Vermont Fallen.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Vermont Casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan\n\n       Twenty-four American servicemen with ties to Vermont have \n     died in Iraq since the war began.

The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I know the chairman is on his way here, \nand while he is on his way, I would just like to urge all Senators who \nhave amendments to this bill to please get them in. We have \napproximately 100 pending. Obviously, most of those can be dispensed \nwith without debate and votes, but we really need to stop submitting \namendments because there has to be a time where we just have had enough \namendments approved. So I would urge my colleagues to get their \namendments in tonight--before tomorrow, if they can, but tomorrow at \nthe latest--so that next week we can begin the process of approving or \ndeciding to debate and to vote on various amendments.\n\n[[Page S9115]]\n\n  Madam President, I note the presence of the distinguished chairman, \nso I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I join my good friend from Arizona first \nof all in urging people to get their amendments in to us. I don't know \nthe time that was suggested by the Senator, but I want to repeat it--\nwhat was it? Well, the earlier the better because we have a lot on our \nplate.\n  Madam President, these are the three second-degree amendments--we \nreferred to them before--and as soon as these amendments are disposed \nof, we are then going to move to vote on the wounded warriors \nlegislation, and I believe we should have a rollcall on that \nlegislation.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2132 to Amendment No. 2011\n\n(Purpose: To provide and enhance rehabilitative treatment and services \nto veterans with traumatic brain injury and to improve health care and \n                    benefits programs for veterans)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment 2100 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2100 to amendment No. 2011.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that it is in the national \n security interest of the United States that Iraq not become a failed \n                 state and a safe haven for terrorists)\n\n       At the end of title XV, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1535. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF A \n                   FAILED STATE IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) A failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for \n     Islamic radicals, including al Qaeda and Hezbollah, who are \n     determined to attack the United States and United States \n     allies.\n       (2) The Iraq Study Group report found that ``[a] chaotic \n     Iraq could provide a still stronger base of operations for \n     terrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally''.\n       (3) The Iraq Study Group noted that ``Al Qaeda will portray \n     any failure by the United States in Iraq as a significant \n     victory that will be featured prominently as they recruit for \n     their cause in the region and around the world''.\n       (4) A National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the \n     consequences of a premature withdrawal from Iraq would be \n     that--\n       (A) Al Qaeda would attempt to use Anbar province to plan \n     further attacks outside of Iraq;\n       (B) neighboring countries would consider actively \n     intervening in Iraq; and\n       (C) sectarian violence would significantly increase in \n     Iraq, accompanied by massive civilian casualties and \n     displacement.\n       (5) The Iraq Study Group found that ``a premature American \n     departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater \n     sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions. . \n     . . The near-term results would be a significant power \n     vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, \n     and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our \n     withdrawal as a historic victory.''\n       (6) A failed state in Iraq could lead to broader regional \n     conflict, possibly involving Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and \n     Turkey.\n       (7) The Iraq Study group noted that ``Turkey could send \n     troops into northern Iraq to prevent Kurdistan from declaring \n     independence''.\n       (8) The Iraq Study Group noted that ``Iran could send \n     troops to restore stability in southern Iraq and perhaps gain \n     control of oil fields. The regional influence of Iran could \n     rise at a time when that country is on a path to producing \n     nuclear weapons.''\n       (9) A failed state in Iraq would lead to massive \n     humanitarian suffering, including widespread ethnic cleansing \n     and countless refugees and internally displaced persons, many \n     of whom will be tortured and killed for having assisted \n     Coalition forces.\n       (10) A recent editorial in the New York Times stated, \n     ``Americans must be clear that Iraq, and the region around \n     it, could be even bloodier and more chaotic after Americans \n     leave. There could be reprisals against those who worked with \n     American forces, further ethnic cleansing, even genocide. \n     Potentially destabilizing refugee flows could hit Jordan and \n     Syria. Iran and Turkey could be tempted to make power \n     grabs.''\n       (11) The Iraq Study Group found that ``[i]f we leave and \n     Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could \n     eventually require the United States to return''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate should commit itself to a strategy that will \n     not leave a failed state in Iraq; and\n       (2) the Senate should not pass legislation that will \n     undermine our military's ability to prevent a failed state in \n     Iraq.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we debate the so-called new strategy in \nIraq, and as we once again engage in more than a little political \nposturing that has become so redundant, that has already delayed \nimportant legislation, not the least of which was the emergency \nappropriations bill to get proper funding and equipment to our troops, \nit appears once again that some of my colleagues in the Senate feel we \nshould retreat, thus abandoning what al-Qaida views as the central \nfront in their global war of terror, and in so doing, allowing Iraq to \nbecome a safe haven for al-Qaida, the same terrorist organization that \nhit this country on September 11, 2001.\n  I ask my colleagues who want us to abandon this critical fight now, \nif we leave Iraq before the Iraqis can defend and govern themselves, \nthen will they answer this question: Will that action strengthen or \nweaken al-Qaida and other foreign jihadists in Iraq and across the \nregion? If there is one thing all of us should have learned by now, it \nis that al-Qaida and organizations that emulate it are the face of \nevil. These organizations and the individuals who subscribe to their \nideology are dedicated to the destruction of the United States, to the \ndestruction of Israel, and to committing the most barbaric and \nincomprehensible assaults on innocent civilians that any of us can \npossibly imagine.\n  Without a stable government in Iraq, it becomes increasingly likely \nthat the training and equipping of terrorists and the planning and \nexecution of terror operations can proceed in both Iraq and throughout \nthe region with impunity, and that our adversaries will operate with \nlittle fear of discovery or disruption.\n  I also ask my distinguished colleagues who believe that we ought to \nleave Iraq before it is stable: Will al-Qaida and other terrorists then \nfollow us here into the United States, even while expanding their \ninfluence in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa? We have already \nseen numerous attacks occur throughout Europe and Africa from al-Qaida-\nlinked or al-Qaida-inspired terrorists. With a firm foothold in Iraq, \nal-Qaida would have a safe and unthreatened sanctuary to serve as their \nnew base of operations from which they can expand further into the \nMiddle East or Africa or Europe, spreading chaos, fear, and strife.\n  How long would it be before al-Qaida is able to continue unabated \nwith further attacks against the United States including operations \ninto and within our country?\n  I ask my distinguished colleagues who believe we should retreat and \nsurrender before stabilizing Iraq, before\n\n[[Page S9117]]\n\nproviding them the opportunity to govern and defend themselves: How \nwill we address Iran's continued support of Iraqi insurgents and \nterrorists now that we have definitive evidence of their involvement in \nactivities such as the training of terrorists and Shiite militias in \nIran; operations in Iraq by terrorists trained in Iran by Al-Quds and \nother Iranian special military forces; alliances with Hezbollah and \nother groups, including Iranian-trained and equipped Hezbollah fighters \noperating in Iraq; the provision of the explosive formed penetrator and \nother improvised explosive devices that are killing American soldiers, \nsailors, marines, and airmen; and other aid and assistance directly \nresulting in the death of American citizens serving us bravely in Iraq?\n  We must be especially concerned as Iran spreads its power and \ninfluence in the region, considering their insistence on developing \nnuclear capabilities. I ask my colleagues who subscribe to this \nproposed policy of retreat and surrender: What will Iran do to expand \ntheir influence in Iraq through their Shia alliances if we stage an \nimmediate withdrawal?\n  We have seen the impact of Iranian-supported terrorist activity in \nIraq. Not only have we lost hundreds of American servicemembers due to \nIranian involvement, not to mention those who still live but live with \ngrievous injuries, but scores of Iraqis have died too, including \ninnocent civilians who have been the victims of these savage attacks.\n  I ask my colleagues who believe we ought to retreat and surrender \nregardless of the circumstances on the ground, regardless of the \nability of the Iraqis to govern and defend themselves: Will Sunni \nmajority nations outside of Iraq, including Saudis and others, stand by \nand let Shiites massacre Sunnis in Iraq? Conversely, will Iran, \nHezbollah, and others stand by when Sunnis then massacre Shiias in \nretaliation? It is clear that this situation could rapidly deteriorate \ninto a full-scale civil war, a massive religious conflict or, at worst, \nuncontrolled genocide on both sides.\n  I ask my distinguished colleagues who believe we ought to withdraw \nfrom Iraq before that country is able to defend and govern itself: What \nis the resultant impact with the Kurds in northern Iraq and with Turkey \nif we stage an immediate withdrawal?\n  Cross-border incursions by both PKK elements operating from Kurdish \nsafe havens in northern Iraq, and retaliatory attacks by Turkish forces \ncould become routine, further destabilizing Iraq, Turkey, and the \nregion.\n  I ask my distinguished colleagues who believe we ought to withdraw \nfrom Iraq before that country is able to govern and defend itself: What \nwill happen to our Iraqi allies who have fought alongside of us? How \nwill this affect America's ability to conduct future multinational \noperations?\n  Some have argued we should have shaped and relied upon a stronger \ncoalition before undertaking operations in Iraq. Clearly we lose the \nability to build such a coalition in the future if we leave our allies \nbehind as we precipitously withdraw from Iraq.\n  I ask my distinguished colleagues who believe we ought to withdraw \nfrom Iraq before that country is able to govern and defend itself: What \nis the scope of humanitarian and refugee crisis that will ensue if we \nsuddenly depart from Iraq? Where and how will the United States address \nthat consequent crisis? It was not that long ago we experienced the \nlargest scale humanitarian and refugee flow after the first gulf war. \nWe were able to eventually deal with that situation through a \nsubstantial commitment of forces to Joint Task Force Provide Comfort in \nnorthern Iraq. Under this new scenario, it would be difficult if not \nimpossible for us to adequately help the large segments of the Iraqi \npopulation trying to flee from unrelenting terror when our forces \nsuddenly withdraw.\n  I ask our colleagues who believe we ought to withdraw from Iraq \nbefore the Iraqis are able to govern and defend themselves: Are the \nIraqis ready to assume full responsibility and control of their own \nsecurity, economic development, reconstruction, and governance? If not, \nhow can we posture the Iraqis for that desired end state, while at the \nsame time withdrawing under continued enemy pressure?\n  Finally, I ask my colleagues on the other side this important \nquestion: What is your plan? What is your plan for the way forward in \nIraq and in the region?\n  Our presence in Iraq is not about pride. It is not, as some have \nsuggested, solely to benefit the Iraqis. Instead it is about our own \nvital national security and our ability to address the threats to our \nNation. Our success is not just about providing the people of Iraq a \nsafe environment to develop and provide for their own self-governance, \nit is about America's national security, the stability of the Middle \nEast, and our partners in the war on terror.\n  We have to do what is right for America's national security, which \nmeans helping to stabilize the Middle East and supporting our partners \nin the war on terror. These 10 concerns have caused me to draft an \namendment which I believe must be added to this bill. This amendment \nexpresses the sense of Congress that ``the Senate should commit itself \nto a strategy that will not leave a failed state in Iraq.'' It also \nstates that ``the Senate should not pass legislation that will \nundermine our military's ability to prevent a failed state in Iraq.''\n  The Iraq Study Group, National Intelligence Estimates, and even the \nNew York Times have all repeatedly warned against the consequences of a \nfailed state in Iraq. Instability in the region could lead to genocide, \nretaliatory attacks against our allies, invasions from neighboring \ncountries, and the proliferation of global terrorism. We cannot allow \nthese possibilities to become realities. Withdrawing our troops now or \non the expedited basis proposed by Senators Reed and Levin, when Iraq \nis not yet able to sustain itself, will only sink the fledgling nation \ninto further chaos and disorder while ensuring that either we will \nrecommit our troops later to a more tumultuous and dangerous battle or \nthat we will leave ourselves open to future attacks from a fortified \nterrorist network.\n  I urge all my colleagues to reject any notion of a premature troop \nwithdrawal and join me in expressing the importance of a stable Iraqi \nnation, not just for the benefit of the people of Iraq but for our own \nnational security. We can't talk about ideas such as withdrawing our \ntroops without looking at the consequences. I know all of us join in \nbelieving that we want to get our troops home as soon as we can. The \nonly difference between us is those who believe we ought to do so based \non an arbitrary timetable and those who believe we ought to do so after \nwe are able to leave the Iraqis in a position to govern and defend \nthemselves, not just, again, for their security and safety but for ours \nas well. Because a failed state in Iraq is a clear and present danger \nto the American people. It would be terrible, indeed, if, having let \nthat happen and seeing more Americans die as they did on 9/11 as a \nresult of al-Qaida's strength and its ability to recruit, train, and \nthen export terrorist attacks to the United States and around the \nworld, that more people in this country and other countries around the \nworld had to die. That is at stake.\n  If we are going to talk about ideas such as those proposed in the \nReed-Levin and other amendments, we need to confront directly the \nconsequences of our actions. This amendment expresses the sense of the \nSenate that we will take no action that will make it more likely that \nIraq will end up a failed state, again, in the national security \ninterest of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2135 to Amendment No. 2011\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 2135, \nand I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. Conrad, proposes an amendment numbered 2135.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Relating to bringing Osama bin Laden and other leaders of al \n                           Qaeda to justice)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add the following:\n\n[[Page S9118]]\n\n     SEC. 1218. JUSTICE FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN AND OTHER LEADERS OF \n                   AL QAEDA.\n\n       (a) Enhanced Reward for Capture of Osama Bin Laden.--\n     Section 36(e)(1) of the State Department Basic Authorities \n     Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2708e)(1)) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new sentence: ``The Secretary shall \n     authorize a reward of $50,000,000 for the capture, or \n     information leading to the capture, of Osama bin Laden.''.\n       (b) Status of Efforts To Bring Osama Bin Laden and Other \n     Leaders of Al Qaeda to Justice.--\n       (1) Reports required.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and every 90 days \n     thereafter, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of \n     Defense shall, in coordination with the Director of National \n     Intelligence, jointly submit to Congress a report on the \n     progress made in bringing Osama bin Laden and other leaders \n     of al Qaeda to justice.\n       (2) Elements.--Each report under paragraph (1) shall \n     include, current as of the date of such report, the \n     following:\n       (A) An assessment of the likely current location of \n     terrorist leaders, including Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-\n     Zawahiri, and other key leaders of al Qaeda.\n       (B) A description of ongoing efforts to bring to justice \n     such terrorist leaders, particularly those who have been \n     directly implicated in attacks in the United States and its \n     embassies.\n       (C) An assessment of whether the government of each country \n     assessed as a likely location of top leaders of al Qaeda has \n     fully cooperated in efforts to bring those leaders to \n     justice.\n       (D) A description of diplomatic efforts currently being \n     made to improve the cooperation of the governments described \n     in subparagraph (C).\n       (E) A description of the current status of the top \n     leadership of al Qaeda and the strategy for locating them and \n     bringing them to justice.\n       (F) An assessment of whether al Qaeda remains the terrorist \n     organization that poses the greatest threat to United States \n     interests, including the greatest threat to the territorial \n     United States.\n       (3) Form of report.--Each report submitted to Congress \n     under paragraph (1) shall be submitted in a classified form, \n     and shall be accompanied by a report in unclassified form \n     that redacts the classified information in the report.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, my colleague Senator Conrad, and my colleague Senator Salazar. \nMy understanding is we will vote on this amendment in the morning. I \ndon't know whether there has been a unanimous consent order on that \nmatter, but my understanding is it will be voted on at 9:30. I wanted \nto spend a few minutes talking about what this amendment is. Let me \nbegin by pointing out the following.\n  It has been nearly 6 years since Osama bin Laden and the leadership \nof al-Qaida ordered an attack on our country on 9/11/2001. Thousands of \nAmericans were killed, innocent Americans murdered by Osama bin Laden \nand the leadership of al-Qaida. Nineteen terrorists with box cutters \nusing commercial airliners loaded with fuel attacked this country. \nThousands died. Six years later, Osama bin Laden is still free. He has \nnot been brought to justice. Six years later, we are told in reports by \nsenior officials in the newspapers--and I will read some of them--that \nal-Qaida is stronger than it has been in years. Six years later, we are \ntold that al-Qaida and the Taliban are rebuilding terrorist training \ncamps in northern Pakistan and the region between northern Pakistan and \nAfghanistan. Six years later, we are told that the leadership of al-\nQaida has a secure hideout in Pakistan. Six years later, we are told \nthat al-Qaida, with its leadership, remains the greatest terrorist \nthreat to our country. All of this after 6 years, two wars in two \ncountries, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars \nspent at home and abroad, thousands of American soldiers dead, and tens \nof thousands wounded.\n  That is a failure. The fact that those who attacked us on 9/11 have \nnot been brought to justice and, in fact, are now planning additional \nattacks against this country and other countries and doing so in secure \nand safe harbors in northern Pakistan, the fact that that exists is a \nfailure. We have troops going door to door in Baghdad in the middle of \na civil war. Yet the leadership of al-Qaida, the greatest terrorist \nthreat to this country, is apparently living free in a safe harbor in \nnorthern Pakistan.\n  Let me describe some of the reasons I bring this discussion to the \nfloor. This is testimony by John Negroponte, then-Director of National \nIntelligence on January 11, 2007, before the U.S. Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence:\n\n       Al Qaeda continues to plot attacks against our homeland and \n     other targets with the objective of inflicting mass \n     casualties. And they continue to maintain active connections \n     and relationships that radiate outward from their leaders' \n     secure hideout in Pakistan.\n\n  Think of that, 6 years after 9/11, after they engineered the murder \nof innocent Americans, our Director of National Intelligence says the \nleadership of al-Qaida ``continues to plot attacks against our \nhomeland'' from their ``secure hideout in Pakistan.''\n  Further, the Director of National Intelligence, in the same testimony \nsaid this:\n\n       Al Qaeda is the terrorist organization that poses the \n     greatest threat to U.S. interests, including to the homeland.\n\n  That is from the Director of National Intelligence. Al-Qaida is the \ngreatest terrorist threat to our country. He said that in January of \nthis year.\n  Let me fast forward. The McClatchy newspapers, June 26, 2007. Senior \nU.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials in this administration \nsaid:\n\n       While the U.S. presses its war against insurgents linked to \n     al Qaida in Iraq, Osama bin Laden's group is recruiting, \n     regrouping and rebuilding in a new sanctuary on the border \n     between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n       Al Qaida, its allies in Afghanistan's Taliban movement and \n     Pakistani radicals ``have free rein there now,'' said Marvin \n     Wenibaum, a former State Department intelligence analyst.\n\n  That is last month.\n  July 11, ``Officials Worry of Summer Terrorist Attack.''\n\n       . . . Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told the \n     editorial board of the Chicago Tribune that he had a ``gut \n     feeling'' about a new period of increased risk.\n\n  The next day, July 12:\n\n       Six years after the Bush administration declared war on al-\n     Qaeda, the terrorist network is gaining strength and has \n     established a safe haven in remote tribal areas of western \n     Pakistan for training and planning attacks.\n       The report, a five-page threat assessment compiled by the \n     National Counterterrorism Center, is titled ``Al-Qaida Better \n     Positioned To Strike the West.''\n\n  We have seen some of this before. Mr. Chertoff says he has a gut \nfeeling. The fact is, we have a lot of intelligence-gathering \ncapability. Mr. Chertoff, Director of Homeland Security, has a gut \nfeeling.\n  Let's go back 6 years to August of 2001, from the President's daily \nbriefing. I have it in my hand. It was released in 2004. In August of \n2001 the intelligence gave the President a document titled: ``Bin Ladin \nDetermined to Strike in US.'' On 9/11, bin Laden and al-Qaida struck \nthe U.S. with devastating effect.\n  July 2007, secret intelligence assessment from the U.S. National \nCounterterrorism Center:\n\n       Al Qaeda better positioned to strike the west.\n\n  Six years ago, the President's daily briefing said bin Laden was \ndetermined to strike the United States, and he did. Six years later:\n\n       Al Qaeda better positioned to strike the west.\n\n  So much money spent in lives, in treasury. So much done, so much \naction in Iraq, where US troops, now go door to door in Baghdad. What \nhas happened to the leaders of those who continue to plan attacks \nagainst our country? What has happened to the leaders of the \norganization who our National Intelligence Director says represent the \ngreatest terrorist threat to our country? They live free, able to speak \nto the world. Al Zawahiri last week spoke to the world. They live free. \nThey are creating new terrorist training camps, and they are talking to \nthe world about their plans to inflict damage and to attack other parts \nof the world. That is called failure.\n  Let me go back again a few years, September 15, 2001. I will not ever \nforget sitting in the Chamber of the House of Representatives in a \njoint session of Congress when President Bush came to speak. This \ncountry was one at that point. They weren't Republicans and Democrats. \nThis was a country that had been victimized by a devastating attack by \nterrorists who were perfectly content to give their own lives as long \nas they could kill innocent others. The President came and spoke to a \njoint session of Congress. Here is what he said:\n\n       We will not only deal with those who dare attack America, \n     we will deal with those who harbor them and feed them and \n     house them.\n\n\n[[Page S9119]]\n\n\n  On August 31, 2006, at the American Legion National Convention, the \nPresident said:\n\n       We have made it clear to all nations, if you harbor \n     terrorists, you are just as guilty as the terrorists. You are \n     an enemy of the United States, and you will be held to \n     account.\n\n  The question most people ask is: What has happened in 6 years that \nthose who planned and executed the attacks against this country now \nlive free and apparently have reconstituted their strength and are \nplanning further attacks against us? We have committed 150,000 or so \nAmerican troops over a long period of time, so far a period of time \nlonger than the Second World War lasted, and they are now going door to \ndoor in Baghdad in a civil war, where Shia are killing Sunnis and \nSunnis are killing Shia, and they are both killing American troops. \nSometime, we are going to leave Iraq. That is not the question. The \nquestion isn't whether. The American people and this Congress are not \ngoing to allow American soldiers to be in the middle of a civil war in \nIraq for years ahead. That is not going to be the case. The question \nisn't whether we leave Iraq. The question is when and how.\n  But even as we discuss and debate that--and we will this week and \nnext week and perhaps the week after--even as we deal with those \nissues, the American people have a right, through this Congress, to ask \nthe President: Why is it that those who engineered the attacks are \nstill able to engineer and plan further attacks? Why is it that those \nwho engineered the attacks of 2001 are still active, are still \napparently in safe harbors, immune to whatever efforts might or might \nnot have existed to bring them to justice? The President was asked \nabout this at one point, and the President said: I don't think much \nabout Osama bin Laden. Well, he should. We should.\n  The amendment we offer is very simple. Six long years later, this \namendment would require the President every 3 months, every single \nquarter, to send a classified report to this Congress telling us what \nhas been done in this administration, what has been done to apprehend \nand bring to justice the leadership of al-Qaida.\n  If, in fact, this is the greatest terrorist threat to our country--if \nthat is the case--and that does not come from me, that comes from the \nhead of intelligence in this country, John Negroponte, in January of \nthis year--if that is the case, why isn't this our primary objective \nand our most important objective?\n  This amendment says the following: It doubles the reward money for \nthe apprehension of Osama bin Laden. It also requires a quarterly \nclassified, top secret report to be provided to Congress to tell us \nwhat is being done to attempt to make this a priority and apprehend the \nleadership of al-Qaida.\n  I understand it is much easier to recognize failure than to recognize \nsuccess. I understand that. But it does not take much looking to \nunderstand this failure.\n  Now, Senator Conrad and I have offered this amendment before, and it \npassed the Senate before and then was quietly dropped in conference by \nthose who do not want this amendment to survive.\n  But it seems to me we ought to as a country understand, if we are \nwaking up in the mornings these days and reading, as I read this \nmorning in the newspapers--and yesterday morning and the morning \nbefore--that our Homeland Security Secretary has a ``gut feeling'' \nabout this, that or the other thing, and there is a meeting down at the \nWhite House to assess these increased risks--we need to understand it \nis all about al-Qaida. It is all about the leadership of al-Qaida \nplanning additional attacks. It is about the reconstitution of \nterrorist activities in training camps with the Taliban and al-Qaida. \nAnd--guess what--we are going door to door in Baghdad trying to figure \nout how we deal with the Sunnis and the Shias.\n  Yes, there are some al-Qaida in Iraq, but those who tell us that is \nthe central fight against terrorism are wrong, and they ought to know \nit. Go have a secret briefing upstairs. I tell you, if you believe that \nis the central fight against terrorism, go have a classified, secret \nbriefing, and then you come back and tell me that is what you heard. \nYou will not hear that.\n  An honest, level look at what is going on in Iraq will describe, \nunfortunately, a civil war in Iraq. Yes, there is some al-Qaida in \nAnbar Province and some other al-Qaida influences, but the principal \nissue in Iraq is sectarian violence or a civil war, and this Congress, \nat some point, is going to tell this President we are not going to keep \nAmerican soldiers in the middle of a civil war for any great length of \ntime. But we will insist that we make a priority as one of our \nsignificant objectives to bring to justice those who murdered thousands \nof Americans on 9-11-2001, and we will insist that those who are now \nplanning additional attacks from a secure hideaway--as Mr. Negroponte \npoints out, a secure hideaway--we will insist that some effort be made \nin this country to deal with that issue.\n  Let me ask one question. I do not want five reasons or three reasons. \nI want somebody to give me one good reason why there ought to be any \nsecure hideout anywhere on this Earth for the people, the leaders of \nal-Qaida who committed this atrocious act against this country in 2001 \nand who are now planning additional attacks against this country. I do \nnot need five reasons. Is there any reason there ought to be a secure \nhideout anywhere on this planet for these people? The answer ought to \nbe no.\n  Getting the terrorists who attacked us on 9-11 has not been our \nobjective, in my judgment. We have gotten sidetracked. It has not been \nour objective to make this the central issue, and I believe it ought to \nbe the central issue. Senator Conrad believes that. Senator Salazar and \nothers believe it. I expect and hope that tomorrow, when we have a vote \nat 9:30 in the morning, the Senate will go on record saying it is \ntime--long past the time--for this country to demand that the \nleadership of al-Qaida be brought to justice and that we interrupt the \nopportunity of those to be in a secure hideout in Pakistan, planning \nadditional destruction and planning additional deaths against innocent \nAmericans in attacks on our homeland.\n  That is the amendment. It is simple. No one can misunderstand that \namendment. No one can misinterpret it. My hope is, at the end of the \nvote tomorrow, the Senate will have expressed itself as forcefully as I \nhope it can on this subject.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment that has \nbeen offered by Senator Dorgan and I have a second-degree amendment, \nwhich I will then offer. I also wish to speak about the broader issue \nbefore us, the Defense authorization bill, but specifically Iraq and an \namendment I have cosponsored with Senators Salazar and Alexander \ndealing with the Iraq Study Group recommendations.\n  First, I rise in support of the amendment by Senator Dorgan. I \ncertainly agree with him that it is critical we focus on the threat \nposed by al-Qaida--whether it be in Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Iraq, or \nthe under leadership of al-Zawahiri or Osama bin Laden. That needs to \nbe a focus of our intelligence and security efforts, as well as the \nefforts our special forces, because of the threat they pose not just to \nAmerican citizens but to our allies around the world.\n  We cannot forget they are committed to the death and destruction of \ninnocent civilians around the world. Under no circumstances should we \nallow any secure area, hideout, or haven to be reconstituted or \nrecreated in the way it was created in Afghanistan under the Taliban \nrule.\n  So I am pleased to support his amendment. No one should underestimate \nthe complexity of the challenge of tracking down the leaders of al-\nQaida, wherever they are around the world, but the American people \nshould know the greatest effort and the greatest commitment is being \nundertaken to deal with these terrorists.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2184 to Amendment No. 2135\n\n  Mr. President, at this time, I would, however, like to offer a \nsecond-degree\n\n[[Page S9120]]\n\namendment. In the drafting of Senator Dorgan's amendment, he speaks \nabout ``the capture, or information leading to the capture,'' but I \ncertainly believe most Americans would agree we should also provide \nsupport, assistance, and a reward if information leads to the death of \nal-Qaida's leadership.\n  To that end, my second-degree amendment would simply amend that line \nto ensure this amendment provides support for the capture or death or \ninformation leading to the capture or death of Osama bin Laden, where \nthe $50 million reward is allowed.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I send the amendment to the desk. It is \na second degree to the Dorgan amendment, and I ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2184 to amendment No. 2135.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike page 2, line 2 and insert in lieu thereof: ``for the \n     capture or death or information leading to the caputure or \n     death of''.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. The amendment, as I have described it, is a simple, \nsingle line that inserts that additional contingency. I think the \nreporting and the assessment of the threats that are included in this \namendment make sense. Members of Congress along with members of our \nintelligence agencies need the most accurate information available to \nunderstand what work is being undertaken, what efforts are being made, \nand what progress is in tracking these terrorists. I think that, in \nturn, will help us make much better policy decisions.\n  So I am pleased to support the amendment. I hope the Senator from \nNorth Dakota will accept my second-degree amendment, and I look forward \nto the adoption of this change to the Defense Authorization bill.\n  Second, Mr. President, I wish to address the Salazar-Alexander \namendment that has been filed, which we certainly hope to have a vote \non next week. This is a piece of legislation that I worked with \nSenators Salazar and Alexander on addressing the recommendations of the \nIraq Study Group.\n  The Iraq Study Group was a bipartisan effort covered extensively in \nthe media since the release of their recommendations in December 2006. \nI made the point at the time, 7 months ago, that those \nrecommendations--there were over 70 different proposals and \nrecommendations in the report--represented the most complete assessment \nthat had been made of the situation in Iraq. That it was a \ncomprehensive framework, and that it did not just deal with security \nissues but included recommendations addressing political reforms that \nneed to take place within the country with the political dynamics of \nIraq. That it included diplomatic efforts that could make a real \ndifference in stabilizing Iraq, supporting the efforts of neighbors and \nother countries in the region, as well as changes that ought to be made \nto our intelligence-gathering operation to support not just our effort \nin Iraq but our effort to deal with al-Qaida in Iraq and around the \nworld. This is something that Senator Dorgan spoke about.\n  I said at the time that, that framework and those recommendations \nshould be embraced and implemented to the greatest extent possible, \nfirst, because it is a comprehensive effort, and second, because the \nIraq Study Group proposals recognize the importance and responsibility \nof the Iraqi Government implementing a series of reforms. They include \neconomic development, reconciliation, the sharing of oil revenues with \npeoples of all regions and ethnic groups across the country, the \ndebaathification process--designed to bring the country closer \ntogether, to create greater unity among the different ethnic factions \nacross Iraq. Only the Iraqi Government, given time, can accomplish \nthese goals which are essential to improving the stability within the \nregion, reducing the level of violence and creating the environment \nwhere our troops can be brought home as soon as possible. No American \nsoldier should serve in Iraq a day longer than is absolutely necessary.\n  This plan is comprehensive in its approach. It recognizes the \nimportance and the responsibility of the Iraqi Government to take steps \nto improve the situation, and it places an emphasis on the coalition \nmission, the mission of U.S. forces, in addressing the threat of al-\nQaida, focusing on the counterterrorism mission within the country, and \ntraining Iraqi security forces.\n  This is one of the few and perhaps the only truly broad bipartisan \neffort we have had before us in the last several months. We have seen a \nseries of relatively partisan votes dealing with hard withdrawal dates, \ncriticizing the Pentagon policy in one area or another. On this \nlegislation right now we have seven Democratic sponsors, six or seven \nRepublican sponsors, and I think the support we would receive from both \nsides of the aisle is even more dramatic than that. So it is a \nbipartisan effort that attempts to implement or help encourage the \nimplementation of the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. I think \nthat provides a very sound and strong framework, not just for improving \nthe situation in Iraq but for also addressing a lot of the regional \nproblems that are contributing to its stability in the other countries \nin the region.\n\n  I would encourage all of my colleagues to take a hard look at this \nlegislation. I don't think anyone would agree with 100 percent of all \nof the recommendations in the Iraq Study Group Report, but I think we \ncan recognize that it is the product of a great deal of effort to \nunderstand the situation, assess the climate in Iraq, and make \nsubstantive recommendations that will move us forward.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I have submitted an amendment that \nwould help tackle an alarming problem with our men and women who serve \nin the Armed Forces, the Heroes Helping Heroes Act.\n  I have introduced the Heroes Helping Heroes Act in the Senate this \nyear to provide funding for peer support programs so that trained \nveterans can help returning veterans navigate the sometimes perilous \ntransition to civilian life.\n  My intention is to expand the use of peer-support approaches to \nassist the reintegration of America's veterans as they return from \nactive duty to their homes and communities. We hope that this \nlegislation will demonstrate the effectiveness of peer-support \napproaches and ease the burden of the social, economic, medical and \npsychological struggles our veterans face.\n  Fortunately, ``peer-support'' approaches offer a low cost and \neffective adjunct to traditional services by allowing the heroes of our \ncountry to help each other. Veteran peer-support offers two things that \nno kind of professionalized service can ever hope to: the support of \nsomeone who has had the same kinds of experiences and truly understands \nwhat the veteran is going through; and the potential of a large pool of \nexperienced volunteers who can assist and support returning veterans at \nvery little cost.\n  Last week I held a hearing on the issues surrounding older veterans \nin my home State of Oregon. I also held a series of roundtables in both \nPortland and White City to discuss how we can improve the current \nmental health system, be it through the VA, Department of Defense, or \nwithin the community mental health structure.\n  What we now refer to as post-traumatic stress disorder was once \ndescribed as ``soldier's heart'' in the Civil War, ``shell shock'' in \nWorld War I, and ``combat fatigue'' in World War II. Whatever the name, \nit is a serious mental illness and deserves the same type of attention \nand care provided for a physical wound.\n  In recent reports, we have heard that 20 to 40 servicemen and women \nare evacuated each month from Iraq due to mental health problems. In \naddition to those who are identified, there are many more who will \nreturn home after their service to face re-adjustment challenges. Some \nwill need appropriate mental heath care to help them adjust back to \n``normal'' life. While others will need medical assistance to heal more \nserious PTSD issues. Yet others will need help to mentally cope with \ntheir physical wounds.\n  The effectiveness of these approaches has been documented in a \nvariety of\n\n[[Page S9121]]\n\ndomains. Specifically, for mental health disorders like PTSD and \ndepression, peer-support programs have shown that participation yields \nimprovement in psychiatric symptoms and decreased hospitalizations, the \ndevelopment of larger social support networks, enhanced self-esteem and \nsocial functioning, as well as lower services costs. The Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Service Administration, SAMHSA, and even the \nPresident's new Freedom Commission on Mental Health, have recognized \npeer-support approaches as an emerging practice that is helping people \nrecover from traumatic events.\n  So many of our veterans from previous conflicts, such as World War II \nand the Korean and Vietnam Wars, needed similar programs once they \nreturned home. Yet I fear that we didn't do enough to help them. With \nproper and early supports systems in place, we can work to prevent the \nmore serious and chronic mental health issues that come from a lack of \nintervention.\n  As our country faces new waves of veterans with mental health \nillnesses, many of whose issues arise from combat stress, we must \nensure that we learn from the lessons of the past. We must ensure that \nthey are cared for, and we must not leave behind those who fought for \nNation in previous generations.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am in strong support of the fiscal year \n2008 National Defense Authorization Act. This legislation will provide \nessential resources to our troops as they engage in combat overseas and \ntraining at home. It also offers an important opportunity at this \ncrucial time for continued debate as to our Nation's future presence in \nIraq. This is the most important challenge facing our country, and I \nwill address this issue in subsequent remarks.\n  Let me begin by thanking my colleagues, the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin and \nSenator McCain, for their leadership in crafting this bill and for \ntheir strong commitment to our Nation's Armed Forces.\n  This legislation includes a strong commitment to strengthen Navy \nshipbuilding by including $13.6 billion for shipbuilding programs. The \ndeclining size of our Navy fleet is of great concern to me, and this \nlegislation is an important step toward reversing that troubling \ndecline.\n  The Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Mullen, has proposed a 313-\nship Navy shipbuilding plan that seeks to address longstanding \ncongressional concerns that Navy shipbuilding has been inadequately \nfunded in recent years. The resulting instability has had a number of \ntroubling effects on the shipbuilding industrial base and has \ncontributed to significant cost growth in Navy shipbuilding programs. \nThe CNO's plan--combined with more robust funding by Congress--will \nbegin to reverse the decline in Navy shipbuilding.\n  I strongly support the provisions authorizing the funding for \nconstruction of destroyers for the 21st century, the DDG-1000 Zumwalt \nclass destroyers. The DDG-1000 represents a significant advance in Navy \nsurface combatant technology. Its capabilities include: superior \nprecision naval surface fire support; advanced stealth technologies; \nengineering and technological innovations allowing for a reduced crew \nsize; and sophisticated, advanced weapons systems, such as the \nelectromagnetic rail gun.\n  In addition, it is important to note the tremendous cost savings that \nwill be realized over the lifecycle of a DDG-1000 destroyer compared to \nthat of a DDG-51 destroyer as a result of various innovations and \ntechnological advancements.\n  It is critical that the construction of the first two DDG-1000 \ndestroyers in 2007 and 2008 continue as scheduled without further \ndelays. The dedicated and highly skilled workers at our Nation's \nsurface combatant shipyards, such as Bath Iron Works in my home State \nof Maine, are simply too valuable to jeopardize with further \ncontracting delays.\n  That is why I am concerned that the House version of this bill \nincludes a provision to prohibit the start of construction on lead \nships until the Secretary of Navy certifies that detailed design is \ncomplete. This provision, if enacted, could further delay the Navy's \nawarding of the construction contract for the first two DDG-1000 \ndestroyers.\n  The House version would also require that the next-generation class \nof Navy cruisers, which will be the follow-on to the DDG-1000 \ndestroyer, be powered by nuclear propulsion systems, even though \nneither of the U.S. Navy's proven surface combatant shipyards, Bath \nIron Works and Ingalls Shipyard, has the facilities or certifications \nrequired to construct nuclear-powered surface combatant ships. This \nprovision could dramatically increase the costs of future surface \ncombatants, thereby reducing the overall number of ships built at a \ntime when the Navy is seeking to revitalize and modernize its fleet.\n  Of further concern is the fact that the Senate version of this \nlegislation, as drafted initially, eliminated all funding for the \nLittoral Combat Ship Program for fiscal year 2008, despite the fact \nthat this ship is an integral part of the CNO's 313-ship plan. \nFortunately, I was able to work with my colleagues on the Armed \nServices Committee during the mark up of this legislation to restore \n$480 million to ensure continued development of this important program.\n  I am pleased that the Senate Armed Services Committee also agreed to \nmy request for $50 million in funding to continue the modernization \nprogram for the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers. This program \nprovides significant savings to the Navy by applying some of the \ntechnology that is being developed for the DDG-1000 destroyer and \nbackfitting the DDG-51, which may reduce the crew size by 30 to 40 \npeople.\n  The Senate's fiscal 2008 Defense authorization bill also includes \nfunding for other defense-related projects that benefit Maine and our \nnational security. Funding is provided for machine guns and grenade \nlaunchers, both of which are manufactured by the highly skilled workers \nat Saco Defense in Saco, ME.\n  All of the Senate Armed Services Committee members are concerned \nabout improving the protection of our troops in harm's way. As such, \nthis bill includes $4 billion above the President's budget request for \naccelerated procurement of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, MRAP, \nvehicles for the Armed Forces and $4.5 billion for the Joint Improvised \nExplosive Defeat Organization.\n  In addition, the legislation provides $5 million to the University of \nMaine's Army Center of Excellence for the production and demonstration \nof lightweight modular ballistic tent insert panels. The panels provide \ncrucial protection to servicemembers in temporary dining and housing \nfacilities in mobile forward-operating bases in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The legislation also provides $6.9 million for the Maine Army \nNational Guard to field the Integrated Disaster Management System, \ndeveloped by Global Relief Technologies in Kennebunk and Portsmouth, in \nsupport of critical medivac operations in Iraq. This system provides \nnear real-time data management and analysis to and from field operators \nvia state-of-the-art, hand-held devices.\n  The bill also authorizes $9.7 million for construction of a \nConsolidated Emergency Control Center at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. \nThis facility will consolidate all of the shipyard's emergency response \nentities into one centralized location, which will provide a \ncomprehensive communications and response capability in the event of an \nemergency.\n  Finally, I am pleased that this bipartisan Defense bill also \nauthorizes a 3.5-percent across-the-board pay increase for \nservicemembers, half a percent above the President's budget request. \nThis bill provides the necessary resources to our troops and our Nation \nand recognizes the enormous contributions made by the State of Maine. \nThe bill provides the necessary funding for our troops, and I offer it \nmy full support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be granted 30 \nminutes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9122]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Senator Enzi pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1783 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, is there a preestablished time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will speak roughly, if any Members are interested, 15 \nminutes or so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in October 2006, the North Korean regime \nof Kim Jong Il culminated years of provocative military action by \nconducting a nuclear test. In the years preceding that test, North \nKorea expelled international inspectors, restarted nuclear facilities, \nand reinvigorated its plutonium production program, this, following the \npledge by North Korea, under the agreed framework in 1994, to freeze \nand dismantle its nuclear weapons program in exchange for our \nassistance.\n  I am glad that following this test in 2006, the international \ncommunity joined the United States in condemning that test, and the \nUnited Nations Security Council passed a resolution requiring North \nKorea to halt their nuclear tests and dismantle their nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  In February of this year, our State Department negotiators and Bush \nadministration officials heralded a breakthrough agreement with North \nKorea. On February 13, the six-party negotiators, including the \ncountries of the United States, Russia, South Korea, Japan, China, and \nNorth Korea, concluded an agreement to end North Korea's nuclear \nprograms.\n  President Bush stated he was ``pleased with the agreement reached'' \nby the six-party talks. He acknowledged that under the agreement, North \nKorea committed to take several specific actions by a 60-day deadline, \nand President Bush made clear that the cooperation on economic, \nhumanitarian, and energy assistance to North Korea would be provided \n``as the North carries out its commitments to disable its nuclear \nfacilities.'' In other words, there was going to be a step-by-step \nprocess by which they disabled their nuclear facilities, that they \nwould then get economic, humanitarian, and energy assistance in North \nKorea.\n  Pursuant to the February 13 deal, North Korea was required to take a \nseries of actions within 60 days. This included a freeze of its nuclear \ninstallations at Yongbyon, including shutting down a nuclear reactor \nand plutonium processing plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency \nin Vienna was to be allowed to monitor the freeze at Yongbyon. To no \none's surprise, that 60-day deadline that was negotiated passed with no \naction by the North Koreans. The Yongbyon facility was not shut down. \nThe International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors were not admitted, \nreminiscent of the pussyfooting with North Korea that went on during \nthe 1990s.\n  Rather than comply with their commitments under the agreement--then \nwe know what North Korea did, something that was not even negotiated--\nNorth Korea proceeded to demand the release of assets frozen at the \nMacau-based Banco Delta Asia.\n  The approximately $25 million was frozen by the United States \nTreasury Department in 2005 once it was discovered that these funds \ncame from a range of fraudulent and illegal activities by the North \nKoreans; simply stated, counterfeiting of U.S. currency and money \nlaundering.\n  So what was our response to the North Korean demand? Did we refuse to \nnegotiate the BDA funds until North Korea demonstrated their commitment \nto follow through on their obligations? I am sorry to say the answer is \nno. We allowed them to pussyfoot around, as they have done so often.\n  Our team of negotiators began working on a way to yield to Kim Jong \nIl's demands, once again accepting their pussyfooting.\n  Keep in mind, under the terms of the February 13 agreement, North \nKorea had the unambiguous responsibility to take the first step, which \nNorth Korea did not do. In addition, the BDA frozen funds were not \nstated in or a part of that February 13 agreement. So how do we get to \nthe point of responding to their pussyfooting that they demand \nsomething that is not in an agreement that was already agreed to? What \ngood are agreements? Not only had the North Koreans not followed \nthrough on their commitment by the 60-day deadline, they were now \nreopening the agreement by demanding the release of these frozen funds.\n  So rather than force North Korea to fulfill its commitments, our \nnegotiators were looking for ways to respond to their pussyfooting, \ntheir unwillingness to act, and then work to get those frozen funds \nunfrozen.\n  Here again Uncle Sam becomes Uncle Sucker for some tinhorn dictator. \nAnd we wonder why we are not respected around the world.\n  In June, after weeks of back and forth between the State Department \nand Pyongyang, the funds were unfrozen and our own Federal Reserve \nSystem was called in to transfer the funds. How illicit these funds \nwere in the first place is the fact that they went to banks all over \nthe world to try to transfer them. They even went to Russia, and Russia \nwould not touch it. But once again Uncle Sam is Uncle Sucker and our \nFederal Reserve System was willing to pass on that tainted money.\n\n  Before North Korea showed even an inkling of followthrough on their \nobligations, we conceded on an issue that wasn't even a part of the \nagreement that they were supposed to start dismantling their nuclear \nprogram. So it begs the question of whether the BDA funds were part of \na side deal that our State Department negotiators had chosen to agree \nto but not include in that formal agreement.\n  In addition, in pushing the BDA issue as a precondition for \nimplementing the initial phase of the six-party agreement, Kim Jong Il \nhad succeeded in rendering the timelines of the agreement useless. In \nother words, what was supposed to happen in 60 days after the February \n13 agreement did not happen in 60 days, and more pussyfooting by Kim \nJong Il, as we saw in the 1990s and we are seeing again now. Do we ever \nlearn a lesson?\n  In addition to pushing the BDA issue as a precondition of \nimplementing the initial phase of the agreement, he had in fact pulled \none over on the United States. These deadlines, starting February 13, \nwere touted by the six-party negotiators as evidence that North Korea \nwould finally comply with the demands to give up its nuclear program \nand that they would be held accountable to strict deadlines. Neither of \nthese things happened, and people in North Korea are laughing at Uncle \nSucker again.\n  In recent days and weeks, North Korea has begun to signal that they \nwill take concrete steps to shut down and seal the Yongbyon facility \nand accede to verification and monitoring procedures of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. Assistant Secretary of State \nChristopher Hill recently visited North Korea and described his \npositive discussions with the North Koreans and their intentions to \nfulfill their obligations.\n  I wonder if he bothered to discuss with them why they didn't keep \ntheir word. Is their word worth anything? I mean, after all, you have \nan agreement. Can you trust people who sign a name to a document?\n  It is difficult to understand the positive reaction to the signals \nnow being sent by North Korea 3 months after they were required. In \nother words, in 60 days things would start to happen. Nothing happened \nuntil 3 months after the 60 days. Nonetheless, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency has, in recent days, determined the scope of its \ninspection regime and is expected to be back in North Korea within \nweeks.\n  But once again, there is no target date for shutting down the \nYongbyon facility. It appears that all we are getting from North \nKorea's leadership is the same old footdragging--pussyfooting around. \nAnd while the North Koreans have said they intend to shut down and seal \nthe Yongbyon facility in the near future, do you know what they are \ndoing now? They are putting more demands on us ahead of time. They are \nnow tying those actions to the delivery of heavy oil.\n  Now, this bears repeating, because, here again, we have more \npussyfooting.\n\n[[Page S9123]]\n\nBefore shutting and sealing the nuclear facility at Yongbyon, North \nKorea is demanding the delivery of heavy oil, and even other \nassistance, without any significant action on their part. Mr. \nPresident, to use a quote from baseball's great Yogi Berra, it's deja \nvu all over again.\n  My great concern is that North Korea is in the process of exploiting, \ntime and again, our willingness to concede to their demands for \nassistance, regardless of whether they ever actually comply with their \ncommitments of the February agreement in the first place. In other \nwords, if they can sucker us again, they want to sucker us for all they \ncan get out of us.\n  I understand the angst of North Korea with allowing the International \nAtomic Energy Agency inspectors in and the freezing of the Yongbyon \nfacility, but these steps are rather small compared to the future \nrequirements. If Kim Jong Il ever complies with the first phase of this \nagreement, the next phase will require them to make a complete \ndeclaration of all nuclear programs, including their uranium enrichment \nactivities.\n  It also requires the complete disablement of all nuclear facilities. \nKeep in mind, no timetables, no deadlines have been agreed to for the \nimplementation of this phase. It is during those future steps, when the \nreal heavy lifting will be required, that we will see the true nature \nof Kim Jong Il.\n  I haven't seen any change, and I don't expect a lot of change, but I \nexpect the United States to just continue to be suckered and suckered \nand suckered. And if Kim Jong Il has no intention of giving us his \nnuclear weapons program, which many believe, it will be crystal clear \nat that point when real commitments come due.\n  I am afraid we will likely see more of the same patient back and \nforth, so-called confidence building--those are words our people use--\nthat our negotiators seem so compelled to pursue. It seems that nothing \nhas been learned during the process with North Korea. Have the \ndiplomats at Foggy Bottom not learned anything from the mistakes made \nby this administration now, by the Clinton administration previously?\n  Have we learned nothing from Kim Jong Il's perpetual tactics of \nagreeing to terms, only to demand then further concessions, as though \nwritten agreements mean nothing? We have been down this road before. \nWhen are we going to recognize we are being made a sucker, much the \nsame way President Clinton was played along with? When will we say to \nPyongyang that enough is enough? When will this Bush administration \nstand its ground?\n  I support the international effort towards a diplomatic solution on \nthis matter, but I also think it is imperative we learn from past \nmistakes. I was deeply skeptical of North Korea's willingness to follow \nthrough on the 1994 Agreed Framework, and I am deeply skeptical they \nwill follow through on the February 13 agreement.\n  If Pyongyang continues to demand assistance without complying with \nthe terms of the February 13 agreement, I hope the President--the \npresent chief executive, President Bush--will quickly realize the deja \nvu tactics of Kim Jong Il and put an end to the policies of concessions \nwithout compliance. If not, President Bush will have done nothing more \nto address North Korea's nuclear problems than President Clinton.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                            Trade With China\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the senior \nSenator from Iowa and his terrific work on North Korea and what we need \nto do, and I thank him for that.\n  Today, new trade figures were released by the Department of Commerce. \nThe news continues to be bad, as our trade policy continues on its \nmerry way. We saw the numbers--$20 billion trade deficit in May, the \nmost recent number they released--$20 billion, leaving us for the year, \nat this point, a $96 billion trade deficit with China. That is a 15-\npercent increase over last year. That means we are buying $96 billion \nmore from China than we are selling to China, and that is just through \nthe first 5 months of 2007.\n  To understand a billion dollars, which is pretty hard to do, if you \nhad a billion dollars and you spent a dollar every second of every \nminute, of every hour, of every day, it would take 31 years to spend $1 \nbillion. The pages who sit in this Chamber, Mr. President, have lived \nabout a half billion seconds. They are a little older than half of 31 \nbut not much. So our trade deficit with China, so far this year, up \nthrough the first 5 months since January 1, is $96 billion.\n  Our trade deficit with the whole world, just in the month of May, was \n$66 billion. President Bush the first said a trade deficit of a billion \ndollars translates into 13,000--mostly manufacturing jobs--13,000 jobs \nfor a $1 billion trade deficit. You can do the math and see what this \ncontinued persistent insidious trade deficit is doing to our economy.\n  Those are just numbers. Last week, in my State of Ohio, just to put \nfaces with those numbers, I was in the town of Lima, the town of \nMansfield, where I grew up--my mother had her 87th birthday--I was in \nLorain and Marion and Zanesville. Each of those are medium-sized cities \nof 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, and 60,000 people. Each of those cities \ncontributed so much to the muscle of this country, to our war effort in \nWorld War II, to the building of a middle class, and to doing all that \nindustrial America has done, and in each of those communities--Lima, \nZanesville, Mansfield, Lorain, and Marion--and I could add Springfield, \nXenia, Findlay, Ravenna and Ashtabula--my wife's hometown--I could add \nall those cities, and in too many cases the growth in this economy that \nthe President trumpets when he comes to Cleveland--a more prosperous \narea--the President trumpets this economic growth, an economic growth \nthat is passing by too many of these communities.\n  When I grew up in Mansfield, we had the international headquarters of \nTappan-Stowe, Westinghouse, General Motors, and we had a Mansfield Tire \nCompany, and the corporate headquarters of Ohio Grass, and tens of \nthousands of industrial manufacturing jobs. Today, of those companies I \nmentioned, only General Motors is still there.\n  Mr. President, we know what that kind of job loss does to communities \nwhen a company closes and lays off 2,000 people to move to Mexico, to \nChina, or whatever happens. When 2,000 people lose their jobs, or 200 \npeople lose their jobs, we know what that does to the community and to \nthe families and to those individuals. We also know it means layoffs \nfor teachers, police officers, firefighters, and that the community is \nless safe, less prosperous, and there is less opportunity for young \npeople in those communities to go to school and get a good education in \nhopes of achieving the American dream.\n  The President's answer to this--and I don't put all of this decline \nin manufacturing, where my State of Ohio has lost literally hundreds of \nthousands of jobs, onto the Bush administration. I don't put all of \nthis at the President's feet nor at the feet of failed trade policy, \nbut clearly NAFTA, PNTR with China, the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, trade agreements that are now on the table, all of these \nclearly have contributed to the decline of manufacturing in a big, big \nway.\n  So what is the President's answer? We had NAFTA, we had PNTR, we had \nCAFTA, and so the President's answer is let's do four more trade \nagreements. Let's do a trade agreement with Panama, let's do a trade \nagreement with Peru, let's do a trade agreement with Colombia, and \nlet's do a trade agreement with South Korea. Again and again it is the \nsame NAFTA failed model.\n  This time the President said it is going to be better because we are \ngoing to include labor and environmental standards in Peru and in \nPanama.\n  First, if that is the case, why today, literally this week, were \nworkers in Peru demonstrating on the streets? Because they think these \ntrade agreements are bad for workers in their country too. The fact is, \nthese trade agreements might be good for some investors short term but \nthey are never good for the workers in Peru, they are not good for \nworkers in Panama, they are not good for the workers in the United \nStates, and they are not good for our communities or families.\n  The President says: Well, this trade agreement is different because \nwe have labor and environmental standards\n\n[[Page S9124]]\n\nthat are going to be negotiated alongside them. But the fact is that is \nwhat they said about NAFTA. They passed labor and environmental \nstandards in a side agreement and it did nothing to raise the labor and \nenvironmental standards in NAFTA, but it did turn a trade surplus that \nwe had with Mexico in 1993 into a trade deficit into the tens of \nbillions of dollars. We know that.\n  We also know what happened when we signed a trade agreement with \nJordan--one I voted for when I was in the House of Representatives--a \ntrade agreement that had solid labor and environmental standards in the \nmiddle of the agreement, at the core of the agreement. We also know \nthat happened in 2000.\n  In 2001, when President Bush took office, his trade representative, \nRobert Zoellick, wrote a letter to the Jordanian Government saying we \nwere not going to use the dispute resolution and not going to actually \nenforce the labor and environmental standards. What has happened? \nJordan is now a sweatshop with a whole lot of Bangladeshi workers \nexporting textiles and apparel all over the world and has undercut all \nthat trade agreement has been. It has undercut all that trade agreement \nshould have been. So when I hear the President say we are going to do a \ntrade agreement with Peru and Panama and South Korea and Colombia, it \nis the same old story. The trade policy is not working. We need \nsomething different.\n\n  We need to go back and relook at NAFTA, relook at PNTR, relook at \nCAFTA. We also need a trade policy that will have strong labor and \nenvironmental standards and strong food safety standards. Look at what \nhas happened with China in the last few weeks. Look at the news stories \nabout China--contaminants or worse in toothpaste and dog food, \ndefective consumer toys for children. We are exposing American \nchildren, American families, Americans generally to the products coming \nfrom a country with no regulation, with no health and environmental \nstandards, with no consumer product safety standards--none of those. \nYet our market is wide open for them to sell into this country and just \nend run all the protections we have built to raise our standard of \nliving and to protect our families and our children.\n  As Senator Dorgan said, we also need trade agreements with benchmarks \nto allow us to gauge whether these serve the national interest. We \nshould have objectives of opening markets and creating jobs ensuring \nthese benchmarks, so each year we have a report card whether this trade \ndeal is actually helping us export or is this actually exporting jobs. \nIs this trade deal helping American workers bring their wages up or are \nthese trade agreements pulling wages down? Are they helping to build a \nmiddle class or are they, like they have in the past, taking them piece \nby piece and pulling apart the middle class in this country?\n  We know what we need to do. We know, unfortunately, what the Bush \nadministration wants to do on trade policy. Now is the time to start by \nrejecting these trade agreements the administration continues to push \ndown our throats.\n  At the same time, when we pass trade agreements that work for workers \nand work for the middle class in this country and work for poorest \nworkers in the developing world, we also need a manufacturing policy in \nour country. We need a tax system that rewards work, a tax system that \nencourages production in this country, the enlargement of the \nmanufacturing extension partnership Senator Kohl from Wisconsin so \neloquently spoke about, and we need a real alternative energy policy in \nthis country, one that really will mean more manufacturing of wind \nturbines--the University of Toledo does some of the best wind research \nin the country--and of solar panels. My State has a variety, a whole \nbunch of manufacturing capabilities. There is simply no reason we can't \nhelp to turn my State into a Silicon Valley of alternative energy.\n  It is an opportunity whose time has come. It is an opportunity for \nus, as a Senate and a House, and for Governor Strickland in Ohio and \nLieutenant Governor Fisher and all of us to work together, not just to \nchange the direction of trade policy or change our tax system to help \nthe middle class and help American workers but to embark on an \nalternative energy policy that will help stabilize energy prices, that \nwill help wean us off Middle Eastern oil, and ultimately will help \nproduce good-paying industrial jobs in our State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the life of Lady \nBird Johnson. She was one of the most beloved First Ladies in our \nNation's history.\n  Lady Bird Johnson represented the best of Texas and the best of \nAmerica. Since the days that I attended the University of Texas with \nher daughter Lynda, I have known and admired Lady Bird Johnson. I knew \nher as a woman of dignity, kindness, and graciousness.\n  Through the years, I have also come to know Luci, one of the most \nthoughtful people I have ever met. And, of course, most of us in the \nSenate know Lynda and her husband Chuck Robb, a former Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Claudia Alta Taylor Johnson was a Texas original. She was born in \nKarnack, TX, on December 22, 1912. During her infancy, a nursemaid \ncommented, ``She's as pretty as a ladybird,'' and that nickname \nvirtually replaced her given name of Claudia Alta for the rest of her \nlife.\n  Lady Bird graduated from Marshall High School in Marshall, TX, \nstudied journalism and art at St. Mary's Episcopal School for Girls, \nand graduated from the University of Texas.\n  In 1934, she married Lyndon Baines Johnson, another young, smalltown \nTexan, who would go on to serve our State in the U.S. House and Senate \nand then our country as Vice President and later as President of the \nUnited States.\n  In her role as First Lady, Lady Bird shared her love of the outdoors \nwith the American people, becoming the strongest advocate for improving \nour public spaces. She was instrumental in promoting the Highway \nBeautification Act, which enhanced the Nation's highway system by \nlimiting billboards and planting roadside areas. I will never pass \nwildflowers on a median of a highway without thinking of her. She was \nalso a champion of the Head Start Program.\n  Even after her husband left office in 1969, she remained active in \npublic life and especially in Texas. She served on the University of \nTexas board of regents. On December 22, 1982--her 70th birthday--she \nand Helen Hayes founded the National Wildflower Research Center, a \nnonprofit organization devoted to preserving and reintroducing native \nplants in planned landscapes at the University of Texas. In 1998, that \ncenter was officially renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.\n  As the U.S. Senator from Lady Bird's home State, I have consistently \nworked to strengthen and promote her outstanding legacy. Over the \nyears, I have worked to preserve the LBJ office\n\n[[Page S9125]]\n\nin the Jake Pickle Building in Austin and to add the Lady Bird Johnson \nPlaza to the LBJ Library.\n  In the fall of 2006, Lady Bird joined me at a groundbreaking ceremony \nfor the new plaza. She was radiant that day. The renovation is still in \nprogress and has now been scheduled to finish by August of 2008--just \nin time for what would have been Lyndon's 100th birthday. The plaza \nwill be graced by wildflowers which will serve as a tribute to Lady \nBird's love of nature. Each wildflower will represent the lifework of a \nbeautiful woman who will always have a special place in the hearts of \nthe people who knew her.\n  I am proud, as a Texan, that this Texas lady represented the best of \nour Nation. My thoughts and prayers are with Lady Bird's family--\nespecially her daughters Lynda and Luci. We all mourn her passing, but \nwe should also celebrate this remarkable woman's life.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lady \nBird Johnson, one of our Nation's most beloved former First Ladies.\n  Lady Bird Johnson was a conservationist, an enthusiastic political \nwife, a shrewd businesswoman, and the loving grandmother of a close-\nknit family.\n  But she will be best remembered for her efforts to make America a \nmore beautiful country.\n  Lady Bird Johnson was born Claudia Alta Taylor to her parents near \nKarnack, TX, in 1912. Legend has it that she received the quaint \nnickname when a nursemaid exclaimed that the young Claudia was ``as \npurty as a lady bird.''\n  At a very early age, she expressed an interest in the environment, \nand in particular, wildflowers--which would become a lifelong passion.\n  A graduate of the University of Texas, Lady Bird received a bachelor \nof arts in history and a bachelor of journalism in 1934.\n  It was in Austin where she met her future husband, Lyndon Baines \nJohnson. The connection between the two was electric--after a whirlwind \nromance and courtship, the two were married in November 1934.\n  Lady Bird was a loyal and tireless supporter during her husband's \npolitical career--usually behind the scenes--from Congressman to \nSenator, from Senate majority leader to Vice President, and finally, on \nthat fateful day in 1963, as the 36th President of the United States.\n  And it is her accomplishments as First Lady that distinguished Lady \nBird as visionary.\n  Lady Bird brought a dash of Texas hospitality and genteel charm to \nthe White House during those first dark days of the Johnson \nadministration, as the Nation struggled to recover from the tragedy of \nthe Kennedy assassination.\n  A life-long lover of the environment, Lady Bird Johnson is best known \nfor the Beautification Act of 1965, which is widely credited as the \nLady Bird Act. The legislation encouraged efforts to make the Nation's \nInterstate System more scenic and limited billboards that could be \nposted along roadways.\n  So as millions of American families go on summer vacations, they can \nthank Lady Bird Johnson for the beautiful wildflowers that bloom along \nthe highways.\n  It was the first of a major legislative effort undertaken by a First \nLady--and helped to transform the very nature of the Office of the \nFirst Lady.\n  Lady Bird began her beautification efforts with the ``First Lady's \nCommittee for a More Beautiful Capital'' in 1965.\n  Although it is largely known that the First Lady worked to have \nflower beds and dogwood trees planted throughout the Capitol, Lady Bird \nalso worked to address more urban societal concerns here in the \nDistrict of Columbia, such as crime, public transportation, mental \nhealth and recreation.\n  And to Lady Bird, beautification meant much more--it embodied a deep \ncommitment to the conservation of this country's natural resources.\n  In her own words, it meant: ``clean water, clean air, clean \nroadsides, safe waste disposal and preservation of valued old \nlandmarks, as well as great parks and wilderness areas.''\n  As First Lady, she was often considered a ``shadow Secretary of the \nInterior.''\n  When the White House Conference on Natural Beauty was convened in May \n1966, Lady Bird kicked off the conference proceedings by asking this \nimportant question:\n\n       Can a great democratic society generate the drive to plan, \n     and having planned, execute projects of great natural beauty?\n\n  And thanks in part to her efforts, the Johnson administration helped \nto oversee some 150 legislative accomplishments for the environment, \nincluding: The Clean Air Act; The Wilderness Act of 1964; The Land and \nWater Conservation Fund; The Wild and Scenic Rivers Program; and \nnumerous additions to the National Park system.\n  Lady Bird Johnson helped to ensure protection of some of America's \nfinest natural treasures, including the Grand Canyon, the Hudson River \nValley, and perhaps closest to my heart, the majestic California \nredwoods.\n  Lady Bird Johnson was also closely involved in President Johnson's \ncivil rights efforts and his ``Great Society'' campaign, particularly \non the Head Start program.\n  She helped to ensure that low-income youngsters are given the \nopportunities they need to compete fairly and equally when they enter \nelementary school.\n  So she truly left her stamp as a First Lady.\n  After leaving the White House in 1969, Lady Bird turned her attention \nonce again to wildflowers. She was instrumental in launching the \nNational Wildflower Research Center in 1982, which was later renamed in \nher honor.\n  The center has been central to helping preserve many species of \nwildflowers and plants, which are increasingly sensitive to the \nchallenges of climate change. In fact, today, some 30 percent of the \nworld's wildflowers and other native flora are endangered.\n  Lady Bird Johnson was one of America's finest citizens. And she was \nrecognized as such. In 1977, the former First Lady was presented with \nAmerica's highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom, by President \nGerald Ford. And in 1988, she received the Congressional Gold Medal \nfrom President Ronald Reagan.\n  As Laurance Rockefeller aptly stated when Lady Bird was awarded the \nConservation Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1977:\n\n       She's a role model for leadership responsibility for women. \n     That's a big part of her legacy, above and beyond the \n     environment.\n\n  Lady Bird Johnson will be very much missed. And I offer my personal \nand deepest sympathies to her family.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, today I join people from throughout America \nin paying tribute to former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, who passed \naway yesterday at the age of 94.\n  Lady Bird Johnson served as America's First Lady during one of the \nmost tumultuous periods in our Nation's history. During the 1960s, this \nNation suffered through the assassinations of our most promising \nleaders.\n  We were also bitterly divided by the war in Vietnam. With respect to \nVietnam, the Johnson family was personally affected by the war. Many of \nus recall the White House wedding of Chuck and Lynda Bird Robb in 1967, \nand how Chuck Robb later distinguished himself as a Marine Corps \nofficer in Vietnam.\n  And many of our cities literally burned as America struggled to end \nsegregation and to usher in a new era of civil rights. On this last \nissue, in particular, President Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson deserve \nhistorical credit for their leadership and political courage.\n  It was against this backdrop of political and civil unrest that \nAmerica was especially blessed by the grace, humility and quiet \ndetermination of Lady Bird Johnson.\n  Mrs. Johnson reminded all of us that America is at her best when we \nare civil to each other and when we treat our adversaries with \ntolerance and respect.\n  Of course, her legacy extends far beyond her grace, charm and \nsteadfast loyalty to President Johnson. To a greater extent perhaps \nthan any other living American, Lady Bird Johnson was the mother of the \nmodern environmental movement.\n  With her tireless efforts to beautify the countryside, promote \nconservation and combat roadside litter, Lady Bird Johnson demonstrated \nthe power that each of us has to protect the environment and make our \ncommunities more attractive. Again, we need to embrace her legacy \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S9126]]\n\n  In my home State of Virginia, we have always felt a special \nconnection to Lady Bird Johnson. She was the mother of Lynda Bird Robb, \nwho was the Commonwealth's First Lady from 1982 to 1986, and the \nmother-in-law of Chuck Robb who was Governor at that time and later a \ndistinguished Member of this body.\n  During her frequent trips to our State, Virginians always embraced \nLady Bird Johnson for her warmth, grace, and strength of character. \nThese were the same values for which all Americans held her in such \nhigh esteem.\n  I want to extend to her family and many friends my deepest \nsympathies, as well as my appreciation for her extraordinary life. \nAmerica is a much better Nation because of the life and service of Lady \nBird Johnson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9126-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT ON AL-QAIDA\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, the new intelligence assessment is a \nchilling reminder that the American people are less secure than we were \non 9/11. According to press reports of the assessment, al-Qaida has \nreconstituted, rebuilt its training and command and control \ncapabilities, and is better positioned to strike the West. Meanwhile, \nOsama bin Laden and his top deputy are still on the loose.\n  If America is again attacked, it will be in no small measure a \nconsequence of the Bush administration's failure to destroy al-Qaida at \nits roots in Afghanistan and to adequately secure the homeland. The \ndecision to authorize and fight a misguided war in Iraq also created a \nnew cadre of experienced terrorists bent on the destruction of the \nUnited States and our allies. The recent attacks in Britain are likely \nonly the beginning of an Iraqi ``blowback,'' which may haunt us for \nyears to come. Since we invaded Iraq, the number of Islamic extremist \nterrorist attacks--excluding those in Iraq and Afghanistan--has risen \nby 35 percent worldwide.\n  We cannot win a war against the terrorists if we are on the wrong \nbattlefield. America must urgently begin redeploying from Iraq and take \nthe fight more effectively to the enemy's home by destroying al-Qaida's \nleadership along the Afghan-Pakistan border, eliminating their command \nand control networks, and disrupting their funding. To counter their \nability to rebuild these capabilities, we must convince Pakistan to \npursue an effective strategy, with our assistance, to deny the \nterrorists sanctuary in Pakistan's northwest territories. We must also \nfinish the job and secure Afghanistan, where the Taliban is resurgent.\n  But it will take more than force to defeat this threat. It will take \nwisdom and patience to restore America's credibility in the Muslim \nworld and reduce both passive and active support for extremists. We \nneed to partner with the vast majority of Muslims in their struggle \nagainst those who would distort their religion, create oppressive \ntheocracies, and kill innocents. We must demonstrate through action, \nnot mere words, that America is not at war with Islam, and that we will \nstand with those Muslims who seek a better future.\n  Abu Ghraib served as a recruiting poster for violent Islamic \nextremists. Guantanamo has diminished America's standing in the Muslim \nworld and with our closest allies. The needless violation of our civil \nliberties at home has damaged our moral authority abroad. All these \nactions have undercut our fight against terrorists. This is not \nAmerica, this is not who we are. We must close Guantanamo, renounce \ntorture, and respect the rule of law to be faithful to our own values, \nprosecute the war on terrorism more effectively, and begin to engender \nrenewed admiration for America in the Muslim world. American values and \nliberties must be seen as a source of our strength, not as a liability, \nin the fight against terrorism.\n  Finally, we must take many long-overdue steps to better secure our \nhomeland. We need to lock down loose nuclear material around the world, \nupgrade port, transport and chemical plant security, allocate homeland \nsecurity dollars according to risk, and give local law enforcement the \nresources and intelligence support to help prevent rather than simply \nrespond to terrorist attacks.\n  The administration argues this intelligence assessment proves its \ncase for doing more of the same. On the contrary, the American people \ncannot afford more of the same. This intelligence assessment reminds us \nonce again of the consequences of the decision to authorize and fight \nthe war in Iraq, and to direct our resources away from the wider war on \nterrorism that was yet to be won.

Specialist Workman \nwas killed on June 28 by an improvised explosive device in Baghdad. He \nwas 19 years old.\n  Specialist Workman graduated from Ashland-Greenwood High School in \n2005.

From the time he was a freshman at \nAshland-Greenwood, Specialist Workman's teachers noticed a strong \ndesire to serve in the Army.\n  Specialist Workman enlisted with the Army and served with B Company, \n2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, based \nat Fort Carson, CO. We are proud of Specialist Workman's service to our \ncountry, as well as the thousands of other brave Americans serving in \nIraq.\n  Specialist Workman is survived by his parents Dustin and Valerie, \nyounger brother Korey, and younger sister Krysta.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SPC \nDustin Workman II.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9126-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9126-S9127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GUATEMALA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with the Congress's attention on Iraq and \nthe Middle East, I want to take a moment to alert other Senators to an \nimportant issue in Guatemala, a country that rarely makes the news in \nWashington.\n  Many of us remember the decades of civil conflict that caused the \ndeaths of an estimated 200,000 Guatemalans, many of them indigenous \nMayan civilians. Since those dark days, most Guatemalans have tried to \nput that tragic period behind them and to build the institutions of \ndemocracy that can provide economic development, stability and justice.\n  While the Guatemalan Army has shrunk to half its size, the peace \naccords that ended the fighting have yet to be fully realized. Most \ntroubling is the rampant violent crime, organized crime and corruption, \nmuch of it perpetrated by illegal armed groups, some of which are \ncomprised of former members of the security forces and their \nsupporters.\n  During the tenure of President Berger, the Guatemalan Government, \nwith the assistance of the United Nations, has sought to establish a \ncommission to investigate and prosecute these clandestine groups. The \nfirst attempt was rejected by Guatemala's Constitutional Court, but \nrecently the Court approved the establishment of an International \nCommission against Impunity in Guatemala, CICIG. The CICIG is widely \nregarded as an essential mechanism for combating the cancer of human \nrights violations and organized crime that are threatening to destroy \nthe foundations of Guatemala's democracy.\n  It is important to note that the Constitutional Court confirmed that \nCICIG would work alongside the Attorney-General's office in \ninvestigating illegal groups. Far from weakening national sovereignty, \nCICIG will support Guatemala by helping to strengthen the capacity of \nthe country's weak judicial system.\n\n[[Page S9127]]\n\n  Not only could CICIG go a long way in fulfilling the government's \ncommitment under the peace accords to combat illegal armed groups, it \ncould also help to uncover the full extent of these groups and \ndismantle their underlying structure. Most importantly, it would be an \nunprecedented step in ending the impunity that has been the greatest \nimpediment to establishing the rule of law in Guatemala.\n  At this point, the future of CICIG is in the hands of the Guatemalan \nCongress, and with new elections approaching time is running out. It \nwould be a terrible waste of years of hard work by the Guatemalan \nGovernment and the United Nations if the CICIG is not approved. Whether \nfor prospective foreign investors or the surviving families of victims \nof political violence, nothing is more important than knowing the truth \nand seeing that justice is finally possible.\n  On June 28, the Senate Appropriations Committee, like the House of \nRepresentatives last month, unanimously reported the fiscal year 2008 \nforeign aid appropriations bill. That legislation would authorize the \nresumption of assistance for the Guatemalan Air Force, Navy and Army \nCorps of Engineers, if they are respecting human rights and the \nGuatemalan Congress ratifies the CICIG agreement.\n  I urge the Guatemalan Congress to seize this historic opportunity. \nThe alternative, which is almost unthinkable, of rejecting this \nessential step to uphold the rule of law, would send a chilling message \nthat it is the forces of crime and violence who will determine \nGuatemala's future. That is not an outcome that Guatemala or its people \ncan afford.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9127-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BOB VAN HEUVELEN\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my chief of \nstaff upon his retirement from the U.S. Senate. Robert Van Heuvelen is \nrecognized not only by me, but also by his colleagues and other \nMembers, as a highly respected, effective, and engaging public servant.\n  Mr. Van Heuvelen has had a remarkable career in the Federal \nGovernment, spanning over 32 years. Bob first came to Capitol Hill in \n1975 to work as a legislative assistant for the Honorable Quentin \nBurdick in the Senate. Following that, he served as assistant counsel \nfor the Environment and Public Works Committee for the Honorable Edmund \nMuskie. He remained in Washington and went on to work as a Federal \nprosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice, rising to the position of \ndeputy and acting chief of the Department of Justice's environmental \nenforcement section, and eventually to director of the Office of \nRegulatory Enforcement at the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  For the past 10 years, I have been privileged to have Bob serve on my \nstaff, first as policy director and then as chief of staff. He brought \nwith him extensive experience in Government and his lifelong dedication \nto our home State of North Dakota.\n  During his tenure in my office, some of his most notable \naccomplishments include coordinating disaster relief for the \ndevastating 1997 flood of Grand Forks, spearheading the work of a \ntobacco task force to formulate a strong public health response to the \ntobacco settlements, fighting for a fair Medicare distribution formula \nand estate tax reform. He also made great strides in developing strong \nworking relations with both his Democratic and Republican colleagues. \nBob has helped organize monthly breakfasts, dinners, and policy \nmeetings for chiefs of staff of both parties, fostering a sense of \nbipartisanship, an accomplishment which is truly praiseworthy.\n  Bob is a native of Bismarck, ND. He earned his bachelor's degree at \nMacalester College in Minnesota. Following that, he attended the \nUniversity of Minnesota, where he received his master's degree in \npublic policy, and George Washington University, where he received his \njuris doctor. Today, Bob and his wife of 30 years, Jane Sherburne, live \nin Bethesda, MD. They have three wonderful children--Ben, Elizabeth, \nand Will.\n  As Bob goes forward in his life and on to other endeavors, I hope \nthat he proudly looks back at his time here on Capitol Hill and \nrealizes the tremendous difference he has made for North Dakota, our \nNation, and in the lives of so many people. I am honored to have had \nthe pleasure to work with him and look forward to our ongoing \nfriendship. We have had great fun doing the Nation's business, and I \nwill miss him. I commend Bob for his many achievements and superior \nservice and wish him the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9127-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF VASILIKI CHRISTOPOULOS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I wish to express Kathy's and my \ngreatest admiration and thanks for a person who over the past 14 years \nhas been the heart and soul of my Washington staff. Vasiliki \nAlexopoulos Christopoulos has served as my administrative assistant \nsince February 2001 and before that as my legislative director, \ndirector of appropriations and as a legislative assistant. From her \nfirst days when she began working with us during our 1992 Senate \ncampaign, Kathy and I knew Vas was an extraordinary person.\n  To describe Vas simply as AA does not do her justice--although that \njob is at the center of a well-run and effective Washington office and \nis critical to the success of a Senator. She, rather, has been the \nheartbeat of the office. Her caring, warm, and always positive \npersonality calms the stormy times and has given all of us a shot of \nenergy when we needed a lift. Vas understands that running an office is \nmore than assigning tasks. Under her leadership, it has been about \nbuilding an exceptional team. She always makes sure that when there is \na task to be done, it is not left to one person; rather, everyone jumps \nin with Vas leading the way.\n  Whether it is counseling interns through separation anxieties, \ninterviewing people to join the office, or assisting Kathy, me, and our \nchildren in making sense out of this chaotic lifestyle, Vas has always \norganized, planned, and followed through in a manner that has lead to a \nsuccessful end in a positive way.\n  Walking with Vas to get a cup of coffee is like taking a field trip. \nThis is no police officer, no maintenance staff, no congressional staff \nwho does not know Vas and want to share a story. One quickly learns \nthat everyone in Washington is Greek.\n  Vas could do about anything she wishes, including probably be mayor \nof Nashua, but she has chosen a different course. She is moving from \nthe friendly confines of Washington and Nashua to the cold, barren land \nof Grand Rapids, MI. Michigan, where the summer occurs on July 4, will \nbe the better for this. She will bring her sunny personality which will \ninevitably warm even the chill climate of Michigan.\n  As Vas and her terrific husband Jimmy embark on this new career path \nand challenge, seeking all things Greek, Kathy joins me in thanking her \nfor all her years of dedication to the Gregg family, our office staff, \nand all the people of New Hampshire. We have all greatly benefited from \nher commitment and love. She has been and will remain a part of our \nfamily and although she will be a bit further away, we wish her only \nthe best and say thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9127-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9127-S9128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    HONORING REYNOLDS, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I recognize a community in \nNorth Dakota that will be celebrating its anniversary. On July 27-29, \nthe residents of Reynolds will gather to celebrate their community's \nhistory and founding.\n  Reynolds is a vibrant community located in eastern North Dakota. \nFounded in 1880, years before North Dakota was granted statehood, \nReynolds was named for Dr. Henry A. Reynolds, who served as a surgeon \nin the Civil War and had recently migrated to the area from Maine. \nReynolds, like many other North Dakota communities, was originally \nincorporated with the arrival of the railroad.\n  Reynolds is now, and always has been, a very unique community. The \ncity itself has two churches, two elevators, and is separated by two \ncounties. The number two is very important to the residents of \nReynolds, and celebrating its quasquicentennial 2 years late is, as the \ncommunity says, kind of a ``Reynoldsism.''\n\n[[Page S9128]]\n\n  Today, Reynolds has much to celebrate. Its 125th+2 celebration will \nbe an event worth taking in. Festivities will include a steak fry, \nparade, street fair, alumni baseball game, fireworks, and much more.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Reynolds, ND, and its \nresidents on their first 127 years and in wishing them well in the \nfuture. By honoring Reynolds and all the other historic small towns of \nNorth Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for \nfuture generations. It is places such as Reynolds that have helped to \nshape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine \ncommunity is deserving of our recognition.\n  Reynolds has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9128-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BERNARD WOODARD\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I celebrate the life and \nmourn the recent passing, of a great Texan, Thurmond Bernard Woodard. \nMr. Woodard recently lost a courageous battle with cancer, a foe he had \nbeen battling since 2005.\n  Born on January 9, 1949, in Ocala, FL, Thurmond Woodard learned the \nimportance of family at an early age. His childhood and adolescence \nwere marked by the qualities that would later endear him to all--strong \nwill, strong character, and uncompromising integrity. He went on to \nearn a bachelor's degree in accounting from Hampton University and then \nembarked on a storied career in finance, marketing, sales, and human-\nresources management.\n  In October 2000, Woodard was serving as president and chief operating \nofficer for Roosevelt Thomas Consulting and Training in Atlanta. In \nthat role, he spent his days advising the company on the importance and \nnecessity of integrating diversity within business strategies. \nRecognizing his talent and vision, Austin-based Dell Inc. decided to \ntry and lure him away by offering him the job of vice president for \nglobal diversity and chief ethics, privacy, and compliance officer. \nThankfully for Dell, he accepted the offer and never looked back. He \nheld those positions until his death in April.\n  Known for his dedication to creating cultures of dignity, respect, \nand inclusion, Thurmond promoted the importance of leadership through \ncreating opportunity for all. ``We cannot resist change that is \ninevitable,'' he said. ``We have to get on board and help drive that \nchange.''\n  That eloquence earned him the admiration of his colleagues, including \nDell's chief executive Michael Dell who said, ``His sensible counsel, \ngenerosity of spirit, tireless dedication, and optimism were \nappreciated and admired by all he touched. His passing leaves a void \nimpossible to fill.''\n  That void is seen not only at Dell but also in the many Texas \ncommunities in which he had a profound impact. Even in the difficult \nstages of his illness, he served as deacon and Sunday school teacher at \nthe David Chapel Missionary Baptist Church in downtown Austin. His work \nas a mentor and community activist was recognized last year when the \nAustin Area Urban League honored him with the Whitney M. Young Jr. \nAward for his efforts to promote diversity through the strengthening of \nbusiness and community partnerships.\n  Thurmond's impact could also be seen in our Nation's Capitol, where \nhe served as a board member of the Congressional Black Caucus \nFoundation and was the key architect of the foundation's AVOICE virtual \nlibrary on the history of African Americans in Congress. Other \norganizations that continue to benefit from his efforts and generosity \nin Washington include the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's \nCenter for Latino Leadership and Operation Hope's financial literacy \ncenter in Anacostia.\n  Dell will honor his legacy of outreach by endowing a scholarship in \nhis name for students of color and students from disadvantaged economic \nbackgrounds around the world.\n  Even though he was known for being an incredibly successful \nbusinessman and community leader, Thurmond was known first as an \nincredibly successful family man. A beloved father and husband, he \nleaves behind his wonderful wife of 37 years Suzanne, his children \nMichelynn and Derek, and countless friends. They recall with fondness \nThurmond's love of humor, friendship, and the occasional round of golf.\n  He lived life with vigor, passion, and unwavering optimism. And even \nthough he has been called home to God, Thurmond's selflessness and \ndecency will always serve to guide and inspire us all.\n  Mr. President, please join me in celebrating the life of Thurmond \nBernard Woodard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9128-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF DALE W. SOPPER\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today we recognize a distinguished \nexecutive at the Social Security Administration, Dale W. Sopper. Dale \nis the Deputy Commissioner for Budget, Finance and Management. He is a \ndedicated public servant who has served his country in public service \nfor 42 years.\n  A native of Allentown, PA, he began his Federal career as a claims \ninsurance specialist in the local Social Security Office in Kansas \nCity, MO. After 2 years, he was selected for the Management Intern \nProgram at the then-Department of Health, Education and Welfare. He \nserved in a number of increasingly responsible positions there and in \nthe Department of Health and Human Services over the next 16 years, \nultimately serving as HHS' Assistant Secretary for Management and \nBudget.\n  Dale returned to the Social Security Administration in 1983 as the \nDeputy Associate Commissioner for Management, Budget and Personnel. In \nhis current position as Deputy Commissioner for Budget, Finance and \nManagement, Dale is responsible for providing executive leadership and \ndirection in administering: a comprehensive financial program of budget \npolicy, formulation and execution; accounting policy and operations; \nthe agency's acquisition and grants program; audit resolution and \nliaison; the internal controls program; agencywide facilities and \npublications management programs; and the agency's efforts to improve \nannual wage reporting and wage reconciliation activities. In addition, \nDale serves as SSA's chief financial officer, senior procurement \nexecutive and principal deputy ethics counselor.\n  During Dale's long and distinguished career with both agencies, he \nhas received many awards--of special note, the Presidential Rank Awards \nfor Distinguished Executive and Meritorious Executive, the Donald \nScantlebury Memorial Award, the Elmer Staats Award and the Frank \nGreathouse Distinguished Leadership Award.\n  Dale will retire from the Social Security Administration on August 3, \n2007. He is an exceptional career executive who has consistently \ndemonstrated strength, integrity, diligence and a relentless commitment \nto public service and the well-being of our citizens across the Nation. \nThrough his extraordinary leadership and achievements, he has inspired \ncountless men and women with whom he has worked over these past 42 \nyears.\n  It is important that we in Congress recognize the many men and women \nwho devote their working lives to improve the lives of others. Career \ncivil servants often do their work in quiet anonymity behind the scenes \nproviding vital service to the American people. They are rarely \nrecognized for their important contribution. Dale Sopper is one of \nthose people. His record of leadership at the Social Security \nAdministration and his commitment to providing the American people with \neffective and compassionate service is a record of which he can be \njustly proud.\n  I wish Dale all the best in his retirement from Federal service and \nthank him for his many years of dedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9128-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9128-4", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9128-S9129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S9129]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9128-4", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9128-S9129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S9129]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9129-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   INITIAL ASSESSMENT REPORT RELATIVE TO THE IRAQI BENCHMARKS--PM 20\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 1314 of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' \nCare, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, \n2007 (Public Law 110-28) (the ``Act''), attached is the report that \nassesses the status of each of the 18 Iraqi benchmarks contained in the \nAct and declares whether satisfactory progress toward meeting these \nbenchmarks is, or is not, being achieved.\n  This report has been prepared in consultation with the Secretaries of \nState and Defense; Commander, Multi-National Forces-Iraq; the United \nStates Ambassador to Iraq; and the Commander of United States Central \nCommand.\n                                                      George W.

A resolution adopted by the Council of the City of \n     North Miami of the State of Florida urging Congress to \n     appropriate the funds necessary to bring the Herbert Hoover \n     dike into compliance with current levee protection safety \n     standards; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n       POM-150. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah expressing opposition to the Divine \n     Strake explosive test that is to be conducted in Nevada in \n     2007; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n       Whereas, ``Divine Strake'' is the code name for a large \n     high-explosive test to be conducted by the Defense Threat \n     Reduction Agency;\n       Whereas, the Pentagon has stated the purpose of the test is \n     to ``determine the potential for future non-nuclear \n     concepts,'' such as high-energy weapons or the simultaneous \n     use of multiple conventional bombs to destroy deeply buried \n     and fortified military targets, as an alternative to \n     detonating a nuclear device;\n       Whereas, the test was originally planned to take place June \n     2, 2006 at the site of an existing underground tunnel in the \n     United States Department of Energy Nevada Test Site, but was \n     postponed several times due to legal action, then later \n     delayed until 2007;\n       Whereas, the test is scheduled to utilize 700 tons of an \n     ammonium nitrate combined with fuel oil explosive, which is \n     equivalent to 593 tons of TNT;\n       Whereas, there is concern that the explosion could stir up \n     nuclear particles, left from previous tests conducted decades \n     earlier at the Nevada test site, into the atmosphere;\n       Whereas, in December 2006, the revision to the \n     Environmental Assessment was released, and although the study \n     concluded that there are no health risks to persons outside \n     the blast area, it stated, ``Since suspended natural \n     radionuclides and resuspended fallout radionuclides from the \n     detonation have potential to be transported off of the NTS by \n     wind, they may contribute a radiological dose to the \n     public'';\n       Whereas, on January 22, 2006, the Washington County \n     Commission issued a statement opposing the federal \n     government's plan to conduct the test which reads in part, \n     ``The City of St. George has a unique history due to its \n     proximity to the Nevada Nuclear Test Site during the atomic \n     age. . . thousands of early deaths of those living in \n     southern Utah and the surrounding areas have been attributed \n     to nuclear testing during the 1950s and 1960s at the site. \n     Many St. George residents and others have suffered \n     incalculable loss as a result of radioactive fallout exposure \n     from the detonations at the site'';\n       Whereas, the Commission added, ``To assure the safety and \n     well-being of our citizenry, these concerns must be carefully \n     studied and evaluated before a decision is made to proceed \n     with the proposed detonation''; and\n       Whereas, much more needs to be done to assure that there is \n     never a repeat of the immense suffering endured by citizens \n     of Utah and nearby states due to the nuclear fallout from \n     past tests at the Nevada Test Site. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, express opposition to the Divine \n     Strake high-explosive test to be conducted by the Defense \n     Threat Reduction Agency at the United States Department of \n     Energy Nevada Test Site in 2007. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the United States Department \n     of Defense, the United States Department of Energy Nevada \n     Test Site, the Washington County Commission, and to the \n     members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-151. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     enact H.R. 1619 or S. 587 to direct the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to mint coins to commemorate the Ford Model T; to \n     the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 78\n\n       Whereas, Michigan's integral role as the heart of the \n     automobile industry in our country and around the world is \n     well established. Nearly 100 years ago, an especially \n     meaningful chapter in this long history began with the \n     opening of the Highland Park Ford Plant that is acknowledged \n     to be the birthplace of the assembly line. In addition, the \n     more than 15 million Model T Fords that were built between \n     1908 and 1927 reshaped the American landscape and our way of \n     life; and\n       Whereas, The new age in manufacturing that was born in \n     Michigan and the Model T Ford set in motion changes in how \n     Americans live and how people travel around the world. The \n     rise in the American middle class, the ability to prevail in \n     defense of our nation in world wars, and subsequent \n     technological advances all can be traced in significant \n     measure to the automobile industry that began with the vision \n     and hard work of the pioneer mechanics in Michigan; and\n       Whereas, Congress has before it legislation that would \n     require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint not more than \n     500,000 coins to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the \n     Model T Ford automobile. Under this legislation, these dollar \n     coins, which would be public tender, would be comprised of 90 \n     percent silver and 10 percent copper. The legislation also \n     provides that the money raised by a surcharge above the face \n     value would be distributed to the Motor Cities National \n     Heritage Area through the Automobile National Heritage \n     Partnership and to the Edison Institute. This money would \n     create endowments to support the celebration of the Model T \n     and the preservation of its story through educational \n     programs and displays; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact H.R. \n     1619 or S. 587, to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     mint coins to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Model \n     T Ford; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-152. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of Tennessee urging Congress to address the economic \n     impact of interchange fees and merchant discount charges and \n     develop clear and concise disclosure to consumers and \n     retailers; to the Committee on Banking,Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 361\n\n       Whereas, consumers are increasingly using credit and debit \n     cards and other electronic transactions to make purchases, \n     and the number of credit and debit card transactions each \n     year now exceeds the number of check transactions; and\n       Whereas, payment system networks and technology provide \n     significant economic benefits to merchants and consumers; and\n\n[[Page S9130]]\n\n       Whereas, merchants and retailers pay merchant discount \n     fees, including interchange fees, to access payment system \n     networks for credit and debit transactions; and\n       Whereas, the fees, policies, and practices of credit card \n     organizations have social and economic consequences for \n     merchants and consumers; and\n       Whereas, interchange costs have risen dramatically in \n     recent years and the number of transactions involving \n     interchange fees has grown in volume in recent years due to \n     consumer preference to use credit and debit cards and the \n     expansions in technology facilitating the use of credit card \n     systems; and\n       Whereas, American consumers and retailers pay the highest \n     credit card fees in the world, with rates averaging close to \n     2 percent and debit card fees averaging close to 1 percent; \n     and\n       Whereas, merchants are required to pay merchant discount \n     fees, including interchange fees, to banks to access credit \n     and debit card payment system networks; and\n       Whereas, interchange fees are ultimately passed on to \n     consumers, including those who pay by cash or check, in the \n     form of higher prices; and\n       Whereas, it is advantageous to have competitive economic \n     models that assure a highly competitive marketplace; and\n       Whereas, with more and more consumers using electronic \n     payment methods, the United States Congress needs to assure a \n     highly competitive and vibrant market that promotes an \n     economic playing field that is fair to consumers, merchants, \n     and card providers alike. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred Fifth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, that this General Assembly hereby \n     urges the Congress of the United States of America to act \n     expeditiously to address the economic impact of interchange \n     fees and other merchant discount fees and develop clear and \n     concise disclosure to consumers and retailers. Be it further\n       Resolved, That this General Assembly strongly urges each \n     member of the Tennessee congressional delegation to utilize \n     the full measure of his or her influence to assess the \n     economic impact of interchange fees and other merchant \n     discount fees. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives is directed to transmit a certified copy of \n     this resolution to the President and the Secretary of the \n     United States Senate; the Speaker and the Clerk of the United \n     States House of Representatives; and to each member of the \n     Tennessee congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-153. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Pennsylvania urging Congress \n     to provide equitable funding to the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development for the operation of quality affordable \n     housing; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 292\n\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania's public housing authorities are \n     essential in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania is home to 90 public housing \n     authorities serving an estimated 245,819 residents of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania's public housing authorities provide \n     high-quality affordable housing to the residents in the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through the use of Federal \n     resources and programs; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania's public housing authorities have \n     successfully assisted residents of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania with moving to work programs and \n     preapprenticeship training, resulting in greater self-\n     sufficiency and a reduced burden on Commonwealth resources; \n     and\n       Whereas, developments built by Pennsylvania's public \n     housing authorities have in some instances increased the \n     values of neighboring properties and communities in the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by 142%; and\n       Whereas, new funding guidelines developed by the United \n     States Department of Housing and Urban Development have \n     resulted in reduced funding for the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania, its public housing authorities and the \n     Pennsylvanians who rely on these services; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania's public housing authorities are a \n     major employer in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and \n     funding cuts from the United States Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development have resulted in drastic layoffs and \n     diminished services to the residents of public housing; \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania recognize the importance of the \n     quality services, support and housing provided by \n     Pennsylvania's public housing authorities and respectfully \n     urge the Congress to provide equitable funding to the United \n     States Department of Housing and Urban Development for the \n     operation of quality affordable housing; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-154. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah expressing support for acquiring a \n     second airport surveillance radar facility for the Salt Lake \n     International Airport; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, Salt Lake City International Airport (SLCIA) is \n     one of the nation's primary hub airports, is the second \n     largest hub airport for Delta Air Lines and processed over \n     455,000 aircraft operations during 2005 making it the 18th \n     busiest airport in the world, and conservative forecasts \n     project operations to grow to over 634,000 operations by \n     2025;\n       Whereas, the Provo Airport is the second busiest airport in \n     Utah with over 175,000 operations a year and was recently \n     designated as the primary reliever to SLCIA by major \n     commercial airlines including Delta, Frontier, and Southwest, \n     a designation that significantly increases the demand on \n     Provo Airport;\n       Whereas, the Salt Lake City Terminal/TRACON (terminal radar \n     approach control) facility has responsibility for \n     coordinating the safe and efficient movement of aircraft \n     within the regional airspace but experiences important \n     limitations in the regulation of aircraft using the Provo \n     Airport and airports in surrounding communities;\n       Whereas, coordinating air traffic activity within the \n     region is complicated significantly because the mountainous \n     terrain along the Wasatch Front creates a sizeable radar \n     shadow which prevents air traffic controllers from seeing \n     aircraft below 8,000 feet, above ground level, in Utah \n     Valley, while aircraft operating below 500 feet, above ground \n     level, at the Salt Lake City Airport II cannot be seen;\n       Whereas, aircraft arriving or departing the Provo Airport \n     and surrounding airports regularly interact with commercial \n     aircraft using SLCIA; when aircraft operating at these \n     airports request entry into SLCIA airspace, air traffic \n     controllers are not able to determine the precise location of \n     the aircraft due to lack of radar coverage; the slower speeds \n     of these aircraft combined with airspace congestion can \n     present safety concerns for commercial airline operations as \n     well as for general aviation;\n       Whereas, the lack of ASR-11 (automated surveillance radar) \n     at Provo Airport causes significant delays to take-off and \n     landing operations during poor weather conditions, resulting \n     in a real and significant threat to air safety;\n       Whereas, there is no backup radar equipment to provide \n     continuous radar coverage to the surface when existing radar \n     becomes inoperable, and the volume of activity generated by \n     the Delta Air Line hub is closely linked to the efficiency of \n     the entire national air transportation system;\n       Whereas, ASR-11 would provide essential redundancy to \n     assure that adequate safety is maintained at all times; and\n       Whereas, the radar shadow and the limitations it creates \n     can be corrected by installing a second ASR-11 facility that \n     would be fully integrated with the existing radar at SLCIA \n     and would be optimally located at the Point of the Mountain, \n     providing major safety and efficiency benefits to all of the \n     airports previously mentioned: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, support the critical need to \n     acquire ASR-11 (automated surveillance radar) to provide \n     radar redundancy for the Sale Lake City International \n     Airport, and to achieve full radar coverage for Provo Airport \n     and other general aviation airports. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor request \n     that Utah's Congressional Delegation seek the appropriation \n     of funds in the 2008 FAA Facilities and Equipment budget \n     needed to acquire ASR-11, as well as to finalize site \n     selection and to acquire property to the extent needed for \n     the installation of the system. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     city of Provo, the Provo Airport, Delta Air Lines, Frontier \n     Air Lines, Southwest Air Lines, and to the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-155. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging Congress to take action to help \n     stop children and employees from accessing Internet \n     pornography; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, the Internet has become an extremely important and \n     popular means of exchanging information, and is relied upon \n     in Utah for business, education, recreation, and other uses;\n       Whereas, many Internet sites contain material that is \n     pornographic, either obscene or inappropriate for children, \n     and a majority of these sites originate within the United \n     States but outside of the state of Utah;\n       Whereas, the availability of Internet pornography on the \n     job costs Utah employers significant numbers of work hours, \n     strains employers' computer equipment, reduces productivity, \n     and leads to potentially hostile work environments for men \n     and women;\n       Whereas, while the custody, care, and nurturing of children \n     resides primarily with parents, the widespread availability \n     of Internet pornography and the ability of children to \n     circumvent existing filtering technology defeat the best \n     attempts at parental supervision or control;\n       Whereas, Internet pornographers use evolving techniques to \n     lure Utah children and others into viewing and purchasing \n     pornographic material, defying existing technology designed \n     to block adult content;\n\n[[Page S9131]]\n\n       Whereas, current methods for protecting computers and \n     computer networks from unwanted Internet content are \n     expensive, block more than the intended content, and are \n     easily circumvented;\n       Whereas, because children, employees, and others may seek \n     out pornography, warnings and other labels meant to help \n     avoid inadvertent hits on pornographic sites may simply \n     increase the likelihood that these sites will be visited;\n       Whereas, credit card verification systems burden credit \n     card companies, are expensive and time consuming to establish \n     and maintain, and inhibit legal speech;\n       Whereas, other forms of age verification have not been \n     practicable;\n       Whereas, prior Congressional attempts to address children's \n     access to Internet pronography have been held \n     unconstitutional or otherwise have not passed constitutional \n     scrutiny;\n       Whereas, prior Congressional attempts to address children's \n     access to Internet pornography have not been based on \n     technology that allows individual Internet users to select \n     what kind of Internet content enters their homes and work \n     spaces;\n       Whereas, protecting the physical and psychological well-\n     being of Utah's children by shielding them from inappropriate \n     materials is a compelling interest of the Legislature of the \n     State of Utah;\n       Whereas, protecting the right of Utah's citizens to control \n     what materials enter their homes and other private property \n     is a compelling interest of the Legislature of the State of \n     Utah;\n       Whereas, although the State of Utah has taken rigorous \n     action in an attempt to shield Utah's children from obscenity \n     and other inappropriate adult content, it cannot effectively \n     curb the problems with Internet pornography within its \n     borders without the support of the United States government;\n       Whereas, the United States remains in control of the \n     Internet through the Department of Commerce, and the National \n     Telecommunication and Information Association; and\n       Whereas, the United States has the ability to create \n     appropriate policies and enforcement tools to effectively \n     deal with these issues: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, strongly urges the United States \n     Congress to take action to help stop children and employees \n     from accessing Internet pornography; be it further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature and the Governor strongly \n     urge the United States Congress to seriously consider \n     enacting legislation to facilitate a technology-based \n     solution that allows parents and employers to subscribe to \n     Internet access services that exclude adult content; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the President of \n     the United States, and the members of Utah's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-156. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     encourage expansion of existing or the construction of new \n     petroleum refineries to meet increasing energy needs; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 121\n\n       Whereas, The price of petroleum products has been \n     unpredictable. Between December 2006 and the end of February \n     2007, the price of crude oil fluctuated between 62 dollars a \n     barrel and 50 dollars several times. Currently, the world \n     crude oil price exceeds 66 dollars a barrel. Recently, oil \n     futures leapt above 72 dollars a barrel on the New York \n     Mercantile Exchange due to shrinking gasoline supplies and \n     international tensions. Increased refinery capacity would \n     buffer the United States from some of the more volatile price \n     swings that occur during periods of global conflict and which \n     are often outside of our national control; and\n       Whereas, There has not been a new oil refinery built in the \n     United States in nearly 30 years. Yet, in the intervening \n     years, the total energy demand in the United States has grown \n     by about 40 percent. According to the United States Energy \n     Information Administration, the projected petroleum demand \n     between 2003 and 2025 will increase by 30 percent. We must \n     plan for our future energy needs by incorporating new \n     petroleum refineries into the overall energy policy of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, Recent major investments in the Marathon Refinery \n     located in the city of Detroit, Michigan's only refinery, \n     will increase the output by about 28 percent, from 74,000 \n     barrels per day to over 102,000 barrels per day. Marathon's \n     investment of $300 million was made possible through the \n     collaborative efforts of Marathon, the city of Detroit, and \n     the state of Michigan. Marathon's commitment to Michigan and \n     its collaboration with the city and state to create a \n     renaissance zone encompassing the refinery illustrates the \n     type of creative solutions that can be used to promote \n     increased capacity or the construction of new refineries; and\n       Whereas, Constructing new refineries or expanding current \n     facilities would also create new jobs and increase gasoline, \n     fuels, and distillate output--all vital components of \n     strengthening our economy, Michigan is well placed to locate \n     a new refinery due to our proximity with Canada, this \n     country's largest source of imported petroleum. Moreover, \n     Michigan's highly skilled labor force could adapt to \n     employment in the refinery industry; now, therefore, be it\n        Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to establish a \n     national energy policy that promotes the expansion of \n     existing or construction of new petroleum refineries in the \n     United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Department \n     of Energy, the American Petroleum Institute, and the American \n     Petroleum Industries of Michigan.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-157. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Louisiana urging Congress to pass the Non-Market Economy \n     Trade Remedy Act of 2007; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 119\n\n       Whereas, H.R. 1229, the ``Non-Market Economy Trade Remedy \n     Act of 2007,'' will ensure that the United States \n     countervailing duty law applies to imports from non-market \n     economies; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of the countervailing duty law is to \n     offset any unfair competitive advantage that foreign \n     manufacturers or exporters have as a result of subsidies; and\n       Whereas, manufacturing is a vital part of the American \n     economy; and\n       Whereas, each American manufacturing job results in the \n     creation of approximately four additional jobs; and\n       Whereas, since 1997, Louisiana has lost over thirty-nine \n     thousand manufacturing jobs due to unfair trade practices; \n     and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's coastal area is home to some of the \n     nation's premiere commercial fisheries, accounting for 30% of \n     the commercial fisheries production of the lower 48 states; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana seafood industry provides an annual \n     economic impact of approximately two billion eight hundred \n     million dollars and over thirty-one thousand jobs; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana seafood industry has lost over \n     eleven thousand jobs and millions of dollars due to illegally \n     subsidized seafood imports and dumping from foreign nations; \n     and\n       Whereas, industries that once were the pride of their \n     communities and employed generations of the same family have \n     been shut down resulting from jobs being shifted to foreign \n     nations where labor is cheap and environmental standards are \n     not enforced; and\n       Whereas, billions of dollars in wages and millions of jobs \n     are expected to move from the United States to low-cost \n     nations by 2015; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 1229, the ``Non-Market Economy Trade Remedy \n     Act of 2007,'' is being considered in Congress to correct the \n     longstanding inequity of trade law, and requires the \n     Department of Commerce to take action in countervailing duty \n     cases in support of American businesses:\n       Now therefore, be it Resolved, that the Senate of the \n     Legislature of Louisiana memorializes the Congress of the \n     United States to vote in favor of H.R. 1229, the ``Non-Market \n     Economy Trade Remedy Act of 2007.'' and; be it further \n     Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution shall be transmitted \n     to the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each member \n     of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress.\n       POM-158.

The \n     United States already has a massive trade deficit with South \n     Korea, with a large portion of that deficit in automobiles \n     and automobile parts; and\n       Whereas, the agreement will jeopardize thousands of \n     automobile jobs because it opens the United States automobile \n     market further while failing to address the barriers to the \n     sale of United States automobiles in South Korea; and\n       Whereas, the United States Trade Representative rejected a \n     very sensible proposal put forward by a bipartisan group of \n     members of Congress to tie any opening of the United States \n     automobile market to concrete benchmarks in United States \n     sales in Korea. Until such benchmarks are set, we do not have \n     confidence that the South Korea Free Trade Agreement is in \n     the best interests of the United States: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n\n[[Page S9132]]\n\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the United States \n     Congress to oppose the South Korea Free Trade Agreement; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-159.

Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and Governor urge that the \n     legislation include increased and effective verification \n     requirements by companies, accompanied by the tools and \n     resources necessary to adequately verify whether or not a \n     Social Security number is fraudulent, and increased penalties \n     for individuals who intentionally use fraudulent Social \n     Security numbers to obtain employment, avoid child support \n     obligations, or for other personal gain. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge that \n     the legislation include increased penalties for companies who \n     repeatedly report wages on employees with fraudulent Social \n     Security numbers.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging support for Taiwan's \n     participation in the World Health Organization; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Constitution \n     states that ``The objective of the World Health Organization \n     shall be the attainment by all peoples of the highest \n     possible level of health'';\n       Whereas, this position demonstrates that the WHO is \n     obligated to reach all peoples throughout the world, \n     regardless of state or national boundaries;\n       Whereas, the WHO Constitution permits a wide variety of \n     entities, including nonmember states, international \n     organizations, national organizations, and nongovernmental \n     organizations, to participate in the activities of the WHO;\n       Whereas, five entities, for example, have acquired the \n     status of observer of the World Health Assembly (WHA) and are \n     routinely invited to its assemblies;\n       Whereas, both the WHO Constitution and the International \n     Covenant of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights declare \n     that health is an essential element of human rights and that \n     no signatory shall impede on the health rights of others;\n       Whereas, Taiwan seeks to be invited to participate in the \n     work of the WHA simply as an observer, instead of as a full \n     member, in order to allow the work of the WHO to proceed \n     without creating political frictions and to demonstrate \n     Taiwan's willingness to put aside political controversies for \n     the common good of global health;\n       Whereas, this request is fundamentally based on \n     professional health grounds and has nothing to do with the \n     political issues of sovereignty and statehood;\n       Whereas, Taiwan currently participates as a full member in \n     organizations like the World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific \n     Economic Cooperation, and several other international \n     organizations that count the People's Republic of China among \n     their membership;\n       Whereas, Taiwan has become an asset to all these \n     institutions because of a flexible interpretation of the \n     terms of membership;\n       Whereas, closing the gap between the WHO and Taiwan is an \n     urgent global health imperative;\n       Whereas, the health administration of Taiwan is the only \n     competent body possessing and managing all the information on \n     any outbreak in Taiwan of epidemics that could potentially \n     threaten global health;\n       Whereas, excluding Taiwan from the WHO's Global Outbreak \n     Alert and Response, Network, for example, is dangerous and \n     self defeating from a professional perspective;\n       Whereas, good health is a basic right for every citizen of \n     the world and access to the highest standard of health \n     information and services is necessary to help guarantee this \n     right;\n       Whereas, direct and unobstructed participation in \n     international health cooperation forums and programs is \n     therefore crucial, especially with today's greater potential \n     for the cross-border spread of various infectious diseases \n     through increased trade and travel;\n       Whereas, the WHO sets forth in the first chapter of its \n     charter the objectives of attaining the highest possible \n     level of health for all people;\n       Whereas, Taiwan's population of 23 million people is larger \n     than that of three quarters of the member states already in \n     the WHO and shares the noble goals of the organization;\n       Whereas, Taiwan's achievements in the field of health are \n     substantial, including one of the highest life expectancy \n     levels in Asia, maternal and infant mortality rates \n     comparable to those in western countries, the eradication of \n     such infectious diseases as cholera, smallpox, and the \n     plague, and the first country in the world to provide \n     children with free hepatitis B vaccinations;\n       Whereas, Taiwan is not allowed to participate in any WHO-\n     organized forums and workshops concerning the latest \n     technologies in the diagnosis, monitoring, and control of \n     diseases;\n       Whereas, in recent years, both the Taiwanese Government and \n     individual Taiwanese experts have expressed a willingness to \n     assist financially or technically in WHO-supported \n     international aid and health activities, but have ultimately \n     been unable to render assistance;\n       Whereas, the WHO does allow observers to participate in the \n     activities of the organization; and\n       Whereas, in light of all the benefits that participation \n     could bring to the state of health of people not only in \n     Taiwan, but also regionally and globally, it seems \n     appropriate, if not imperative, for Taiwan to be involved \n     with the WHO: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, urges the Bush Administration to \n     support Taiwan and its 23 million people in obtaining \n     appropriate and meaningful participation in the World Health \n     Organization. Be it further resolved that the Legislature and \n     the Governor urges that United States' policy should include \n     the pursuit of some initiative in the World Health \n     Organization which would give Taiwan meaningful participation \n     in a manner that is consistent with the organization's \n     requirements. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the United States Secretary \n     of State, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \n     majority leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation, the Government of Taiwan, \n     and the World Health Organization.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-162.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Utah urging Congress to \n     suspend or repeal the REAL ID Act; to the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                         House Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas the implementation of the REAL ID Act intrudes upon \n     the states' sovereign power to determine their own policies \n     for identification, licensure, and credentialing of \n     individuals residing therein;\n       Whereas one page of the 428 page 9/11 Commission report \n     that did not give consideration to identification issues, \n     prompted Congress to pass the legislation which created the \n     REAL ID Act, ignoring states' sovereignty and their right to \n     self-governance;\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act converts the state driver licensing \n     function into federal law enforcement and national security \n     functions that are outside the purpose and core competency of \n     driver licensing bureaus;\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act constitutes an unfunded mandate by \n     the federal government to the states;\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act requires states to confirm their \n     processes of issuing driver licenses and identification cards \n     to federal standards by May 2008;\n       Whereas the National Governor's Association, National \n     Conference of State Legislatures, and American Association of \n     Motor Vehicle Administrators predict state compliance with \n     the REAL ID Act provisions will require all of the estimated \n     245 million current driver license and identification card \n     holders in the United States to renew their current identity \n     documents in person by producing three or four identity \n     documents, thereby increasing processing time and doubling \n     wait time at licensing centers;\n       Whereas identification-based security provides only limited \n     security benefits because it can be avoided by defrauding or \n     corrupting card issuers and because it gives no protection \n     against people not already known to be planning or committing \n     wrongful acts;\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act will cost the states over $11 \n     billion to implement according to a recent survey of 47 state \n     licensing authorities conducted by the National Governor's \n     Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, \n     and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators;\n       Whereas the use of identification-based security cannot be \n     justified as part of a ``layered'' security system if the \n     costs of the identification ``layer''--in dollars, lost \n     privacy, and lost liberty--are greater than the security \n     identification provides;\n       Whereas the ``common machine-readable technology'' required \n     by the REAL ID Act would convert state-issued driver licenses \n     and identification cards into tracking devices, allowing \n     computers to note and record people's whereabouts each time \n     they are identified;\n       Whereas a more secure and flexible system of verifying \n     identity may be achieved by less intrusive means to the \n     individual and to states by employing the free market and \n     private sector ingenuity;\n       Whereas the requirement that states maintain databases of \n     information about their citizens and residents and then share \n     this personal information with all other states will expose \n     every state to the information security weaknesses of every \n     other state and threaten the privacy of every American;\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act wrongly coerces states into doing \n     the federal government's bidding by threatening to refuse \n     noncomplying states' citizens the privileges and immunities \n     enjoyed by other states' citizens;\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act threatens the privacy and liberty \n     of those individuals belonging to unpopular or minority \n     groups, including racial and cultural organizations, firearm \n     owners and collectors, faith-based and religious affiliates, \n     political parties, and social movements;\n       Whereas Congress passed the REAL ID Act without a single \n     hearing in either house and without an up-or-down vote in \n     either house;\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act thus imposes a national \n     identification system through the states, premised upon the \n     threat to national security, but without the benefit of \n     public debate and discourse; and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act is determined by the Utah State \n     House of Representatives to be in opposition to the \n     Jeffersonian principles of individual liberty, free markets,\n\n[[Page S9134]]\n\n     and limited government: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Utah House of Representatives urges the \n     United States Congress and the United States Department of \n     Homeland Security to suspend implementation of the REAL ID \n     Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the REAL ID Act should be repealed outright \n     by the United States Congress to avoid the significant \n     problems it currently poses to state sovereignty, individual \n     liberty, and limited government; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, and the members \n     of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-165. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Tennessee opposing the implementation of the \n     REAL 10 Act of 2005; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 248\n\n       Whereas the State of Tennessee recognizes the Constitution \n     of the United States as our charter of liberty and the Bill \n     of Rights as affirming the fundamental and inalienable rights \n     of Americans, including freedom of privacy and freedom from \n     unreasonable searches; and\n       Whereas the people of Tennessee recognize that the \n     Constitution of the State of Tennessee affords even greater \n     privacy rights for her citizens than those provided by the \n     Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas Tennessee has a diverse population whose \n     contributions are vital to the state's economy, culture and \n     civic character; and\n       Whereas Tennessee is proud of her tradition of protecting \n     the civil rights and liberties of all her residents, \n     affirming the fundamental rights of all people, and providing \n     more expansive protections than are granted by the \n     Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas the federal REAL 1D Act of 2005, Public Law 109-12, \n     creates a national identification card by mandating federal \n     standards for state driver's licenses and identification \n     cards and requires states to share their motor vehicle \n     databases; and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act mandates the documents that states \n     must require to issue driver's licenses and requires states \n     to place uniform information on every driver's license in a \n     standard, machine-readable format; and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act prohibits federal agencies and \n     federally regulated commercial aircraft from accepting a \n     driver's license or identification card issued by a state \n     that has not fully complied with the act; and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act places a costly, unfunded mandate \n     on states, with initial estimates for Tennessee of more than \n     one hundred million dollars, plus the additional burden of \n     millions of taxpayers' dollars in ongoing annual expenses, \n     and a national estimate of more than eleven billion dollars \n     over the five years following its implementation; and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act requires the creation of a massive \n     public sector database containing information on every \n     American that is accessible to all motor vehicle employees \n     and law enforcement officers nationwide and that can be used \n     to gather and manage information on citizens. Such activities \n     are not the business or responsibility of government; and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act enables the creation of additional \n     massive private sector databases, combining both \n     transactional information and driver's license information \n     gained from scanning the machine-readable information \n     contained on every driver's license; and\n       Whereas these public and private databases are likely to \n     contain numerous errors and false information, creating \n     significant hardship for Americans attempting to verify their \n     identities in order to travel on commercial aircraft, open a \n     bank account, or perform any of the numerous functions \n     required to live in the United States today; and\n       Whereas the Federal Trade Commission estimates that ten \n     million Americans are victims of identify theft annually, and \n     because identity thieves are increasingly targeting motor \n     vehicle departments, the REAL ID Act will enable the crime of \n     identity theft by making the personal information of all \n     Americans, including date of birth and signature, accessible \n     from tens of thousands of locations; and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act requires a driver's license to \n     contain a person's actual home address and makes no exception \n     for individuals in potential danger, such as undercover law \n     enforcement personnel or victims of stalking or criminal \n     harassment; and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act contains onerous record \n     verification and retention provisions that place unreasonable \n     burdens on state motor vehicle divisions and on third parties \n     required to verify records; and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act will place enormous burdens on \n     citizens seeking new driver's licenses, such as longer lines, \n     increased document requests, higher costs, and a waiting \n     period; and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act will place state motor vehicle \n     staff on the front lines of immigration enforcement by \n     forcing state employees to determine federal citizenship and \n     immigration status, excessively burdening both foreign-born \n     applicants and motor vehicle staff; and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act passed without sufficient \n     deliberation by Congress and did not receive a hearing by any \n     congressional committee or a vote solely on its own merits, \n     despite opposition from more than six hundred organizations; \n     and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act eliminated a process of negotiated \n     rulemaking initiated under the Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which had convened federal, \n     state and local policymakers, privacy advocates, and industry \n     experts to solve the problem of the misuse of identity \n     documents; and\n       Whereas the REAL ID Act provides little security benefit \n     and leaves identification systems open to insider fraud, \n     counterfeit documentation, and database failures; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the Senate of the one hundred fifth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, that we support the government of \n     the United States in its campaign to secure our country, \n     while affirming the commitment that this campaign not be \n     waged at the expense of the essential rights and liberties of \n     the citizens of this country, nor by placing the added burden \n     of a costly mandate upon the taxpayers of each state; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That it is the policy of the State of Tennessee \n     to oppose any portion of the REAL ID Act that violates the \n     rights and liberties guaranteed under the constitutions of \n     the State of Tennessee and the United States, including the \n     Declaration of Rights and the Bill of Rights; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Tennessee General Assembly urges the \n     Tennessee congressional delegation to support measures to \n     repeal the REAL ID Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That there be no implementation of the REAL ID \n     Act of 2005, unless and until funding for the additional cost \n     associated with same is furnished by the United States \n     government; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Senate be hereby \n     authorized and directed to forward a certified copy of this \n     resolution to the President of the United States, George W. \n     Bush, the United States Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales, \n     the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives of Congress, and the congressional delegation \n     representing the State of Tennessee in the Congress of the \n     United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-166. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the approval \n     of the placement of a statue of President Gerald R. Ford in \n     the United States Capitol; to the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 148\n\n       Whereas each state is permitted to have two statues of \n     prominent citizens on display in our nation's capitol as part \n     of the National Statuary Hall Collection, which was created \n     by federal law in 1864. This collection is a strong reminder \n     of the heritage we share and the exceptional men and women \n     who have helped shape our nation. Michigan's two statues are \n     of Lewis Cass and Zachariah Chandler, leaders who played \n     pivotal roles in the history of our state and nation; and\n       Whereas the federal law governing the National Statuary \n     Hall Collection also provides a procedure for states to \n     replace an existing statue with a new one. This reflects the \n     continuing growth and development of our country. With the \n     recent passing of Gerald R. Ford, Michigan's only president \n     and a man who devoted his entire life to the service of our \n     state and nation, the people of Michigan wish to acknowledge \n     this native son and commence the process of placing a statue \n     of him in the National Statuary Hall Collection; and\n       Whereas under the established guidelines, the legislature \n     must adopt a resolution to express formally its support for \n     the statue of the person to be honored and to request the \n     Joint Committee on the Library of Congress to approve the \n     placement of the statue. The governor must also express \n     support; and\n       Whereas under the procedures that govern the replacement of \n     a statue in the collection, the resolution requesting the \n     Joint Committee on the Library of Congress must identify the \n     entity that will select the sculptor and pay for all aspects \n     of the process; and\n       Whereas relocating the statue of Zachariah Chandler to \n     Michigan would allow many more Michigan citizens, including \n     young people, to learn more of the life of this exceptional \n     man and his contributions to our state; and\n       Whereas Gerald Ford's life of honesty, integrity, and \n     service constitutes one of Michigan's most important \n     contributions to our nation. As a veteran of World War II and \n     Grand Rapids congressman for a quarter century, Gerald Ford, \n     a man of abiding principle and a strong sense of duty, came \n     to the highest office in our land under most difficult \n     circumstances. As the 38th president, Gerald Ford took the \n     oath of office as our country faced a crisis in confidence. \n     Acting with little regard for political expediency, President \n     Ford helped the country heal through his own honesty and \n     trustworthiness. These qualities, long known by the people of \n     Grand Rapids and his colleagues in Congress, left a legacy \n     that stands strong; and\n       Whereas the Gerald R. Ford Foundation is committed to the \n     effort to add an image of President Ford to the National \n     Statuary Hall Collection. The Gerald R. Ford Foundation has \n     agreed to serve as the body selecting a sculptor and to fund \n     all of the costs associated with the placement of the new \n     statue and the relocation of the statue of Zachariah Chandler \n     to Michigan; Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S9135]]\n\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we request \n     the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress to approve the \n     placement of a statue of President Gerald R. Ford as part of \n     the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States \n     Capitol and to authorize the removal of the statue of \n     Zachariah Chandler and its relocation to Michigan; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the Joint Committee \n     on the Library of Congress, the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation, the Office of the Governor, and the \n     Gerald R. Ford Foundation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-167. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     enact legislation to improve the health programs available to \n     veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 53\n\n       Whereas, providing medical care for the men and women who \n     risk their lives in defense of our nation is a most important \n     responsibility. While this is always true, the significance \n     of this task should be eminently clear as our armed forces \n     are engaged in battle; and\n       Whereas, funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs is \n     determined each year by the Congress as part of discretionary \n     spending. This budget is seriously under funded each year. \n     This chronic under funding has a direct impact on the level \n     of services available to our injured veterans. Currently, \n     nearly 90 percent of federal health care spending is carried \n     out through direct, rather than discretionary funding; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Veterans Affairs has the \n     nation's largest health care system, with more than 150 \n     hospitals, hundreds of clinics, nursing homes, residential \n     rehabilitation treatment programs, and specialized services \n     to deal with the most horrific and widest range of injuries. \n     Recent rises in demand for health care services have far \n     outpaced spending; and\n       Whereas, the American people owe our returning veterans \n     proper health care services to address the injuries they \n     sustain in defense of our freedoms. Quality health care for \n     those injured in service to the country should not be subject \n     to the annual fluctuations of a budget process that is often \n     held hostage to politics. Clearly, the care of our wounded \n     must be a top priority; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to increase funding for veterans health programs \n     and to reform budget practices to assure that veterans health \n     care needs are addressed by direct rather than discretionary \n     funding; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9135-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n       S. 1772.

 By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1773. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nregulate payroll tax deposit agents; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Payroll Protection Act of 2007. This crucial legislation will \nprotect small businesses from payroll tax fraud and provide them with \ngreater security when working with IRS registered payroll service \nproviders.\n  By way of background, let me say that in the fall of 2003, small \nbusinessman Roger Cyr, owner of the Lily Moon Cafe in Saco, Maine, \nlearned that he was the victim of payroll tax fraud and that he owed \n$52,000 in back taxes. He was one of a number of small business owners \nin Maine who were forced to pay their payroll taxes twice after an \nunscrupulous payroll provider ran off with their tax deposits instead \nof making the required payments to the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Unfortunately, this type of payroll fraud is not unique to my State \nof Maine, with instances of malfeasance occurring in Georgia, Texas, \nUtah, Iowa, Maryland, New York, and elsewhere throughout the U.S. It is \nunconscionable that these small business owners, are required to pay \ntheir payroll taxes twice. This additional and unexpected expense can \ndrive these companies out of business.\n  But let me be clear, these egregious examples of payroll fraud hide \nthe fact that most small businesses use payroll providers that are \nhonest, meticulous, and trustworthy. The majority of payroll tax agents \npay their clients' taxes accurately, and on time, providing outstanding \nservice as they help their clients with a myriad of complicated tax and \naccounting issues. Consequently, the organizing principle behind the \nbill I introduce today is to safeguard small business owners from afew \ndishonest payroll providers, and to shield the honest payroll providers \nfrom the bad actors in their industry.\n  To that end, this legislation contains a number of provisions \ndesigned to guard small business owners against fraud. These provisions \ninclude increasing IRS oversight of payroll service providers, creating \na separate section of the Internal Revenue code that will govern the \npayroll industry, defining the responsibilities of payroll tax deposit \nagents, and requiring all agents to register with the IRS or be \npenalized. The bill also penalizes payroll providers that collect, but \nfail to make, required tax payments by extending section 6672 penalties \nto all payroll tax agents. Additionally, payroll clients will also be \ninformed of their continued liability for all of their payroll taxes as \nwell as their obligation to periodically verify that their payroll \ntaxes are paid in full.\n  Now, I recognize that the new regulations will be more costly for \nsmall payroll companies to implement than for large payroll companies. \nIn order to keep client protections in place, while providing small \npayroll services providers with some reasonable flexibility, the bill \noffers a choice. Payroll providers can either obtain a surety bond, or \ncomply with quarterly third-party certifications.\n  Surety bonds can be very difficult for many small businesses to \nobtain. Consequently, instead of bonding, many small payroll service \nproviders prefer the targeted quarterly certification option, which \nensures that payroll agents are depositing clients' tax funds \ncompletely and on time. Small payroll agents assert that the \ncertification process actually provides their clients with greater \nfraud protection than a surety bond because the certification verifies \nthe payroll agent's sound financial practices quarterly, while a surety \nboud only requires an annual audit.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I understand how critical it is to defend our small \nbusiness owners from tax fraud. Enacting these provisions will help \nprotect small companies in Maine, Utah, Georgia and in each of our \nstates, from the very few dangerous payroll providers that would steal \ntheir clients' payroll taxes. At the same time, this bill recognizes \nthat small payroll tax agents must be provided flexible and reasonable \nregulatory options that offer real protection to their clients. This \nlegislation contains both strong safeguards and small business \nflexibility.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to help create a buffer for our \nsmall businesses from devious pay roll tax agents by increasing IRS \noversight and protections as contained in this bill. I hope my \ncolleagues will strongly support the Small Business Payroll Protection \nAct of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURR (for himself and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 1775. A bill to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct of 1965 to ensure that no child is left behind; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the No Child Left \nBehind Act of 2007, which I am pleased to introduce with my colleague \nSenator Gregg of New Hampshire. It has been an honor for my office to \nwork with Senator Gregg, one of the ``Big 4'' architects of the \noriginal No Child Left Behind legislation that passed Congress with \noverwhelmingly bipartisan support and that was signed into law by \nPresident Bush in January 2002.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 is the first comprehensive \nreauthorization legislation to be introduced in either the Senate or \nthe House of Representatives. I hope our introduction today will kick-\nstart the legislative process and get the Senate and the House on the \npath to a swift reauthorization of NCLB, the most sweeping and \nimportant federal K-12 education legislation passed since the original \nElementary and Secondary Education Act was passed in 1965.\n  If ever there were a Federal law that needed to be reauthorized on \ntime, it is No Child Left Behind. As the headline to Ron Brownstein's \narticle in yesterday's Los Angeles Times read: ``Don't leave this law \nbehind: Progress is slow\n\n[[Page S9139]]\n\nunder Bush's 2001 education reform, but No Child Left Behind is worth \nimproving.'' To be sure there has been lots of gnashing of teeth and \ngrimacing in the K-12 field since NCLB was passed. But as many of us in \nCongress and across the country recognized when NCLB was passed in \n2001, the point of No Child Left Behind wasn't, in the words of Kati \nHaycock of the Education Trust, ``to make people happy.''\n  If we had wanted to make the adult stakeholders in K-12 happy, we \ncould have done nothing and just kept the status quo. However, in 2001 \nthis Congress and a number of dedicated individuals and groups across \nthis Nation decided the status quo for our children was not acceptable \nand that the time had come to eradicate, as President Bush called it, \nthe ``soft bigotry of low expectations.'' Together with strong \nbipartisanship, this Congress with the passage of No Child Left Behind \nstated to all the adult stakeholders that we can and will close the \nachievement gap and to all of America's children that, regardless of \nbackground, socio-economics, race, ethnicity, or disability, you can \nand will learn and you can and will achieve.\n  We must not turn away from what we began when we passed the original \nNo Child Left Behind legislation. The stakes are too high both for our \nchildren and the Nation as a whole. In the ever competitive global \neconomy, all our children, not just some and not just the lucky or the \nfortunate, must be equipped with the academic skills to succeed. We \ncannot afford to return to the status quo of days past. The time is now \nto reauthorize No Child Left Behind and to reassert to all of America's \nchildren that this Congress will not give up on them and will not stop \nthis endeavor until the too-long-standing achievement gap is closed \nonce and for all and until all children have the academic skills they \nneed to succeed in both postsecondary education and the workforce.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 that Senator Gregg and I are \nintroducing today does not abandon the basic tenets of No Child Left \nBehind. To be sure there is still a great deal of work to do to reach \nour Nation's goal of having all children proficient in reading and math \nby 2013-2014. Nevertheless, we are seeing historic increases in student \nachievement. Since the passage of NCLB, the United States has witnessed \na greater increase in student achievement in the last five years than \nin the 30 previous years combined, as well as a significant narrowing \nin the achievement gap between African-American and Hispanic students \nand their Caucasian peers. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 builds \non the original cornerstone laid by Congress in 2001 of holding schools \naccountable for the academic achievement of all their students and of \nempowering parents to make better choices for their child's education.\n  In particular, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 preserves the \nfoundational principles of NCLB. It maintains the goal that all \nchildren will reach grade-level proficiency in reading in math by 2013-\n2014; keeps in place annual testing in grades 3-8 and at the high \nschool level; and keeps in place an accountability system rooted in \nState standards and State assessments. Further, our bill does not water \ndown accountability with the addition of multiple measures; rather, it \nkeeps a laser-like focus on grade-level achievement in math and \nreading.\n  While maintaining the fundamentals of NCLB, the No Child Left Behind \nAct of 2007 rightly responds to legitimate concerns parents, teachers, \nand principals, have raised regarding the original legislation. In \nresponse to concerns raised about impracticable accountability \ntimeframes, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 streamlines the \naccountability timeline to make it easier for schools to develop and \nimplement plans to improve student achievement and to focus on what \nmatters most teaching and learning. Additionally, recognizing that \nschools and their needs vary, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 \nallows for differentiated interventions for schools in restructuring to \nallow districts and schools to target resources to students and schools \nmost in need of assistance. Further, in response to calls for the use \nof a growth model to measure individual student progress and to \npositively recognize schools and educators who are making tremendous \nstrides in improving the achievement of all children, the bill expands \nthe Department's seven State growth model demonstration to all 50 \nStates.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 also responds to legitimate \nconcerns regarding the special populations of limited English \nproficient, LEP, students and students with disabilities, by providing \ngreater flexibility, focus, and resources to help schools educate these \nstudents to high standards. Notably, the bill grants new flexibility \nfor LEP students who are new to the country and codifies in statute \nrecent flexibility granted by the Department of Education for special \neducation students, which permits the use of alternate academic \nachievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive \ndisabilities and modified academic achievement standards for students \nwho have disabilities that preclude them from achieving grade-level \nproficiency. Finally, the bill targets Federal assessment dollars to \ndevelop and administer valid and reliable assessments for special \neducation and LEP students and targets professional development dollars \nto empower teachers with better tools and information for teaching LEP \nand special education children.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 reasserts that high-quality \nteachers are the most important factor to improved student academic \nachievement. The bill authorizes programs to ensure that all students \nare taught by a highly qualified teacher and to ensure that low-income \nand minority students are not taught by unqualified and inexperienced \nteachers at higher rates than their more affluent peers. The No Child \nLeft Behind Act of 2007 maintains the current definition of highly \nqualified teacher; emphasizes alternative certification, incentive, \ndifferential, and performance and merit pay; and has States and \ndistricts conduct needs assessments to determine which districts and \nschools have the most acute teacher quality and staffing needs in order \nto better target resources to those schools and districts. Further, the \nbill gives greater authority to local school districts to renegotiate \nrestrictions in collective bargaining agreements that contribute to the \nleast experienced and qualified teachers teaching in the schools with \nstudents most in need of a highly qualified teacher.\n\n  Finally, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 focuses on improving \nthe Nation's high school graduation rate. Included in the legislation \nis the Graduate for a Better Future Act, which I introduced earlier \nthis year in response to the high school dropout crisis in the United \nStates. The high school graduation rate for the class of 2003 was only \n70 percent nationwide. Thus, almost one-third of American students who \nenter high school in ninth grade drop out of school and never receive a \nhigh school diploma. Large disparities exist in the high school \ngraduation rates among various subgroups of students. Although the high \nschool graduation rate for white students was 78 percent in 2003, the \nrate for African American students was only 55 percent, and the rate \nfor Hispanic students was only 53 percent.\n  To remain competitive in the world economy, it is critical for \nAmerica's youth to graduate from high school and to have access to the \npostsecondary education needed to succeed in the 21st century job \nmarket. Funds under the Graduate for a Better Future Act will be used \nto create models of excellence for academically rigorous high schools \nto prepare all students for college and the 21st century workplace; to \nimplement accelerated academic catch-up programs for students who enter \nhigh school behind; to implement an early warning system to quickly \nidentify students at risk of dropping out of high school; to implement \ncomprehensive college guidance programs; and to implement programs that \noffer students opportunities for job-shadowing, internships, and \ncommunity service so that students are able to make the connection \nbetween what they are learning in school and how that applies and is \nused in the workplace.\n  Additionally, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 requires states to \nget serious and to get accurate in their calculation of graduation \nrates. The Nation's dropout crisis will not go away\n\n[[Page S9140]]\n\nby fudging on the numbers. The graduation rate in the No Child Left \nBehind Act of 2007 builds on the work of all 50 states through the \nNational Governors Association, which has signed the Graduation Counts \nCompact, an effort started in 2005 to find a common method for \ncalculating each state's high school graduation rate.\n  As I stated at the beginning of my remarks, continuing our endeavor \nbegun in 2001, the time is now to reauthorize No Child Left Behind. For \nthe future of our Nation, our children, we must not turn back. Once \nagain let us stand together and State to the American public that we \ncan and will close the achievement gap. And once again let us say to \nevery child, regardless of background, you can achieve.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, since its implementation, the No Child Left \nBehind Act has been successful in narrowing the achievement gap and \nimproving student performance. Since its passage, the U.S. has \nwitnessed a greater increase in student achievement in the last 5 years \nthan in the previous 30 years combined, as well as a significant \nnarrowing in the achievement gap. Because of No Child Left Behind, \nparents are now empowered with information on the quality of their \nchild's school and given the ability to improve their child's education \nthrough additional tutorial services.\n  No Child Left Behind has been tremendously successful in ensuring \nthat all students have access to the same high academic standards. No \nlonger can a school hide behind the averages of their higher performing \nstudents; now all students are given the same opportunities to reach \nacademic proficiency. Today I am introducing the No Child Left Behind \nAct of 2007 with my colleague Mr. BURR. This bill builds upon the basic \ntenets of No Child Left Behind and rightly responds to the legitimate \nconcerns of parents, teachers and principals. The No Child Left Behind \nAct of 2007 maintains the expectation that all students can reach or \nexceed proficiency when given the opportunity. Any rollback of \naccountability simply ignores the progress already being made and the \nbelief that all students can reach proficiency when given the \nopportunity.\n  Recognizing that each school and its needs vary tremendously, the No \nChild Left Behind Act of 2007 allows for differentiated consequences to \nensure that schools where a majority of students are not performing at \ngrade-level are treated differently than schools where a small segment \nof the school population is not meeting State standards. Coupled with \nadditional time before advancing into the next stage of Program \nImprovement, these new differentiated consequences will allow schools \nto target resources and interventions to the students who need the most \nassistance in reaching state-determined levels proficiency.\n  Under this bill, the Federal Government will continue to support \nStates financially in their development, improvement, and \nadministration of State academic assessments through the \nreauthorization of the Grants for State Assessments program. \nAdditionally, because many States are still striving to improve their \nassessment systems to assess students with disabilities and limited \nEnglish proficient students validly and reliably, the No Child Left \nBehind Act of 2007 creates a fund dedicated solely to the development \nand improvement of assessments for these students.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 recognizes that high quality \nteachers are the most important factor to improved student academic \nachievement. The bill authorizes several programs to ensure that all \nstudents are taught by a highly-qualified teacher and to ensure that \nlow-income students are not taught by unqualified and inexperienced \nteachers at higher rates than their more affluent peers. This bill \nauthorizes the Teacher Incentive Fund, a program to encourage State and \nschools districts to expand performance-based compensation for teachers \nand principals in high-need schools who raise student achievement and \nclose the achievement gap. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 also \nauthorizes the Adjunct Teacher Corp, a program to encourage highly \neducated and trained professionals, particularly in the areas of math \nand science, to teach high school courses in their area of expertise.\n  One of the key cornerstones of No Child Left Behind, options for \nparents, is maintained and expanded in the No Child Left Behind Act of \n2007. Notably, this bill makes supplemental services available at the \nsame time as public school choice, expands the time period parents can \nenroll their children in tutorial services programs and makes it easier \nfor supplemental service providers to readily access school facilities.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act of 2007 authorizes a new ``money follows \nthe child'' program and provides financial assistance to districts that \npermit Title I dollars to follow the child to the public school of his \nor her choice. This child-centered program will infuse competition into \nthe public school system, empower parents with new choices and \nencourage all public schools to improve the academic achievement of all \nstudents.\n  The combination of strengthening supplemental services and the new \nchild-centered program will provide even greater resources for parents \nto ensure that the educational needs of their children are being met.\n  This bill maintains what we know is working, accountability, \ntransparency and expanded options, without adding burdensome new \nrequirements. By maintaining the fundamentals of No Child Left Behind, \nthis bill combines maximum flexibility with differentiated consequences \nto ensure that all schools and students have the tools necessary to \nreach academic proficiency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1776. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nestablish a user fee program to ensure food safety, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nstrengthen the ability of the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, to \nensure the safety of food imported into the U.S.\n  The volume of food imports has increased significantly in recent \nyears, from $45.6 billion in 2003 to $64 billion in 2006. According to \nthe USDA, imported food accounts for 13 percent of the average \nAmerican's diet, including 31 percent of fruits, juices, and nuts; 9.5 \npercent of red meat; and 78.6 percent of fish and shellfish.\n  This upward trend in imported food has been accompanied by an \nincreasing number of health and safety incidents related to imported \nfood products. In the past 6 months, we have seen what appears to be \nthe intentional contamination of wheat gluten and rice protein \nconcentrate with melamine, which is an industrial product that should \nnever find its way into food products. In addition, we recently learned \nthat a significant volume of imported fish products from China have \nbeen contaminated with chemicals and residues, including Malachine \ngreen and Nitrofuren. We have found imported Chinese toothpaste in the \nU.S. that was contaminated with diethylene glycol, which is a toxic \ncomponent used in antifreeze.\n  Unfortunately, the FDA currently lacks the resources and authority to \nadequately determine the quality and safety of food imports, inspect an \nadequate volume of imported food, and rapidly detect and respond to \nincidents of contaminated imports. This legislation would take several \nsteps to correct these problems.\n  First, the bill would impose a fee for the FDA's oversight of \nimported food products. These fees would generate revenues to be used \nfor inspections of imported food and critical food safety research. The \nlegislation directs the FDA to use some of this funding to perform \ncutting-edge research to develop testing technologies and methods that \nwould quickly and accurately detect the presence of pervasive \ncontaminants such as E. coli and listeria. The legislation would also \nestablish a food importer certification program that would require \nforeign firms and governments to demonstrate that their food safety \nsystems are equivalent to ours.\n  What has been made clear through the pet food recall and other \noutbreaks of foodborne illnesses is that the FDA is a severely \nunderfunded and understaffed agency. Much of the responsibility for \noverseeing and inspecting the safety of imported food rests with the\n\n[[Page S9141]]\n\nFDA. However, due to fairly flat budgets and increasing \nresponsibilities, the number of inspectors looking at these shipments \nhas actually decreased from more than 3,000 inspectors in 2003 to the \npresent level of around 2,700 inspectors.\n  The Centers for Disease Control, CDC, estimates that 76 million \nAmericans become sick from foodborne illnesses each year. More than \n300,000 are hospitalized and 5,000 die each year. Less than 1.5 percent \nof imported food is inspected by the FDA and the FDA lacks the \nresources and authorities to certify the standards of our trading \npartners. This situation presents an economic, public health, and \nbioterrorism risk to the U.S.\n  The FDA office that is responsible for regulating more than $60 \nbillion of imported food, the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition, \nCFSAN, is also responsible for regulating $417 billion worth of \ndomestic food and $59 billion in cosmetics. All of this activity is \nregulated by an office for which the President requested $467 million \nin fiscal year 2008. Only $312 million of that amount would be for \ninspectors. We clearly need to review FDA's funding to make sure that \nit has the resources necessary to safeguard the 80 percent of our food \nsupply that it is responsible for regulating. For this reason, a group \nof my colleagues and I sent a letter earlier this year to the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the FDA, asking \nfor a significant increase in the level of funding for the FDA foods \nprogram.\n  But imports present a special challenge. It may cost more to ensure \nthe safety of food produced in other countries, and the logistical \nchallenges are greater. It is important that we supplement the FDA's \nbudget with additional funding streams to make sure that it has the \nresources necessary to safeguard our food supply from contaminated \nimports.\n  Specifically this legislation would direct the FDA to collect a user \nfee on imported food products, for the administrative review, \nprocessing, and inspection costs borne by the FDA. The legislation \nwould use that funding to bolster FDA's import inspection program, \nwhich currently inspects less than 1.5 percent of all imports. It would \nalso fund critical research into rapid testing technologies for \ndetecting foodborne pathogens.\n  Lastly, this bill would establish an imported food certification \nprogram. Today, any country and any company can export food products to \nthe United States as long as they inform regulators of the shipment. No \nchecks are performed to ensure that the producer has adequate sanitary \nstandards. The FDA does not ensure that trading partners have \nequivalent regulatory systems or inspect overseas plants when problems \narise.\n  When the FDA does want to investigate an outbreak, it can be delayed \nby uncooperative foreign governments. For example, during the pet food \nrecall, U.S. regulators were delayed three weeks in their request for \nvisas to inspect facilities.\n  This new program would mark a watershed change in the food import \nsafety posture of the U.S. This bill says that if you want a slice of \nthe lucrative U.S. market, you have to comply with the same common-\nsense standards that apply to U.S. food producers. You have to have \nequivalent food safety systems and processes in place to those of the \nU.S. You need to give U.S. regulators access to your facilities and \nrecords so they can check your safety record without unnecessary delay. \nIn addition, U.S. regulators would have the power to revoke the \ncertification of a company or country that fails to comply, and to \ndetain products that fail to meet U.S. standards.\n  For too long, we have gone without a solid safety standard for \nimported foods. Instead, our regulators jump from alert to alert and \nrecall to recall. This legislation would close these loopholes that \nallow dangerous imports into our country and put a solid, proactive \nsystem in place to protect our food supply.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1776\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a program for tribal colleges and \nuniversities within the Department of Health and Human Services and to \namend the Native American Programs Act of 1974 to authorize the \nprovision of grants and cooperative agreements to tribal colleges and \nuniversities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, Indian Education is perhaps the most \nimportant issue facing Indian Country today because education \nrepresents hope. Higher education leads to better job opportunities. \nBetter jobs lead to higher income and happier days. Higher income leads \nto greater access to health care and adequate housing and overall, a \nhigher quality of life. Higher quality of life leads to strong \ncommunities. Happy, healthy, and strong communities are more resistant \nto the destructive forces of poverty such as chemical abuse, violence \nand neglect.\n  No one disagrees that 85 percent unemployment in Indian Country is \nunacceptable. No one disagrees that it is unacceptable that the \nmajority of America's at-risk youth live in Indian Country. However, \nmerely reciting these statistics over and over won't make the situation \nany better. We need to work together to make Indian Country a better \nplace to live, work and raise a family.\n  Senator Dorgan and I introduce this vital legislation to help advance \nthe remarkable work tribal colleges and universities are doing. Through \ngrants awarded under this bill, tribal colleges and universities will \nhave additional resources necessary to strengthen Indian communities \nthrough the provision of health promotion and disease prevention \neducation, outreach and workforce development programs, through program \nimplementation, research, and capacity building. Not only will it \nimprove education, but it will also improve the delivery of culturally \nappropriate health care services. In addition to good education and \nincreased access to health care, this bill will also help create good \njobs in Indian Country.\n  Tribal colleges and universities are accredited by independent, \nregional accreditation agencies, and like all institutions of higher \neducation, must undergo stringent performance reviews to retain their \naccreditation status. In addition to offering postsecondary education \nopportunities, tribal colleges serve reservation communities by \nproviding critical services including: libraries, community centers, \ncultural, historical and language programs; tribal archives, career \ncenters, economic development and business centers; health and wellness \ncenters, public meeting places, child and elder care centers. Despite \ntheir many obligations, functions, and notable achievements, tribal \ncolleges remain the most poorly funded institutions of higher education \nin this country.\n  The continued success and future of the Nation's tribal colleges and \nuniversities depends on their ability to provide higher education and \ncommunity outreach programs. For them to succeed however, they must \nhave the financial resources to do so. I am honored to rise today to \nintroduce this important legislation for improving conditions in \nAmerica's Indian Country. I am proud of the folks who came together to \nhelp craft the bill and am proud to cosponsor it with my friend, \nChairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Dorgan.\n  I am proud to serve on the Indian Affairs Committee and to work to \nimprove conditions in Indian Country.\n  For example, on April 5th, I held a Tribal College Summit at the \nBlackfeet Community College in Browning, the first of its kind.\n  Leaders of all the Tribal nations in Montana and leaders throughout \nIndian higher education met to brainstorm about how we can improve \ntribal colleges in the State of Montana and across the country. By the \nend of the day, each group pledged to take specific actions to improve \ntribal college education throughout the U.S.\n  Part of my pledge includes introducing this PATH legislation. By \ntraining more Indian students to enter the health care field, we will \nprovide Indian country with more educated and self-sufficient members \nand improve the quality of and access to healthcare in Indian Country.\n  Healthier communities and good-paying jobs lead to improved overall \nconditions in Indian Country.\n  As a Montanan and member of the Senate Indian Affairs Community, I am \nproud to introduce this legislation. I look forward to swift \nconsideration and eventual passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1781. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 118 Minner Avenue in Bakersfield, California, as the \n``Buck Owens Post Office''; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleague, Senator \nFeinstein, to introduce legislation to designate the facility of the \nUnited States Postal Service located at 118 Minner Avenue in \nBakersfield, California, as the Buck Owens Post Office.\n  Country western legend, Buck Owens was one of the pioneers of the \n``Bakersfield Sound,'' that brought the raw edge of electric guitars \nand a rock and roll beat to country music. A great musician and a \ngenerous man, Buck left behind a legacy of artistry and love for his \nadopted hometown of Bakersfield and California's Central Valley.\n  The son of a sharecropper, Buck was born Alvis Edgar Owens, Jr. in \nSherman, TX, in 1929. At an early age, he nicknamed himself ``Buck'' \nafter a mule on the family farm. In 1937, the Owens family moved west \nseeking better fortune during the Great Depression. When he was just 13 \nyears old, Buck dropped out of school to find work, but he never \nstopped pursuing his passion for music.\n  A natural musician, Buck taught himself to play guitar in his early \nteens. When he was just 16, he had already landed a regular show on a \nlocal radio station and was playing shows in honky tonks and bars \naround Phoenix. Just 6 years later, Buck moved his young family to \nBakersfield, California, where he began to make his mark on country \nmusic as a performer, a songwriter, and a recording artist.\n  Buck's trademark stinging electric guitar and rhythm sound \nrevolutionized country music and challenged the Nashville \nestablishment. His 20 number-one hits are a testament to his place \namong the greatest artists in country music history. Throughout his \ndecades as an entertainer, Buck delighted audiences from Bakersfield to \nNashville, all the way to Japan and even the White House.\n  Buck's pioneering work has continued to inspire a new generation of \nmusicians. In 1986, when Buck had finished a 25-year run as the cohost \nof the Hee Haw television show, Dwight Yoakam and other new traditional \nperformers were just beginning a revival of his hallmark Bakersfield \nSound.\n  I was fortunate to have met Buck back in 1997 at his Crystal Palace \nin Bakersfield, when I was invited to\n\n[[Page S9144]]\n\npresent one of his special red, white, and blue guitars to a promising \nmusic student named William Villatoro. I still vividly remember how the \nyoung man was deeply moved and inspired by Buck's generous gesture. I \nwill certainly remember Buck Owens as a man of great compassion who \npossessed a profound love for his country. Although he is no longer \nwith us, I take great comfort in knowing that Buck Owens was able to be \na shining light not only in the life of a young man from Bakersfield \nbut also to the millions of others who admired his musical gifts and \nwere touched by his humanity.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation \nas we commemorate an icon of American music whose artistry and \ngenerosity touched so many lives in his community.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1782. A bill to amend chapter 1 of title 9 of United States Code \nwith respect to arbitration; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will introduce the Arbitration \nFairness Act of 2007. Just as its name suggests, the Arbitration \nFairness Act is designed to return fairness to the arbitration system. \nThis bill is not an anti-arbitration bill. If anything, it is pro-\narbitration. I firmly believe that this bill will strengthen the \narbitration system by returning arbitration to a more equitable design \nthat reflects the intent of the original arbitration legislation, the \nFederal Arbitration Act.\n  President Calvin Coolidge signed the Federal Arbitration Act, FAA, \ninto law on February 12, 1925. Congress passed the FAA to make \narbitration an enforceable alternative to the civil courts. Even as \nearly as the 1920s, there were concerns about the efficiency of the \ncivil court system and a desire to allow a speedier alternative. The \nintent of the FAA, as expressed in a 1923 hearing before a subcommittee \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, was ``to enable business men to \nsettle their disputes expeditiously and economically.'' In a later \nhearing on the FAA, it was clarified that the legislation was not \nintended to apply to the employment contracts of those businesses. This \ndistinction is important because it illustrates that, while arbitration \nwas something that the FAA's original sponsors wanted to promote, they \nwere also careful to make clear that they didn't intend for arbitration \nto become a weapon to be wielded by the powerful against those with \nless financial and negotiating power.\n  Since the FAA's enactment, the use of arbitration has grown \nexponentially. Arbitration certainly has advantages. It can be a fair \nand efficient way to settle disputes. I strongly support voluntary, \nalternative dispute resolution methods, and I believe we ought to \nencourage their use. But I also believe that arbitration is a fair way \nto settle disputes between consumers and lenders only when it is \nentered into knowingly and voluntarily by both parties to the dispute \nafter the dispute has arisen. Otherwise arbitration can be used as a \nweapon by the stronger party against the weaker party.\n  One of the most fundamental principles of our justice system is the \nconstitutional right to take a dispute to court. Indeed, all Americans \nhave the right in civil and criminal cases to a trial by jury. The \nright to a jury trial in civil cases in Federal court is contained in \nthe Seventh Amendment to the Constitution. Many States provide a \nsimilar right to a jury trial in civil matters filed in State court.\n  I have been concerned for many years that mandatory arbitration \nclauses are slowly eroding the legal protections that should be \navailable to all Americans. A large and growing number of corporations \nnow require millions of consumers and employees to sign contracts that \ninclude mandatory arbitration clauses. Most of these individuals have \nlittle or no meaningful opportunity to negotiate the terms of their \ncontracts and so find themselves having to choose either to accept a \nmandatory arbitration clause or to forgo securing employment or needed \ngoods and services. Incredibly, mandatory arbitration clauses have been \nused to prevent individuals from trying to vindicate their civil rights \nunder statutes specifically passed by Congress to protect them.\n  There is a range of ways in which mandatory arbitration can be \nparticularly hostile to individuals attempting to assert their rights. \nFor example, the administrative fees, both to gain access to the \narbitration forum and to pay for the ongoing services of the arbitrator \nor arbitrator, can be so high as to act as a de facto bar for many \nindividuals who have a claim that requires resolution. In addition, \narbitration generally lacks discovery proceedings and other civil due \nprocess protections.\n  Furthermore, there is no meaningful judicial review of arbitrators' \ndecisions. Under mandatory, binding arbitration, even if a party \nbelieves that the arbitrator did not consider all the facts or follow \nthe law, the party cannot file a suit in court. The only basis for \nchallenging a binding arbitration decision is fairly narrow: if there \nis reason to believe that the arbitrator committed actual fraud, or was \nbiased, corrupt, or guilty of misconduct, or exceeded his or her \npowers. Because mandatory, binding arbitration is so conclusive, it is \na credible means of dispute resolution only when all parties understand \nthe full ramifications of agreeing to it.\n  Unfortunately, in a variety of contexts, employment agreements, \ncredit card agreements, HMO contracts, securities broker contracts, and \nother consumer and franchise agreements, mandatory arbitration is fast \nbecoming the rule, rather than the exception. The practice of forcing \nemployees to use arbitration has been on the rise since the Supreme \nCourt's Circuit City decision in 2001. Unless Congress acts, the \nprotections it has provided through law for American workers, \ninvestors, and consumers, will slowly become irrelevant.\n  The Arbitration Fairness Act of 2007, which I am happy to say will \nalso be introduced in the House by Representative Hank Johnson, D-GA, \nreinstates the FAA's original intent by requiring that agreements to \narbitrate employment, consumer, franchise, or civil rights disputes be \nmade after the dispute has arisen. The act does not apply to mandatory \narbitration systems agreed to in collective bargaining, and it does not \nprohibit arbitration. What it does do is prevent a party with greater \nbargaining power from forcing individuals into arbitration through a \ncontractual provision. It will ensure that citizens once again have a \ntrue choice between arbitration and the traditional civil court system.\n  In our system of Government, Congress and State legislatures pass \nlaws and the courts are available to citizens to make sure those laws \nare enforced. But the rule of law means little if the only forum \navailable to those who believe they have been wronged is an \nalternative, unaccountable system where the law passed by the \nlegislature does not necessarily apply. This legislation both protects \nAmericans from exploitation and strengthens a valuable alternative \nmethod of dispute resolution. These are both worthy ends, and I hope \nthat my colleagues in the Senate will join me in working to pass this \nimportant bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-\nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1782\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Arbitration Fairness Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Arbitration Act (now enacted as chapter 1 \n     of title 9 of the United States Code) was intended to apply \n     to disputes between commercial entities of generally similar \n     sophistication and bargaining power.\n       (2) A series of United States Supreme Court decisions have \n     changed the meaning of the Act so that it now extends to \n     disputes between parties of greatly disparate economic power, \n     such as consumer disputes and employment disputes. As a \n     result, a large and rapidly growing number of corporations \n     are requiring millions of consumers and employees to give up \n     their right to have disputes resolved by a judge or jury, and \n     instead submit their claims to binding arbitration.\n       (3) Most consumers and employees have little or no \n     meaningful option whether to submit their claims to \n     arbitration. Few people\n\n[[Page S9145]]\n\n     realize, or understand the importance of the deliberately \n     fine print that strips them of rights; and because entire \n     industries are adopting these clauses, people increasingly \n     have no choice but to accept them. They must often give up \n     their rights as a condition of having a job, getting \n     necessary medical care, buying a car, opening a bank account, \n     getting a credit card, and the like. Often times, they are \n     not even aware that they have given up their rights.\n       (4) Private arbitration companies are sometimes under great \n     pressure to devise systems that favor the corporate repeat \n     players who decide whether those companies will receive their \n     lucrative business.\n       (5) Mandatory arbitration undermines the development of \n     public law for civil rights and consumer rights, because \n     there is no meaningful judicial review of arbitrators' \n     decisions. With the knowledge that their rulings will not be \n     seriously examined by a court applying current law, \n     arbitrators enjoy near complete freedom to ignore the law and \n     even their own rules.\n       (6) Mandatory arbitration is a poor system for protecting \n     civil rights and consumer rights because it is not \n     transparent. While the American civil justice system features \n     publicly accountable decision makers who generally issue \n     written decisions that are widely available to the public, \n     arbitration offers none of these features.\n       (7) Many corporations add to their arbitration clauses \n     unfair provisions that deliberately tilt the systems against \n     individuals, including provisions that strip individuals of \n     substantive statutory rights, ban class actions, and force \n     people to arbitrate their claims hundreds of miles from their \n     homes. While some courts have been protective of individuals, \n     too many courts have upheld even egregiously unfair mandatory \n     arbitration clauses in deference to a supposed Federal policy \n     favoring arbitration over the constitutional rights of \n     individuals.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 1 of title 9, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by amending the heading to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 1.

Validity and enforceability'',\n\n       (2) by inserting ``(a)'' before ``A written'';\n       (3) by striking ``, save'' and all that follows through \n     ``contract'', and inserting ``to the same extent as contracts \n     generally, except as otherwise provided in this title''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) No predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or \n     enforceable if it requires arbitration of--\n       ``(1) an employment, consumer, or franchise dispute; or\n       ``(2) a dispute arising under any statute intended to \n     protect civil rights or to regulate contracts or transactions \n     between parties of unequal bargaining power.\n       ``(c) An issue as to whether this chapter applies to an \n     arbitration agreement shall be determined by Federal law. \n     Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the validity or \n     enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate shall be \n     determined by the court, rather than the arbitrator, \n     irrespective of whether the party resisting arbitration \n     challenges the arbitration agreement specifically or in \n     conjunction with other terms of the contract containing such \n     agreement.\n       ``(d) Nothing in this chapter shall apply to any \n     arbitration provision in a collective bargaining \n     agreement.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall take \n     effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall \n     apply with respect to any dispute or claim that arises on or \n     after such date.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       When Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act \n     (``FAA''), its goal was to allow an alternative forum for \n     parties on equal footing to resolve their disputes. Yet a \n     series of court decisions moved the law away from its \n     original intent and opened the door for arbitration to be \n     used to deprive ordinary citizens in employment, consumer, \n     and franchise disputes of their constitutional right to use \n     the civil justice system.\n       The Arbitration Fairness Act of 2007, introduced in the \n     Senate by Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) and in the House by Rep. \n     Hank Johnson (D-GA), reflects the FAA's original intent by \n     requiring that agreements to arbitrate employment, consumer, \n     franchise, or civil rights disputes be made after the dispute \n     has arisen. The Act does not prohibit arbitration, but it \n     will prevent a party with greater bargaining power from \n     forcing individuals into arbitration through a contract \n     entered into prior to a dispute arising. It will ensure that \n     citizens have a true choice between arbitration and the \n     traditional civil court system.\n       Sec. 1: Short Title: the ``Arbitration Fairness Act of \n     2007''\n       Sec. 2: Findings: This section details how the law has \n     moved away from the original intent of the Federal \n     Arbitration Act and has now exposed growing numbers of \n     individual consumers and employees to mandatory arbitration \n     agreements. It also discusses the ways in which mandatory \n     arbitration systems are skewed in favor of powerful, \n     corporate, repeat players.\n       Sec. 3: Definitions: This section amends section 1 of the \n     FAA (9 U.S.C. Sec. 1) to include specific definitions of \n     ``employment dispute,'' ``consumer dispute,'' and ``franchise \n     dispute,'' which are covered by the Act. An employment \n     dispute is any dispute between an employer and employee \n     arising out of the relationship as defined by the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act. A consumer dispute is a dispute between an \n     individual person who seeks or acquires property, services, \n     money, or credit for non-business purposes and the seller or \n     provider of those goods or services. A franchise dispute is a \n     dispute between a franchisor and franchisee arising out of or \n     relating to the contract establishing the franchise.\n       Sec. 4: Validity and Enforceability: This section amends \n     section 2 of the FAA (9 U.S.C. Sec. 2) to establish that \n     agreements to arbitrate employment, consumer, or franchise \n     disputes will not be enforceable if they are entered before \n     the actual dispute arises. It extends this rule to disputes \n     arising under civil rights statutes and statutes regulating \n     contracts or transactions between parties of unequal \n     bargaining power. This section also states that disputes as \n     to whether the Act applies shall be resolved by the court, \n     rather than through arbitration. Finally, the section \n     clarifies that the Act does not apply to collective \n     bargaining agreements.\n       Sec. 5: Effective Date: The Act shall apply to claims and \n     disputes arising on or after the date of enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 1783. A bill to provide 10 steps to transform health care in \nAmerica; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of introducing a bill \non health care reform. I know the Presiding Officer has immense \ninterest in it, as do a number of other Senators. I have read his bill \nand incorporated many parts of that.\n  Health care reform is one of the biggest needs in this country. It is \nthe fastest escalating price in this country. It is the biggest cost to \ncompanies and individuals in this country. We need to have a solution.\n  I have been working with Senator Kennedy, who is the chairman of the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. He has a very full \nplate with the Higher Education Act, the higher education \nreconciliation, information technology, and I could go on to mention \nabout 53 bills we are working on in that committee. So I have had some \nlatitude as ranking member to try to pull together some information--\nsome legislation that would deal with health care for this Nation. This \nis a work in progress. This is not a finished document.\n  I wish to thank Senator Kennedy for working with me and his staff and \nmy staff to come up with some health care principles we wanted to \nfollow. Of course, I appreciate the work Senator Nelson did with me in \nprevious times and currently on small business health plans. I \nappreciate Senator Baucus's efforts on health care and how the tax\n\n[[Page S9146]]\n\npackage goes together with that. We can see there are a lot of moving \nparts to anything we do with health. Senator Coburn has an outstanding \nand very comprehensive package on how we can solve many of the health \ncare and health insurance problems in this Nation. Senator Lott, \nSenator DeMint, Senator McConnell; as I mentioned, the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Whitehouse; Senator Lincoln, Senator Carper, Senator \nSalazar, and Senator Durbin--these are all people who have come up with \neither a comprehensive plan or a piece of a plan that would work to \nmake an important difference in health care in this country.\n  Congressman McCreary on the House side has been a real leader on this \nand, of course, the President and the administration have made \ncontributions as well. The President, in his State of the Union speech, \nmade some comments about how taxes would fit in with solving some of \nthe uninsured problems in the country, and some of those provisions are \nin here as well.\n  Without the work of everyone on this, it can't be done. If it gets \npolarized, it can't be done. This is something which has to be done in \na very bipartisan way. I hope we have a framework from which we can all \noperate, making changes, finding third ways.\n  I work on an 80-percent rule. I anticipate and from experience have \nfound that usually everybody can agree on 80 percent of the issues, and \namong the 80 percent of the issues on which they agree, they can agree \non 80 percent of any one of those issues. You never get a perfect bill \naround here. If you can get 80 percent, you can get a lot done. That is \nwhat we are trying to do on health care--make an 80-percent change for \nthe people of America. Eighty percent would be a huge difference and \nwill help out a lot of people.\n  So I rise today to talk about an issue that is literally a heartbeat \naway from devastating the lives of every American; that is, our current \nhealth care crisis. Undeniably, we have a problem. There are 46.1 \nmillion Americans, according to the last tabulation, who are uninsured. \nNow, we always talk about that figure and change it slightly \ndifferently because there are 7 million of those people who make over \n$80,000 a year and don't have insurance, so they must choose not to \nhave insurance, but they are uninsured. People who are on Medicaid, \nthey don't have to sign up for anything before they have an emergency. \nWhen they go to the hospital, they can sign up then. That is a \nsignificant number of the 46.1 million people as well. So I don't know \nwhether to really say they don't have insurance, but at any rate, let's \njust use that figure of 46.1 million Americans who are uninsured and \nfigure out a way to solve that, as well as to help people who also have \ninsurance to perhaps be able to handle the situation even better.\n  Health care costs are outstripping inflation. They are increasing \nannually at three times the rate of the Consumer Price Index. It is \nlittle surprise that three out of every four Americans are concerned \nabout health care--three out of four. I think probably, if you are \ntalking to people, you would think the percentage was even higher than \nthat.\n  Employer-provided health insurance is voluntary and in critical \ncondition. Sixty percent of the country's employers offer insurance \ntoday, but that is down 9 percent from a few years ago. It is partly \ndue to the fact that the cost of health insurance for companies has \nnearly doubled in the same amount of time. With employers expected to \npay over $8,000 per employee versus $4,000 5 years ago, we have no \nchoice but to stabilize the system and provide more options for \nbusinesses so they can continue to provide health care for their \nemployees.\n\n  We must also provide real options--real options for those without \nemployer-based health care. My own home State of Wyoming is hard-hit. \nOn average, one in five Wyoming residents is uninsured, and more and \nmore residents are losing the coverage they do have as the costs go up. \nIt is largely due to the fact that much of Wyoming's economy is small \nbusiness. Nearly 70 percent of Wyoming employers are small business. \nActually, if you use the Federal definition of small business and you \ntalk about companies headquartered in Wyoming, 100 percent of the \ncompanies are small business. We don't have a single one, according to \nthe Federal definition, that is based in Wyoming. But nearly 70 percent \nof the employers find that it is nearly impossible to afford health \ncare coverage for their employees.\n  Thankfully, I am not here today to talk about these problems; I am \nhere to provide real solutions. Americans need and deserve real \nsolutions to this crisis now, and they are counting on this body to \nwork together to get that. The time has come to move beyond the \nrhetoric and principles to true comprehensive health care reform.\n  Congress could enact 10 major steps for health care reform. These 10 \nsteps are the basis of the legislation I am introducing today, the Ten \nSteps to Transform Health Care in America, or simply ``Ten Steps.''\n  In putting together these 10 steps, I first wanted to understand the \nproblem, and all the proposals others have been discussing help with \nthat. I have studied those other proposals very carefully, and my \ncolleagues will find that I have included many of the concepts of those \nother proposals in the 10 steps. I particularly wish to recognize again \nand thank Senator Baucus, Senator Kennedy, Senator Nelson, Senator \nCoburn, Senator Lott, Senator DeMint, Senator McConnell, Senator \nWhitehouse, Senator Lincoln, Senator Carper, Senator Salazar, Senator \nDurbin, Congressman McCreary, the President, the administration--all of \nthem for their contributions, for their patience, and for their \nwillingness to share their ideas.\n  However, to truly do this right, we have to move beyond the usual \njurisdictional issues, beyond the usual reauthorizations of a single \nprogram at a time. We have to examine the whole health care system and \ntogether--together, we have to put forward a bold and comprehensive \nsolution that addresses our health care crisis. That is what Ten Steps \ndoes. It is a comprehensive solution to a very big problem. It can be \ndone in parts. It doesn't have to be done as one structure.\n  It needs to go through the committee process. I have pointed out \nseveral times that bills that don't go through the committee process \nusually don't make it through the process at all. They are good for \nmaking rhetoric, they are good for making points, they are sometimes \ngood for advancing a principle, but they seldom ever make it to the \nPresident's desk for signature. So I know this will have to go through \nmore than one committee. I know the jurisdictional issues between \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions and the Finance Committees. I \nhave no problem. We did the pensions bill last year, going through \nthose same kinds of multiple committees and getting agreement from \neverybody, and that can be done on this issue as well--of course, as \nlong as we don't polarize it.\n  So I want to reiterate again that this is not a final bill. One of \nthe things we have done in the HELP Committee which has helped to move \nthings along is to consider every bill a work in progress. At a lot of \nthe committee meetings, when you have a markup, different amendments \nare presented and they are voted up or down, just like on the floor. \nWell, that doesn't result in a lot of compromise. So what we have done \non the HELP Committee is use the markup process as an indication of \nproblems and the level of intensity of those problems, and we have \nagreed to work through those problems even after the bill makes it \nthrough committee. As a result, it seldom makes it through committee \nunanimously, but it makes it through committee in a bipartisan way, and \nthat encourages people to work together to find solutions. Sometimes it \nis one way or the other, but usually it is finding a third way to come \nup with a mechanism to do what we are trying to do. Once we can put \naway some of the old ``diving into the weeds'' things that have \nhappened year after year, we are able to come up with something new and \ndifferent that actually reaches the goal we have been trying to reach \nas we jumped into the weeds through the whole process.\n  So I want to remind everybody that it is a work in progress. We want \nmore ideas. We want some of those third ways. But primarily, we want \neverybody to take a look at what is in here because it is a compilation \nof a number of people who have really taken a look at the situation.\n  So what does it do? These 10 steps--I will break them down into the \nactual 10 steps and go through each of them.\n\n[[Page S9147]]\n\n  First, we eliminate unfair tax treatment of health insurance, which \nexpands choices and coverage and gives all Americans more control over \ntheir health care.\n  Our current health insurance system is biased toward employer-based \ncoverage--kind of due to a historical accident. The wage controls of \nWorld War II increased competition among employers for recruiting the \nbest employees and incentivized employers to offer health benefits \ninstead of what they couldn't do, which was increase wages. In 1954, \nCongress codified a provision declaring that such a contribution would \nnot count as taxable income. This tax policy made it very favorable for \nindividuals to get their health benefits through their employers and \nconsequently has penalized individuals who get coverage through the \nindividual market. So if you work for a big company--a tax break. If \nyou don't--penalized.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that moving this tax bias \nand a few related health care tax policies will save the Government \n$3.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Even around here, that is a lot \nof money. That is a lot of money which can and should be used to expand \nchoices and access and give individuals more control over their health \ncare. Ten Steps ensures that every American can benefit from this \nsavings--whether they get their health care from their employer, from \nthe individual insurance market or they decide they want to get off \nMedicaid and switch to private insurance.\n\n  Let me be clear. My goal is not to erode employer-based health \ninsurance, given that the Ten Steps does not alter the way employers \ntreat health insurance. Rather, I wish to provide more options for \nindividuals who don't currently have insurance through their employer. \nEveryone should be treated equally.\n  Once the employee exclusion for health care insurance is eliminated, \nwe must provide additional tax incentives for the purchase of health \ncare insurance. Ten Steps is a hybrid approach, combining the standard \ndeduction for health insurance with a tax subsidy for those who need it \nthe most. That way, no particular population is adversely affected.\n  The second step of Ten Steps would increase affordable options for \nworking families to purchase health insurance through a standard tax \ndeduction. The national above-the-line standard deduction for health \ninsurance will equal $15,000 for a family and $7,500 for an individual. \nI wish to also note the earned-income tax credit for taxpayers with \nqualifying children is held harmless--that is very important--so those \nreceiving the earned-income tax credit will not be affected by these \nchanges. Actually, they will be affected in a positive way.\n  For example, say Bob from Gillette, WY, has total compensation of \n$38,000, made up of $34,000 in wages and $4,000 in health insurance \npremiums paid by his employer. Because of the current unfair tax \ntreatment of premiums, Bob's current taxable income is reduced to \n$34,000, which means he paid about $5,000 in taxes. To an accountant, \nthis is all fascinating; for other people, I am not so sure.\n  Under the Ten Steps, which eliminates the exclusion of premiums from \ntax, Bob's total compensation and thus taxable income would be $38,000. \nBy providing Bob with a $7,500 standard deduction for health insurance, \nhis taxable income under this bill would be lowered to $30,500, which \nmeans he would pay about $4,000 in taxes. So Bob's total savings under \nthis proposal is $1,000 a year.\n  The third step of Ten Steps is what makes this a hybrid approach. I \ncouple the standard deduction with a refundable, advanceable, \nassignable tax-based subsidy. That is a mouthful, but it ensures that \nAmericans receive this credit in a meaningful way that allows them to \npurchase real insurance coverage.\n  Given that everybody is not familiar with these terms, I will explain \nthem. As a refundable credit, it benefits folks even if they don't have \ntax liability. They don't have to owe taxes in order to get it. This \nhelps low-income individuals. Advanceable means the subsidy would be \npaid at the beginning of the year so individuals can use the funds to \nimmediately purchase health insurance. If it wasn't advanceable, \nindividuals would need to first pay for their health insurance and then \nget the money back at the end of the year to pay them back for that \npurchase. To encourage everyone to obtain health insurance right away, \nwe should provide those funds upfront. Further, to ensure that the \nsubsidy goes toward the purchase of health care insurance, it is also \nassignable--paid directly from the IRS to the insurance carrier that \nthe individual chooses.\n  Ten Steps includes the tax subsidy equal to $5,000 for a family or \n$2,500 for an individual. The full subsidy amount is available to \nindividuals at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level, which \nis $20,650 right now for a family of four. The subsidy is phased out \nbetween up to 300 percent of Federal poverty level, with individuals at \n200 percent receiving half the subsidy and individuals at 301 percent \nreceiving the standard deduction instead of the subsidy. I am sure \neverybody got that.\n  The fourth key step for health care reform is to provide market-based \npooling to reduce growing health care costs and increase access not \nonly for small businesses, unions and other kinds of organizations and \ntheir workers, members, and families. That is a change from anything I \nhave done on pooling before, but it is a change that was requested by \nthe other organizations and unions, as well as small business. Those of \nyou who know me well recognize how central this would be to any health \ncare reform proposal of mine.\n  While I have not yet introduced the small business health plan \nlegislation from last year, I have not abandoned those key principles. \nEvery day, emergency rooms treat more than 30,000 uninsured Americans \nwho work for or depend on small businesses. That is at least 30,000 \nreasons why I will not abandon the concept. However, in the proposal I \nam introducing, I have addressed some of the criticisms of the bill, \nand I have offered what I believe are appropriate solutions.\n  For instance, while the earlier bill focused heavily on small \nbusinesses--and this one still does--it simply became clear that other \norganizations, including unions and churches, can benefit from better \npooling options too. Therefore, under this bill, the umbrella of the \npooling option has been expanded to include more kinds of organizations \nbut with the same strong focus on consumer protections and State-based \noversight.\n  Of course, a big elephant in the room was dealing with those who were \nmisled to fear how the initial proposal dealt with insurance mandates. \nI hope those who were so vocal before will pause this time around. By \nincorporating what many have described as the Snowe amendment--which I \nam sure we would have passed at the time we were talking about that \nbefore--the legislation would require benefit mandate categories if a \nmajority of the States required them. While I still have some concerns, \nI am comfortable with this compromise because the mandate requirement \nis coupled with something it needs to encourage pooling and that is a \ncommon definition of what that mandate means. We do it with the Federal \ninsurance plan because definitions in all the States run a little bit \ndifferent. If you are trying to do something comprehensively, it is \npretty hard to figure out what each definition means, so there needs to \nbe a way of streamlining it and coming up with a common definition for \nthat mandate. I don't think people have a problem with that, especially \nsince we do it with the Federal plan.\n  As I learned with the previous debate, mandates for many different \nservices and items are not consistent from State to State. Thus, if we \nare to discuss requiring those, we should at least have a consistent \ndefinition of what those mandates require. We should not further \ncomplicate the pooling option with a multitude of definitions. We want \nto make insurance as simple as possible. I know that is kind of an \noxymoron, I am sure, because I know nobody in America relishes having \ntheir insurance agent come over and spend an evening explaining the \nbill to them. But we want to have this little bit of streamlining so it \nis simpler and people will be able to understand it, to the degree that \nis possible with insurance.\n\n  While the next step is probably one of the most obvious ones, it is \nalso one many have not yet discussed. Currently, HIPAA portability \nprotections\n\n[[Page S9148]]\n\nare provided to group health plans. The protections provide assurances \nto consumers that insurers will deal with preexisting conditions fairly \nand provide coverage, even to small groups.\n  These protections have been a great help for individuals purchasing \nhealth care coverage in the group market. However, those consumer \nprotections are not provided nearly as well to individuals who are \npurchasing in the individual market. Ten Steps blends the individual \nand group market to extend important HIPAA portability protections to \nthe individual market so the insurance security can better move with \nyou from job to job. It allows people to take that new opportunity and \nstill be sure they will be covered, even if they have had some \npreexisting conditions.\n  The sixth step emphasizes preventive benefits and helps individuals \nwith chronic diseases better manage their health. America should have \nhealth care, not sick care. Prevention, prevention, prevention. That \nmakes a big difference in the cost.\n  We have all been discussing the need to do more to prevent disease, \nnot just treat its symptoms. Even though I leave much to the markets to \ndefine some health insurance components, the one thing we must \nemphasize is the need for prevention. Any plan purchased with the tax \nsubsidy must include basic preventive services and a medical self-\nmanagement component.\n  This concept is modeled after a very successful program in Wyoming. \nIn 2005, Wyoming EqualityCare, our Medicaid Program, began providing \none-on-one case management for Medicaid participants with chronic \nillnesses, such as diabetes, asthma, depression or heart disease, to \nencourage better self-management of these conditions. The program \nprovides educational information on self-management, as well as a nurse \nhealth coach who follows up with each patient to ensure they have what \nthey need to take care of themselves.\n  In addition, EqualityCare provides a nursing hotline so all patients \nhave a direct line to a health care provider when they are concerned \nabout an illness. These programs targeting those with chronic illnesses \nwere estimated to save nearly $13 million for the EqualityCare program \nin 2006. In a lot of States, that would not sound like a lot, but \nWyoming is the least-populated of all of the States. We are hoping to \nget 500,000 people in the next census. When you talk about $13 million \nbeing saved in this EqualityCare Program dealing with Medicaid \nparticipants, it is a lot of money, proportionately, particularly \nbecause it cut down on inappropriate use of emergency room services.\n  Now, another key step of the Ten Steps for health care reform is to \ngive individuals the choice to convert the value of their Medicaid and \nSCHIP program benefits into private health insurance, putting them in \ncontrol of their health care, not the Federal Government. The rationale \nfor this step is simple. If the market can provide better coverage at a \nlower price, why not allow Americans to access that care?\n  This gives low-income individuals more options about where they can \nreceive their care and what care is available to them. Some providers \ndon't see Medicaid and SCHIP patients. This provision will change that \nby letting the market forces work and give all patients more choices. \nIt is time for people to start making decisions about their care. Let's \nget the Government out of the doctors office.\n  About 6,000 kids are enrolled in the Wyoming SCHIP program. An \nadditional 6,000 kids are eligible for the program but are not \nenrolled. I wonder why that is. Maybe it is because folks in Wyoming \nare wary about accepting Government help, and they think there is a \nnegative stigma associated with SCHIP and Medicaid. Well, under Ten \nSteps, they can use that money to purchase health care insurance \nthrough the private sector so that their family can attain the high \nquality care they need and deserve. This will cover more people.\n  The eighth step in Ten Steps is a bipartisan proposal which the HELP \nCommittee approved last month--the ``Wired for Health Care Quality \nAct,'' which encouraged the adoption of cutting-edge information \ntechnologies in health care to improve patient care, reduce medical \nerrors, and cut health care costs. Some of the most serious challenges \nfacing health care today--medical errors, inconsistent quality, and \nrising costs--can be addressed through the effective application of \navailable health information technology linking all elements of the \nhealth care system.\n  The widespread use of health IT can save lives. If somebody is \ntraveling and gets in a car wreck or gets hurt in some other way, the \nemergency room doctor would be able to find out everything he or she \nneeds to know to make the right treatment decisions, without the person \nhaving to fill out one of those little papers at the doctors office, \nwhich they may not be capable of doing if they have been in a requiem \nor have some other problem.\n  Better use of health IT would also allow medical data to move with \npeople when they go to other locations. When someone goes to the \ndoctor's office, they won't have to take the clipboard and a pencil and \nwrite down everything they can remember about their history. It will \nalready be recorded and go with them. It will make a huge difference.\n\n  Beyond saving lives and saving time, more effective use of health \ninformation technology would save us a lot of money. A RAND study \nsuggested that health IT has the potential to save--listen to this--\n$162 billion a year. Even around here that is real money. In order for \nthese savings to be realized, we have to create an infrastructure for \ninteroperability.\n  All the different health providers and insurers and doctors have to \nbe able to get the information electronically, but doctors, hospitals, \nhealth care advocates, the business community, including small \nbusinesses, are clamoring for Congress to take action and establish \nuniform health IT standards. That will cut down on the cost of the \nsoftware.\n  Time is of the essence. If Congress does not act, our health care \nsystem will move forward in a highly inefficient, fragmented, and \ndisjointed way. Among other things, this bill will eliminate \nduplicative tests and reduce medical errors. That is a lot of where \nthat $162 billion a year in savings comes from.\n  Health care reform cannot simply expand health insurance coverage. It \nmust also expand access to actual providers of care. There are growing \nshortages of health care providers nationally, with a shortage of up to \n200,000 primary care physicians and 1 million nurses expected by 2020. \nWho is going to take care of us at the hospital if we don't have \nnurses? Who is going to help make a diagnosis if we don't have doctors?\n  That is why the ninth step of Ten Steps helps future providers and \nnurses pay for their education while encouraging them to serve in areas \nwith great need with five key reforms.\n  This legislation provides competitive matching grants for States to \nencourage nurses to return to the profession after having left the \nworkforce for 3 years or more while reaffirming the commitment to \ncurrent programs targeting nurse educators and nurse education. So this \nwill encourage people to come back into providing that excellent \nservice. To deal with the shortage right now, this legislation will \nexpand the number of nonimmigrant skilled workers visa slots for nurses \nserving in medically underserved areas.\n  To expand access to those most vulnerable, Ten Steps reaffirms the \ncommitment to current programs that are working, such as the Community \nHealth Centers program and the loan repayment programs at the National \nHealth Service Corps. Working together, these two programs provide key \nsupport in underserved areas.\n  To allow for greater access to health care services, clarification \nwill be made that convenient care clinics may accept and receive \nreimbursement from Medicaid and SCHIP patients. These convenient care \nclinics are small health care facilities located in retail outlets \nproviding affordable and accessible nonemergency health care from \nnurses, physician assistants, and physicians. Often open 7 days a week, \nthese clinics provide an option for those seeking routine and \npreventive care services in a more convenient setting--at the retail \noutlets--and with patients seen typically within 15 minutes.\n  Finally, building upon the successes of current rural health \nprograms, Ten Steps will ensure appropriate development of rural health \nsystems and access to care for residents in rural areas.\n\n[[Page S9149]]\n\n  In providing access to health care, I believe it is important to \nenvision where we want to provide that care. Community and home-based \ncare is often much preferred, less costly, and proven to increase \nquality of life. To encourage innovative approaches to keeping long-\nterm care in residential settings, competitive grants will be available \nto give seniors more options for receiving care in home or community-\nbased settings. We just had a hearing on that subject in the HELP \nCommittee. It was both very helpful and very convincing.\n  The final step to Ten Steps decreases the skyrocketing cost of health \ncare by restoring reliability in our medical justice system through \nState-based solutions. The bill I have been discussing today includes \nthe Fair and Reliable Medical Justice Act, which I just introduced with \nSenator Baucus, for States to encourage early disclosure of preventable \nhealth care errors, prompt and fair compensation for injured patients, \nand careful analysis on patterns of health care errors to prevent \nfuture injuries. By funding demonstration projects, States are enabled \nto experiment with and learn from ideas leading to long-term solutions \ntailored to the unique circumstances of each State.\n  No one--not patients or health care providers--is appropriately \nserved by our current medical litigation procedures. Right now, many \npatients who are hurt by negligent actions receive no compensation for \ntheir loss. Those who do receive merely 40 cents of every premium \ndollar, given the high cost of legal fees and administrative costs. \nThat is simply a waste of medical resources.\n  Furthermore, the likelihood and the outcomes of lawsuits and \nsettlements bear little relation to whether the health care provider \nwas at fault. Consequently, we are not learning from our mistakes. \nRather, we are simply diverting our doctors. When someone has a medical \nemergency, they want to see a doctor in an operating room, not a \ncourtroom.\n  The medical liability system is losing information that could be used \nto improve the practice of medicine. Although zero medical errors is an \nunattainable goal, the reduction of medical errors should be the \nultimate goal in medical reform. The Institute of Medicine, in its \nlandmark study called ``To Err is Human,'' estimated that preventable \nmedical errors kill somewhere between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans each \nyear. That study further emphasized that to improve our health care \noutcomes, we should no longer focus on individual situations but on the \nwhole system of care that is failing American patients.\n  In the 8 years since that study, little progress has been made. \nInstead, the practice of medicine has become more specialized and \ncomplex while the tort system is more focused on individual blame than \non a system safety.\n  I realize I have talked for quite a bit about Ten Steps, and given \nthe current crisis, we should be talking a lot more about real \nsolutions, not just problems. I also want everyone to know I believe \nthe introduction of this bill today is simply the first step forward. I \nlook forward to talking with others about their thoughts on how to \nimprove this proposal, how to better refine it so it can better serve \nall Americans.\n  With all of that talk, I also want action, real action, to provide \nreal coverage for Americans, not a large expansion of a government \nprogram with a huge pricetag that does little to impact those who are \nuninsured.\n  We have an opportunity, we have an obligation to take care of the \npeople of this country, and they are demanding it. Let's work from a \nbasis of some information and see where we can take it so that we get a \nsolution and we get action now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Cantwell, and Ms. Landrieu):\n\n  S. 1784. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to improve programs \nfor veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nMilitary Reservist and Veteran Small Business Reauthorization and \nOpportunity Act. As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I am gratified that I was able to work \nwith Ranking Member Senator Snowe on behalf of the 25 million veterans \ncurrently in America, including over 1 million who have left military \nservice since September 11, 2001. As the conflicts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan continue, the number of veterans, including service \ndisabled veterans, will increase and reservists will continue to carry \nmore of the burden then ever before. As veterans and reservists reenter \ncivilian life, the small business programs provided by the Federal \nGovernment will become even more critical. I am serious about \naddressing the problems affecting veterans and reservists who wish or \nare already engaged in small business and this bill is another step \nforward in doing so.\n  The Military Reservist and Veteran Small Business Reauthorization and \nOpportunity Act of 2007 reauthorizes the veteran programs in the Small \nBusiness Administration. Specifically, this legislation increases the \nfunding authorization for the Office of Veteran Business Development \nfrom $2 million today to $2.5 million over three years. In light of the \nlarge numbers of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and \nincreased responsibilities placed on this office by Executive Order \n13360, it is high time that the Office of Veteran Business Development \nreceive the funding levels that it needs.\n  The bill also creates an Interagency Task Force to improve \ncoordination between agencies in administrating veteran small business \nprograms. One of the biggest complaints that our Committee heard at the \n``Assessing Federal Small Business Assistance Programs for Veterans and \nReservists'' hearing held on January 31st was that Federal agencies do \nnot work together in reaching out to veterans and informing them about \nsmall business programs. This task force is an attempt to improve that. \nThe task force is composed of representatives from Small Business \nAdministration, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, \nDepartment of Labor, General Services Administration, Office of \nManagement Budget and four veterans service organizations appointed by \nthe President. The task force will focus on increasing veterans' small \nbusiness success, including procurement and franchising opportunities, \naccess to capital, and other types of business development assistance.\n  This bill also permanently extends the SBA Advisory Committee on \nVeterans Business Affairs. The committee was created to serve as an \nindependent source of advice and policy recommendations to the SBA, the \nCongress, and the President. The veteran small business owners who \nserve on this committee provide a unique perspective which is sorely \nneeded at this challenging time. Unfortunately, continuing uncertainty \nabout the Committee's future has, at times, distracted the committee \nfrom focusing on its core function. Therefore, I have called for its \npermanent extension. It is clear to me that more needs to be done to \naddress the issues facing veterans and reservists, and the role this \ncommittee plays will continue to be important.\n  Additionally, I have taken a number of steps to better serve the \nreservists who are serving their country abroad while their businesses \nare suffering at home. Over the past decade, the Department of Defense \nhas increased its reliance on the National Guard and reserves. This has \nintensified since September 11, 2001, and increased deployments are \nexpected to continue. The affect of this increase on reservists and \nsmall businesses continues to remain of concern. A 2003 GAO report \nindicated that 41 percent of reservists lost income when mobilized. \nThis had a higher effect on self-employed reservists, 55 percent of \nwhom lost income.\n\n  In 1999, I created the Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster \nLoan, MREIDL, program to provide loans to small businesses that incur \neconomic injury as a result of an essential employee being called to \nactive duty. However, since 2002, fewer than 300 of these loans have \nbeen approved by the SBA, despite record numbers of reservists being \ncalled to active duty. It is clear that changes need to be made, so \nthat reservists are informed about the availability of the MREIDL \nprogram and that the program better meets their needs.\n  At the hearing on January 31, we heard suggestions for a number of\n\n[[Page S9150]]\n\nchanges which would improve the Military Reservist Economic Injury \nDisaster Loan program, and I have included those changes in this bill. \nThey include increasing the application deadline for such a loan from \n90 days to 1 year following the date of discharge; creating a \npredeployment loan approval process; and improved outreach and \ntechnical assistance.\n  This bill also increases to $50,000 the amount SBA can disburse \nwithout requiring collateral under the MREIDL program. Reservist \nfamilies have already sacrificed enough when a family member goes away \nto serve their country and when their business is harmed as a result. \nThis loan program would allow reservist dependent businesses to access \nthe capital they need to stay afloat without having to sacrifice beyond \nthe service of the key employees. In order to give reservists time to \nrepay the loans, the non-collaterized loan created in this bill would \nnot accumulate interest or require payments for one year or until after \nthe deployment ends, whichever is longer.\n  While addressing the funding needs of reservists is essential, I also \nwant to make sure that reservists receive the technical and management \nassistance they need to succeed. For that reason, this bill also \nincludes the establishment of the Reservists Enterprise Transition and \nSustainability Task Force. This grant program would allow Small \nBusiness Development Centers, Women's Business Centers and veteran \ncenters to compete for grants to create programs that help small \nbusinesses prepare for and cope with the mobilization of reservist-\nemployees and owners.\n  There are two more provisions which will help this Nation's service \nmembers. One section of the bill will require the SBA to give priority \nto MREIDL loans during loan processing. Another provision will give \nactivated service members an extension of any SBA time limitations \nequal to the time spent on active duty. This will make it easier for \nservice members to serve their country while continuing to meet their \nobligations at home.\n  Lastly, this bill calls for two reports. One report will look at the \nneeds of service-disabled veterans who are interested in becoming \nentrepreneurs. As a result of the war on terror and improved medicine, \nwe are seeing more service-disabled veterans than we have seen in \ndecades. For some service-disabled veterans, entrepreneurship is the \nbest or only way of achieving economic independence. Therefore, it is \nessential that we understand and take steps to address the needs of the \nservice-disabled veteran entrepreneur or small business owner.\n  This bill also calls for a study to investigate how to improve \nrelations between reservists and their employers. In January, the \nCommittee heard that recent changes by the Department of Defense to \npolicies regulating the length and frequency of reservist deployments \nis harming the ability of reservists to find jobs and the ability of \nsmall business owners to continue hiring them. Witnesses testified \nabout reservists being turned down or not considered for jobs because \nthey are reservists. I have heard reservists talk about being pressured \nto leave the reserves if they would like to continue to advance at \nwork. I have also heard the concerns of small business owners who want \nto support servicemembers; however, they cannot do so if it means the \nsurvival of their business. Understanding more about this issue is \nimportant and essential to making sure that policymakers can continue \nto support citizen soldiers and the small businesses that employ them \nacross the Nation.\n\n  Veterans possess great technical skills and valuable leadership \nexperience, but they require financial resources and small business \ntraining to turn that potential into a viable enterprise. A recent \nreport by the Small Business Administration stated that 22 percent of \nveterans plan to start or are starting a business when they leave the \nmilitary. For service-disabled veterans, this number rises to 28 \npercent. This bill is another step forward in providing the necessary \nresources for veterans and reservists to succeed in starting or growing \na small business.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1784\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today, with Senator \nKerry, to introduce the Military Reservist and Veteran Small Business \nReauthorization and Opportunity Act of 2007. This bill improves the \nprograms and resources available to our Nation's veteran entrepreneurs \nand the small businesses that employ our veterans.\n  Thank you, Senator Kerry, for working so closely with me on this \nbipartisan legislation and for your long\n\n[[Page S9153]]\n\nstanding commitment to our Nation's veterans. This bipartisan measure \ncontains key provisions from both S. 904, the Veterans Small Business \nOpportunity Act of 2007, which I introduced in March, and Senator \nKerry's S. 1005, Military Reservist and Veteran Small Business \nReauthorization Act of 2007. It is truly critical that all of our \nfellow Senators, on both sides of the aisle, continue to collaborate on \nour veterans' behalf and support swift passage of this legislation.\n  In October 2003, I requested a Congressional Budget Office Report \nentitled ``The Effects of Reserve Call-Ups on Civilian Employers.'' \nThat report, issued in May 2005, highlighted the problems that our \nnation's small businesses face when their owners or key employees are \n``called up'' to serve in defense of our Nation. In response to that \nreport's findings, I offered two bills to improve the resources and \nprograms targeted to these veterans and small businesses. Those bills, \nS. 1014, the Supporting our Patriotic Businesses Act, and S. 3122, the \nPatriot Loan Act of 2006, were the genesis of S. 904 that I introduced \nearlier this year. Similarly, Senator Kerry has an established history \nof working on these issues, and the Small Business Committee on January \n31 held its first hearing of the 110th Congress regarding programs to \nassist veterans and reservists.\n  In recent years, our Nation's Guard and Reserve forces, which I \ncollectively refer to as reservists, have selflessly answered the call \nto duty in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, there have been over \n425,000 reservist deployments, including nearly 3,000 from my home \nState of Maine, to those two countries since September 11, 2001. With \nthe majority of nongovernmental reservists either being self-employed \nor working for small businesses, it is easy to see that veteran \nentrepreneurs and small businesses are profoundly and \ndisproportionately impacted by these deployments.\n  As our reservists answer our Nation's call to duty, we must similarly \nfulfill our obligations to help protect their livelihood back home. In \naddition to addressing this responsibility, our legislation includes \nother broad provisions to help our Nation's veteran entrepreneurs \nacross the board.\n  First, our bill makes vast improvements to the Small Business \nAdministration's, SBA, Military Reservist Economic Disaster Loan, \nMREIDL, program. The MREIDL program provides funds to businesses to \nmeet ordinary and necessary business expenses that they could have \nmade, if not for the deployment of a reservist who is one of their \nessential employees.\n  Specifically, the bill establishes a preapplication process so \nbusinesses can be prepared, in advance, to apply for an MREIDL and \nincludes a provision allowing a businesses up to 1 year, as opposed to \n90 days, to apply. The legislation increases, from $1.5 million to $2 \nmillion, the maximum MREIDL loan a business can take and raises, from \n$5,000 to $50,000, the level of uncollateralized MREIDL loans available \nto businesses. Finally, our changes to the MREIDL program would allow \nthe SBA Administrator to defer the payment of principal and interest \nwhile the employee is deployed.\n  Second, the measure also includes a national reservist enterprise \ntransition and sustainability provision. This provision would allow the \nSBA to award grants to entities that assist businesses with preparing \nand implementing a business strategy to cover the period of time that \nthe owner is called-up on active duty through 6 months after that \nowner's date of return.\n  Third, our bill would create a new Interagency Task Force to \ncoordinate the efforts of Federal agencies necessary to increase \ncapital and business development opportunities for, and increase the \naward of Federal contracting opportunities to, small businesses owned \nand controlled by veterans. This type of coordinated and targeted \neffort by our Federal Government is long overdue.\n  Finally, today's legislation would increase funding for the SBA's \nOffice of Veterans Business Development, and permanently extend the \nduties and responsibilities of the SBA Advisory Committee on Veterans \nBusiness Affairs. It would also allow small businesses owned and \noperated by veterans to extend their SBA program participation time \nlimitations by the duration of their owner's deployment.\n  While I have not provided an exhaustive list of this bill's \nprovisions and all that it would do, a simple review of the legislation \nwill reveal that it goes far toward helping our nation's veteran \nentrepreneurs and our patriotic small businesses that employ \nreservists, despite the risk that deployments entail. Our legislation \nis not a silver bullet, but it is certainly a step in the right \ndirection. To that end, I urge my colleagues to join us in support of \nthis bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/12/senate-section/article/S9153-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9153-S9154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 269--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n CITIZENS' STAMP ADVISORY COMMITTEE SHOULD RECOMMEND TO THE POSTMASTER \nGENERAL THAT A COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP BE ISSUED IN HONOR OF FORMER \n              UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE BARBARA JORDAN\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \nSpecter, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Durbin, \nMr. Biden, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Boxer, and Ms. Landrieu) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs:\n\n                              S.

SPECIAL INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR AFGHANISTAN \n                   RECONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A democratic, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan is \n     vital to the national security of the United States and to \n     combating international terrorism.\n       (2) Since the fall of the Taliban, the United States has \n     provided Afghanistan with over $20,000,000,000 in \n     reconstruction and security assistance. However, repeated and \n     documented incidents of waste, fraud, and abuse in the \n     utilization of these funds have undermined reconstruction \n     efforts.\n       (3) There is a stronger need for vigorous oversight of \n     spending by the United States on reconstruction programs and \n     projects in Afghanistan.\n       (4) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and \n     departmental Inspectors General provide valuable information \n     on such activities.\n       (5) The congressional oversight process requires more \n     timely reporting of reconstruction activities in Afghanistan \n     that encompasses the efforts of the Department of State, the \n     Department of Defense, and the United States Agency for \n     International Development and highlights specific acts of \n     waste, fraud, and abuse.\n       (6) One example of such successful reporting is provided by \n     the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \n     (SIGIR), which has met this objective in the case of Iraq.\n       (7) The establishment of a Special Inspector General for \n     Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) position using SIGIR as a \n     model will help achieve this objective in Afghanistan. This \n     position will help Congress and the American people to better \n     understand the challenges facing United States programs and \n     projects in that crucial country.\n       (8) It is a priority for Congress to establish a Special \n     Inspector General for Afghanistan position with similar \n     responsibilities and duties as the Special Inspector General \n     for Iraq Reconstruction. This new position will monitor \n     United States assistance to Afghanistan in the civilian and \n     security sectors, undertaking efforts similar to those of the \n     Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.\n       (b) Office of Inspector General.--There is hereby \n     established the Office of the Special Inspector General for \n     Afghanistan Reconstruction.\n       (c) Appointment of Inspector General; Removal.--\n       (1) Appointment.--The head of the Office of the Special \n     Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction is the \n     Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (in \n     this section referred to as the ``Inspector General''), who \n     shall be appointed by the President.\n       (2) Qualifications.--The appointment of the Inspector \n     General shall be made solely on the basis of integrity and \n     demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial \n     analysis, law, management analysis, public administration, or \n     investigations.\n       (3) Deadline for appointment.--The nomination of an \n     individual as Inspector General shall be made not later than \n     30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (4) Removal.--The Inspector General shall be removable from \n     office in accordance with the provisions of section 3(b) of \n     the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 4102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States Government \n     deemed as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born and \n     300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and their \n     families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification and limited their travel and personal property \n     rights. At that time, these groups were the 2 largest \n     foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (2) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned, or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to European Axis nations, many to be \n     exchanged for Americans held in those nations.\n       (3) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American nations, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were arrested, brought to \n     the United States, and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated, or deported to European Axis nations during \n     World War II, many to be exchanged for Americans and Latin \n     Americans held in those nations.\n       (4) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian American and German American \n     communities, individuals, and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (6) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution or genocide and sought safety in the United \n     States. During the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, \n     immigration regulations, visa requirements, and the time \n     required to process visa applications affected the number of \n     Jewish refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, \n     who could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (7) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to fully assess and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (8) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. 4103.

RELIEF OF RICHARD M. BARLOW OF SANTA FE, NEW \n                   MEXICO.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Richard Barlow was a counter-proliferation intelligence \n     officer with expertise in Pakistan nuclear issues.\n       (2) From 1980-82, Mr. Barlow served as the action officer \n     for Pakistan proliferation matters at the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency.\n       (3) In 1985, Mr. Barlow joined the Central Intelligence \n     Agency, becoming a recognized issue expert on Pakistan's \n     clandestine nuclear purchasing networks and its weapons \n     programs.\n       (4) After serving as a Special Agent with the Customs \n     Service, Mr. Barlow then joined the Office of the Secretary \n     of Defense starting in 1989, where he continued to \n     investigate Pakistan's nuclear weapons network headed by A. \n     Q. Khan.\n       (5) Mr. Barlow was instrumental in the 1987 arrest and \n     later conviction of 2 agents in Pakistan's nuclear weapons \n     development program headed by A. Q. Khan, for which he \n     received an award for exceptional accomplishment from the \n     Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and numerous \n     commendations from senior State Department and law \n     enforcement officials.\n       (6) In addition, Mr. Barlow received a prestigious \n     commendation from the State Department's Legal Advisor for \n     assistance to President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of State \n     George P. Schultz for triggering the Solarz Amendment \n     relating to termination of military and economic aid to \n     Pakistan for exporting nuclear weapons technology.\n       (7) In a classified hearing following the arrests of the \n     Pakistani agents, Mr. Barlow, as the Central Intelligence \n     Agency's top expert, testified truthfully to the Subcommittee \n     on Asian Pacific Affairs of the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives, then known as the \n     House Foreign Affairs Committee, that the arrested Pakistanis \n     were agents of the Pakistani government, and revealed that \n     Pakistan had continued to regularly violate United States \n     nuclear export laws.\n       (8) Mr. Barlow's actions revealed that certain Executive \n     Branch officials had been withholding this information from \n     the Congressional committees.\n       (9) In 1989, Mr. Barlow joined the Office of the Secretary \n     of Defense in the Office of Non-proliferation where he \n     continued to investigate Pakistani proliferation networks.\n       (10) In April 1989, Mr. Barlow received an outstanding \n     performance review from his Department of Defense \n     supervisors, and in June 1989 he was promoted.\n       (11) During the spring and early summer of 1989, Mr. Barlow \n     told his supervisors on a number of occasions that he had \n     serious concerns that Executive Branch officials were \n     concealing intelligence about Pakistan's nuclear program from \n     Congress and were obstructing pending criminal investigations \n     into Pakistan's procurement efforts in order to avoid \n     triggering the Pressler and Solarz Amendments and to obtain \n     approval for a proposed $1,400,000,000 sale of F-16 jets to \n     Pakistan.\n       (12) On August 2, 1989, Mr. Barlow raised concerns about \n     false testimony given by senior officials to the Congress on \n     Pakistan's nuclear capabilities to the Subcommittee on Asian \n     Pacific Affairs of the Committee on International Relations \n     of the House.\n       (13) On August 4, 1989, several weeks after being promoted, \n     Richard Barlow was handed a notice of pending termination.\n       (14) On August 8, 1989, Mr. Barlow's security clearances \n     were suspended for reasons that were classified and not \n     revealed to him.\n       (15) On August 26, 1989, Mr. Barlow, under threat of \n     firing, was offered a series of menial, temporary assignments \n     by Department of Defense personnel and security officials \n     concerned about possible retaliation against him as a \n     Congressional whistleblower by senior officials in the Office \n     of the Secretary of Defense.\n       (16) Mr. Barlow then underwent a 9-month long security \n     investigation involving numerous allegations levied against \n     him by his superiors in the Office of Secretary of Defense, \n     all of which were found to be false.\n       (17) In March of 1990, Mr. Barlow then had his security \n     clearance restored and remained in a series of temporary \n     assignments until February 1992, when he then resigned under \n     duress.\n       (18) At the time of his separation from government service, \n     Mr. Barlow had completed 8 years of government service.\n       (19) Mr. Barlow's temporary loss of his security clearance \n     and personnel actions against him damaged his reputation and \n     left him unable to find suitable employment inside the \n     Government.\n       (20) For the next 15 years, Mr. Barlow continued to serve \n     his country as a consultant to the intelligence and law \n     enforcement communities working on complex \n     counterintelligence and counter-proliferation operations \n     without the benefits he would have had if he had continued as \n     a Federal employee.\n       (21) In 1998, the Senate approved a private relief \n     resolution, Senate Resolution 253 (105th Congress) to provide \n     compensation for Richard Barlow's losses on ``the nature, \n     extent, and character of the claim for compensation referred \n     to in such bill as a legal or equitable claim against the \n     United States or a gratuity''.\n       (22) With Senate Resolution 253, the Senate recognized the \n     importance of protecting Federal employees who inform \n     Congress of Executive Branch distortions of the truth and \n     other wrongdoing.\n       (23) On March 6, 2000, the Government filed a protective \n     order under the state secrets privilege for documents \n     requested under discovery by Mr. Barlow relating to the \n     Pakistan nuclear program.\n       (24) The documents denied under the state secret privilege \n     were documents that Mr. Barlow had official access to prior \n     to the loss of clearance.\n       (25) The documents denied under the state secrets privilege \n     were subpoenaed by Mr. Barlow to substantiate the allegations \n     he originally made regarding his claim of false testimony of \n     Government officials to Congress on the Pakistan nuclear \n     weapons program and the actions taken against him.\n       (26) The evidence withheld from the Court as a result of \n     the state secrets privilege included significant, sworn \n     statements from a number of senior intelligence, Department \n     of State, and Department of Defense officials corroborating \n     Mr. Barlow's charges of Executive Branch wrongdoing.\n       (27) As a result of the use of the state secrets privilege, \n     Mr. Barlow and the United States Court of Federal Claims did \n     not have access to evidence and information necessary to \n     evaluate the key information relating to the merits of Mr. \n     Barlow's case and accurately report its findings to the \n     Senate.\n       (28) Since Mr. Barlow's separation from government service \n     in 1992, five Senate and five House committees have \n     intervened in support of Mr. Barlow's case on a bipartisan \n     basis, and investigations by the Central Intelligence Agency, \n     State Department Inspectors General, and the Government \n     Accountability Office have corroborated Mr. Barlow's findings \n     or found that personnel actions were taken against him in \n     reprisal.\n       (29) Richard Barlow is recognized for his patriotism and \n     service to his country.\n       (b) Compensation of Certain Losses.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay, \n     out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, \n     to Richard M. Barlow of Santa Fe, New Mexico, the sum of \n     $1,800,000 for compensation for losses incurred by Richard M. \n     Barlow relating to and a direct consequence of--\n       (A) personnel actions taken by the Department of Defense \n     affecting Richard Barlow's employment at the Department \n     (including Richard Barlow's top secret security clearance) \n     during the period beginning on August 4, 1989, and ending on \n     February 27, 1992; and\n       (B) Richard Barlow's separation from service with the \n     Department of Defense on February 27, 1992.\n       (2) No inference of liability.--Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed as an inference of liability on the part \n     of the United States.\n       (3) No agents and attorneys fees.--None of the payment \n     authorized by this section may be paid to or received by any \n     agent or attorney for any services rendered in connection \n     with obtaining such payment. Any person who violates this \n     subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be \n     subject to a fine in the amount provided in title 18, United \n     States Code.\n       (4) Non-taxability of payment.--The payment authorized by \n     this section is in partial reimbursement for losses incurred \n     by Richard Barlow as a result of the personnel actions taken \n     by the Department of Defense and is not subject to Federal, \n     State, or local income taxes.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 2178.

The\n\n[[Page S9186]]\n\nrecommended legislation necessary to implement the Convention will be \nsubmitted to the Congress separately.\n  This Convention is important in the campaign against international \nterrorism.
