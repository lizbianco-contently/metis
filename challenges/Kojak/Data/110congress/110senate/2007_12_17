Mr. President, I will proceed on leader time so as not \nto encroach on the complicated agreement we reached on dividing time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, heading into our last work week, \nRepublicans remain focused on the two principles that have guided us \nall year: protecting and defending the country from harm and protecting \ntaxpayers' wallets. In these last few days, we will face some of the \nmost crucial tests of the year on both fronts.\n  On security, Senate Republicans will amend the House version of the \nAppropriations bill to include funding for the troops in Iraq. Our men \nand women in uniform deserve our support wherever they are serving.\n  These funds are dangerously overdue. Delaying them further could put \nthe Pentagon in serious straits and potentially jeopardize the \nuniversally acknowledged gains of the Petraeus plan.\n  We will also need to act wisely on reforming the FISA law that lets \nour intelligence agents track terrorists overseas. The success of this \nlaw over the last several years should be obvious to everyone.\n  The Intelligence Committee has produced a bill that would retain its \ncore strengths; that has broad bipartisan support; and that, with \nslight modification, the President would sign into law. We need to act \non this version of the revision without any political games.\n  On protecting taxpayers, we have two major pieces of legislation to \nfinish: AMT, and a fiscally responsible omnibus bill.\n  A quarter of the way into the fiscal year, we have passed 1 of 12 \nAppropriations bills from last year.\n  We need to evaluate this omnibus and make sure it is written in a \nform the President will sign. That means funding for our forces in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, no excess spending, and no poison pills in the \nform of politically motivated policy riders.\n  Crucially, we also need to assure middle-class Americans we are not \ngoing to raise their taxes or further delay their tax refunds. The \nHouse needs to patch the AMT tax that now threatens 23 million \ntaxpayers it was never meant to affect, and they need to do so without \nraising other taxes on these households.\n  We saw last week we could get legislation out the door when we work \ntogether. After Republican insistence, we passed an energy bill without \nraising taxes or utility rates. We will need to repeat that effort this \nweek on several issues that lie at the very heart of our \nresponsibilities to the American people.\n  We need to ensure the safety of our citizens. We need to keep them \nfrom being hit by new and unnecessary taxes.\n  We will need to do all this and act on several important executive \nnominations. New week. Much to do. America's watching. Let's get to \nwork.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12 noon is equally divided and controlled between the two leaders \nor their designees, with the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, \ncontrolling 35 minutes and the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, \ncontrolling 15 minutes of the opponents' time.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am not a part of the order as read \nby the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator has been allocated 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  Today, the Senate begins debate on S. 2248, the FISA Amendments Act \nof 2007. I am confident in saying without any risk of exaggeration that \nFISA modernization is one of the most important matters that will be \nconsidered by this Congress. It calls on us to get two essential \nmatters entirely right--protection of our national security and the \npreservation of the privacy of our citizens.\n  I am proud of the substance of the bill the Intelligence Committee \nreported to the Senate in late October on a strong bipartisan vote of \n13 to 2. I am equally proud of the process by which we achieved that \nresult. The distinguished vice chairman of the committee, Senator \nChristopher Bond, and I provided simple guidance for all who worked on \nthis bill: First, work together, reach out; second, reach out \nparticularly to the intelligence community and the Department of \nJustice for their expertise; third, keep in mind at all times the \nfundamental principles of protecting both the security and the privacy \nof all Americans; and finally, remain united in our effort to produce a \nbill that will meet the test of Congress and that will be signed into \nlaw by the President.\n  I am also grateful to all members of our committee for their \ncontribution. As the Senate can see from our report, we debated and \nvoted on highly important issues. We then sought as a committee to lay \nout for the entire Senate and the American public a description of our \nbill, the reasons for it, and, in additional views, further \nimprovements that Members might seek. Our report is on each Member's \ndesk. It is also on our committee's Web site and the Web site of the \nLibrary of Congress. I urge every Member of the Senate to read it, \nincluding a careful section-by-section explanation of the bill.\n  Of course, some sensitive intelligence matters cannot be described in \na public report. That makes this something of an awkward procedure. If \nany Member has a question about a classified matter, please let the \nvice chairman or myself know, and we will do our best to\n\n[[Page S15711]]\n\nanswer your questions in a classified setting.\n  I am also pleased that we will be sharing the management of this \ndebate with Senator Leahy and Senator Specter, the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. From the very \nbeginning of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1976, it has \nbeen a joint responsibility of the Intelligence Committee and the \nJudiciary Committee. It is, after all, a statute that concerns both \nintelligence collection and judicial proceedings. The Judiciary \nCommittee considered the Intelligence Committee bill on sequential \nreferral and has reported a proposed amendment to our bill.\n  In accordance with Senate rules, the Senate has before it only one \nbill; that is, the Intelligence Committee bill, S. 2248. The \nlegislative recommendations proposed by the Judiciary Committee will be \nthe first pending amendment. Some of the suggestions the Judiciary \nCommittee made improve the quality of our product.\n  I commend Majority Leader Reid for his decision to bring the FISA \nbill before the Senate under the regular order. While some advocated \nbringing before the Senate a hybrid bill which combined parts of both \ncommittees' work into one bill, the majority leader recognized that \nfollowing regular order would not only allow for orderly consideration \nof important amendments but ultimately produce an even stronger \nbipartisan bill.\n  The products of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees have a lot \nin common. Both fix a number of deficiencies in the flawed Protect \nAmerica Act, hastily passed in August, as we all remember. Both \nstrengthen our national security while protecting American civil \nliberties and privacy rights through enhanced and mandatory court \nreview and approval of surveillance activities. Both would greatly \nimprove oversight and accountability and ensure that the unchecked \nwiretapping policies of the Bush administration are a thing of the \npast.\n\n  Finally, each committee's work includes a sunset provision. Each \nstrengthens the exclusivity of FISA--all concepts to be explained. Each \nestablishes court approval of surveillance of Americans overseas--\nperhaps the most important of all the amendments. But there are \ndifferences in how each committee went about effecting these important \nprotections.\n  Over the past month, we have worked very closely--our staffs--\ntogether to determine how best to reconcile the work of the two \ncommittees. It has been a bipartisan, straightforward process. I \nbelieve we have been able to work out a number of important amendments \nthat take elements of the Judiciary Committee's work and add them to \nthe underlying Intelligence Committee bill. There are some elements of \nthe Judiciary Committee substitute amendment, however, that I do not \nsupport, but in all instances, I deeply appreciate the work of Senator \nLeahy and our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee.\n  I commend in particular the extraordinary contribution during this \nprocess of four Senators serving on both committees: Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Hatch, Senator Feingold, and Senator Whitehouse. They have \nworked tirelessly in their dual committee assignments to make this \nlegislation as sound and balanced as possible.\n  Before I go into any details of the legislation and the expected \ndebate over the next few days, I want to briefly remind my colleagues \nof the history of the debate and why FISA modernizing is so important.\n  The need to modernize FISA is explained by looking at the convergence \nof three elements in recent years. One is the rapid change of the \nworld's communications systems, with new challenges and opportunities \nfor signals intelligence arising from the fact that much of the foreign \nintelligence information now passes through or is stored in American \nelectronic space. The second change is the significant increase in the \nnumber of intelligence targets outside of the United States, \nparticularly as a result of international terrorism but also from \nweapons of mass destruction proliferation and other foreign threats. \nThe final key judgment is that the 30-year-old FISA law has required a \nlarge number of individual applications to the FISA Court for the \nsurveillance of foreign persons outside the United States, which was \nnever intended--which was never intended--under the original \nlegislation and does not involve the privacy of Americans.\n  So the question before our committee was not whether to modernize \nFISA but how to modernize FISA. We began this effort in March of this \nyear, when the vice chairman, Senator Bond, and I notified the Attorney \nGeneral of our intention to address FISA modernization. We also advised \nthe Attorney General we would focus on whether legislation should be \nenacted to address the legal consequences of the President's \nwarrantless surveillance program; namely, the many lawsuits resulting \nfrom the President's decision to act outside of the statutory \nrequirements of FISA. In response, the Director of National \nIntelligence submitted a legislative proposal in April, which the \nIntelligence Committee began to consider at a public hearing in May.\n  These efforts to address FISA, however, were stalled for several \nmonths because of disagreements with the administration over access to \nkey documents relating to the President's warrantless surveillance \nprogram. Yet, given the pressing need to fix FISA and allow for timely \ncollection, we made a concerted effort over the summer to produce a \nbill that both the Congress and the administration could support. \nUnfortunately, it did not work. The result of that effort ended in the \nhastily passed and significantly flawed Protect America Act, which \nallowed for timely collection, yes, but did not include significant \nFISA Court safeguards.\n  In order to fix the Protect America Act and protect the privacy of \nAmericans while strengthening the timely collection of intelligence, \nour Intelligence Committee spent several months this fall working on a \nnew bill--the bill before us today--which accomplishes four principal \nreforms.\n  First, the special procedures provided by this bill apply only to \npersons outside the United States. If somebody is in the United \nStates--an American is in the United States--all the traditional \nprovisions and protections of FISA continue to apply. Everyone agrees \nthis should be the case. The distinction of whether the target of \nsurveillance is foreign or domestic makes it imperative that there is \nan adequate basis for determining whether somebody is reasonably \nbelieved to be outside the United States.\n  An important safeguard for Americans in the bill is the requirement \nfor court-approved targeting procedures that are reasonably designed to \naccurately make the determination whether somebody is outside of the \nUnited States. The Protect America Act had included that requirement, \nand our bill does the same. But the Protect America Act had limited the \nauthority of the FISA Court to review the reasonableness of those \nprocedures by imposing a ``clearly erroneous standard'' on that review. \nOur bill strikes that limitation.\n  Second, our bill recognizes that minimization procedures have been an \nessential part of FISA from the beginning and will continue to play an \nessential role. These will be explained. These are procedures to \nensure, among other things, that if Americans are overheard in \nconversations of a foreign target or there is discussion about \nAmericans, that the identity of those Americans only be revealed within \nthe U.S. Government if there is a good foreign intelligence purpose for \nso doing.\n  The Protect America Act had provided that the Attorney General \napprove minimization procedures, but it did not provide for court \nreview of them. Our bill corrects that deficiency. The FISA Court will \nnow have the responsibility to ensure that the procedures comply with \nthe law.\n  Thirdly, our bill provides protections for U.S. citizens who are \noutside the United States. Under the Protect America Act, if a U.S. \ncitizen sets foot outside the United States, he or she would be treated \nthe same as any foreigner outside the United States.\n  The Intelligence Committee rejects the proposition that Americans \nlose rights--any kind of rights--because they travel or work elsewhere \nin the world. An essential part of the rights of an American is the \ndetermination by a judge whether there is probable cause to believe an \nAmerican outside the United States is a lawful subject of surveillance \nby our own Government.\n\n[[Page S15712]]\n\n  This is a concept which both committees--Democrats and Republicans \nalike--agreed to. Director of National Intelligence Mitch McConnell \nendorsed this change in law as well in testimony before the \nIntelligence Committee. There are, however, some differences in how to \naccomplish this. After considerable negotiation, I believe we have \nreached an agreement on a bipartisan amendment which would reconcile \nthe approaches of the two committees and resolve the concerns of the \nadministration over unintended consequences of the language reported \nout by both committees.\n  It is my hope, given the centrality of this reform to the work of \nboth committees, that this bipartisan amendment is the first one before \nthe Senate once cloture is invoked, if it is invoked and we are, \ntherefore, then on the bill.\n  The fourth principal accomplishment of the Intelligence Committee \nbill is that it considerably enhances oversight of these protections by \neach branch of Government. This is achieved through a series of annual \nreports to Congress on the authorized collection, including instances \nof noncompliance; inspector general reviews by the Justice Department \nand the intelligence community; and FISA Court review and approval of \nacquisition and minimization procedures.\n  As we begin debate on these and other important issues, one of the \nconcepts the Senate will hear a lot about is exclusivity. Exclusivity \naddresses the question of whether FISA and the laws that explicitly \ngovern the domestic interception of communications for law enforcement \npurposes are the exclusive means by which the President may authorize \nthe surveillance of Americans.\n  The President claims that he has the authority as Commander in Chief \nto approve surveillance even when he has no statutory authority to do \nso. No act of Congress by itself can finally resolve that debate \nbetween Presidential and congressional authority, but what Congress can \nmake clear is which statutes authorize electronic surveillance.\n  The significance of this, in connection with our recent national \nexperience, is that the Department of Justice has claimed that the \nauthorization to use military force, passed in response to 9/11, \nsomehow authorized the President to disregard FISA. Not only is this \nproposition dubious at best, in my opinion, it is also dangerous. In \nfact, the next time Congress is asked to act quickly in response to an \nattack, should there be one, it may pause and take time to consider \nwhether its authorization to use force will have completely unintended \nconsequences, such as authorizing the President unlimited power to \nviolate acts of Congress.\n  To make sure authorizations for the use of military force do not \nagain become an excuse to wipe away acts of Congress, both the \nIntelligence and Judiciary Committees sought to make even clearer than \nbefore which statutes constitute the exclusive means for conducting \nelectronic surveillance.\n  I believe we have been able to work out language on an amendment that \nwill reconcile the differences in these two bills.\n  The Intelligence Committee also establishes a 6-year sunset for the \nnew authority it provides. A sunset is essential because we owe it to \nthe American people to make sure we have gotten both parts of this \nsystem right--effective intelligence collection and the protection of \nthe privacy of Americans--before settling on what should be permanent \nlaw. The Judiciary Committee amendment proposes a 4-year sunset. The \nHouse FISA bill provides for a 2-year sunset. The administration \nopposes any sunset. I will join with Chairman Leahy in support of an \namendment to incorporate the Judiciary Committee 4-year sunset into the \nunderlying bill. Four years will ensure that a decision on permanency \nis made during the next Presidential term, not the one succeeding it.\n  Finally, title II of the committee's bipartisan bill addresses the \nquestion of protection for telecommunications companies that assisted \nthe Government during the course of the President's warrantless \nsurveillance program.\n  The Intelligence Committee carefully reviewed this matter of \nretroactive liability protection for companies prior to reporting out \nits bill. We received and reviewed the letters sent by the \nadministration to the companies. These letters stated that the \nassistance of the companies was ``required,'' that the request was \nbased on order of the President, and that the Attorney General had \ncertified the form and legality of the order.\n  In the course of our investigation, the committee heard from the \ncompanies themselves as well as administration officials and many \nothers and determined that the companies were not provided with any of \nthe Justice Department legal opinions underlying the Attorney General's \ncertifications they received ordering them to do something which has \ncome to put them at risk.\n  In the end, a bipartisan consensus of the Intelligence Committee \nsupported a narrowly drawn retroactive immunity provision. I want to \nstress the phrase ``narrowly drawn'' because what the committee \napproved was not--I repeat: was not--the broad and open-ended immunity \nsought by the administration.\n  The committee immunity provision applies only to companies that may \nhave participated in the warrantless surveillance program from a \nspecific period of time--from 9/11--until it was placed under FISA \nCourt authorization in January 2007. Nothing in the bill provides \nimmunity for Government officials for their actions--that is in the \ncurrent law; it is not in the law that we have proposed--nor to \ncompanies outside the specified timeframe.\n  The 12 members of our committee who supported the provision did so \nfor different reasons. Some Senators believed that the President acted \nwithin his constitutional responsibility and authority in establishing \nthe surveillance program. Some other Senators, including me, believe \nthe President trampled on our Constitution and our laws in unilaterally \ncreating a warrantless surveillance program in 2001 and continuing it \nfor years without seeking statutory authority to support it. But no \nmatter what may be the views about the President's adherence to the \nlaw, our collective judgment on the Intelligence Committee is that the \nburden of the debate about the President's authority should not fall on \ntelecommunications companies because they responded to the \nrepresentations by Government officials at the highest levels that the \nprogram had been authorized by the President and determined to be \nlawful and received requests, compulsions to carry it out.\n\n  Companies participated at great risk of exposure and financial ruin \nfor one reason, and one reason only: in order to help identify \nterrorists and prevent follow-on terrorist attacks. They should not be \npenalized for their willingness to heed the call during a time of \nnational emergency.\n  I conclude by urging my colleagues to support cloture on the motion \nto proceed so that we can turn our attention to reconciling the fine \nwork of the Intelligence and Judiciary committees and ultimately pass a \nFISA reform bill before adjournment.\n  Every one of us in the Senate and in Congress has a responsibility to \ncorrect the flaws in the Protect America Act and put our Nation on \nfirmer footing in authorizing critical intelligence surveillance \nactivities that are effective, while safeguarding the constitutional \nrights of Americans.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we yielded some time to the distinguished \nchairman from my side. How much time is remaining on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 46 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BOND. Forty-six. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first let me begin by thanking our majority leader, \nSenator Reid, and our minority leader, Senator McConnell, for bringing \nthis very important bill to the Senate floor. It is critical that we \ndiscuss it, debate it, vote on it, and pass it. I express my great \nthanks to the chairman of the committee, Senator Rockefeller, for his \nthoughtful discussion of the bill and his urgent request, in which I \njoin, that all Members of this body move forward, adopt cloture, and \nadopt this bill. I wish to thank the chairman and all of the members of \nthe committee and the staff of the Intelligence Committee who have \nlabored long and hard\n\n[[Page S15713]]\n\nover many months, beginning well before the April request for \nlegislation, to understand the program. I believe almost all of us have \ngone out to the NSA to see how the program works and to see what the \nprotections are that are built in.\n  We have asked questions many times over. I think I have heard the \nsame questions asked many times, and each time they are explained, I \nlearn a little bit more. I think we have a good understanding--not a \nperfect understanding--of the process, but we do fully appreciate how \nimportant it is.\n  The bill before us today reflects a tremendous amount of work and \ncompromise. The distinguished chairman and I and others have had \ndisagreements. We view things a little bit differently. But I think it \nis significant for this body to realize we came together, the majority \nand the minority, in a 13-to-2 vote to present to this body a good \ncompromise. Nobody is 100 percent happy with it. I don't expect them to \nbe. But this is about as good as we can do in earthly matters, and \nparticularly in congressional matters, if we can come that close, I \nthink it is a good product.\n  Obviously, I have some disagreements with the chairman on the Protect \nAmerica Act of which I was a principal sponsor. Because that bill was \npassed--had to be passed hurriedly before the August recess--what we \nwere able to do in that bill was to restore the FISA process with a \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court acting as it had originally \nbeen intended to act: to approve collections on U.S. persons in the \nUnited States. We changed the law so that technological changes would \nno longer bring within the FISA Court jurisdiction--or the FISA Court \nworkload, more appropriately--collections on foreign targets where very \noften they were communicating with foreign recipients of messages. That \nwas never the purpose and, as I indicated on the Senate floor, the FISA \nCourt objected to the intelligence community having to be burdened by \napproving collections against targets where there was only minimal \nimpact on any U.S. citizen.\n  The Protect America Act did fill in a critical national security \nintelligence gap. We all heard about it for a number of months. The \nintelligence community was shut out of the ability to go up on foreign \ntargets which might have had vital information. Now, we have had time \nto consider all of the aspects of this collection program, and we have \ncome up with a plan that will modernize the bill not only to make sure \nit keeps up with modern technology, but that it adds additional \nprotections under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  This morning, in a few minutes, we will hear from some of our \ncolleagues about why they are not happy with the bill coming before us. \nI would venture that some individuals made the same speeches back in \n1978 before the passage of that bill as well. But let me state the \nmeasure very plainly. The question is, Can the intelligence community \nof the United States obtain signals intelligence on foreign persons \nbelieved to be terrorists and reasonably believed to be outside of the \nUnited States, and do so in a manner that will protect us.\n  We know the electronic surveillance that was done under the \nPresident's program and under the current FISA Court jurisdiction has \nprovided valuable intelligence which has helped to thwart attacks on \nthe United States and, more importantly, as we heard from GEN Stan \nMcCrystal, the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command, when \nthe outmoded FISA law application shut down our ability to collect \nforeign intelligence, the people most greatly at risk were our men and \nwomen in the service overseas who did not have the benefit of \ncollection of intelligence that might have foretold attacks on them. So \nour men and women volunteers defending America, protecting security in \nthe world, were without the protection our technology enables us to \ncollect at the same time they were fighting overseas, and this kind of \ninformation could have been a big help.\n\n  Well, the legislation we are looking at today contains far greater \nprotections for U.S. persons than this body ever conceived of or was \never willing to grant Americans when it passed FISA 30 years ago. We \nhave gone further than ever before in this bill in protecting \nAmericans' privacy rights, and I am proud to be part of the process \nthat is shoring up our national security while protecting to the \ngreatest extent possible the liberties of all Americans.\n  The chairman is correct; we made many changes. We added many \nprotections--important protections--that the Director of National \nIntelligence agreed were necessary additions to provide protections for \nAmericans, U.S. persons that were not previously in the law. But I \nbelieve we can say today that Americans can feel safe and secure; that \nnot only is their privacy being protected but their lives are being \nprotected from terrorist attacks if we pass this bill which will \nmodernize and extend FISA.\n  We have an urgent need to proceed to the Senate's consideration of \nthe FISA amendments of 2007. Just last week, the Senate heard from our \nDirector of National Intelligence, ADM Mike McConnell, and Attorney \nGeneral Mike Mukasey in a closed briefing about the vital importance of \nthis legislation to our intelligence collection efforts. This \nlegislation will give the intelligence community the tools it needs \ntoday and in the future to protect our country.\n  The Protect America Act, passed in August by Congress, allowed the \nintelligence community temporarily to close critical intelligence gaps \nthat were impeding the intelligence community's ability to protect our \ntroops and to detect terrorist plots against our homeland. That \ntemporary legislation expires in less than 2 months, and we must not \nlet those dangerous gaps reopen. Two months may seem like a lot of \ntime, but when it comes to this bill or when it comes to floor action \nin the Congress in both Houses and then a conference, it is a very \nshort time period. Anybody who has watched this distinguished \ndeliberative body and its counterpart on the other side work knows that \n2 months sometimes can go in the flash of an eye.\n  The Senate will go out of session this week until mid-January, \nleaving only about 2 weeks for us to work out our differences with the \nHouse to get a bicameral bill sent to the President--one that he can \nsign into law before the current Protect America Act expires on \nFebruary 5. I regret the majority did not let this important bill get \nto the floor sooner, particularly when we had the DNI on the Hill last \nMarch urging Congress to modernize FISA, giving us his template of \nlegislation for FISA modernization in early April. But we are here in \nthe last week before Christmas, and I hope we will not waste any time \nin passing the bill on the way to becoming law.\n  I sincerely hope we are not going to leave ourselves in the same \nuncomfortable position we found ourselves in this past August when the \nSenate's consideration of the Protect America Act had to be passed very \nquickly. Because the Senate waited from April until August to act, we \nfound ourselves in a chaotic rush to pass a bill, and there were \ngenuine fears in the intelligence community that a terrorist attack \nagainst the homeland might be in the works. If we had acted in a more \ntimely manner, we would not have had some of the hard feelings we do \ntoday that resulted from that rushed process in August. That process \nproduced a bill that continued FISA as it was originally intended but \ndid not include the additional protections we have added today.\n  The good news, however, is that all of that is ancient history now \nbecause the product we have coming before us today is a thoroughly \nbipartisan Intelligence Committee bill that was put together in close \ncoordination with the subject matter experts in the offices of both the \nDirector of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice. I can \nassure my colleagues that all of the good ideas we have had--I have had \nand other members of the committee have had--when we have taken them to \nthese experts, we have found out you have to do it this way if you want \nto accomplish the results you want. Some of the things we attempted to \ndo had impossible burdens that we did not understand until we laid them \nout for these experts. They have told us how to accomplish our purposes \nand do so in a manner that would be effective in protecting the \ninterests, and yet not destroy the ability of the intelligence \ncommunity to collect the information we need.\n\n[[Page S15714]]\n\n  So I implore my colleagues in the Senate to move as quickly as \npossible on this bill since its construction has been quite deliberate \nso that we do not repeat the history of the hasty manner in which we \nhad to pass the Protect America Act. But that also means we must pass a \ngood bill that will not get vetoed. We don't have time for that. It is \nalways fun to posture and make political statements, but what is more \nimportant, we don't have to do that. The bill coming before the Senate \nout of the Intelligence Committee offers the legislation that gives the \nintelligence community the flexibility it needs to protect our troops \nand those of us in America, while protecting the privacy and civil \nliberties of Americans. With two small fixes that Chairman Rockefeller \nand I intend to add to the bill in a manager's amendment, I have been \nassured that the President will sign that bill.\n  Now, let me comment a minute on exclusivity. We are working on an \nagreement on exclusivity that states to the greatest extent possible \nthis will be the exclusive legislative means for the President to \ncollect foreign intelligence. As one who used to be a student of the \nConstitution and still remembers a little bit of it, I have been \nimpressed to read over the years how article 2 of the Constitution has \nbeen interpreted. Article 2 of the Constitution has been interpreted to \nsay that the President--the President alone--has the power to collect \nforeign intelligence.\n  That power was used by Presidents going back in history. President \nCarter and President Clinton have used that bill to collect \ninformation. The FISA Court of Review has said, in the in re: Sealed \nCase, that the President's power to collect foreign intelligence \nremains. The President has put this bill under the FISA Court. So he \nhas accepted the jurisdiction of the court in assessing the \nappropriateness of the collection means that have been requested.\n  We cannot erase by legislation a constitutional power. That \nconstitutional power that the President has was fully laid out in the \nopinions and advice given by the Department of Justice and the \nintelligence community to any carriers that may have participated in \nthe collection of information during the pendency of the President's \nterror surveillance program.\n  One other item I will comment on is the sunset. The provision we have \nin the bill--the 6-year sunset--is a compromise we reached. I don't \nbelieve a bill such as this should have a sunset. FISA did not have a \nsunset. It stayed in effect from 1978 until 2006. We should have \nreviewed it before. That is what we are in business for.\n  The Intelligence Committee of the Senate continues to hold hearings \nand have oversight of the intelligence community, and I would expect \nthat if we see problems in the bill, we will move to correct them when \nwe see them, not wait to a sunset. General Mukasey strongly opposed \nhaving any sunset on the bill, and I oppose lessening the sunset from 6 \nyears. In fact, I prefer to see that sunset provision out of the bill.\n  To summarize, S. 2248, the bill passed out of the Intelligence \nCommittee by a solid bipartisan vote of 13 to 2, on which I hope the \nSenate invokes cloture in a few minutes, will be the proper means of \nassuring the intelligence community can go forward with the vitally \nimportant collection of signals intelligence, while at the same time \nprotecting the civil rights and privacy of all Americans and U.S. \npersons.\n  The bill is an extremely delicate arrangement of compromises that \nwill fall apart if significant changes are made to it. By ``fall \napart,'' what I really mean is it won't become law. We need a bill that \nDemocrats and Republicans can support, that the DNI says will work for \nthe intelligence community, and that the President will sign into law. \nThat means the first principle we need to follow today is that the age-\nold advice that doctors and others use: ``do no harm,'' and not \ndeconstruct what the Intelligence Committee has carefully crafted.\n  We don't have time for poison pill amendments or any other sort of \npolitical posturing. The Senate Intelligence Committee bill is a good \none and needs to become law without further delay so our intelligence \ncollectors and troops in harm's way will have the tools they need \nbefore the Protect America Act expires in February.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote with Chairman Rockefeller \nand me to proceed to this bill.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  What is the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). There are 28 minutes.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, let me say to my two good friends, \nSenators Rockefeller and Bond, I appreciate the job they do serving as \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. I \ncommend them for their efforts in this matter.\n  Having said that, I reluctantly rise to urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst cloture on S. 2248, the FISA Amendment Act, and I will explain \nwhy.\n  Opposing cloture is essential, because there is no unanimous consent \nagreement in place providing for the immediate adoption of the \nJudiciary Committee substitute amendment.\n  As you know, the Judiciary substitute amendment, among other things, \nstrikes title II of the Intelligence Committee bill--the title which \nseeks to provide retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies \nwho are alleged to have violated their customers' privacy rights by \nturning over information to the government without warrants.\n  I am fully aware that the majority leader has various parliamentary \noptions at his disposal to move this legislation forward. It is his \nright to attempt to invoke cloture.\n  But I regret that decision, and I hope that my colleagues will join \nme in stopping this legislation.\n  Mr. President, why do I feel so strongly about this matter?\n  For the last 6 years, our largest telecommunications companies have \nbeen spying on their own American customers.\n  Secretly and without a warrant, they delivered to the Federal \nGovernment the private, domestic communications records of millions of \nAmericans--records this administration has compiled into a database of \nenormous scale and scope.\n  That decision betrayed millions of customers' trust. It was \nunwarranted--literally.\n  But was it illegal?\n  That, Mr. President, I don't know. And if this bill passes in its \ncurrent form, we will never know. The President's favored corporations \nwill be immune.\n  Their arguments will never be heard in a court of law. The details of \ntheir actions will stay hidden. The truth behind this unprecedented \ndomestic spying will never see light. And the book on our Government's \nactions will be closed, and sealed, and locked, and handed over to the \nsafekeeping of those few whom George Bush trusts to keep a secret.\n  The bill that the majority leader will seek to make the pending \nbusiness of the Senate later today--the FISA Amendments Act of 2007--\nhas a long and twisted history behind it. Its origins lie in President \nBush's years of warrantless spying on Americans.\n  That abuse of power was exposed by the press in late 2005. The New \nYork Times revealed that:\n\n       Under a presidential order signed in 2002, the [National \n     Security Agency] has monitored the international telephone \n     calls and international e-mail messages of hundreds, perhaps \n     thousands, of people inside the United States without \n     warrants over the past three years.\n\n  In fact, we later learned that the President's warrantless spying was \nauthorized as early as 2001.\n  Disgraced former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, in a 2006 white \npaper, attempted to justify that spying; his argument rested on the \nspecious claim that, in authorizing the President to go to war in \nAfghanistan, Congress had also somehow authorized him to listen in on \nphone calls in America.\n  But many of those who voted on the original authorization of force \nfound this claim to new executive powers to be a laughable invention. \nHere's what former Majority Leader Tom Daschle wrote:\n\n       As Senate majority leader . . . I helped negotiate that law \n     with the White House counsel's office over two harried days. \n     I can state categorically that the subject of warrantless \n     wiretaps of American citizens never came up . . . I am also \n     confident that the 98 senators who voted in favor of \n     authorization of force against al-Qaida did not believe that \n     they\n\n[[Page S15715]]\n\n     were also voting for warrantless domestic surveillance.\n\n  Such claims to expanded executive power based on the authorization \nfor military force have since been struck down by the courts.\n  In recent months, the administration has changed its argument, now \ngrounding its warrantless surveillance power in the extremely nebulous \n``authority of the President to defend the country'' that they find in \nthe Constitution.\n  Of course, that begs the question: Exactly what doesn't fit under \n``defending the country''? If we take the President at his word, we \nwould concede to him nearly unlimited power, as long as he finds a \nlawyer willing to stuff his actions into that boundless category.\n  Rather than concede such power, Congress has worked to bring the \nPresident's surveillance program back where it belongs--under the rule \nof law.\n  At the same time, we have worked to modernize FISA and ease \nrestrictions on terrorist surveillance. The Protect America Act, a bill \nattempting to respond to that two-pronged challenge, passed in August; \nbut it is set to expire in February.\n  The bill now before us would create a legal regime for surveillance \nunder reworked and more reasonable rules. But crucially, President Bush \nhas demanded that this bill include full retroactive immunity for \ncorporations complicit in domestic spying. In a speech on September 19, \nhe stated that ``it's particularly important for Congress to provide \nmeaningful liability protection to those companies.''\n  In October, he stiffened his demand, vowing to veto any bill that did \nnot shield the telecom corporations. And this month, he resorted to \nshameful, misleading scare tactics, accusing Congress of failing ``to \nkeep the American people safe.''\n  That month, the FISA Amendments Act came before the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. Per the President's demand, it included full \nretroactive immunity for the telecom corporations. Senator Nelson \nintroduced an amendment to strip that immunity, and instead allow the \nmatter to be settled in the courts. It failed by a vote of 3 to 12.\n  But as it passed out of the Intelligence Committee, by a vote of 13 \nto 2, the bill still put corporations literally above the law and \nensured that the extent of the President's invasions of privacy would \nremain a secret. I found retroactive immunity far beyond the pale, and \nI made my objections strongly and publicly.\n  But the bill also had to pass through the Judiciary Committee. There, \nChairman Pat Leahy succeeded in reporting out a bill without the \negregious immunity provision. Over the years, Pat Leahy has cemented \nhis reputation as a champion of the rule of law; and I believe the \nstand he took last month will be honored for a long time to come.\n  However, I am still concerned that when Senator Feingold proposed an \namendment to strip immunity for good, it failed by a vote of 7 to 12.\n  So here we are--facing a final decision on whether the \ntelecommunications companies will get off the hook for good. The \nPresident's allies are as intent as they ever were on making that \nhappen. They want immunity back in this bill at all costs.\n  But what they are truly offering is secrecy in place of openness. \nFiat in place of law.\n  And in place of the forthright argument and judicial deliberation \nthat ought to be this country's pride, two simple words from our \nPresident's mouth: ``Trust me.''\n  I cannot speak for my colleagues--but I would never take that offer, \nnot even in the best of times, not even from a perfect President. I \nwould never take that offer because our Constitution tells us that the \nPresident's word is subject to the oversight of the Congress and the \ndeliberation of the courts; and because I took an oath to defend the \nConstitution; and because I stand by my oath.\n  ``Trust me.'' It is the offer to hide ourselves in the waiting arms \nof the rule of men. And in these threatened times, that offer has never \nseemed more seductive. The rule of law has rarely been so fragile.\n  ``It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is to be \ncharged to the provisions against danger . . . from abroad.'' James \nMadison, the father of our Constitution, made that prediction more than \ntwo centuries ago. With the passage of this bill, his words would be \none step closer to coming true. So it has never been more essential \nthat we lend our voices to the law, and speak on its behalf.\n  On its behalf, we say to President Bush that a Nation of truly free \nmen and women would never take ``trust me'' for an answer, not even \nfrom a perfect President--and certainly not from this one.\n  In these times--under a President who seems every more day intent on \nacting as if he is the law, who grants himself the right to ignore \nlegislation, who claims the power to spy without a warrant, to imprison \nwithout a hearing, to torture without a scruple--in these times, I \nwould be a fool to take his offer.\n  But ``trust me,'' says President Bush. He means it literally. When he \nfirst asked Congress to make the telecoms' actions legally disappear, \nCongress had a reasonable question for him: Can we at least know \nexactly what we'd be immunizing? Can you at least tell us what we'd be \ncleaning up?\n  And the President refused to answer. Only he, his close advisors, and \na handful of telecom executives know all of the facts. Congress is only \nasked to give token oversight. But if we are to do our constitutionally \nmandated job, we need more than token oversight; we need full hearings \non the terrorist surveillance program before the Intelligence and \nJudiciary Committees.\n  Without that, we remain in the dark--and in the dark we're expected \nto grant the President's wish, because he knows best.\n  Does that sound familiar to any of my colleagues?\n  In 2002, we took the President's word and voted to go to war on \nfaulty intelligence. What if we took his word again--and found, next \nyear or the year after, that we had blindly legalized grave crimes?\n  If this disastrous war has taught us anything, it is that the Senate \nmust never again stack such a momentous decision on such a weak \nfoundation of fact. The decision we're asked to make today is not, of \ncourse, as immense. But between fact and decision, the disproportion is \njust as huge.\n  So I rise in determined opposition to this unprecedented immunity and \nall that it represents. I have served in this body for more than a \nquarter century. I have spoken from this desk hundreds and hundreds of \ntimes. I have rarely come to the floor with such anger.\n  But since I came to Washington, I have seen six Presidents sit in the \nWhite House--and I have never seen a contempt for the rule of law equal \nto this. Today, I have reached a breaking point. Today my disgust has \nfound its limit.\n  I don't expect every one of my colleagues to share that disgust, or \nthat limit. I wish they did--but had that been the case, we would never \nhave come to this point.\n  I only ask them to believe me when I say if I did not speak today, my \nconscience would not let me rest.\n  The right to conscience is one of the Senate's most treasured \nallowances. It is perhaps this body's defining feature. The President \nhas his dominating bully pulpit. Justice Robert Jackson famously wrote \nthat ``in drama, magnitude and finality [the President's] decisions so \nfar overshadow any others that almost alone he fills the public eye and \near. No other personality in public life can begin to compete with him \nin access to the public mind.''\n  But in this Chamber, a minority--even an impassioned minority of \none--has the right to stand against all the combined weight and \nmachinery of government and plead: ``Stop!'' Or at least: ``Wait.'' A \nminority can't stand forever, as surely as I can't speak forever. \nUltimately, a minority has only one recourse--to make itself a \nmajority. And I have faith that when the American people understand the \nfull extent of this President's contempt for the law, they will share \nmy outrage. This is a trusting and patient nation--and with more than \ntwo centuries of democratic tradition, rightly so. But that trust is \nnot infinite; that patience is not endless; and after 7 years of this \nPresident, they are worn down to the nub.\n  If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be standing here today. If the \nrule of law\n\n[[Page S15716]]\n\nwere not my ruling passion, I wouldn't be standing here today. But I \ndo, and it is.\n  ``Law'' is a word we barely hear from the President and his allies. \nThey offer neither a deliberation about America's difficult choices in \nthe age of terrorism, nor a shared attempt to set for our times the \nexcruciating balance between security and liberty.\n  They merely promise a false debate on a false choice: security or \nliberty, but never, ever both.\n  It speaks volumes about the President's estimation of the American \npeople that he expects them to accept that choice. I think differently. \nI think that America's founding truth is unambiguous: security and \nliberty, one and inseparable, and never one without the other.\n  Secure in that truth, I offer a challenge to the President's allies: \nYou want to put the President's favored corporations above the law. \nCould you please explain how your immunity makes any one of us any \nsafer by an iota?\n  If security were truly the issue, this debate wouldn't be happening. \nAn excellent balance between security and liberty has already been \nstruck by FISA, a balance that has stood for three decades. In fact, \nFISA was written just to prevent a situation like ours from occurring: \nto protect Americans without countenancing executive lawbreaking.\n  In the wake of the Watergate scandal, the U.S. Senate convened the \nChurch Committee, a panel of distinguished senators determined to shine \nlight on executive abuses of power. The facts it uncovered were \nshocking:\n  Army spying on the civilian population; Federal dossiers on citizens' \npolitical activities; a CIA and FBI program that had opened hundreds of \nthousands of Americans' letters without warning or warrant.\n  The collective force of these revelations was undeniable: In their \noversight duties, Congress and the courts had failed; they had \nunquestioningly accepted the executive's ``trust me''; and as a result, \nAmericans had sustained a severe blow to their fourth amendment rights \n``to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against \nunreasonable searches and seizures.''\n  The Senate could have panicked; it could have ended or drastically \ncurtailed those searches altogether. But in its wisdom, the Senate \nunderstood that protecting the American people was not the problem; the \nproblem was simply the Nixonian attitude that ``if the President does \nit, it's not illegal.''\n  The solution was to bring the executive's efforts to protect America \nunder the watchful eye of Congress and the courts--to restore checks \nand balances to surveillance, and to give it the legitimacy it demands \nand deserves. America would not be America if such power remained \nconcentrated in the hands of one man, or one branch of Government.\n  The Church Committee's final report, ``Intelligence Activities and \nthe Rights of Americans,'' put the case eloquently:\n\n       The critical question before the Committee was to determine \n     how the fundamental liberties of the people can be maintained \n     in the course of the Government's effort to protect their \n     security. The delicate balance between these basic goals of \n     our system of government is often difficult to strike, but it \n     can, and must, be achieved.\n       We reject the view that the traditional American principles \n     of justice and fair play have no place in our struggle \n     against the enemies of freedom. Moreover, our investigation \n     has established that the targets of intelligence activity \n     have ranged far beyond persons who could properly be \n     characterized as enemies of freedom. . . .\n       We have seen segments of our Government, in their attitudes \n     and action, adopt tactics unworthy of a democracy, and \n     occasionally reminiscent of the tactics of totalitarian \n     regimes.\n       We have seen a consistent pattern in which programs \n     initiated with limited goals, such as preventing criminal \n     violence or identifying foreign spies, were expanded to what \n     witnesses characterized as ``vacuum cleaners,'' sweeping in \n     information about lawful activities of American citizens.\n\n  The Senators of the Church Commission concluded:\n\n       Unless new and tighter controls are established by \n     legislation, domestic intelligence activities threaten to \n     undermine our democratic society and fundamentally alter its \n     nature.\n\n  What a strange echo we hear in those words. They could have been \nwritten yesterday. Three decades ago, our predecessors in this Chamber \nunderstood that when domestic spying goes too far, it threatens to kill \njust what it promises to protect--an America secure in its liberty. \nThat lesson was crystal clear 30 years ago. Why is it so clouded now?\n  And before we entertain the argument that ``everything has changed'' \nsince those words were written, remember: The men who wrote them had \nwitnessed world war and Cold War, had seen Nazi and Soviet spying, and \nwere living every day under the cloud of nuclear holocaust. How short \nsome memories are.\n  The threats have multiplied and grown in complexity, but the lesson \nhas been immutable: Warrantless spying threatens to undermine our \ndemocratic society, unless legislation brings it under control. In \nother words, the power to invade privacy must be used sparingly, \nguarded jealously, and shared equally between the branches of \nGovernment.\n  Or the case can be made pragmatically. As my friend Harold Koh, the \ndean of Yale Law School, recently argued:\n\n       The engagement of all three branches tends to yield not \n     just more thoughtful law, but a more broadly supported public \n     policy.\n  Three decades ago, that broadly supported public policy--a prime \noutcome of the Church Committee--was the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, or FISA. FISA confirmed the President's power to \nconduct surveillance of international conversations involving anyone in \nthe United States, provided that the Federal FISA court issued a \nwarrant--ensuring that wiretapping was aimed at safeguarding our \nsecurity, and nothing else. To further protect intelligence gathering, \nthat court was to work in secret.\n  Ironically, none other than the President's own Director of National \nIntelligence, Mike McConnell, explained the rationale in an interview \nthis summer: The United States ``did not want to allow [the \nintelligence community] to conduct . . . electronic surveillance of \nAmericans for foreign intelligence unless you had a warrant, so that \nwas required.''\n  As originally written in 1978, and as amended nine times since, FISA \nhas accomplished its mission; it has been a valuable tool for \nconducting surveillance of terrorists and those who would harm America. \nAnd every time Presidents have come to Congress openly to ask for more \nleeway under FISA, Congress has worked with them; Congress has \ncompromised; and together, Congress and the President have struck a \nbalance that safeguards America while doing its utmost to protect \nprivacy.\n  This summer, Congress made a technical correction to FISA, enabling \nthe President to wiretap, without a warrant, conversations between two \nforeign targets, even if those conversations are routed through \nAmerican computers. Personally, I felt that this summer's legislation \nwent too far, and I opposed it. But the point is that Congress once \nagain proved its willingness to work with the President on FISA. Isn't \nthat enough?\n  Just this October and November, as we have seen, the Senate \nIntelligence and Judiciary Committees worked with the President to \nfurther refine FISA and ensure that, in a true emergency, the FISA \ncourt would do nothing to slow down intelligence gathering. Isn't that \nenough?\n  And as for the FISA court, it has approved the President's \nwiretapping requests with impeccable consistency.\n  Between 1978 and 2004, according to the Washington Post, the FISA \ncourt approved 18,748 warrants and rejected five. The FISA court has \nsided with the executive 99.9 percent of the time. Isn't that enough?\n  Is anything lacking? Isn't the framework already in place? Isn't all \nof this enough to keep us safe?\n  We all know the President's answer. Given this complex, fine-tuned \nmachinery, crafted over three decades by all three branches, what did \nhe do? He ignored it.\n  Given a system primed to bless nearly any eavesdropping he could \nconceive--he conducted his own, illegally.\n  If the shock of that decision has yet to sink in, think of it this \nway: President Bush ignored not just a Federal court, but a secret \nFederal court; not just a secret Federal court, but a secret Federal \ncourt prepared to sign off on his actions 99.9 percent of the time. A\n\n[[Page S15717]]\n\nmore compliant court has never been conceived. And still that wasn't \ngood enough for our President.\n  So I will ask the Senate candidly, and candidly it already knows the \nanswer: Is this about our security or is it about his power?\n  I ask that question not to change the subject, but because it is the \nkey to understanding why this administration is pushing so hard for \ntelecom immunity--that is, for secrecy. Richard Nixon, the same man who \ndeclared that ``if the president does it, it's not illegal,'' raised \nsecrecy to an art form--because he understood that the surest way to \namass power is to conceal its true extent.\n  Secrecy can spring from the best motives; but as it grows it begins \nto exist only for itself, only for its own sake, only to cover its own \nabuses.\n  The Senators of the Church Committee expressed succinctly the deep \nflaw in that form of Government: ``Abuse thrives on secrecy.''\n  Today, we have seen the executive branch pass to a new master of \nsecrecy. Vice President Cheney practices a secrecy so baroque that it \ncould, in a less threatened time, be an object for laughter, instead of \nfear.\n  His unclassified papers? Stamped ``treat as TSSCI,'' one of the \nhighest levels of state secret. The list of papers he has declassified? \nClassified. The members of his energy task force? None of your \nbusiness. His location? Undisclosed. The names of his staff? \nConfidential. And tellingly, of course, the visitor log for his office? \nShredded by the Secret Service.\n  When secrecy becomes this divorced from practicality, we are left \nwith only one conclusion: For this executive branch, secrecy is power.\n  Of course, I don't mean any offense against our Vice President--as he \nreminds us, he is not part of the executive branch.\n  We see a pattern of secrecy stretching back to the first months of \nthis administration. Its push for immunity is no different--secrecy is \nat its center.\n  And tellingly, the administration's original immunity proposal \nprotected not just the telecoms, but everyone involved in the \nwiretapping program. In their original proposal, that is, they wanted \nto immunize themselves.\n  Think about that. It speaks to their fear and, perhaps, their guilt: \ntheir guilt that they had broken the law, and their fear that in the \nyears to come, they would be found liable or convicted. They knew \nbetter than anyone else what they had done--they must have had good \nreason to be afraid!\n  Thankfully, executive immunity is not part of the bill before us. I \nam grateful for that. But the origin of immunity tells us a great deal \nabout what's at stake here: This is, and always has been, a self-\npreservation bill.\n  Otherwise, why not have the trial and get it over with? If the \nPresident's allies believe what they say, the corporations would win in \na walk.\n  After all, look at things from their perspective: In their telling, \nwhen our biggest telecom corporations helped the President spy without \na warrant, they were doing their patriotic duty. When they listened to \nthe executive branch and turned over private information, they were \ndoing their patriotic duty.\n  When one company gave the NSA a secret eavesdropping room at its own \ncorporate headquarters, it was simply doing its patriotic duty. The \nPresident asked, the telecoms answered.\n  Shouldn't that be an easy case to prove, Mr. President? The \ncorporations only need to show a judge the authority and the assurances \nthey were given, and they will be in and out of court in 5 minutes. If \nthe telecoms are as defensible as the President says, why doesn't the \nPresident let them defend themselves? If the case is so easy to make, \nwhy doesn't he let them make it? Why is he standing in the way?\n  Our Federal court system has dealt for decades with the most delicate \nnational security matters, building up expertise in protecting \nclassified information behind closed doors--ex parte, in camera. We can \nexpect no less in these cases. If we're worried about national security \nbeing threatened as a result, we can simply get the principals a \nsecurity clearance.\n  No intelligence sources need be compromised. No state secrets need be \nexposed. And we can say so with increasing confidence, because after \nthe extensive litigation that has already taken place at both the \ndistrict court and circuit court level, no sensitive information has \nleaked out.\n  In fact, Federal District Court Judge Vaughn Walker, a Republican \nappointee, has already ruled that the issue can go to trial without \nputting state secrets in jeopardy. He reasonably pointed out that the \nexistence of the President's surveillance program is hardly a secret at \nall: The government has already disclosed the general contours of the \n``terrorist surveillance program,'' which requires the assistance of a \ntelecommunications provider.\n\n  George Bush wouldn't be the first president to hide righteously \nbehind the state secrets privilege. In fact, the privilege was tainted \nat its birth by a President of my own party, Harry Truman. In 1952, he \nsuccessfully invoked the new privilege to prevent public exposure of a \nreport on a plane crash that killed three Air Force contractors.\n  When the report was finally declassified--some 50 years later, \ndecades after anyone in the Truman administration was within its \nreach--it contained no state secrets at all. Only facts about repeated \nmaintenance failures that would have seriously embarrassed some \nimportant people. And so the state secrets privilege began its career \nnot to protect our nation--but to protect the powerful.\n  In his opinion, Judge Walker argued that, even when it is reasonably \ngrounded:\n\n       The state secrets privilege [still] has its limits. While \n     the court recognizes and respects the executive's \n     constitutional duty to protect the nation from threats, the \n     court also takes seriously its constitutional duty to \n     adjudicate the disputes that come before it. To defer to a \n     blanket assertion of secrecy here would be to abdicate that \n     duty, particularly because the very subject matter of this \n     litigation has been so publicly aired.\n       The compromise between liberty and security remains a \n     difficult one. But dismissing this case at the outset would \n     sacrifice liberty for no apparent enhancement of security.\n\n  And that ought to be the epitaph for this Presidency: ``sacrificing \nliberty for no apparent enhancement of security.'' Worse than selling \nour soul--giving it away for free!\n  The President is equally wrong to claim that failing to grant this \nretroactive immunity will make the telecoms less likely to cooperate \nwith surveillance in the future.\n  The truth is that, since the 1970s, FISA has compelled \ntelecommunications companies to cooperate with surveillance, when it is \nwarranted--and what's more, it immunizes them. It is done that for more \nthan 25 years.\n  So cooperation in warranted wiretapping is not at stake today. \nCollusion in warrantless wiretapping is--and the warrant makes all the \ndifference, because it is precisely the court's blessing that brings \nPresidential power under the rule of law.\n  In sum, we know that giving the telecoms their day in court--giving \nthe American people their day in court--would not jeopardize an ounce \nof our security. And it could only expose one secret: the extent of our \npresident's lawbreaking, and the extent of his corporations' \ncomplicity. That, our President will go to the mat to defend. That, he \nwill keep from the light of a courtroom at all costs. That, his \nsupporters would amend the law to protect.\n  And that is the choice at stake today: Will George Bush's secrets die \nwith this Presidency? Or will they be open to the generations to come, \nto our successors in this Chamber, so that they can prepare themselves \nto defend against future outrages of power and usurpations of law from \nfuture Presidents, of either party?\n  I am here because I will not see those secrets go quietly into the \ngood night with Donald Rumsfeld and Alberto Gonzales and Dick Cheney \nand George Bush. I am here because the truth is not their private \nproperty--it belongs to every one of us, and it demands to be heard.\n  ``State secrets,'' ``patriotic duty''--those, as weak as they are, \nare the arguments the president's allies use when they're feeling high-\nminded! When their thoughts turn baser, they make their arguments in \ndollar signs.\n  Here's how Mike McConnell put it:\n\n       If you play out the suits at the value they're claimed, it \n     would bankrupt these companies. So . . . we have to provide \n     liability protection to these private sector entities.\n\n  Mike McConnell is quickly becoming an accidental truth-teller! Notice \nhow\n\n[[Page S15718]]\n\nthe President's own Director of National Intelligence concedes that if \nthe cases went to trial, the telecoms would lose. I don't know if \nthat's true, Mr. President--but we can thank Admiral McConnell for \ntelling us how he really feels.\n  Of course, it is an exaggeration to claim that these companies would \nsurely go bankrupt, even if they did lose.\n  We are talking about some of the wealthiest, most successful \ncompanies in America. Let me quote an article from Dow Jones \nMarketWatch. The date is October 23, 2007. The headline reads: ``AT's \nthird-quarter profit rises 41.5 percent.''\n\n       AT Inc. on Tuesday said third-quarter earnings rose 41.5 \n     percent, boosted by the acquisition of BellSouth and the \n     addition of 2 million net wireless customers . . . Net income \n     totaled $3.06 billion . . . compared with $2.17 billion . . . \n     a year ago.\n\n  Note that AT has posted these record profits at a time of very \npublic litigation.\n  A company with more than $3 billion in profits one quarter--only the \nmost exorbitant and unlikely judgment could completely wipe it out. To \nassume that the telecoms would lose, and that their judges would then \nhand down such backbreaking penalties, is already to take several \nleaps.\n  The point, after all, has never been to financially cripple our \ntelecommunications industry. The point is to bring checks and balances \nback to domestic spying. Setting that precedent would hardly require a \ncrippling judgment.\n  It is much more troubling, though, that the Director of National \nIntelligence even feels the need to pronounce on ``liability protection \nfor private sector entities.'' Since when were our spies in the \nbusiness of economics? Since when did they put protecting AT or \nVerizon ahead of protecting the American people? Since when did the \namount a defendant stands to lose have any bearing on whether a suit \nshould go forward? I learned in law school that guilty was guilty--no \nmatter how rich or how poor.\n  Lean on this logic, and you'll sink to its venal core: Certain \ncorporations are too rich to be sued. Forget what they owe; forget \nwhat's just; forget judges setting the penalty. If there's even a \nchance of the judgment being high, throw the suit out--it endangers the \nRepublic!\n  This administration has equated corporations' bottom lines with our \nNation's security. Follow that reasoning honestly to its end, and you \ncome to the conclusion: The larger the corporation, the more lawless it \ncan be. If we accept Mr. McConnell's premises, we could conceive of a \ncorporation so wealthy, so integral to our economy, that its riches \nplace it outside the law altogether. And if the administration's \nthinking even admits that possibility, we know instinctively how flawed \nit is.\n  The truth is exactly the opposite: The larger the corporation, the \ngreater the potential for abuse, and the more carefully it must be \nwatched. Not that success should make a company suspect; companies grow \nlarge, and essential to our economy, because they are excellent at what \nthey do. I simply mean that size and wealth open the realm of \npossibilities for abuse far beyond the scope of the individual.\n  Consider this. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation,\n\n       Clear, first-hand whistleblower documentary evidence \n     [states] . . . that for year on end every e-mail, every text \n     message, and every phone call carried over the massive fiber-\n     optic links of sixteen separate companies routed through \n     AT's Internet hub in San Francisco--hundreds of millions of \n     private, domestic communications--have been . . . copied in \n     their entirety by AT and knowingly diverted wholesale by \n     means of multiple ``splitters'' into a secret room controlled \n     exclusively by the NSA.\n\n  If true, that constitutes one of the most massive violations of \nprivacy in American history. And it would be inconceivable without the \nsize and resources of an AT behind it--the same size that makes Mike \nMcConnell fear the corporations' day in court.\n  If reasonable search and seizure means opening a drug dealer's \napartment, the telecoms' alleged actions would be the equivalent of \nstrip-searching everyone in the building, ransacking their bedrooms, \nand prying up all the floorboards. That is the massive scale we are \ntalking about--and that massive scale is precisely why no corporation \nmust be above the law.\n  On that scale, it is impossible to plead ignorance. As Judge Walker \nruled:\n\n       AT cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in \n     its position could have believed that the alleged domestic \n     dragnet was legal.\n\n  But the arguments of the President's allies sink even lower. Listen \nto the words a House Republican leader spoke on Fox News. They are \nshameful:\n\n       I believe that they deserve immunity from lawsuits out \n     there from typical trial lawyers trying to find a way to get \n     into the pockets of American companies.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Cindy Cohn is one of those ``trial lawyers.'' She is lead \ncounsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a small public-interest \nlaw firm bringing suit against the telecom corporations. And when she \nheard that Fox News claim about typical greedy trial lawyers, she \nlaughed.\n\n       If he still thinks that we're rich plaintiffs' attorneys \n     after he's visited our little tiny Mission Street offices, \n     [she said,] then I have a bridge to sell him. Most of the EFF \n     lawyers worked in those big fancy firms for big fancy \n     salaries, and took big pay cuts to join us . . .\n       Young lawyers come to me and say, ``I really want to work \n     for EFF--you have such great lawyers.''\n       I say: ``Take your current paycheck, rip it in three \n     pieces, take any third, and that's about what you'll get \n     working for EFF.'' The lawyers who work for EFF . . . are \n     making far less than they could on the open market in \n     exchange for being able to work in things they believe in \n     every day.\n\n  Consider the hundreds of lawyers retained by the corporations in \nquestion, and their multimillion-dollar legal budgets, and the attempt \nto portray them as pitiable Davids is ludicrous. Sprint's lawyers \nrecently settled an unrelated class-action lawsuit for $30 million. \nThree years ago, AT handled a settlement with shareholders for $100 \nmillion.\n  With those resources, I think they can give EFF's nine nonprofit \nlawyers in their little office on Mission Street a fair fight.\n  Mr. President, I don't presume to know how that fight will end. I \ndon't presume to hand out innocence and guilt--that's not my job. \nJudges and juries do that. And in their search for the truth, the only \njob of this body is to get out of the way.\n  I am not invested in one verdict or another--only that a verdict is \nreached. I don't care who the truth favors--only that it comes out at \nall.\n  State secrets; future cooperation; economic harms; reputational \ndamage; legal burdens--as we've seen, not a single one of the \nPresident's arguments for this immunity stands. Nothing tells us to \nhalt the legal process, to bar the courthouse door. Everything tells us \nto open it.\n  Mr. President, perhaps when I leave this floor today, someone will \nask me, ``Why are you so agitated about some telephone records? There's \nso much else to be worked up about!''\n  And I'll only be able to respond: ``Exactly.''\n  We have seen this administration chip away at the rule of law at a \ndozen points. Its relentlessness may be its greatest strength--the \nassault becomes numbing, and our healthy outrage grows dull. It was an \noutrage when this President set up secret courts outside the law. It \nwas an outrage when he ignored the courts and tapped our phones. It was \nan outrage when he sanctioned torture. But outrage upon outrage upon \noutrage--and we wind up in a stupor. We have allowed each abuse with \nnothing more than a promise to resist the next one--and the next one, \nand the next one.\n  I am here, in the end, because the line has to be drawn somewhere. \nWhy not here? Why not today?\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject the motion on \ncloture. Let them come back, strip this language out on immunity, and \ngive us a clean FISA bill. That is the only right thing to do. The law \nis here to protect all of us. We can have security and liberty.\n  As Benjamin Franklin said some 200 years ago:\n\n       Those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve \n     neither security nor liberty.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject cloture, and then we can send the \nbill forward without that immunity provision.\n\n[[Page S15719]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 13 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, then 5 minutes to Senator Sessions, 5 minutes to Senator \nChambliss, and 5 minutes to Senator Kyl. That would conclude the time \non our side, and I think that will put us at a vote or it will consume \nthe time on our side. So I unanimous consent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Missouri for yielding me the \ntime, and I wish to begin with the comment made by the Senator from \nConnecticut raising a question about the grant of retroactivity \nimmunity. I believe that had that provision not been in the Senate \nbill, it would be a great deal easier to deal with, although there are \nsome substantial problems with the bill as such, even in addition to \nthe provision on retroactive immunity.\n  But I support the motion to invoke cloture because I believe it is \nnecessary to deal with the fight against terrorism, and I think the \nGovernment has made a case for some expanded powers, although I think \nwe have to weigh them very carefully--to fight terrorism but still \nprotect civil liberties in this country.\n  I have a strong objection to the provision in the bill relating to \nretroactive immunity, and my objection goes to the point that the \nadministration did not follow the provisions of law in notifying the \nIntelligence Committees of the House and Senate or the chairman and \nranking member of the Judiciary Committees about this program. To come \nat a later date and seek retroactive immunity I think is inappropriate.\n  I found out about it when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nlast year, and I moved to subpoena the records of the telephone \ncompany, and then I moved to go into a closed session. While that was \nin process, Vice President Cheney went to the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee on the Republican side, without notifying me--which I thought \nwas inappropriate--and thwarted the efforts I was making to find out \nwhat this program was all about.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have my letter to Vice President Cheney \ndated June 7, and his reply to me dated June 8, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2006.\n     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,\n     The Vice President,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President: I am taking this unusual step in \n     writing to you to establish a public record. It is neither \n     pleasant nor easy to raise these issues with the \n     Administration of my own party, but I do so because of their \n     importance,\n       No one has been more supportive of a strong national \n     defense and tough action against terrorism than I. However, \n     the Administration's continuing position on the NSA \n     electronic surveillance program rejects the historical \n     constitutional practice of judicial approval of warrants \n     before wiretapping and denigrates the constitutional \n     authority and responsibility of the Congress and specifically \n     the Judiciary Committee to conduct oversight on \n     constitutional issues.\n       On March 16, 2006, I introduced legislation to authorize \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to rule on the \n     constitutionality of the Administration's electronic \n     surveillance program. Expert witnesses, including four former \n     judges of the FISA Court, supported the legislation as an \n     effective way to preserve the secrecy of the program and \n     protect civil rights. The FISA Court has an unblemished \n     record for keeping secrets and it has the obvious expertise \n     to rule on the issue. The FISA Court judges and other experts \n     concluded that the legislation satisfied the case-in-\n     controversy requirement and was not a prohibited advisory \n     opinion. Notwithstanding my repeated efforts to get the \n     Administration's position on this legislation, I have been \n     unable to get any response, including a ``no''.\n       The Administration's obligation to provide sufficient \n     information to the Judiciary Committee to allow the Committee \n     to perform its constitutional oversight is not satisfied by \n     the briefings to the Congressional Intelligence Committees. \n     On that subject, it should be noted that this Administration, \n     as well as previous Administrations, has failed to comply \n     with the requirements of the National Security Act of 1947 to \n     keep the House and Senate Intelligence Committees fully \n     informed. That statute has been ignored for decades when \n     Presidents have only informed the so-called ``Gang of \n     Eight,'' the Leaders of both Houses and the Chairmen and \n     Ranking on the Intelligence Committees. From my experience as \n     a member of the ``Gang of Eight'' when I chaired the \n     Intelligence Committee of the 104th Congress, even that group \n     gets very little information. It was only in the face of \n     pressure from the Senate Judiciary Committee that the \n     Administration reluctantly informed subcommittees of the \n     House and Senate Intelligence Committees and then agreed to \n     inform the full Intelligence Committee members in order to \n     get General Hayden confirmed.\n       When there were public disclosures about the telephone \n     companies turning over millions of customer records involving \n     allegedly billions of telephone calls, the Judiciary \n     Committee scheduled a hearing of the chief executive officers \n     of the four telephone companies involved. When some of the \n     companies requested subpoenas so they would not be \n     volunteers, we responded that we would honor that request. \n     Later, the companies indicated that if the hearing were \n     closed to the public, they would not need subpoenas.\n       I then sought Committee approval, which is necessary under \n     our rules, to have a closed session to protect the \n     confidentiality of any classified information and scheduled a \n     Judiciary Committee Executive Session for 2:30 P.M. yesterday \n     to get that approval.\n       I was advised yesterday that you had called Republican \n     members of the Judiciary Committee lobbying them to oppose \n     any Judiciary Committee hearing, even a closed one, with the \n     telephone companies. I was further advised that you told \n     those Republican members that the telephone companies had \n     been instructed not to provide any information to the \n     Committee as they were prohibited from disclosing classified \n     information.\n       I was surprised, to say the least, that you sought to \n     influence, really determine, the action of the Committee \n     without calling me first, or at least calling me at some \n     point. This was especially perplexing since we both attended \n     the Republican Senators caucus lunch yesterday and I walked \n     directly in front of you on at least two occasions enroute \n     from the buffet to my table.\n       At the request of Republican Committee members, I scheduled \n     a Republican members meeting at 2:00 P.M. yesterday in \n     advance of the 2:30 P.M. full Committee meeting. At that \n     time, I announced my plan to proceed with the hearing and to \n     invite the chief executive officers of the telephone \n     companies who would not be subject to the embarrassment of \n     being subpoenaed because that was no longer needed. I \n     emphasized my preference to have a closed hearing providing a \n     majority of the Committee agreed.\n       Senator Hatch then urged me to defer action on the \n     telephone companies hearing, saying that he would get \n     Administration support for my bill which he had long \n     supported. In the context of the doubt as to whether there \n     were the votes necessary for a closed hearing or to proceed \n     in any manner as to the telephone companies, I agreed to \n     Senator Hatch's proposal for a brief delay on the telephone \n     companies hearing to give him an opportunity to secure the \n     Administration's approval of the bill which he thought could \n     be done. When I announced this course of action at the full \n     Committee Executive Session, there was a very contentious \n     discussion which is available on the public record.\n        It has been my hope that there could be an accommodation \n     between Congress's Article I authority on oversight and the \n     President's constitutional authority under Article II. There \n     is no doubt that the NSA program violates the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act which sets forth the exclusive \n     procedure for domestic wiretaps which requires the approval \n     of the FISA Court. It may be that the President has inherent \n     authority under Article II to trump that statute but the \n     President does not have a blank check and the determination \n     on whether the President has such Article II power calls for \n     a balancing test which requires knowing what the surveillance \n     program constitutes.\n       If an accommodation cannot be reached with the \n     Administration, the Judiciary Committee will consider \n     confronting the issue with subpoenas and enforcement of that \n     compulsory process if it appears that a majority vote will be \n     forthcoming. The Committee would obviously have a much easier \n     time making our case for enforcement of subpoenas against the \n     telephone companies which do not have the plea of executive \n     privilege. That may ultimately be the course of least \n     resistance.\n       We press this issue in the context of repeated stances by \n     the Administration on expansion of Article II power, \n     frequently at the expense of Congress's Article I authority. \n     There are the Presidential signing statements where the \n     President seeks to cherry-pick which parts of the statute he \n     will follow. There has been the refusal of the Department of \n     Justice to provide the necessary clearances to permit its \n     Office of Professional Responsibility to determine the \n     propriety of the legal advice given by the Department of \n     Justice on the electronic surveillance program. There is the \n     recent Executive Branch search and seizure of Congressman \n     Jefferson's office. There are recent and repeated assertions \n     by the Department of Justice that it has the authority to \n     criminally prosecute newspapers and reporters under highly \n     questionable criminal statutes.\n       All of this is occurring in the context where the \n     Administration is continuing\n\n[[Page S15720]]\n\n     warrantless wiretaps in violation of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act and is preventing the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee from carrying out its constitutional responsibility \n     for Congressional oversight on constitutional issues. I am \n     available to try to work this out with the Administration \n     without the necessity of a constitutional confrontation \n     between Congress and the President.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           The Vice President,\n\n                                         Washington, June 8, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your letter of \n     June 7, 2006 concerning the Terrorist Surveillance Program \n     (TSP) the Administration has described. The commitment in \n     your letter to work with the Administration in a non-\n     confrontational manner is most welcome and will, of course, \n     be reciprocated.\n       As recently as Tuesday of this week, I reiterated that, as \n     the Administration has said before, while there is no need \n     for any legislation to carry out the Terrorist Surveillance \n     Program, the Administration will listen to the ideas of \n     legislators about terrorist surveillance legislation and work \n     with them in good faith. Needless to say, that includes you, \n     Senator DeWine and others who have ideas for such \n     legislation. The President ultimately will have to make a \n     decision whether any particular legislation would strengthen \n     the ability of the Government to protect Americans against \n     terrorists, while protecting the rights of Americans, but we \n     believe the Congress and the Administration working together \n     can produce legislation to achieve that objective, if that is \n     the will of the Congress.\n       Having served in the executive branch as chief of staff for \n     one President and as Secretary of Defense for another, having \n     served in the legislative branch as a Representative from \n     Wyoming for a decade, and serving now in a unique position \n     under the Constitution with both executive functions and \n     legislative functions, I fully understand and respect the \n     separate constitutional roles of the Congress and the \n     Presidency. Under our constitutional separation between the \n     legislative powers granted to Congress and the executive \n     power vested exclusively in the Presidency, differences of \n     view may occur from time to time between the branches, but \n     the Government generally functions best when the legislative \n     branch and the executive branch work together. And I believe \n     that both branches agree that they should work together as \n     Congress decides whether and how to pursue further terrorist \n     surveillance legislation\n       Your letter addressed four basic subjects: (1) the legal \n     basis for the TSP; (2) the Administration position on \n     legislation prepared by you relating to the TSP; (3) \n     provision of information to Congress about the TSP; and (4) \n     communications with Senators on the Judiciary Committee about \n     the TSP.\n       The executive branch has conducted the TSP, from its \n     inception on October 4, 2001 to the present, with great care \n     to operate within the law, with approval as to legality of \n     Presidential authorizations every 45 days or so by senior \n     Government attorneys. The Department of Justice has set forth \n     in detail in writing the constitutional and statutory bases, \n     and related judicial precedents, for warrantless electronic \n     surveillance under the TSP to protect against terrorism, and \n     that information has been made available to your Committee \n     and to the public.\n       Your letter indicated that you have repeatedly requested an \n     Administration position on legislation prepared by you \n     relating to the TSP program. If you would like a formal \n     Administration position on draft legislation, you may at any \n     time submit it to the Attorney General, the Director of \n     National Intelligence, or the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget (OMB) for processing, which will \n     produce a formal Administration position. Before you do so, \n     however, it might be more productive for executive branch \n     experts to meet with you, and perhaps Senator DeWine or other \n     Senators as appropriate, to review the various bills that \n     have been introduced and to share the Administration's \n     thoughts on terrorist surveillance legislation. Attorney \n     General Alberto R. Gonzales and Acting Assistant Attorney \n     General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven G. Bradbury \n     are key experts upon whom the executive branch would rely for \n     this purpose. I will ask them to contact you promptly so that \n     the cooperative effort can proceed apace.\n       Since the earliest days of the TSP, the executive branch \n     has ensured that, consistent with the protection of the \n     sensitive intelligence sources, methods and activities \n     involved, appropriate members of Congress were briefed \n     periodically on the program. The executive branch kept \n     principally the chairman and ranking members of the \n     congressional intelligence committees informed and later \n     included the congressional leadership. Today, the full \n     membership of both the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \n     (including four Senators on that Committee who also serve on \n     your Judiciary Committee) are fully briefed on the program. \n     As a matter of inter-branch comity and good executive-\n     legislative practice, and recognizing the vital importance of \n     protecting U.S. intelligence sources, methods and activities, \n     we believe that the country as a whole, and the Senate and \n     the House respectively, are best served by concentrating the \n     congressional handling of intelligence matters within the \n     intelligence committees of the Congress. The internal \n     organization of the two Houses is, of course, a matter for \n     the respective Houses. Recognizing the wisdom of the \n     concentration within the intelligence committees, the rules \n     of the Senate (S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress) and the \n     House (Rule X, cl. 11) creating the intelligence committees \n     mandated that the intelligence committees have cross-over \n     members who also serve on the judiciary, foreign/\n     international relations, armed services, and appropriations \n     committees.\n       Both in performing the legislative functions of the Vice \n     Presidency as President of the Senate and in performing \n     executive functions in support of the President, I have \n     frequent contact with Senators, both at their initiative and \n     mine. We have found such contacts helpful in maintaining good \n     relations between the executive and legislative branch es and \n     in advancing legislation that serves the interests of the \n     American people. The respectful and candid exchange of views \n     is something to be encouraged rather than avoided. Indeed, \n     recognizing the importance of such communication, the first \n     step the Administration took, when it learned that you might \n     pursue use of compulsory process in an attempt to force \n     testimony that may involve extremely sensitive classified \n     information, was to have one of the Administration's most \n     senior officials, the Chief of Staff to the President of the \n     United States, contact you to discuss the matter. Thereafter, \n     I spoke with a number of other Members of the Senate \n     Leadership and the Judiciary Committee. These communications \n     are not unusual--they are the Government at work.\n       While there may continue to be areas of disagreement from \n     time to time, we should proceed in a practical way to build \n     on the areas of agreement. I believe that other Senators and \n     you, working with the executive branch, can find the way \n     forward to enactment of legislation that would strengthen the \n     ability of the Government to protect Americans against \n     terrorists, while continuing to protect the rights of \n     Americans, if it is the judgment of Congress that such \n     legislation should be enacted. We look forward to working \n     with you, knowing of the good faith on all sides.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dick Cheney.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. The telephone companies, I do believe, have acted as \ngood citizens. I would not want to see them pay damages because they \nwere responding to a governmental request. So my idea, in order to \nstrike a balance between the Senate bill which grants retroactive \nimmunity and the House bill which leaves it out, would be instead to \nprovide for the Government to be substituted as a party for telephone \ncompanies.\n  Toward that end, I have introduced S. 2402, which was considered by \nthe Judiciary Committee last week and did not pass, on a vote of 13 to \n5. Since that time, I have heard from other Senators that they think it \nis a good idea. I believe it has to be explored and will be explored \nbecause I will offer it as an amendment to this bill as soon as I have \nan opportunity to do so.\n  What my idea does, essentially, is to substitute the Federal \nGovernment as the party defendant for the telephone companies in the \ncases which have been initiated. The Government would stand in the \nshoes of the telephone companies, with no more and no less defenses \navailable. For example, governmental immunity would not be available as \na defense to the Government because obviously the telephone companies \ndo not have governmental immunity.\n  The telephone companies, I think, or the defendants in these cases \nare highly unlikely to pay damages. But I believe it is very important \nthat the courts not be foreclosed from making a judicial determination \non the issues which are involved. Part of the concern I have is that \nthe Government is now coming forward to try to have retroactive \nimmunity, to absolve them from any potential wrongdoing in the past. I \ndo not know whether there is wrongdoing, but I do not believe that it \nis appropriate for the Federal Government to act secretly, \nsurreptitiously, not tell the intelligence committees as required by \nlaw, not tell the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and then come back at a later date and say: Please exonerate \nus. If we give that kind of a blank check, carte blanche to the \nexecutive officials, it would be a terrible, devastating precedent for \nthe future.\n  I believe it is necessary for the judicial actions to run their \ncourse. Again, let me say I think it is highly questionable that any of \nthe plaintiffs will succeed. The defense of state secrets has been \ninterposed in the cases against\n\n[[Page S15721]]\n\nthe telephone companies. Similarly, the Government would have that \ndefense if it were substituted in their stead.\n  But the fact is that the Congress has not been successful in \nconducting oversight of the Federal Government. The terrorist \nsurveillance program was in existence from October of 2001 until \nDecember of 2005, before the Congress ever found out about it. Then we \ndidn't find out about it as a result of our oversight activities; we \nfound out about it because it was disclosed in a New York Times story.\n  I remember the morning well. I was managing the PATRIOT Act re-\nauthorization, to try the give the U.S. Government adequate powers to \nfight terrorism. Right in the middle of the final day of our \nconsideration, the story broke about the secret terrorist surveillance \nprogram, and the comment was made on the floor of the Senate by one \nSenator that he was prepared to vote for the PATRIOT Act but not after \nhe found out about the terrorist surveillance program.\n  The Federal Government did not notify the Intelligence Committees as \nrequired by law until well after the New York Times article. Then they \nnotified the Intelligence Committees only because they felt compelled \nto do so in order to get General Hayden confirmed.\n  There is a long list of efforts by congressional oversight which have \nbeen insufficient: the signing statements in which the President has \ncherry-picked, taking provisions he likes and excluding provisions he \ndoesn't like. Senator McCain and the President personally negotiated \nthe question of interrogation in the Detainee Treatment Act. There was \nlanguage put in, on a 90-to-9 vote, limiting interrogation practices. \nThen, when the President signed the bill, he made an exclusion, saying \nthat his constitutional authority under article II would enable him to \nignore some of those provisions.\n  Similarly, on the PATRIOT Act re-authorization, we negotiated certain \noversight, and then the President issued a signing statement again \nsaying there were some items which he would feel free to disregard on \nthe oversight provisions.\n  On habeas corpus and detention, the Congress has been totally \nineffective at any oversight; it is only the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States in Rasul and in a case now pending, Boumediene, argued \nrecently in the Supreme Court. So the judicial oversight on checks and \nbalances and on separation of powers, I believe, is indispensable.\n  We have within the past few days another instance of executive \nresistance to congressional oversight. Senator Leahy and I wrote to the \nAttorney General recently--a week ago today--inquiring about the \ndestruction of the tapes by the CIA. The Attorney General responded \nlast week, on December 14, denying our request for information.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Attorney General's letter printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                               Washington, DC., December 14, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Specter: Thank you for your \n     letter of December 10, 2007, regarding your concerns about \n     the reported destruction by the Central Intelligence Agency \n     (CIA) of videotapes showing interrogations of detainees and \n     the Department's review of this matter.\n       As you note, the Department's National Security Division is \n     conducting a preliminary inquiry in conjunction with the \n     CIA's Office of Inspector General. Enclosed please find a \n     letter from Assistant Attorney General Kenneth L. Wainstein \n     to CIA Acting General Counsel John A. Rizzo, which provides \n     some further detail regarding this inquiry, and which was \n     released to the public on December 8.\n       As to your remaining questions, the Department has a \n     longstanding policy of declining to provide non-public \n     information about pending matters. This policy is based in \n     part on our interest in avoiding any perception that our law \n     enforcement decisions are subject to political influence. \n     Accordingly, I will not at this time provide further \n     information in response to your letter, but appreciate the \n     Committee's interests in this matter. At my confirmation \n     hearing, I testified that I would act independently, resist \n     political pressure and ensure that politics plays no role in \n     cases brought by the Department of Justice. Consistent with \n     that testimony, the facts will be followed wherever they lead \n     in this inquiry, and the relevant law applied.\n       Finally, with regard to the suggestion that I appoint a \n     special counsel, I am aware of no facts at present to suggest \n     that Department attorneys cannot conduct this inquiry in an \n     impartial manner. If I become aware of information that leads \n     me to a different conclusion, I will act on it.\n       I hope that this information is helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael B. Mukasey,\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                   National Security Division,\n\n                                Washington, DC., December 8, 2007.\n     John A. Rizzo,\n     Acting General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Rizzo: I am writing this letter to confirm our \n     discussions over the past several days regarding the \n     destruction of videotapes of interrogations conducted by the \n     Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Consistent with these \n     discussions, the Department of Justice will conduct a \n     preliminary inquiry into the facts to determine whether \n     further investigation is warranted. I understand that you \n     have undertaken to preserve any records or other \n     documentation that would facilitate this inquiry. The \n     Department will conduct this inquiry in conjunction with the \n     CIA's Office of Inspector General (OIG).\n       My colleagues and I would like to meet with your Office and \n     OIG early next week regarding this inquiry. Based on our \n     recent discussions, I understand that your Office has already \n     reviewed the circumstances surrounding the destruction of the \n     videotapes, as well as the existence of any pending relevant \n     investigations or other preservation obligations at the time \n     the destruction occurred. As a first step in our inquiry, I \n     ask that you provide us the substance of that review at the \n     meeting.\n       Thank you for your cooperation with the Department in this \n     matter. Please feel free to contact me if you have any \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Kenneth L. Wainstein,\n\n                                       Assistant Attorney General,\n                                       National Security Division.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. It surprised me that the Attorney General would say that \nin light of his very recent statements made during the confirmation \nhearings. ``If confirmed, I will review Department of Justice policies \nwith a goal of ensuring that Congress is able to carry out meaningful \noversight.''\n  When I talked to Judge Mukasey in advance of the confirmation \nhearings and gave him a copy of the letter which I had sent to Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales, Judge Mukasey agreed with the standards established \nby the Congressional Research Service, saying that these are within the \nbounds of congressional authority on oversight.\n\n       [A] review of congressional investigations that have \n     implicated DOJ, or DOJ investigations over the past 70 years, \n     from the Palmer Raids and Teapot Dome to Watergate, and \n     through Iran Contra and Rocky Flats, demonstrates that the \n     Department of Justice has consistently been obliged to submit \n     to congressional oversight. . . .\n\n  Including:\n\n       . . . testimony of subordinate DOJ employees, such as line \n     attorneys and FBI field agents, was taken. . . .\n\n  Again:\n\n       In all instances, investigating committees were provided \n     with documents respecting open or closed cases.\n\n  So here is another example of congressional oversight being thwarted, \nso that when you have a challenge to what has been done by the \ntelephone companies here and you have litigation in progress, I believe \nit to be most inappropriate for the Congress to intercede and grant \nimmunity retroactively.\n  I believe our Federal investigative agencies need very substantial \npowers in the fight against terrorism. I have discussed the issue with \nDirector of National Intelligence McConnell about granting the \nGovernment authority to acquire the cooperation of the telephone \ncompanies prospectively. I am waiting for a briefing on the issue, to \nunderstand the full import of what it is that the Director of National \nIntelligence wants. I am open to granting those powers prospectively, \nbut I do not believe, in the context of what has happened here, that it \nwould be advisable to retroactively give these officials a blank check \nwhen they kept these matters secret from the oversight committees, and \nwhen the Judiciary Committee sought to have subpoenas to find out about \nit, and we were thwarted in that effort, as disclosed by the exchange \nof letters between the Vice President and myself, made a part of the \nrecord.\n\n[[Page S15722]]\n\n  I note my time has expired. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Feingold may have been next, and \nI see he has returned. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. President, I oppose cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 2248, \nas reported by the Senate Intelligence Committee. This bill is deeply \nflawed, and I am very disappointed by the decision to take it up on the \nSenate floor rather than the better bill reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Before leaving town for the August recess, Congress bowed to pressure \nfrom the administration, and vastly expanded the Government's ability \nto eavesdrop without a court-approved warrant. That legislation, the \nso-called Protect America Act, was rushed through this Chamber in a \nclimate of fear--fear of terrorist attacks, and fear of not appearing \nsufficiently strong on national security. There was very little \nunderstanding of what the legislation actually did.\n  But there was one silver lining: The bill had a 6-month sunset to \nforce Congress to do its homework and reconsider the approach it took.\n  The Senate should be taking this opportunity to fix its mistakes and \npass a new bill that gives the Government all the tools it needs to spy \non suspected terrorists but also protects Americans' basic freedoms. \nThis time around, the Senate should stand up to an Administration that \ntime and again has employed fear-mongering and misleading statements to \nintimidate Congress.\n  The fact is, the Intelligence Committee bill doesn't fix those \nmistakes, and it is not the bill we should be considering on the Senate \nfloor.\n  I do agree with the administration on one point--Congress should make \nclear that when foreign terrorists are communicating with each other \noverseas, the U.S. Government doesn't need a warrant to listen in, even \nif the collection activity ends up taking place in this country because \nof the way modern communications are routed. Unfortunately, both the \nProtect America Act and the bill approved by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee go far beyond fixing that problem and also authorize \nwidespread surveillance involving Americans--at home and abroad.\n  The bill we should be considering is the Judiciary Committee bill, \nwhich 14 Senators urged the majority leader to take up, in a letter \nlast week.\n  The Judiciary Committee bill made critical improvements to ensure \nindependent judicial oversight of these sweeping new powers and to \nbetter protect innocent Americans. The Judiciary bill does not contain \na new form of retroactive immunity for companies that allegedly \ncooperated with an illegal wiretapping program that lasted for more \nthan 5 years. And, while the Intelligence Committee bill was drafted \nand debated behind closed doors and in close consultation with the \nadministration, the Judiciary bill was the product of an open process \nwith the input of experts from a variety of perspectives.\n  The Judiciary Committee bill is not perfect. It needs further \nimprovement. But it would be a vastly better starting point for Senate \nconsideration than the bill that the majority leader has brought to the \nfloor, which simply gives the administration everything it was \ndemanding, no questions asked.\n  The stakes are high. I want my colleagues to understand the impact \nthat the Protect America Act and the Intelligence Committee bill could \nhave on the privacy of Americans. These bills do not just authorize the \n6 unfettered surveillance of people outside the United States \ncommunicating with each other. They also permit the Government to \nacquire those foreigners' communications with Americans inside the \nUnited States, regardless of whether anyone involved in the \ncommunication is under any suspicion of wrongdoing.\n  There is no requirement that the foreign targets of this surveillance \nbe terrorists, spies or other types of criminals. The only requirements \nare that the foreigners are outside the country, and that the purpose \nis to obtain foreign intelligence information, a term that has an \nextremely broad definition.\n  There is no requirement that the foreign targets of this surveillance \nbe terrorists, spies, or any other kind of criminal. The only \nrequirements are that foreigners are outside the country, that the \npurpose is to obtain foreign intelligence information, a term that has \nan extremely broad definition.\n  No court reviews these targets individually. Only the executive \nbranch decides who fits these criteria. The result is that many law-\nabiding Americans who communicate with completely innocent people \noverseas will be swept up in this new form of surveillance, with \nvirtually no judicial involvement.\n  Even the administration's illegal warrantless wiretapping program, as \ndescribed when it was publicly confirmed in 2005, at least focused on \nparticular terrorists. What we are talking about now is a huge dragnet \nthat will sweep up innocent Americans.\n  In America, we understand that if we happen to be talking to a \ncriminal or terrorist suspect, our conversations might be heard by the \nGovernment. But I do not think many Americans expect the Government to \nbe able to listen into every single one of their international \ncommunications with people about whom there are no suspicions \nwhatsoever.\n  These incredibly broad authorities are particularly troubling because \nwe live in a world in which international communications are \nincreasingly commonplace. Thirty years ago, it was very expensive, and \nnot common, for many Americans to make an overseas call. But now, \nparticularly with e-mail, such communications are commonplace. Millions \nof ordinary, and innocent, Americans communicate with people overseas \nfor entirely legitimate personal and business reasons.\n  Parents of children call family members overseas. Students e-mail \nfriends they have met while studying abroad. Businesspeople communicate \nwith colleagues or clients overseas. Technological advancements \ncombined with the ever interconnected world economy have led to an \nexplosion of international contacts.\n  We often hear from those who want to give the Government new powers \nthat we just have to bring FISA up to date with new technology. But \nchanges in technology should also cause us to take a look at the \ngreater need for the privacy of our citizens.\n  We are going to give the Government broad new powers that will lead \nto the collection of much more information on innocent Americans. We \nhave a duty to protect their privacy as much as we possibly can, and we \ncan do that. We can do that, as the Senator from Connecticut said, \nwithout sacrificing our ability to collect information that will \nprotect our national security.\n  To take one example, a critical difference between the Intelligence \nand Judiciary bills is the role of the court. The Judiciary bill gives \nthe secret FISA Court new authority to operate as an independent check \non the executive branch.\n  It gives the court authority to assess the Government's compliance to \nwiretapping procedures, to place limits on the use of information that \nwas acquired through unlawful procedures, and then gives the court, as \nmost courts should have, the ability to enforce its own orders.\n  The Judiciary bill also does a better job of protecting Americans \nfrom widespread warrantless wiretapping. It prohibits so-called bulk \ncollection. What is that? Vacuuming up basically all the communications \nbetween the United States and overseas, which the DNI admitted is legal \nunder the PAA. And it ensures that if the Government is wiretapping a \nforeigner overseas in order to really collect the communications of the \nAmerican with whom that foreign target is communicating, what is called \nreverse targeting, well, in that case it has to get a court order on \nthat American. Well, none of these changes hinders the Government's \nability to protect national security.\n  The process by which the Judiciary Committee considered, drafted, \namended, and reported out its bill was an open one, allowing outside \nexperts and the public at large the opportunity to review and comment. \nWith regard to legislation so directly connected to the constitutional \nrights of Americans, I think the result of this open process\n\n[[Page S15723]]\n\nshould be accorded great weight, especially in light of the Judiciary \nCommittee's unique role and expertise in protecting those rights.\n  Now, I am certain that over the course of this week we will hear a \nnumber of arguments about why the Judiciary bill will hamper the fight \nagainst terrorism. Well, let me say now to my colleagues: Do not \nbelieve everything you hear. Last week I sat with many of you in the \nsecure room in the Capitol and listened to arguments made by the \nDirector of National Intelligence and by our Attorney General.\n  I can tell you with absolute certainty that several of the examples \nthey gave were simply wrong, simply false. I am happy to have a \nclassified meeting with anyone in this body who wishes to discuss that. \nThis is not about whether we will be effective in combating terrorism. \nBoth bills allow that. This is about whether the court should have an \nindependent oversight role and whether Americans deserve more privacy \nprotections than foreigners overseas. All of this should sound familiar \nto those who followed previous debates about fighting terrorism while \nprotecting American's civil liberties in the post-9/11 world.\n  The administration says--and again, following on what the Senator \nfrom Connecticut said--the administration basically says: Trust us. We \ndo not need judicial oversight. The court will just get in our way. You \nnever know when they might tell us what we are doing is \nunconstitutional. We would prefer to make that decision on our own.\n  Time and again, that has proved to be a foolish and counterproductive \nattitude, and sadly, despite the objections of many of us in this \nChamber, too many times, Congress has just gone along. We do not have \nto make that same mistake again. In this case we have a factual record \nto help us evaluate whether we should simply trust the administration \nor whether we should write protections into the law.\n  The Protect America Act has only been in effect for 4\\1/2\\ months, \nand we are still missing key information about it. The Intelligence \nCommittee has recently been provided some basic information about its \nimplementation. Based on what I have learned, I have very serious \nquestions about the way the administration is interpreting and \nimplementing the Protect America Act, including its effect on the \nprivacy of Americans.\n  I will shortly be sending the Director of National Intelligence a \nclassified letter detailing my concerns which are directly relevant to \nthe legislation we are considering. I regret this information is \nclassified, so I cannot discuss it here. I regret that more of my \ncolleagues have not been privy to this information prior to this floor \ndebate, but I would be happy to share a copy of my letter in an \nappropriate classified setting with any Senator who wishes to review \nit.\n\n  I have been speaking for some time now about my strong opposition to \nthe Intelligence Committee bill, and I have not even addressed one of \nthe more outrageous elements of the bill: the granting of retroactive \nimmunity to companies that allegedly participated in an illegal \nwiretapping program that lasted for more than 5 years.\n  This grant of automatic immunity is simply unjustified. There is \nalready an immunity provision in current law that has been there since \nFISA was negotiated in the late 1970s, with the participation of the \ntelecommunications industry.\n  The law is clear. Companies already have immunity from civil \nliability when they cooperate with a Government request for assistance, \nas long as they receive a court order or the Attorney General certifies \nthat a court order is not required and all statutory requirements have \nbeen met.\n  So this is not about whether the companies had good intentions or \nacted in good faith; it is about whether they complied with this \nstatutory immunity provision, which has applied for 30 years. If the \ncompanies follow that law, they should get immunity. If they did not \nfollow that law, they should not get immunity. A court should make that \ndecision, not Congress. It is that simple.\n  Congress passed a law laying out when telecom companies get immunity \nand when they do not for a reason. Those companies have access to our \nmost private communications, so Congress has correctly subjected them \nto very precise rules about when they can provide that information to \nthe Government. If the companies did not follow the law Congress \npassed, they should not be granted a ``get out of jail free'' card \nafter the fact.\n  We have heard a lot of arguments about needing technical cooperation \nof carriers in the future. We do need that cooperation, but we also \nneed to make sure carriers do not cooperate with illegitimate requests. \nWe already have a law that tells companies when they should and when \nthey should not cooperate, so they are not placed in the position of \nhaving to somehow independently evaluate whether the Government's \nrequest for help is legitimate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is the \nSenator's request for 3 additional minutes on each side?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would not object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, 3 minutes will be added to \neach side.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Instead of allowing the courts to apply that law to the \nfacts, instead of allowing judges to decide whether the companies \ndeserve immunity for acting appropriately, the Intelligence Committee \nbill sends the message that companies need not worry, they do not have \nto worry about complying with questionable Government requests in the \nfuture, because they will be bailed out. This is outrageous. Even more \noutrageous is the fact that if these lawsuits are dismissed, the courts \nmay never rule on the NSA wiretapping program.\n  So what this is is an ideal outcome for an administration that \nbelieves it should be able to interpret laws on its own without \nworrying about how Congress wrote them or what a judge thinks. For \nthose of us who believe in three independent and coequal branches of \nGovernment, this is a disaster.\n  For all of these reasons, I oppose closure on the motion to proceed \nto the Intelligence Committee bill. I fear we are about to make the \nsame mistake we made with the PATRIOT Act. We passed that law without \ntaking the time to consider its implications, and we did not do enough \nduring the reauthorization process to fix it. As a result, three \nFederal courts have struck down provisions of the PATRIOT Act as \nunconstitutional, and that is right back where we are going to end up \nif we do not do our jobs now and fix the Protect America Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe the last unanimous consent \nagreement was that there would be 5 minutes for Senators Kyl, \nChambliss, and myself. We have added 3 minutes to that. I ask unanimous \nconsent that we each have 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague, Senator \nFeingold, and his passionate argument, but I am going to tell my \ncolleagues that this Congress and this Government of the United States \nare capable of overreacting. We are capable of getting excited about an \nissue and taking theoretical positions that end up, as a practical \nmatter, leaving our country at greater risk. This is not just an item \nof discussion; it is very real.\n  I would point out to my colleagues that we have made two dramatic \nerrors some years ago in a situation just like this, on emotion driven \nby our civil libertarian friends, such that a wall was put up between \nthe FBI and the CIA which barred the sharing of information between \nthose two critical agencies.\n  We also mandated that the Central Intelligence Agency officers could \nnot obtain information from people deemed to be dangerous. Bad people. \nHow do you get information in the world and protect America and our \nlegitimate national interests without sources? Those became laws.\n\n[[Page S15724]]\n\n  And what happened after we were attacked on 9/11? Both those rules \nthat we imposed on our military intelligence agencies were deemed to be \nbogus, wrong, and mistaken, colossally so. Many Members of this body \nwere warned when they were made the law of the United States, they were \nwarned then that if we did these things it was not wise. But, oh no, \nthe others loved the Constitution more, they loved liberty more, so \nthese unwise laws were passed. And what happened afterwards, after 9/\n11? Well, we properly removed both of those silly rules. We have taken \nthem off the books, in a bipartisan, unanimous way. They were never \nrequired by the Constitution. They were never sensible from the \nbeginning. But we passed them on emotion not reason. Some ideas being \npromoted now are not sensible either and can leave our country in \ndangerous straits. So this is an important matter. These things are \nlife and death issues.\n  Last year, a Federal court ruled, based on changes in technology, \nthat those laws we passed effectively limited the collection of \ncritical communications of foreign intelligence. It was not the \nintention of Congress when we passed it, I am sure, that the law would, \nin effect, end up gutting perhaps the most important surveillance \nprogram we have against international terrorists, but that was the \neffect of it.\n  Admiral McConnell was flabbergasted. He came to us and pleaded with \nus to give him relief. So what happened? Well, he said this to us. \nListen to these words. Basically this is what he said: The United \nStates was unable to conduct critical surveillance of . . . foreign \nterrorists planning to conduct attacks inside our country.\n  That is basically--that is what he said to us. That is a dramatic \nthing.\n\n  So what happened? Congress went through an intense study, and we \npassed the Protect America Act this past summer. Some people said: This \nis a rush, though we spent weeks on it. Congress spent a lot of time \nworking on it. But we said: OK, it will come back up for \nreauthorization in February. As of this date, there has been no example \nof abuse of that act.\n  Senator Feingold says these intelligence procedures were illegal \nwiretapping. I think that is really not a fair thing to say. A court \nruled that these procedures we had been using for some time, must, \naccording to statutes we passed, go through a certain number of \nprocedural hoops that, as a practical matter, would have eliminated the \npossibility of us continuing these surveillance techniques. That is \nwhat they ruled. I don't think we ever intended this to be the effect, \nbut the court probably ruled fairly on the law. I am not sure. We are \nstuck with the ruling regardless.\n  I don't think it is fair to say the program was illegal. But \ncertainly the procedures were not unconstitutional because this summer, \nwhen we passed the Protect America Act, we effectively concluded the \nprogram was good and constitutional. We affirmed the program.\n  I want to say, if we have any humor left on this subject, perhaps we \nought to write President Bush a letter and tell him: Thank you. We are \nsorry we accused you of violating our Constitution and basic civil \nliberties. After the Congress spent weeks studying this, we passed a \nlaw that basically allowed the program to continue as it was.\n  I urge that we do the right thing on this legislation and move \nforward to the Intelligence bill, not the Judiciary bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I rise in support of the motion to proceed to the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act of 2007. It is \nimportant to underscore just how critical this legislation is and how \nthe bill which was voted out of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence by a vote of 13 to 2 is a comprehensive and bipartisan \nbill.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made \nallegations that this bill will infringe upon Americans' right to \nprivacy. This bill only infringes on one group's right to privacy, and \nthat is terrorists.\n  Prior to congressional action in August, and again if we do not make \npermanent these changes, our intelligence community was unable to \ncollect vital foreign intelligence without the prior approval of a \ncourt. If our intelligence community wanted to direct surveillance at \nan al-Qaida member located in Waziristan who was communicating with \nanother terrorist in Germany, they would have to first petition the \nFISA court for approval. In August, our intelligence community told us \nthat without updating FISA, they were not just handicapped, they were \nhamstrung.\n  Congress passed the Protect America Act which temporarily fixed the \nintelligence community's legal gaps. However, the Protect America Act \nwill expire in February of 2008. Congress must act swiftly before our \ncore collectors are faced with losing valuable intelligence as a result \nof inaction by Congress.\n  When FISA was enacted in 1978, it was meant to provide our Government \nwith the means to collect foreign intelligence within the United States \nwhile not infringing upon U.S. citizens' rights. Prior to FISA, the \ncourts held that fourth amendment warrant protection applied to \nsurveillance in a variety of cases, including the decisions of Katz and \nKeith. Congress reacted to these cases in the criminal and foreign \nintelligence arena by enacting legislation addressing the requirements \nof the fourth amendment in title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968 and in FISA.\n  While debating FISA, Congress sought to protect the rights of U.S. \npersons from unwarranted Government intrusion while collecting foreign \nintelligence within the United States. The congressional report \naccompanying FISA states:\n\n       The purpose of the bill is to provide a statutory procedure \n     authorizing the use of electronic surveillance in the United \n     States for foreign intelligence purposes.\n\n  Regulating the collection of foreign intelligence, including the \nelectronic surveillance of foreign communications made by terrorists, \nwas neither contemplated during FISA nor by the courts after enactment \nof FISA. It has been long held that foreigners do not enjoy the \nprotection of our Constitution unless they enter the territories of the \nUnited States, and even FISA provides an exception to that warrant \nrequirement if it is unlikely that a U.S. person's communications would \nbe intercepted. As an unfortunate consequence of the rapid advancements \nin technology since 1978 and post-Cold War threats, surveillance of \nsome overseas communications were subjected to court orders.\n  It is now time for Congress to act to make permanent the fix to FISA \nso that our intelligence community has the tools they need to do their \njob in a very professional manner and gather the information necessary \nto protect our national security.\n  Let me be clear: These amendments to FISA would only apply to \nsurveillance directed at individuals who are located outside the United \nStates. This is not meant to intercept conversations between Americans \nor even between two terrorists who are located in the United States. \nThe Government still would be required to seek the permission of the \nFISA Court for any surveillance done against people physically located \nwithin the United States, whether a citizen or not.\n  This is not good enough for some Members of Congress. They wish to \nextend the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment currently not \nbestowed under U.S. criminal law and procedure to American citizens \noverseas. The U.S. laws do not extend beyond our border, but the \nSupreme Court has held that certain fundamental rights such as those \nprotected by the fifth and sixth amendments, as well as the \nreasonableness requirement of the fourth amendment, do extend to U.S. \ncitizens outside the country. However, despite the opportunity, the \nSupreme Court has refused to hold that the warrant clause of the fourth \namendment applies abroad for U.S. citizens. In a criminal prosecution, \nU.S. courts will accept evidence against U.S. citizens obtained by \nforeign governments without the probable cause demanded by U.S. law. \nU.S. courts recognize that the Bill of Rights does not protect \nAmericans from the acts of foreign sovereigns, and excluding evidence \nobtained by them will not deter foreign governments from collecting it. \nTherefore, the evidence can be turned over to the United States and \nused in a criminal prosecution.\n\n[[Page S15725]]\n\n  There was an amendment offered in the Intelligence Committee that \nrequires that anytime a U.S. person is a target of surveillance, \nregardless of where the collection occurs, the Attorney General must \nseek approval under title I of FISA for that collection. The amendment \nfails to consider the intelligence community's adherence to current \nregulations which were drafted to comply with the reasonableness \nrequirement of the fourth amendment.\n  Currently, under Executive Order 12333, section 2.5, the Attorney \nGeneral may authorize the targeting of a U.S. person overseas upon \nfinding probable cause to believe that the individual is a foreign \npower or agent of a foreign power. The intelligence community will now \nbe required to obtain authorization from the FISA Court prior to \nconducting surveillance against terrorists or spies overseas who assist \nforeign governments merely because they are United States persons. It \nis my belief that the intelligence community has demonstrated to \nCongress how judicious, selective and careful they have been when it \ncomes to protecting the very small number of U.S. citizens this applies \nto and does not necessarily need the court to approve their actions \nevery step along the way. This complicates, and attempts to \nmicromanage, the efforts of our intelligence community. Additionally, \nit prevents the intelligence community from acting quickly and with \ndiscretion in a process which has worked well to protect U.S. citizens \nfor almost 30 years.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed opposition to title II of the \nbill which provides that no civil actions may be brought against \nelectronic communication providers if the Attorney General certifies \nthat the assistance alleged was in connection with a lawful \ncommunication intelligence activity authorized by the President and \ndesigned to detect or prevent a terrorist attack against the United \nStates. Providing our telecommunications carriers with liability relief \nis necessary and responsible. The Government often needs assistance \nfrom the private sector in order to protect our national security and, \nin return, they should be able to rely on the Government's assurances \nthat the assistance they provide is lawful and necessary for our \nnational security. As a result of this assistance, America's \ntelecommunications carriers should not have to front heavy legal \nbattles shrouded in secrecy on the Government's behalf.\n  The chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence introduced a carefully crafted, bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. Although it was not a perfect bill, in committee I was \nwilling to forgo offering amendments to support the bipartisan process \nand provide our intelligence community with the minimum requirements it \nneeds in an environment with rapidly changing technology. I believe \nthat the bill which was ultimately adopted by the committee, and with \nmy support, contains troubling language which should be altered before \nenactment. Even so, this legislation is strides ahead of the partisan \nbill passed out of the Judiciary Committee and offered here as a \nsubstitute.\n  This is not, and should not, be a partisan issue by any means. The \nability to collect the intelligence necessary to protect our country \nfrom foreign adversaries and terrorists should not be subjected to \npartisan politics in Congress. Protecting our national security is in \nthe interest of all Americans, and Congress should seek to ensure that \nour Nation is protected fully. There are serious differences between \nthe substitute bill voted out of the Judiciary Committee and the bill \nvoted out of the Intelligence Committee. I urge my colleagues to reject \nthe Judiciary Committee's substitute amendment and support the \ncarefully crafted bipartisan bill passed out of the Intelligence \nCommittee. However, differences of opinion exist and make it essential \nfor Congress to examine and debate these issues on the floor. For these \nreasons I support cloture on the motion to proceed to FISA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Georgia in \nencouraging support for the motion to proceed so we can begin \nconsideration of this important bill. The reason for the FISA bill is \nvery straightforward. Technology has outpaced the law. We are now able \nto collect intelligence in ways that were never understood or \ncontemplated years ago when the law was drafted. As a result, we need \nto change the law to accommodate that collection.\n  Before we changed the law last year, we had lost about two-thirds of \nthe ability to collect intelligence against al-Qaida. Clearly, in this \nwar against these evildoers, these terrorists, we cannot cede two-\nthirds of the playing field to them without any monitoring or \ncollection of intelligence against them. When we did the Protect \nAmerica Act last summer, we regained the capability to collect that \nintelligence by conforming the legal procedures to the technology that \nenables us to collect this material.\n  Al-Qaida has not ceased to exist after 9/11. In fact, it exists and \nis still desiring to carry out the same kinds of attacks against the \nUnited States and other countries that it did on 9/11. We know the \nincredible amount of damage that can be inflicted if we are not \nprepared to deal with them. We also know that the best way to deal with \nal-Qaida and the like is to collect intelligence so we can prevent \nattacks from occurring rather than worrying about them after they have \noccurred. That is why it is so important for us to ensure that under \nthe law we can engage in the kind of intelligence collection against \nal-Qaida that technology today enables us to do.\n  Many of our friends on the other side of the aisle have insisted that \nthere be stringent congressional oversight of these programs by which \nwe collect the intelligence. No one disputes that is a desirable thing \nto do. That is why this Congress and previous Congresses have agreed on \na bipartisan basis to create robust oversight of U.S. intelligence \ngathering, even when it is against foreign targets. The agencies \nexecuting wiretaps and conducting other surveillance must report their \nactivities to Congress and to others, so the opportunities for domestic \npolitical abuse of these authorities is eliminated.\n  No one is on a witch hunt against Americans. There is more material \nout there to be collected against foreign targets. Our people certainly \ndon't have time to try to spy on Americans. That is not what is \ninvolved. We have to be careful that in creating this oversight we \ndon't cut deeply into the capabilities of our intelligence community, \nthat we don't in effect limit what they are able to do.\n  If you compare the Intelligence Committee bill with the Judiciary \nbill, you will see that the Judiciary bill would severely limit this \ncollection of intelligence. Even the Intelligence Committee bill has \none major flaw in it. We have to be careful that we don't tie down our \nIntelligence agencies with so many limits on how they can monitor \nforeign terrorist organizations that they really cannot respond to the \nthreat that exists.\n  Let me give one example. The Intelligence Committee bill, which is \nthe bill we are taking up first and which we should adopt, includes a \nprovision that has been labeled the Wyden amendment which, as written, \nwould require a warrant for any overseas surveillance that is conducted \nfor foreign intelligence purposes and targets a U.S. person. As the \nSenator from Georgia pointed out, we already have protocols to deal \nwith that, to minimize any potential problems that might arise in \nconducting intelligence that would include a U.S. person. But the way \nthe Wyden amendment is written is overly broad and unprecedented.\n  Under current law, a warrant would not be required for overseas \nsurveillance that is targeted to a U.S. person if that surveillance is \nconducted for purposes of a criminal investigation. So consider the \nanomaly. The Wyden amendment would create a requirement for a warrant \nto go after foreign terrorists involving also potentially U.S. persons, \nbut it would not require a warrant in those circumstances of drug \ntrafficking or money laundering that involve the very same people. It \nshould not be more burdensome to monitor al-Qaida than it is to monitor \na drug cartel. Yet the Wyden provision literally creates a situation \nwhere if an overseas group that includes U.S. persons is suspected, for \nexample, of smuggling hashish, no warrant is required, but if the\n\n[[Page S15726]]\n\nsame overseas group is suspected of plotting to blow up New York City, \nthen a warrant would be required. This is not only anomalous; it is bad \npolicy. It is the very kind of thing that if, God forbid, another \nattack should occur and we permit this to be written into the law, the \nnext 9/11 Commission will criticize the Congress for writing it into \nthe statute. We can prevent that from occurring by rejecting the Wyden \namendment.\n  Let me conclude by asking: What is our goal? Do we want to allow our \nintelligence agencies to use the most up-to-date technology to track \nand prevent attacks by the most evil people in the world today, these \nal-Qaida terrorists, or are we so concerned about some potential \ntheoretical, possible situation in which an American citizen's \ncommunications might be temporarily intercepted, if they call an al-\nQaida person or an al-Qaida person calls them, that we are not going to \ntake advantage of these intelligence-collection techniques?\n  We can write the law to ensure the protection of every U.S. person. \nWe need to do that. But we cannot restrict our intelligence agencies \nfrom collecting that intelligence that is out there that might warn us \nof another attack.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we will have a cloture vote shortly on \nthe motion to proceed to the FISA reform legislation that the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence reported last fall. I am glad we are \nproceeding to this bipartisan bill rather than to either of the rule \nXIV proposals. Both of those proposals would carve out core components \nof the Intel Committee's bill and likely would not obtain a \nPresidential signature.\n  The Intelligence Committee bill is a rarity in this Congress. It is \nthe product of weeks of painstaking negotiations between Senate \nRepublicans and Democrats, and benefited from the participation of \nintelligence experts in the administration.\n  The overwhelming bipartisan vote in the Intel Committee reflected the \ncare, concern, and good faith that went into crafting that bill. The \nfinal vote was not 15 to 0, but a vote of 13 to 2 is pretty close.\n  What is all the more impressive about the Intel bill is that this \naccomplishment is in an area--foreign intelligence surveillance--that \nis highly sensitive.\n  Modifications to the Intel bill still need to be made, but it \ncontains the two main ingredients that are needed for a Presidential \nsignature: It will allow intelligence professionals to do their jobs, \nand it will not allow trial lawyers to sue telecom companies that \nhelped protect the country.\n  Unfortunately, the Judiciary Committee bill lacks all the hallmarks \nof the Intelligence Committee's product. It does not provide our \nintelligence community with all the tools it needs. It does not protect \ntelecommunications companies from lawsuits. It does not enjoy \nbipartisan support. And, most importantly, it will not become law.\n  So I think we have one approach that could lead to an important \naccomplishment, and we have one that will not. I am hopeful we will \nchoose the right path.\n  Finally, I wish to make a couple of brief comments about the floor \nprocess for the FISA reform legislation.\n  I will be voting for cloture on the motion to proceed to the Intel \nbill, and I encourage all of our colleagues to do the same. A cloture \nvote is needed because of objections to the bipartisan bill by Senators \nFeingold and Dodd and others. It is certainly their right to object to \nthe Senate's consideration of this important legislation. But it is \nalso the right of other Senators to proceed carefully and thoughtfully \non this matter.\n  Legislation dealing with our foreign intelligence surveillance \ncapabilities is complex, and what we do determines if we are able to \nadequately defend the homeland from attack. Thus, Republicans will \ninsist on being able to debate and study the complicated consequences \nof amendments that are offered. That is every Senator's right and, \nespecially in this area, every Senator's duty.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield back our time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, under the \nprevious order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate \nthe pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to S. 2248, FISA.\n         Harry Reid, Patrick Leahy, Ken Salazar, Daniel K.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 2248, an original bill to amend the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, to modernize and streamline \nprovisions of that act, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a \nclose?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n\n[[Page S15727]]\n\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had a conversation with the \ndistinguished Republican leader. We are now postcloture. No one is \nintending to use the 30 hours. We know we have to get to the omnibus \nand other such things, but there are some people who want to talk \npostcloture. I have spoken to the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee and the ranking member. I have spoken to the Judiciary \nCommittee members several times today. I have spoken to Senator Dodd, \nwho has an amendment dealing with immunity. On this side, there is a \ngeneral feeling that the first amendment should be one dealing with \nimmunity. At this stage, the one who is willing and ready to offer it, \nas soon as the postcloture finishes, is Senator Dodd. So we will get to \nthat on our side as soon as we can.\n  I would also state it appears at this stage it would probably be in \neveryone's interest that we acknowledge going into this that everything \nis going to take 60 votes anyway. So rather than play games, I have \nspoken to the Republican side, and it would appear to me that when we \nget to the amendment-offering stage, we should recognize that is likely \nbe to the issue.\n  Now, let me also say this: I have finished a meeting 45 minutes ago \nwith the Speaker. They are going to finish the omnibus tonight. It will \nbe late. We will not get it tonight. They probably will not finish it \nuntil between 10 and 11 o'clock tonight. But that being the case, we \nare going to move to the omnibus tomorrow, if at all possible. To say \nthe least, it has been very difficult to get to the point where we are. \nI would hope everyone understands we are going to do our very best to \nfinish the bill tomorrow. There are a number of amendments that will be \noffered. There are very few that will be offered.\n  I have talked to Senator McConnell. At this stage, it appears there \nwill probably be four amendments, and that is all. That, of course, is \nalways a moving target, and there may need to be more. If people have \nquestions about this, check with the floor staff on the procedural \naspects. But it is a pretty straightforward issue tomorrow. When we \nfinish that, we have to do something about AMT, which is not completed. \nWe have terrorism insurance that we have to do. We have to do an \nextension of CHIP and some of the Medicare provisions. That is about \nit. I may be missing something, but I don't think much.\n  Everyone should understand that even though the omnibus is coming \nhere, we have spent hours and hours on this over the weekend trying to \nwork out some of our differences. The bill has almost nothing as it \nrelates to anything other than spending. It has been hard to arrive at \nwhere we have, but I think it has been one of cooperation. It was a \ngood weekend. I don't mean this in any negative sense, but I didn't \nhave to speak to the White House because we were able to work this out \nwith the Speaker and Senator McConnell--the Republican leaders in the \nHouse and my colleagues here. So I think we are in fairly decent shape \nto complete our work in the next couple of days.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This Senator wonders if we will have a chance to read \nthat omnibus. I understand it may or may not contain all of the bills \nthat are unresolved as far as the appropriations process is concerned.\n  Mr. REID. The bill was online last night. It was filed around 5 \no'clock. It is on the House Rules Web site. It has been available for \n15 to 18 hours.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is still subject to amendment in the House, isn't it?\n  Mr. REID. No. Well, it is subject to whatever the Rules Committee \ndoes over there. They are taking it to Rules today, and it will be on \nthe floor sometime early this evening, and they will finish it tonight.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the leader will yield, Senator Dodd is \nprepared----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If we can extend the courtesies to our Members \nhere, we need order in the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. We have a Judiciary Committee bill that \nwas passed out with a majority vote. I, at some point, will modify that \nsomewhat. At some point, that will require a vote. We have discussed \nthis already. I wanted to make sure people understand that. Senator \nDodd will go first, but at some point I will do that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we thought there may be, initially, a bill \nthat would be offered by the respective chairmen of the Intelligence \nand Judiciary Committees. That didn't quite work out. Senator Leahy \ngraciously indicated he would be willing to have Senator Dodd go first. \nSenator Dodd has other things he wants to look to. We have a tentative \ntime agreement for Senator Dodd, but we don't have that finalized yet. \nWe need to get some of the postcloture debate out of the way. As soon \nas that is done, Senator Dodd will be recognized. If that is not the \ncase, I will be recognized to offer the amendment on his behalf. We \nhope there will be no efforts to have a jump ball on our side. That is \nthe first amendment Senator Leahy and Senator Rockefeller want to do.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, did I hear the majority leader ask unanimous \nconsent that votes would have a 60-vote requirement?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend that I did not ask that. \nI indicated I thought we should understand that would be the end \nresult.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all votes in relation to the bill that \nis now before the Senate--the FISA legislation--require 60 votes, \nexcept for final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is there a \nrule in the Senate that requires this?\n  Mr. REID. It is by unanimous consent on this bill. It is a very \ncontroversial bill. I think there would not be the votes, for example, \non the immunity aspect; I am confident there are people who would \nrequire 60 votes. In an effort to cut through a lot of the talk here, \nwe would try to set up a time that we would vote on this as the first \namendment out of the box; and on the other amendments, until further \nnotice and agreement among Senators, we would have a 60-vote margin.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say this, further reserving the right to object, I \nwill respectfully object at this time, and I will talk with the leader \nabout that necessity. I don't want to set the precedent of insisting on \n60 votes on a germane amendment. I will object at this point, and \nfollowing that, the leader can make the request again.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend has every right to object. It is \nquite obvious that this is required because Members will simply \nfilibuster. They have told me so. If we are talking about something as \nsensitive as immunity, retroactive immunity, and prospective immunity, \nit is going to take 60 votes. The rules don't require that, we know \nthat, but the rules do require 60 votes to stop a filibuster.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I object to any measure coming up that does \nnot have a 60-vote requirement. We conditioned our approval to bring up \nthese amendments on agreeing to 60 votes; otherwise, we will use the \nprerogatives of the Senate.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I understand the 60-vote majority, but I \nhave a germane amendment that strikes a provision in the bill. I \nunderstand the rules. When something is nongermane or violative of the \nrules of the Senate and you want to waive the rule, you have a \nsupermajority requirement, but not on an amendment pertaining directly \nto the bill that strikes a section of it. I understand there is \nopposition to it, but having to reach a supermajority on an amendment \nthat strikes something in the bill that is of significant disagreement \nseems to be excessive at this point.\n  This is an important piece of legislation, and the Judiciary \nCommittee voted differently than the Intelligence Committee on this \nmatter. We feel strongly about this. If I were offering something that \nis violative of the Senate rules, I would accept a supermajority. But \nto establish the precedent here that any amendment to be offered to \nthis bill will be subjected to a supermajority vote I think is too \nexcessive. That is my concern. Tell me I am wrong about that, that I am \nviolating the rules of the Senate, and I will accept that. But if we \nare establishing that simply on any amendment that is different, I \nthink that is a direction in which we should not go.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, on the immunity issue--we have \na lot of matters here. We have had 60-vote margins all year, including \non the war\n\n[[Page S15728]]\n\nin Iraq. The Senator is right that there is no requirement that there \nbe 60 votes. But there is a requirement that if somebody talks and \nkeeps talking, there won't be a vote. So the Senator can offer his \namendment, but, as we have heard from people on both sides of the \naisle, there won't be a vote taking place on his amendment--50 votes or \n55 votes or 60 votes.\n  I thought it would be in the interest of the body to cut to the chase \nand say on this and other matters--this is a very controversial issue. \nWe don't have time to have a lot of cloture votes on different \namendments. So it seems to me that it is in the best interest of \neverybody that that is the agreement. The suggestion made is a good \none.\n  Despite agreeing with the Senator from Connecticut as to this issue, \nit doesn't mean he and I are right. Certainly, by the unanimous consent \nrequest, there is no precedent set in the Senate. It is on a case-by-\ncase basis.\n  Mr. President, what is the matter before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to S. 2248.\n  Mr. REID. That is one where we have 30 hours from the time the vote \ntakes place, with Senators having 1 hour under their control; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are now postcloture, that is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry, if I might. I \nwonder, is there a unanimous consent request regarding speakers \npostcloture at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No request.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to know this, if I may ask a question to \nSenator Dodd. He, at this point, is objecting to a 60-vote requirement, \nand therefore the regular order would be to have people speak on the \nmotion to proceed; is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. I have an amendment I would like to offer that strikes \ntitle II of the legislation. I am prepared to offer that. I know \nSenator Leahy talked about going first. I am prepared to follow \nwhatever the Senate would like us to in order. I would like an \nopportunity to offer my amendment at some point. I told the leader that \nwe can work out a time agreement. I wasn't quite ready to do it. I want \nto know how many people want to be heard. I will limit myself, but I \nwant to get a vote. I am not looking for extended debate on my \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Further, when such a list is made, I ask Senator Dodd or \nthe majority leader to please place me on the list for a 15-minute \ntimeframe on his amendment and a broader statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On a motion to proceed, amendments are not in \norder at this point.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think it would be appropriate if we find \nout, postcloture, who wants to give speeches. Once we find out how many \nwant to speak and how much time they want, we can lay down the bill and \nhave Senator Dodd offer his amendment. Anybody who wants to speak \npostcloture, let us know so we can get to the bill. We are not on the \nbill yet. We are postcloture.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if it is in order, I would like to start \nand talk for 10 minutes. I would like to make my remarks on the issue \nthat is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly support bringing the Judiciary \nCommittee version of the FISA bill before us. That is why I voted not \nto proceed to take up the Intelligence Committee bill.\n  I did not cast that vote lightly because, as the Chair knows, I want \nto get the terrorists. I voted to go after Osama bin Laden. I voted to \ngo after al-Qaida after they attacked us. I have voted to give this \nPresident every penny he needed to go ahead and capture Osama bin \nLaden. To date, much to my dismay and the dismay of the American \npeople, we haven't captured bin Laden, who engineered the attack \nagainst our Nation. We have not caught him dead, we have not caught him \nalive. But we did capture Saddam Hussein, who didn't attack us on 9/11. \nWe did get into a war we cannot get out of, thanks to the President and \nhis backers, who have gotten us into a position where there is no way \nout and no end in sight. But capture bin Laden? No.\n  I will never give up hope on that. I will give our country all the \ntools it needs to get him and the others who have harmed us and who \nwant to harm us in the future. That is our most sacred responsibility \nand duty. But if we are not careful, if we are not prudent, if we are \nnot honest about what we are doing here, we give bin Laden exactly what \nhe wants, Mr. President: a country that scares its people rather than a \ncountry that protects its people, a country that takes away the rights \nof its people out of fear.\n  Former Justice Thurgood Marshall said:\n\n       History teaches us that grave threats to liberty often come \n     in times of urgency, when constitutional rights seem too \n     extravagant to ignore.\n\n  Now, what makes America so great? It is that we have been a guiding \nlight to the world because we have been a strong nation in all ways, \nand a strong nation protects the rights of its citizens, while a weak \nnation, a fearful nation, a nation that lives in fear, abdicates those \nrights. We see it around the world. Let us never see it here.\n  We have an understanding here in America that the need for security \nmust always be balanced against the rights of the people. Once we lose \nthat precious balance, we are giving the terrorists exactly what they \nwant.\n  We cannot and we must not ever lose that precious balance. If freedom \nand liberty become nothing more than just hollow words, then when we \ntry to lead the world, we will simply not have the moral high ground. \nWe have seen this happen in our great Nation in so many areas, and we \ncannot today, or during the next couple of days, allow this Nation, \nwith our permission, to look at the rights of our people and take them \nlightly.\n  I quote another Supreme Court Justice, one of my heroines, Sandra Day \nO'Connor:\n\n       It is during our most challenging and uncertain moments \n     that our Nation's commitment to due process is most severely \n     tested; and it is in those times that we must preserve our \n     commitment at home to the principles for which we fight \n     abroad.\n\n  ``We must preserve our commitment at home to the principles for which \nwe fight abroad.''\n  When President Bush announced his foreign policy--I will never forget \nit--he said we need to bring democracy around the world. We need to \nbring freedom around the world. We need to stop the despots of the \nworld from taking away the freedoms the people have. Yet here at home \nthey are destroying tapes, at home they are listening in on Americans \nwithout a warrant.\n  What is in the judiciary version of the bill that makes it much \nbetter than the intelligence version, and why was I so proud to stand \nwith only 10 of my colleagues? I thank Senator Dodd for his leadership \non this issue. That is a hard vote. Here is why.\n  The judiciary version of the bill requires at least one specific \nindividual target in order to begin bulk collection of international \ncommunications. You need to name one target; that is what the Judiciary \nCommittee is saying. You just don't go on a fishing expedition. We have \nseen those kinds of fishing expeditions before. We have seen people \nherded up before. We cannot do that now, not in this century; not in \nthis century when we are fighting bin Laden and we are fighting the \nforces that want to take away freedom.\n  Second, it requires a FISA Court order to continue surveillance when \na call involves U.S. citizens. That is called a check and balance. That \nis essential to our freedom.\n  Third, it allows the FISA Court to decide whether surveillance \ncontinues while the Government appeals a decision against a proposed \nsurveillance program. That is another example of check and balance.\n  Human beings are flawed, and when all the power resides in one or two \nof them, we need to have a check and balance. By the way, check and \nbalance is one of the centerpieces of our freedom, of our Constitution. \nIn this particular area of the law, we ought to make sure it is built \nin.\n  The Judiciary bill provides ongoing FISA Court supervision, including \naudits of surveillance programs. Again, a check and balance.\n  And then, of course, there is the issue on which Senator Dodd has \nbeen such a leader, and that is the issue of immunity, immunity for \ntelecommunications companies that cooperated\n\n[[Page S15729]]\n\nwith the administration's warrantless surveillance program.\n  Let me point out that there were some companies that did not go along \nwith it. Let's not be led to believe that every company rolled over and \nsaid: Here, have at it. There were some that stood up for the law, the \nlaw that was supposed to guide them. There were some that stood up for \nthe American people, and I thank them.\n  To the others, what I say to them is this--I understand why they \nmight not have stood up, but we have to get to the bottom of this \nissue. We cannot go around giving people immunity when they turn their \nbacks on the rule of law.\n  Granting immunity without fully understanding whether Americans were \nspied upon in a warrantless surveillance program is irresponsible \nbecause of this reason: Congress and the American people will be \nblocked from finding out the truth about the warrantless program. We \nmay not find out for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. That is wrong. The \nAmerican people deserve to know the truth.\n  Again, I take it to what we are as a nation. We are a free people. \nOur people deserve to be protected. The ones who are bad apples deserve \nto be caught and face the music. We need to find a law that seeks that \nbalance and gets that balance. I think the Judiciary Committee did that \nbeautifully, and I wish that was the bill in front of us now. That is \nwhy I voted not to proceed to the Intelligence Committee version.\n  Having said this, I hope we can work together and improve the \nIntelligence Committee bill. The Intelligence Committee version of the \nbill with telecom immunity puts the interests of the telecom companies \nahead of the rights of the American people.\n  In closing, this is a watershed moment for us. Why do I say that? I \nheard Senator Sessions come down and give a very eloquent speech. He \nsaid, ``The civil''--I am quoting him now--``The civil libertarians \namong us''--and then he listed all the bad things he thinks the civil \nlibertarians among us have done. I hope every one of us--every one of \nus in this Chamber--supports the civil liberties of the United States \nof America because if you don't, you don't believe in the Constitution. \nThat is where we get these rights.\n  We need a FISA bill that will help us continue to track the \nterrorists without surrendering our rights and our liberties, and this \ncan be done. I hope we can get a coalition together and amend this \nIntelligence Committee bill in a way that will do just that. We need a \nbill that closes loopholes in FISA that clearly have been created by \nadvancements in technology. I understand that. But we also need a FISA \nbill that, while it allows us to go after the bad guys, has proper \nchecks and balances within it. We need a bill that will improve FISA \nCourt oversight of our foreign surveillance programs without hindering \nour ability to protect our country. We can do that.\n  I believe the Judiciary Committee version of the FISA bill \naccomplishes these goals. We don't have to create it here. They did an \nexcellent job. It seems to me to throw out all their work would be a \nbig error.\n  Finally, my point: It is so ironic and sad to me that we are losing \nour beautiful young people, and, by the way, not so young, some from \nthe National Guard who are in their thirties and forties and older. We \nare losing them every day over in Iraq. Why? Ask the President to \nanswer that question. He will be quick to answer it eloquently. To \nbring freedom and democracy, bring freedom and democracy, bring freedom \nand democracy.\n  If you feel that way, Mr. President, and those who support him and \nhave given him a blank check, then let's protect it at home in a way \nthat allows us to go after those who will do us harm if we are not \ncareful, and yet protects the very essence of our Nation, the very \nfreedom of our Nation, the very essence of our Constitution that has \nbrought us to this point where the world envies our freedom and \ndemocracy. To give it up for politics or sound bites or 30-second \ncommercials on television would be a dereliction of our most sacred \nduty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized for 15 minutes and that the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, be recognized next if no Member of the minority seeks \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, just recently, the Attorney General \nof the United States published an opinion piece in the Los Angeles \nTimes on our ongoing work to improve the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, what we call FISA. This follows closely on a similar \nopinion piece by the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral \nMcConnell, in the New York Times.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record each of these \ndocuments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 12, 2007]\n\n                               A FISA Fix\n\n                        (By Michael B. Mukasey)\n\n       One of the most critical matters facing Congress is the \n     need to enact long-term legislation updating our nation's \n     foreign intelligence surveillance laws. Intercepting the \n     communications of terrorists and other intelligence targets \n     has given us crucial insights into the intentions of our \n     adversaries and has helped us to detect and prevent terrorist \n     attacks.\n       Until recently, our surveillance efforts were hampered by \n     the unintended consequences of an outdated law, the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act, which was enacted in 1978 to \n     establish a system of judicial approval for certain \n     intelligence surveillance activities in the United States.\n       The requirement that a judge issue an order before \n     communications can be intercepted serves important purposes \n     when the target of the surveillance is a person in our \n     country, where constitutional privacy interests are most \n     significant. The problem, however, was that FISA increasingly \n     had come to apply to the interception of communications of \n     terrorists and other intelligence targets located overseas. \n     In FISA, Congress had embedded the crucial distinction \n     between whether targets are inside or outside our country, \n     but did so using terms based on the technology as it existed \n     then. However, revolutionary changes in communications \n     technology in the intervening years have resulted in FISA \n     applying more frequently to surveillance directed at targets \n     overseas. The increased volume of applications for judicial \n     orders under FISA impaired our ability to collect critical \n     intelligence, with little if any corresponding benefit to the \n     privacy of people in the U.S.\n       This summer, Congress responded by passing the Protect \n     America Act. That law, passed with significant bipartisan \n     support, authorized intelligence agencies to conduct \n     surveillance targeting people overseas without court \n     approval, but it retained FISA's requirement that a court \n     order be obtained to conduct electronic surveillance directed \n     at people in the United States. As J. Michael McConnell, the \n     director of national intelligence, stated, the new law closed \n     dangerous gaps that had developed in our intelligence \n     collection. Congress, however, set the act to expire on Feb. \n     1, 2008.\n       It therefore is vital that Congress put surveillance of \n     terrorists and other intelligence targets located overseas on \n     surer institutional footing. The Senate Intelligence \n     Committee has crafted a bill that would largely accomplish \n     that objective. Recognizing the uncommon complexity of this \n     area of the law, the committee held numerous hearings on the \n     need to modernize FISA, received classified briefings on how \n     various options would affect intelligence operations and \n     discussed key provisions with intelligence professionals and \n     with national security lawyers inside and outside government. \n     This thorough process produced a balanced bill approved by an \n     overwhelming, and bipartisan, 13-2 vote.\n       The Senate Intelligence Committee's bill is not perfect, \n     and it contains provisions that I hope will be improved. \n     However, it would achieve two important objectives. First, it \n     would keep the intelligence gaps closed by ensuring that \n     individual court orders are not required to direct \n     surveillance at foreign targets overseas.\n       Second, it would provide protections from lawsuits for \n     telecommunications companies that have been sued simply \n     because they are believed to have assisted our intelligence \n     agencies after the 9/11 attacks. The bill does not, as some \n     have suggested, provide blanket immunity for those companies. \n     Instead, a lawsuit would be dismissed only in cases in which \n     the attorney general certified to the court either that a \n     company did not provide assistance to the government or that \n     a company had received a written request indicating that the \n     activity was authorized by the president and determined to be \n     lawful.\n       It is unfair to force such companies to face the \n     possibility of massive judgments and litigation costs, and \n     allowing these lawsuits to proceed also risks disclosure of \n     our country's intelligence capabilities to our enemies. \n     Moreover, in the future we will need the full-hearted help of \n     private companies in our intelligence activities, we cannot \n     expect such cooperation to be forthcoming if we do not \n     support companies that have helped us in the past.\n       The bill that came out of the Senate Intelligence Committee \n     was carefully crafted and\n\n[[Page S15730]]\n\n     is a good starting point for legislation. Unfortunately, \n     there are two other versions of the bill being considered \n     that do not accomplish the two key objectives. The House of \n     Representatives recently passed a version that would \n     significantly weaken the Protect America Act by, among other \n     things, requiring individual court orders to target people \n     overseas in order to acquire certain types of foreign \n     intelligence information. Similarly, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee made significant amendments to the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee's bill that would have the collective \n     effect of weakening the government's ability to effectively \n     surveil intelligence targets abroad.\n       Moreover, neither the House bill nor the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee's version addresses protection for companies that \n     face massive liability. Both the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     amendments and the House bill passed largely on party lines, \n     and the full Senate will be debating this issue shortly\n       Congress must choose how to correct critical shortcomings \n     in our foreign intelligence surveillance laws. It is a time \n     for urgency. The Protect America Act expires in just two \n     months, and we cannot afford to allow dangerous gaps in our \n     intelligence capabilities to reopen. But this is also a time \n     of opportunity, when we can set aside political differences \n     to develop a long-term, bipartisan solution to widely \n     recognized deficiencies in our national security laws. When \n     Congress returns to this challenge, it should continue on the \n     course charted by the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 10, 2007]\n\n                        Help Me Spy on Al Qaeda\n\n                           (By Mike McConnell)\n\n       The Protect America Act, enacted in August, has lived up to \n     its name and objective: making the country safer while \n     protecting the civil liberties of Americans. Under this new \n     law, we now have the speed and agility necessary to detect \n     terrorist and other evolving national security threats. \n     Information obtained under this law has helped us develop a \n     greater understanding of international Qaeda networks, and \n     the law has allowed us to obtain significant insight into \n     terrorist planning.\n       Congress needs to act again. The Protect America Act \n     expires in less than two months, on Feb. 1. We must be able \n     to continue effectively obtaining the information gained \n     through this law if we are to stay ahead of terrorists who \n     are determined to attack the United States.\n       Before the Protect America Act was enacted, to monitor the \n     communications of foreign intelligence targets outside the \n     United States, in some cases we had to operate under the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known as FISA, a law \n     that had not kept pace with changes in technology. In a \n     significant number of these cases, FISA required us to obtain \n     a court order. This requirement slowed--and sometimes \n     prevented--our ability to collect timely foreign \n     intelligence.\n       Our experts were diverted from tracking foreign threats to \n     writing lengthy justifications to collect information from a \n     person in a foreign country, simply to satisfy an outdated \n     statute that did not reflect the ways our adversaries \n     communicate. The judicial process intended to protect the \n     privacy and civil liberties of Americans was applied instead \n     to foreign intelligence targets in foreign countries. This \n     made little sense, and the Protect America Act eliminated \n     this problem.\n       Any new law should begin by being true to the principles \n     that make the Protect America Act successful. First, the \n     intelligence community needs a law that does not require a \n     court order for surveillance directed at a foreign \n     intelligence target reasonably believed to be outside the \n     United States, regardless of where the communications are \n     found. The intelligence community should spend its time \n     protecting our nation, not providing privacy protections to \n     foreign terrorists and other diffuse international threats.\n       Second, the intelligence community needs an efficient means \n     to obtain a FISA court order to conduct surveillance in the \n     United States for foreign intelligence purposes.\n       Finally, it is critical for the intelligence community to \n     have liability protection for private parties that are sued \n     only because they are believed to have assisted us after \n     Sept. 11, 2001. Although the Protect America Act provided \n     such necessary protection for those complying with requests \n     made after its enactment, it did not include protection for \n     those that reportedly complied earlier.\n       The intelligence community cannot go it alone. Those in the \n     private sector who stand by us in times of national security \n     emergencies deserve thanks, not lawsuits. I share the view of \n     the Senate Intelligence Committee, which, after a year of \n     study, concluded that ``without retroactive immunity, the \n     private sector might be unwilling to cooperate with lawful \n     government requests in the future,'' and warned that ``the \n     possible reduction in intelligence that might result from \n     this delay is simply unacceptable for the safety of our \n     nation.''\n       Time for the Protect America Act is growing short, but \n     there is still an opportunity to enact permanent legislation \n     that helps us to better confront both changing technology and \n     the enemies we face in a way that protects civil liberties.\n       I served for almost 30 years as an intelligence officer \n     before spending some time in the private sector. When I \n     returned to government last winter, it became clear to me \n     that our foreign intelligence collection capacity was being \n     degraded. I was very troubled to discover that FISA had not \n     been updated to reflect new technology and was preventing us \n     from collecting foreign intelligence needed to uncover \n     threats to Americans.\n       The Protect America Act fixed this problem, and we are \n     safer for it. I would be gravely concerned if we took a step \n     backward into this world of uncertainty; America would be a \n     less safe place.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, both opinion pieces go on at some \nlength about the importance of new legislation on foreign surveillance \nactivities. They devote paragraph after paragraph to this issue. But \nthe two leaders of America's law enforcement and intelligence \ncommunities completely ignore, never once mention, the issue that is \nactually in dispute; that is, on what terms will we allow this \nadministration to spy on Americans?\n  We all agree to unleash our intelligence agencies on foreign targets \nof foreign surveillance. There is no question there. The heart of the \ndebate is the question of spying on Americans, one, when they are \noutside the country, or, two, when they are incidentally intercepted by \nsurveillance targeted at someone else.\n  This, the wiretapping of Americans, has been the entire subject of \nour work on surveillance. And yet Judge Mukasey and Admiral McConnell \nnever once mentioned the topic. There are only two possibilities and \neach is regrettable. One is that these two gentlemen simply don't know \nwhat is going on, which seems unlikely since Director McConnell has \nparticipated in hearings on the subject, and we discussed in detail our \nconcern about wiretapping Americans, and members of my staff are \nworking through the details of the issue on a nearly daily basis with \nlawyers at the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of \nJustice.\n  So that leaves only one alternative that these two gentlemen do know \nwhat is going on and just chose to talk past the issue, ignore its very \nexistence. That is a shame, and I hope it is not the early propaganda \nphase of a Bush administration effort to replicate the August stampede \nthat got us into this pickle in the first place.\n  Since they have not mentioned it, let me tell you what the problem \nis. The Protect America Act passed in the August stampede contains no \nstatutory limitation on this administration's ability to spy on \nAmericans traveling abroad whenever it wants, for whatever purpose. Let \nme repeat that. The Protect America Act contains no statutory \nrestriction on this administration's ability to spy on Americans \ntraveling abroad whenever it wants, for whatever purpose.\n  The only limitation that now exists on that power is section 2.5 of \nExecutive order No. 12333, which says the administration will not \nwiretap Americans overseas unless the Attorney General determines that \nperson is an agent of a foreign power.\n  The problem, as I noted in a speech in this Chamber recently, is a \nsecret Bush administration Office of Legal Counsel memo related to \nsurveillance activities which says this:\n\n       An Executive order cannot limit a President. There is no \n     constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new \n     Executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms \n     of a previous Executive order. Rather than violate an \n     Executive order, the President has instead modified or waived \n     it.\n  In other words, the only thing standing between Americans traveling \noverseas and a Government wiretap is an Executive order that this \nPresident believes he is under no obligation to obey and may secretly \ndisregard. The only thing standing between Americans traveling overseas \nand a Government wiretap is an Executive order this President believes \nhe has no obligation to obey and may secretly disregard.\n  So for months we have worked to repair the flawed bill of August, and \nthe question of spying on Americans has been the issue--the issue--of \nconcern. I and my staff, many of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and their staffs have been working diligently and in good faith \nto solve this problem. What I have seen in these negotiations has been \na thoughtful exchange by well-intentioned people who are committed to \nkeeping America safe without trampling on the rights of Americans.\n  We have talked not only with each other on both sides of the aisle \nbut also\n\n[[Page S15731]]\n\nwith people in this administration, including staff attorneys at the \nDOJ and DNI. We have worked almost all the way toward making sure \nAmericans who are incidentally intercepted enjoy full, meaningful \nminimization protections. I think we have worked all the way toward \nmaking sure a court order is required to wiretap an American who \nhappens to be overseas.\n  For both Director of National Intelligence McConnell and Attorney \nGeneral Mukasey to write an op-ed as if the issue of spying on \nAmericans abroad has no role in this debate, when it has been the key \nand central issue in this debate, is, frankly, disappointing. One \nwonders how big the elephant in the room has to be before they are \nwilling to acknowledge it. Ignoring this problem may serve the Bush-\nCheney interest in unaccountable executive power, but it does not \nprotect Americans' privacy and it does not make Americans safer.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember that the issue we have been \ngrappling with is a simple one: On what terms will we allow this \nadministration to spy on Americans? It is a question with real \nimplications for our democracy, for our civil liberties, and ultimately \nfor the security of this Nation.\n  Unless we really believe that when Americans leave our country we \nleave our civil rights behind, unless we really believe this Government \nshould have unfettered power to eavesdrop on conversations of families \nvacationing in Europe or soldiers serving in Iraq, then the authority \nto spy on Americans abroad cannot be left under the exclusive control \nof this administration. It is a matter that must be solved in this \nlegislation that Congress must pass to restore the Protect America Act \nto a fair appreciation of civil liberties.\n  That is why we have been working on this question so hard. It is a \nserious question. I wish the two gentlemen leading the key Departments \nof Government involved had recognized that it exists, and I urge my \ncolleagues to insist on the protections we have worked so hard for--to \nprotect Americans from surveillance in a way the intelligence community \nhas come to support.\n  We have come a long way. Chairman Rockefeller is owed our gratitude, \nas is Chairman Leahy. Their leadership in this has been spectacular. I \nalso wish to express appreciation for the efforts of the distinguished \nranking members, Senators Kit Bond and Arlen Specter. We are on the \nverge of a historic moment in the rights of Americans and in making \nsure that when they travel abroad it is clear that they take their \nrights with them. Let us not let this moment slip away.\n  Madam President, how much time remains of my 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Let me say one thing quickly, and we will come back \nto it, I believe, when amendments come forward.\n  With respect to the question of how we deal with the litigation that \npresently involves certain telephone communications carriers, I think \neverybody in this Chamber should remember the impossible predicament in \nwhich those companies have been placed. There are litigants, private \nlitigants in court, in an ongoing action, and the Government has come \nin and told them: You may not defend yourself. It has told them: You \nmay not say one word in defense of this litigation. National security \nis asserted as the reason, and all of the threats that come with \nviolations of national security are in play.\n  So there they are, private litigants in private litigation, and the \nGovernment has stepped in and said: You may not defend yourself. I \nthink we have to do something about that. Along with what the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary said earlier, the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter, I think the only decent thing we can expect \nthe Government to do is to at least step in itself for these litigants. \nIf they are going to tell the carriers they can't defend themselves in \ncourt in ongoing litigation, the least this Government should be able \nto do is to step in and say: We will step in and substitute ourselves \nfor you.\n  So I applaud what Senator Specter has done with his substitution \nbill, and I look forward to a discussion of that.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, and I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield \nthe remainder of my hour postcloture to Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me begin by thanking my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, not only for her generosity in giving me \nsome additional time, but also for her comments regarding the \nunderlying discussions on the FISA legislation and the provisions of \nthe law before us for our consideration. I appreciate her comments and \nher thoughts on the subject matter.\n  I have already spoken at some length on FISA this morning, on these \namendments, this new legislation before us, and my concern for what I \nconsider to be the most egregious provision in this proposed \nlegislation--that is, the retroactive immunity for the \ntelecommunications industry that may have helped the President break \nthe law. I have objected to that immunity on some very specific grounds \nbecause it would cover up an immense violation of trust, privacy, and \ncivil liberties in our country.\n  This was not some small matter. It was not a one-time event. It went \non for 5 years, in an elaborate and extensive way. But even more \nimportantly, immunity is wrong because of what it represents. This is a \nfatal weakening of the rule of law which shuts out our independent \njudiciary and concentrates power in the hands of the executive.\n  FISA, as we have seen, was written precisely to resist that \nconcentration. That the motivation in 1976-1978 when this legislation \nwas drafted: making sure we could bridge this gap between security and \nrights, protecting both our security and our fundamental liberties. \nWhen we divide that power responsibly between the legitimate \nlegislative, judicial, and executive branches, terrorist surveillance \nis not weakened; it is strengthened and made more judicious and more \nlegitimate and less subject to the abuses that sap public trust.\n  But when millions of people, for over 5 years, had their private \ncommunications interrupted by the telecommunications industry, without \na court order--which is what the law requires--the spirit of FISA has \nbeen undermined, and the public trust has been sapped. That, Mr. \nPresident, compromises our security.\n  I firmly believe, therefore, that any changes to FISA must be in \nkeeping with its original spirit of shared powers, respect for the rule \nof law. If we act wisely, we can ensure terrorist surveillance remains \ninside the law and not an exception to it.\n  The Senate should pass a bill doing just that, and we will have the \nopportunity to do so; but the FISA Amendments Act, as it comes to us \nfrom the Intelligence Committee, is not that bill. Its safeguards \nagainst abuse, against the needless targeting of ordinary Americans, \nare far too weak. The power this bill concentrates in the hands of the \nadministration is far too expansive.\n  However, the Senate also has before it a version of the bill that \nembodies a far greater respect for the rule of law. The version crafted \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee substituted a completely new title I \nand was reported out on November 16. Both versions of the bill \nauthorize the President to conduct overseas surveillance without \nindividual warrants. Let me repeat that: both bills--both versions of \nthe bill authorize the President to conduct overseas surveillance \nwithout individual warrants.\n  Madam President, I see my colleague from California arriving on the \nfloor, so I will yield the floor to her. I will ask when I come back to \npick up my remarks as if uninterrupted, when the Senator from \nCalifornia completes her remarks; or the Senator from Missouri may have \nsome thoughts on this legislation, and I will be more than happy to \nyield to him, as well, before coming back to the remarks I was in the \nmidst of giving.\n  But I appreciate the opportunity to address the subject of \nretroactive immunity, which is the reason I am here on this matter \ntoday. So I look forward\n\n[[Page S15732]]\n\nto hearing from the Senator from California, and I am withholding my \ntime, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Indeed, Madam President, I am taken aback by the \ngenerosity of the Senator from Connecticut, and I want him to know I \nvery much appreciate it.\n  I wish to make a few comments on this bill and then introduce two \namendments. These two amendments are very important to me because \nwithout them I am going to have a great deal of trouble voting for the \nfinal product. I say that as a predicate.\n  First, the general comments.\n  On December 16, 2005, the New York Times introduced the world to a \nsecret NSA surveillance program, later dubbed the ``terrorist \nsurveillance program,'' or TSP as it came to be known. This program, \nordered by the President after September 11, 2001, was conducted in \nviolation of U.S. law.\n  I have served on the Intelligence Committee for more than 6 years now \nand on the Judiciary Committee for almost 15 years, and I can tell you \nthat NSA signals intelligence is an indispensable tool on the war on \nterror. No one should think there aren't people who would do us harm. \nThe only way to wage this war on terror is to find them before they \nfind us. At the same time, it is crucial to remember the history.\n  FISA was first enacted in 1978 in the wake of major civil rights \nabuses of foreign intelligence. The White House had authorized \nsurveillance on Americans because of their political views--Martin \nLuther King, Joan Baez, and many others--a massive drift net collection \nof communications of U.S. citizens into and out of the United States. \nFISA was enacted to ensure such abuses would not occur again, and it \nhas, in fact, safeguarded Americans' privacy rights for the past 30 \nyears.\n  FISA requires court review and approval when surveillance is \ntargeting a person inside this country. No content can be collected on \nan individual unless there is a warrant by the FISA Court.\n  As has been pointed out many times, changes in telecommunications \ntechnology and a change in the nature of our enemies have made updates \nto the 1978 FISA law necessary. New legislation is, in fact, needed to \nredraw the lines detailing when and where surveillance can take place \nand when a court warrant is required. That is what this debate is about \nand that is what the cloture vote just began.\n  To be clear, these modifications should not come at the expense of \ncivil liberties protections that are enshrined in our Constitution. \nToday, in my view, it is clear that the administration made a big \nmistake in not using FISA in the first place. I have consistently said \nthat I thought the terrorist surveillance program could be done under \nFISA. A FISA Court judge proved this correct earlier this year. If \nchanges to FISA were needed to accomplish this surveillance, the \nadministration should have requested those changes when we reauthorized \nthe PATRIOT Act.\n  But, instead, the White House and Department of Justice relied on a \nnew and aggressive interpretation of the President's article II \nauthority under the Constitution, and a flawed argument that the \nauthorization to grant military force use provided a statutory \nexemption to FISA. That was a big mistake. It is clear to me from the \nOffice of Legal Counsel opinions that individuals in the Justice \nDepartment did not feel bound by established U.S. law, but proceeded \nunder a new and expanded view of Presidential authority to move forward \nwith the program.\n  With this bill, we can turn the page on a sad portion of our Nation's \nhistory. Both the Intelligence and the Judiciary bills will keep the \nterrorist surveillance program under FISA, and it will restore \nprotections for America's privacy rights in ways that the Protect \nAmerica Act does not. Let me give a few examples.\n  No. 1, this bill categorically requires an individualized warrant any \ntime surveillance targets someone inside the United States. So the \nargument about a great drift net being cast across the United States, \npicking up tens of thousands of America's phone calls, simply is not \ncorrect. Targets outside the United States would be subject to a \nprogram warrant where the FISA Court reviews the targeting, in what are \ncalled minimization procedures.\n  No. 2, the FISA Court review must be involved any time the \nintelligence community is conducting surveillance on an American \nanywhere in the world. By that I mean any time a American is collected \nfor content anywhere in the world, that individual becomes a target. \nUntil now, the Attorney General has authorized, under section 2.5 of \nExecutive Order 12333, surveillance of Americans outside the country. \nThere has been no FISA Court review in these cases.\n  The numbers of Americans targeted overseas were between 50 and 60 \ncases last year, according to the DNI--last year being 2006. So the \nnumbers are small, and reports are made anonymous through minimization, \nand only included if they contained foreign intelligence value.\n  No. 3, the bill puts the FISA Court review upfront, where it belongs, \nrather than 4 months after collection has begun, as was done under the \nProtect America Act. In other words, upfront the FISA Court reviews the \nminimization and approves that minimization, and can say to the \nDepartment: We want you to come back in 6 months or 8 months or 3 \nmonths, and we will take another look at it.\n  No. 4, procedures known as ``minimization'' are clearly defined and \napplied. This has been a hallmark of FISA for 30 years, but was not \nincluded in the Protect America Act. Once again, minimization is the \nprocess that the intelligence community has used since 1978 to protect \ninformation concerning Americans. When the NSA collects the content of \ncommunications, it does so to write intelligence reports. Minimization \nstates that information without a foreign intelligence purpose is not \nused, and it cannot be retained indefinitely. It must be discarded at \nsome point.\n  Intelligence reports that use information about an American are made \nanonymous, to protect that person's privacy rights. The bill requires \nthat the minimization procedures used in each program be approved by \nthe court upfront, so they go to the court first and they say this is \nwhat we want to do and these are the procedures we will use, and the \ncourt can affirm it or deny it. But it goes before a court.\n  If the amendments are adopted, the court will have the power to \nreview how the minimization is being applied as well, so they will have \nconstant review of the process.\n  No. 5, oversight mechanisms are stronger in this legislation. Reviews \nare required by inspectors general, agency heads, the FISA Court, and \nthe Congress on how the surveillance authority is being used.\n  I wish to speak for a moment on the subject of telecom liability and \nthen on exclusivity. If I might, I wish to do the exclusivity first.\n  On behalf of myself, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Leahy, and Senator \nNelson, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment may be filed but not offered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, this bill does not include language \nI authored to strengthen the exclusivity provisions of FISA. It has \nbeen reviewed by the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, and they are both cosponsors, as \nwell as an additional cosponsor in Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who \nis also a member of the Intelligence Committee. Basically, what this \namendment does is strengthen FISA as the only and exclusive authority \nfor gathering intelligence through electronic surveillance. It \nspecifically closes the AUMF loophole I mentioned earlier, whereby the \nadministration contends it does not need FISA approval.\n  Second, it provides that only another statute, specific statute can \nconstitute an additional exclusive means of electronic surveillance.\n  Third, it strengthens the requirements for certifications. The \nadministration must identify the specific provision of the law on which \nthe certification is based.\n  The exclusivity amendment I have submitted is intended to reinforce \nthe legislative intent of the bill. In 1978, when the bill was passed, \nthe court was to be absolute when conducting electronic surveillance \nagainst Americans\n\n[[Page S15733]]\n\nfor foreign intelligence purposes. Unfortunately, despite the 1978 \nlanguage, the Bush administration decided it could go outside the law. \nThat was both wrong and unnecessary.\n  To make matters worse, the administration made up an argument that \nCongress had authorized it to go around FISA by some passing the \nauthorization for use of military force against al-Qaida and the \nTaliban. Does anyone here actually believe that? I do not know one \nMember of Congress who has stated publicly that they believed they were \nauthorizing the terrorist surveillance program when they voted to go to \nwar against bin Laden. In fact, to the contrary, it was never \nconsidered and to the best of my knowledge it was never thought of. \nWhen the Department of Justice came to the Congress in September 2001, \noutlining the changes it needed in FISA to wage this war, it did not \nmention anything about surveillance efforts such as those the TSP \nprogram addressed.\n\n  Congressional intent from 1978 is clear. Congress clearly intended \nfor FISA to be the exclusive authority under which the executive branch \nmay conduct electronic surveillance. Let me briefly review the history, \nbecause it is important.\n  Congress wrote, in 1978, in report language accompanying FISA:\n\n       Despite any inherent power by the President to authorize \n     warrantless electronic surveillance in the absence of \n     legislation, by this bill and chapter 119 of title 18, \n     Congress will have legislated with regard to electronic \n     surveillance in the United States, that legislation, with its \n     procedures and safeguards prohibit the President, \n     notwithstanding any inherent powers, notwithstanding any \n     inherent powers--\n\n  Which means AUMF, article II of the Constitution\n\n     --from violating the terms of that legislation.\n\n  That is a quote. The legislative history continues by describing the \nSupreme Court's decision in the Keith case, in which the Court ruled at \nthat time Congress hadn't ruled in this field, and simply left the \nPresidential powers where it found them.\n  But at this point the legislative history turns. The 1978 language \nresponded to the Keith case and said this:\n\n       The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, however, does \n     not simply leave Presidential powers where it finds them. To \n     the contrary, this bill would substitute a clear legislative \n     authorization pursuant to statutory, not constitutional, \n     standards.\n\n  I want the record to show here the clear understanding in 1978 that \nFISA was the exclusive authority. That was the report language \naccompanying H.R. 7138 as it passed the 95th Congress.\n  President Carter signed the bill. His signing statement said this:\n\n       This bill requires, for the first time, a prior judicial \n     warrant from all electronic surveillance for foreign \n     intelligence or counterintelligence purposes in the United \n     States in which communications of U.S. persons might be \n     intercepted.\n\n  That is pretty clear, on the part of the President who signed the \nbill, and the House and the Senate that passed that bill, what the \nintention was.\n  The Intelligence Committee bill before us reiterates the 1978 \nexclusivity language, but I believe this needs to be strengthened in \nlight of the article II and the AUMF arguments that this administration \nhas been making. I am going to introduce this amendment at this time.\n  This language closes loopholes that this Department of Justice \nsqueezed through, to claim that the AUMF was an authorized exception to \nthe FISA. It clearly was not. The amendment does this by tightening \nlanguage in FISA, and in title 18 of the criminal code, making clear \nthat future Presidents should not try to read between the lines in \nfuture legislation for authorization to go outside of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act.\n  It also provides more specificity in what must be included in written \nrequests or directives to telecommunications authorities for them to \nlegally provide assistance. It is clear from the recent history that \nthis is necessary. In fact, the whole issue of whether telecom immunity \nis needed is because past certifications have not been clear.\n  I couldn't support a bill that did not clearly reestablish the \nprimacy of FISA. I tried to do it in committee. I thought it was done \nin committee. It was not included in the base bill. The Republican side \nwould not go along with it. I once again submit it. To me it is vital, \nand my vote on the bill was, at least 50 percent, based on this \nexclusivity provision.\n  Now, if I may, may I mention telecom immunity and submit an \namendment? I voted for telecom immunity in the committee. I am not \ninclined to vote for it, to be candid with you, unless this amendment \nis adopted. So let me begin by talking about the immunity provision of \nthe bill. It is not as expansive as some would make it sound. The \nlanguage would only cover cases where the Attorney General certifies \nthat the defendant companies received written requests or directives \nfrom top levels of the Government for their assistance.\n  In other words, the Government, in writing, I stress in writing, \nassured those companies that the program was legal, the President had \nauthorized the program, and that its legality has been approved by the \nAttorney General.\n  The legislation does not provide immunity for criminal wrongdoing, \nnor does the legislation provide liability relief for any Government \nofficial such as that the Director of National Intelligence had \nrequested in April. No individual immunity of anyone in the government \nis included in this bill.\n  There are approximately 40 cases pending in the Ninth Circuit. The \ncompanies in these cases are prevented from making their own defense. I \ndo not know if Members understand the full importance of this. They are \nprevented from responding to inaccurate news articles, inaccurate press \nreleases, they cannot come before the Congress and testify in public, \nthey cannot respond to anything that is said in the public sector, and \nthey are prevented from defending themselves in court.\n  These defendants have to sit by and listen to what they consider to \nbe misrepresentations, and they cannot respond to these \nmisrepresentations. So, in effect, they are handcuffed and gagged by \nthe administration's claim of state secrets. This is a matter of \nfairness. These companies have no financial motives in providing \nassistance to the Government. In fact, they incurred a substantial risk \nin doing so. They were given written requests, legal assurances in the \nweeks after September 11. The letters went out within 5 weeks of \nSeptember 11, when we all feared this Nation might suffer additional \nattacks.\n  In fact, evidence has come to light to indicate the second wave of \nattacks involving the West Coast was being planned. It was this \nadministration, not the companies, that made a flawed legal \ndetermination. It was this administration that withheld its activities \nfrom the Congress for 4 long years. It was this administration that \ndecided not to go to the FISA Court. They could have gone to the FISA \nCourt. They could have asked for a program warrant, which they \nsubsequently got.\n  They could have put this program under FISA coverage, which it now \nis, which they did not at the time.\n  It has been pointed out that there is a longstanding common law \nprovision that allows citizens to rely on the assumption that the \nGovernment acted legally when it asks a private citizen or a company to \nassist it for the common good. All that is required is that the citizen \nact in good faith.\n  So the question is whether the small number of people, and it was a \nsmall number of people, who were actually cleared in a classified \nsense, to deal with this, of these companies, were acting in good faith \nand whether it was reasonable for them to determine that the \nassistance, in fact, it provided was legal.\n  A small number of telecom officials were acting under the cloak of \nsecrecy and a directive not to disclose the Government's request. They \nare not experts on article II of the Constitution. The amendment I am \ngoing to submit would put before the FISA Court the question of whether \nthe telecommunications companies should, in fact, receive immunity \nbased on the law.\n  The FISA Court would be required to act, en banc, and how this is, is \n15 judges, Federal judges, appointed by the Chief Justice, they sit 24/\n7, and this is all they do, they would act en banc. They would look at \nthe following: Did the letters sent to the carriers which were repeated \nvirtually every 35 to 45 days over the last 4 to 5 years, did the \nletters sent to the carriers meet the conditions of law.\n\n[[Page S15734]]\n\n  Section 2511 of title 18 clearly states that a certification from the \nGovernment is required in cases where there is no court order. That is \nthe only two ways that FISA allows this to proceed, by written \ncertification or by court order.\n  The Government has to certify in writing that all statutory \nrequirements for the company's assistance have been met. So the FISA \nCourt would first look at whether the letter sent to the companies met \nthe terms of this law. The court would then look at, if the companies \nprovided assistance, was it done in good faith and pursuant to a belief \nthat the compliance was legal.\n  Finally, the FISA Court would ask: Did the defendants actually \nprovide assistance? If the FISA Court finds that defendant did not \nprovide any assistance to the Government or that the assistance either \nmet the legal requirements of the law or was reasonably and in good \nfaith, the immunity provision would apply.\n  If the FISA Court finds that none of these requirements were met, \nimmunity would not apply to the defendant companies. I think the merit \nof this approach is it preserves judicial review, the method we look at \nin order to decide questions of legality.\n  Now, the bulk of the Members of this body, probably 90 percent of \nthem, have not been able to see the written certification, so you do \nnot know what was there. What we ask in this amendment is: FISA Court, \nyou take a look at these letters, and you make a ruling as to whether \nthey essentially meet the certification requirements of the FISA law.\n  Therefore, there is judicial review to determine whether, under \nexisting law, this immunity should be forthcoming. It is a narrowing of \nthe immunity provisions of the Intelligence bill. I think it makes \nsense. I read the letters. I am a layperson, I am not a lawyer. I \ncannot say whether they met the immunity provisions. Others can say \nthat.\n  But it should be up to a court to make that decision. It seems to me \nthat if the FISA Court finds that none of these requirements were met, \nimmunity would not apply to the defendant companies.\n  The FISA Court of Review stated in 2002 that the President has \narticle II authorities to conduct surveillance. The article II \nauthority is the big rub in all this. The collection under this program \nwas directed overwhelmingly at foreign targets.\n  But no court has addressed this issue since FISA was enacted in 1978. \nAnd, candidly, I think the time has come to see whether the President's \narticle II authority--and the FISA Court would be the first judge of \nthis--in fact, supersedes the article II authority based on the reading \nthat I had given you of FISA Court passage in 1978.\n  So essentially that is the amendment I would like to send to the desk \nat this time which narrows the immunity provision of the FISA law. I \nthank the clerk for receiving the amendment.\n  In sum, I have tried to pay a great deal of attention to this. I \ntried to do my due diligence, both as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Intelligence Committee. I truly do believe electronic \nsurveillance is vital in the war against terror.\n  I believe it is the most likely way we learn what is being planned \nfor the future and have an opportunity to prevent it from happening. I \ntruly believe there are people who would do this Nation grievous injury \nand harm if they are given the opportunity to do it, and I think the \ntelecom communities did depend on the good faith of the head of the \nNational Security Agency and the Attorney General and the requests from \nthe highest levels of Government.\n  The question is, Did they comply with the law? And so the amendment I \nhave suggested would give the FISA Court the opportunity to make a \nruling as to whether, in fact, they did comply with the law.\n  The second amendment would strengthen the exclusivity provisions of \nthe FISA law so we never again, hopefully, will find ourselves in the \nsame situation.\n  I look for a vote on both those amendments, and I thank the Chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee and Senator \nNelson for supporting my amendment on exclusivity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Nelson of Florida be added as a \ncosponsor of the FISA Court evaluation on the immunity question \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for yielding to \nme.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am troubled by the FISA bill that has \ncome to the Senate floor. Since I introduced the original FISA \nlegislation over 30 years ago, I have worked to amend the FISA law many \ntimes, and I believe that this bill is not faithful to the traditional \nbalance that FISA has struck. This bill gives the executive branch vast \nnew authorities to spy on Americans, without adequate guidance or \noversight. Americans deserve better.\n  I voted ``yes'' on the motion to proceed to consideration of this \nbill because I believe this legislation is too important to hold up any \nlonger. The House has already passed a new FISA bill, and the Senate \nneeds to do the same. But let me be clear, the Senate should reject the \nbill that we have before us. We need to pass the Judiciary Committee \nversion instead.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is one of our landmark \nstatutes. For nearly three decades, it has regulated Government \nsurveillance in a way that protects both our national security and our \ncivil liberties and prevents the Government from abusing its powers. It \nis because FISA enhances both security and liberty that it has won such \nbroad support over the years from Presidents, Members of Congress, and \nthe public alike. It is important to remember that before this \nadministration, no administration had ever resisted FISA, much less \nsystematically violated it.\n  When the administration finally came to Congress to amend FISA after \nits warrantless wiretapping program was exposed, it did so not in the \nspirit of partnership, but to bully us into obeying its wishes. The \nProtect America Act was negotiated in secret at the last minute. The \nadministration issued dire threats that failure to enact a bill before \nthe August recess could lead to disaster. Few, if any, knew what the \nlanguage would actually do. The result of this flawed process was \nflawed legislation, which virtually everyone now acknowledges must be \nsubstantially revised.\n  I commend the members of the Intelligence Committee for their \ndiligent efforts to put together a new bill. They have taken their \nduties seriously, and they have made some notable improvements over the \nProtect America Act.\n  But their bill is deeply flawed, and I am strongly opposed to \nenacting it in its current form. This bill fails to protect Americans' \nconstitutional rights and fundamental freedoms.\n  There are many problems with the bill.\n  It redefines ``electronic surveillance,'' a key term in FISA, in a \nway that is unnecessary and may have unintended consequences.\n  Court review occurs only after the fact, with no consequences if the \ncourt rejects the Government's targeting or minimization procedures.\n  It is not as clear as it should be that FISA and the criminal wiretap \nlaw are the sole legal means by which the Government may conduct \nelectronic surveillance.\n  Its sunset provision is December 31, 2013. For legislation as \ncomplicated, important, and controversial as this, Congress should \nreevaluate it much sooner.\n  The bill purports to eliminate the ``reverse targeting'' of \nAmericans, but does not actually contain language to do so. For \ninstance, it has nothing analogous to the House bill's provision on \nreverse targeting, which prohibits use of the authorities if ``a \nsignificant purpose'' is targeting someone in the United States.\n  It does not fully close the loophole left open by the Protect America \nAct, allowing warrantless interception of purely domestic \ncommunications.\n  It does not require an independent review and report on the \nadministration's warrantless eavesdropping program. Only through such a \nprocess will we ever learn what happened and achieve accountability and \nclosure on this episode.\n  Add it all up, and the takeaway is clear: This bill is inconsistent \nwith the\n\n[[Page S15735]]\n\nway FISA was meant to work, and it is inconsistent with the way FISA \nhas always worked.\n  The Judiciary Committee's FISA bill shows that there is a better way. \nThe Judiciary Committee's version is faithful to the traditional FISA \nbalance. It shares the same basic structure, but it addresses all of \nthe problems I listed above. The Judiciary bill was negotiated in \npublic, which allowed outside groups and experts to give critical \nfeedback. It was also negotiated later in time than the Intelligence \nbill, meaning we had the benefit of reviewing their work.\n  Like the Intelligence Committee's bill, the Judiciary Committee's \nversion also gives the executive branch greater authority to conduct \nelectronic surveillance than it has ever had before. Make no mistake, \nit too is a major grant of power to the intelligence community. But \nunlike the Intelligence Committee's bill, the Judiciary Committee's \nversion sets some reasonable limits that protect innocent Americans \nfrom being spied on by their Government without any justification \nwhatever.\n  No one should lose sight of how important title I of FISA is. The \nrules governing electronic surveillance affect every American. They are \nthe only thing that stands between the freedom of Americans to make a \nphone call, send an e-mail, and search the Internet, and the ability of \nthe Government to listen in on that call, read that e-mail, review that \nGoogle search. In our ``information age,'' title I of FISA provides \nAmericans a fundamental bulwark against Government tyranny and abuse. \nIf we enact the title I that is now before us, we will undermine that \nbulwark.\n  Unfortunately, the exact same thing would be true if we enact the \nIntelligence Committee's title II.\n  The Nation was shocked to learn earlier this month that the CIA had \ndestroyed videotapes showing employees using severe interrogation \ntechniques. The willful destruction of these tapes by the CIA obviously \nraises serious questions involving obstruction of justice.\n  But this is not the only coverup that the administration has been \ninvolved in lately. President Bush has been demanding that Congress \ngrant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that \ncooperated with the administration's illegal surveillance program. He \nwants us to pretend that this whole episode never happened.\n  I oppose granting any form of retroactive immunity to these \ncompanies, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to strike \ntitle II from the FISA bill. Amnesty for telecommunication companies \nmay help the administration conceal its illegal spying, but it will not \nserve our national security, and it will further undermine the rule of \nlaw.\n  Let's not forget why we are even talking about this issue. At some \npoint in 2001, the Bush administration began a massive program of \nwarrantless spying. New reports suggest that the administration began \nits warrantless spying even before 9/11. The administration never told \nCongress what it was doing. In clear violation of the FISA law and in \ncomplete disdain for the fourth amendment, it also never told the FISA \nCourt what it was doing.\n  Because the Bush administration secretly ignored the law, we still do \nnot know how deeply this program invaded the privacy of millions of \ninnocent Americans. The push for immunity by this administration is a \npush to avoid all accountability for a wiretapping program that was a \nmassive violation of the law.\n  FISA has been in force for 29 years. It was designed from the \nbeginning to allow flexibility in pursuing our enemies. It was enacted \nwith strong bipartisan support in 1978, and it has been amended on a \nbipartisan basis some 30 times since then. It has enhanced Americans' \nsecurity and safeguarded our liberty. Every previous administration has \ncomplied with FISA. But the Bush administration apparently decided that \nFISA was an inconvenience. With the help of certain phone companies, it \nsecretly spied on Americans for years, without any court orders or \noversight.\n  There is still a great deal we don't know about this secret spying, \nbut what we do know is alarming. Numerous reports indicate that it \ncovered not only international communications, but also Americans' \npurely local calls with their friends, neighbors, and loved ones. A \nlawsuit in California has produced evidence that at the Government's \nrequest, AT installed a supercomputer in a San Francisco facility \nthat copied every communication by its customers, and turned them over \nto the National Security Agency.\n  Think about that. The National Security Agency of the Bush \nadministration may have been intercepting the phone calls and e-mails \nof millions of ordinary Americans for years.\n  The surveillance was so flagrantly illegal that even lawyers in the \nadministration tried to fight it. Nearly 30 Justice Department \nemployees threatened to resign over it. The head of the Office of Legal \nCounsel, Jack Goldsmith, testified that it was ``the biggest legal mess \nI had ever encountered.''\n  Mr. Goldsmith himself acknowledged that ``top officials in the \nadministration dealt with FISA the way they dealt with other laws they \ndidn't like: they blew through them in secret based on flimsy legal \nopinions that they guarded closely so no one could question the legal \nbasis of the operations.''\n  Think about that as well. The President's own head of the Office of . \nLegal Counsel states that the administration's policy has been to \n``blow through'' laws it doesn't like, in secret, so that its actions \ncannot be challenged. The Bush White House has repeatedly failed to \nunderstand that our Government is a government of laws, and not of men.\n  The administration's secret spying program has taken a heavy toll on \nour country. Its failure to follow the law has made it more difficult \nfor prosecutors to put terrorists behind bars; for intelligence \nprofessionals to avoid civil and criminal lawsuits; and for the public \nto trust its Government. In the name of making us safer, the \nadministration's reckless disregard for the law has made us less safe, \nand countless Americans fear their rights have been endangered. That \nsorry record demands accountability, not immunity.\n  Here is another fact that no one should lose sight of. From the very \nbeginning, telecommunications companies have always had immunity under \nFISA when they comply with lawful surveillance requests. In fact, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee worked closely with AT, and the company \nplayed a major role in drafting FISA's immunity provisions in the \n1970s.\n  To be completely protected from any liability whatever, all a company \nneeds under FISA is a court order or an appropriate certification from \nthe Attorney General. That is it. Just get one of those two documents, \nand you are off the hook.\n  So in this debate, let us be clear that we are not talking about \nprotecting companies that complied with lawful surveillance requests. \nWe are talking about protecting companies that complied with \nsurveillance requests that they knew were illegal.\n  Immunity for the phone companies would be bad policy on many levels. \nFirst, it is premature even to be talking about this subject. Even \nthough the President is demanding immunity for companies that may have \nbroken the law, he will not tell all Members of Congress which \ncompanies broke the law, how they broke the law, or why they broke the \nlaw. He is asking us to legislate in the dark.\n  Immunity for the telecoms for warrantless wiretapping violates the \nbasic structure and purpose of FISA. The industry helped draft FISA, \nand they perform a major role under it. Here is how this system was \nexplained in the House Intelligence Committee report on the original \nlegislation:\n\n       Requiring the court order or certification to be presented \n     [to the carrier] before the assistance is rendered serves two \n     purposes. It places an additional obstacle in the path of \n     unauthorized surveillance activity, and, coupled with the \n     provision relieving the third party from liability if the \n     order or certification is complied with, it provides full \n     protection to such third parties.\n\n  If phone companies can ignore these requirements, this system of \nchecks and balances collapses. That is exactly what happened here. The \ntelecoms are supposed to provide an essential safeguard for protecting \nAmericans' private information. Because Congress and the courts usually \ndon't know about wiretapping activities, this role of the telecoms is \ncrucial. Immunity for the telecoms undermines the basic design of our \nsurveillance laws.\n\n[[Page S15736]]\n\n  Instead of undermining those laws, we should apply them in a court of \nlaw to discover and punish illegal activities. The administration has \nused the scare tactic of claiming that lawsuits will jeopardize \nnational security by leaking sensitive information. That argument \nignores the fact that the media have already exposed the existence of \nits warrantless surveillance program and the role of some telecoms in \nassisting this program. In addition, it would be foolish to assume that \nthe terrorists don't already know that we are trying to intercept their \nphone calls and e-mails.\n  The administration's argument also ignores the numerous safeguards \nused by courts to protect sensitive information. No one is advocating \nthat the NSA disclose its specific methods or targets in open court. \nEven if someone did seek such disclosure, the Federal courts have \nprocedures that have protected Government secrets for generations.\n  The administration has also suggested that allowing these lawsuits to \nproceed might jeopardize national security by deterring phone companies \nfrom future cooperation with surveillance requests. This too is sheer \nnonsense. Under FISA, companies already have absolute immunity for any \nlawful cooperation. Future companies will be deterred only from \ncooperating with illegal surveillance requests, which is the whole \npoint of the law. We do not want this shameful episode to happen again.\n\n  The phone companies will suffer only the same harm that befalls any \ncompany that violates the law. The administration contends that the \ntelecoms may be bankrupted if the lawsuits continue. In other words, \nthe administration is telling us these companies may have engaged in \nlawbreaking on a scale so massive they could not afford the penalty if \nthey are brought to justice. But massive law breaking is an argument \nagainst immunity, not for it. If the concern is the companies' \nfinancial health, the answer is not to throw out the rule of law but to \nlegislate reasonable remedies, such as damage caps.\n  Immunity for the telecoms would also violate basic principles of \nfairness and justice. The administration repeatedly claims immunity is \n``a matter of basic fairness'' because the companies were doing their \npatriotic duty. That is a strange conception of fairness.\n  Telecom companies have clear duties under the law. They also have \nhighly sophisticated lawyers who deal with these issues all the time. \nIf a company violated its clear duties and conducted illegal spying, \nfairness demands it face the consequences.\n  It is precisely because fairness and justice are so important to the \nAmerican system of government that we ask an independent branch--the \njudiciary--to resolve such legal disputes. There is nothing fair or \njust about Congress stepping into ongoing lawsuits to decree victory \nfor one side and deny injured parties their day in court.\n  Frankly--frankly--the whole ``patriotic duty'' argument we have been \nhearing from the White House is hard to take seriously. If the \nallegations against the telecoms are true, then we are not talking \nabout ambiguous points of law. As a Federal judge remarked in one of \nthe leading cases:\n\n       AT cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in \n     its position could have believed that the alleged domestic \n     dragnet was legal.\n\n  We are not talking about what happened in the frantic weeks and \nmonths immediately following 9/11. We are talking about alleged \nviolations of Americans' rights that went on for 5 years--5 years--in \ntotal secrecy, on a scale that has never been approached in our \nhistory.\n  If the telecoms had followed the law instead of the Bush \nadministration, the administration could have come to Congress and \nobtained any needed changes in the law. In a democracy, it is the job \nof the legislature to amend laws to fit new circumstances. It is not \nthe job of the legislature to rubberstamp illegal conduct by the \nExecutive.\n  Some of the telecoms might have been doing what they thought was good \nfor the country. Some of them might simply have been doing what they \nthought would preserve their lucrative Government contracts. We simply \ndo not know. But either way, it is not the role of the \ntelecommunications companies to decide which laws to follow and which \nto ignore. FISA is a law that was carefully developed over many years \nto give the executive branch the flexibility it needs, while protecting \nthe rights of Americans. It is the companies' legal duty--and their \npatriotic duty--to follow that law.\n  Nothing could be more dangerous for Americans' privacy and liberty \nthan to weaken that law, which is precisely what retroactive immunity \nis meant to do. Yesterday's newspapers disclosed that in December of \n2000, the National Security Agency sent the Bush administration a \nreport asserting that the Agency must become a ``powerful, permanent \npresence'' on America's communications network--a ``powerful, permanent \npresence'' on America's communications network. Under this \nadministration, that is exactly what the NSA has become. If the phone \ncompanies simply do the NSA's bidding in violation of the law, they \ncreate a world in which Americans can never feel confident that their \ne-mails and phone calls are not being tapped by the Government.\n  Finally, amnesty would stamp a congressional seal of approval on the \nadministration's warrantless spying. If Congress immunizes the telecoms \nfor past violations of the law, it will send the message Congress \napproves what the administration did. We would be aiding and abetting \nthe President in his illegal actions, his contempt for the rule of law, \nand his attempt to hide his lawbreaking from the American people. \nVoting for amnesty would be a vote for silence, secrecy, and \nillegality. There would be no accountability, no justice, no lessons \nlearned.\n  The damage will not stop there. The telecommunications companies are \nnot the only private entity enlisted by this administration in its \nlawbreaking. Think about Blackwater and its brutal actions in Iraq, or \nthe airlines that have flown CIA captives to be tortured in foreign \ncountries. These companies may also be summoned to court one day to \njustify their actions. When that day comes, the administration may call \nyet again for retroactive immunity, claiming the companies were only \ndoing their patriotic duty as ``partners'' in fighting terrorism.\n  The debate we are having now about telecom amnesty is not likely to \nbe the last round in the administration's attempt to immunize its \nprivate partners. It is only the opening round. In America, we should \nbe striving to make more entities subject to the rule of law, not \nfewer. Giving in to the administration now will start us down a path to \na very dark place.\n  Think about what we have been hearing from the White House in this \ndebate. The President has said American lives will be sacrificed if \nCongress does not change FISA. But he has also said he will veto any \nFISA bill that does not grant retroactive immunity--no immunity, no \nFISA bill. So if we take the President at his word, he is willing to \nlet Americans die to protect the phone companies. The President's \ninsistence on immunity as a precondition for any FISA reform is yet \nanother example of disrespect for honest dialog and the rule of law.\n  It is painfully clear what the President's request for retroactive \nimmunity is about. It is a self-serving attempt to avoid legal and \npolitical accountability and keep the American people in the dark about \nthis whole shameful episode. Similar to the CIA's destruction of \nvideotapes showing potentially criminal conduct, it is a desperate \nattempt to erase the past.\n  The Senate should see this request for what it is and reject it. We \nshould pass this amendment to strike title II from the FISA bill. Our \nfocus should be on protecting national security, our fundamental \nliberties, and the rule of law, not protecting phone companies that \nknew they were breaking the law.\n  I am second to no one in wanting to make sure our intelligence \nagencies have all the flexibility and authority they need to pursue the \nterrorists. We need to pass a FISA bill that will keep America strong \nand protect our liberty. The bill reported by the Judiciary Committee \nwill do that.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his statement this afternoon. He has captured the \nessence of all this and the importance of the issue in\n\n[[Page S15737]]\n\nTitle II. He made very many good points. But one point he made said it \nall: that the President of the United States would veto the FISA \nlegislation if he does not get immunity for the phone companies. This \nadministration would risk the entire law--a law designed to improve our \nsurveillance of terrorists, while respecting privacy--simply to protect \na handful of companies. Those are the lengths to which President Bush \nis prepared to go.\n  I think the Senator from Massachusetts made this point, but it is \nworth repeating: Not every company did what the administration asked \nthem to do. There were those that stood up and said: ``No. Give me a \ncourt order, and I will comply under the law.'' They should be \ncommended for what they did.\n  For those that said, ``We were just doing our patriotic duty,'' their \nlegal departments were not made up of first-year law students. They \nknew what the law was. Yet they may have violated it and are now \nseeking immunity.\n  So I commend my colleague. I am going to offer--when I get a chance--\nan amendment that strikes title II from the legislation. I hope every \nSenator here supports it. This ought not be about party or ideology. It \nis about our Constitution.\n  The FISA law is a good law. It has protected us for almost 30 years. \nBut it should not sanction retroactive immunity for a handful of phone \ncompanies that eavesdropped on millions of people's conversations.\n  So I commend my colleague for his words.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments. I \nagree it never had to be this way. I can remember back in 1976 \nPresident Ford was President of the United States. He had Edward Levi \nas Attorney General, who was a distinguished Attorney General. This was \nin the wake of a good deal of abuse we had seen during President \nNixon's period of wiretap abuse taking place in this country, which \nshocked the Nation.\n  At that time, the Attorney General insisted that we work together, \nthat Congress work together. He called members of the Judiciary \nCommittee down to the Justice Department and took their views into \nconsideration. There was a variety of very sensitive issues about \nactivities involving the Soviet Union and a good deal in terms of \nembassies in Washington, DC. There was very sensitive information. All \nof that was worked out with the Republicans and Democrats in the \nJudiciary Committee, and they passed the FISA bill. There was only one \ndissenting vote in the Senate--only one dissenting vote--on this \nproposal.\n  I must say many of us were enormously disappointed at the beginning \nof this whole pathway when Attorney General Gonzales came up before the \ncommittee and indicated: No, there was not any role to try to work in a \nconstructive way and on a constructive path on this mission. No, there \nwas no place for anyone to get adequately briefed. No, there was no \nsharing of information. No, there was going to be no--they understood \nwhat was going to happen. They understood what was going on. They had \nall the authority and the power under the executive branch. No, there \nwas not going to be any activity whatsoever in trying to work together.\n  I have mentioned a variety of different points. But one of those we \nought to keep in mind is that with the abuses that have taken place, we \nare endangering the prosecution of many of these terrorists. This is a \nreal danger. Rather than trying to work that out through a process, \nwith give-and-take, with Republicans and Democrats, in a bipartisan \nway, working with the Judiciary Committee--the Intelligence Committee \nobviously has enormous interest and experience; I see my friend and \nsomeone we all have such a high regard for, Senator Rockefeller, who \nhas done such a commendable job in this whole area--but not working it \nout and running off on this pathway, which is gradually being revealed \nthrough the national media and the press and through other activities, \nI think, rather than enhancing our national security, has indeed \nthreatened it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may further inquire of my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, I was intrigued to learn how many the Washington \nPost recorded. I heard no one argue with these numbers. One of the \narguments we have heard is that the FISA Court may not have been \nwilling to agree with these court orders to the phone companies--not \nthat that argument was even remotely legitimate.\n  The Washington Post reports that over the years, there have been over \n18,000 requests for FISA court orders. Of those more than 18,000 \nrequests, 5 have been rejected--5. So with over 18,000 requests, for \n99.9 percent of those requests, that court has acquiesced to \nadministration appeals 99.9 percent of the time.\n  So the idea this court was somehow going to serve as an obstruction \nto the administration's desire to get legitimate information is \ncertainly belied by the statistics. I point that out to my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  In the committee, we had some of the members of the FISA Courts \ntestify. They indicated before the committee similar kinds of \ncooperation they have had in reviewing this, making the Senator's point \neven stronger. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. There may have \nbeen others, but I did notice him to be the first one in the Senate who \nspoke up on this issue when it first came up, and he has been a very \nstrong protector of our national security and our liberty, and we have \nall benefited from his comments and his leadership in this area. I \nthank him for all of his good work.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I was in the midst of giving some remarks earlier, and my \ncolleague from California, Senator Feinstein, came on the Senate floor. \nI know she wanted to share her thoughts, so I yielded the floor to her \nto allow her to speak. I see my friend and colleague from Missouri is \nhere. I know we have gone back and forth. I understand how this works. \nI don't know if he has some remarks he wants to give.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am a little bit confused. We certainly \ndon't want to cut short the remarks of our friend from Connecticut, but \nI thought this was supposed to go back and forth. I believe there is an \nhour limit under postcloture on time that can be consumed by any \nSenator. I thought we would go back and forth to enable people on both \nsides and let the chairman and me perhaps respond where necessary.\n  Mr. DODD. Fine.\n  Mr. BOND. I wanted to know, through the Chair, what the procedure is \nright now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order of recognition at this time.\n  Mr. BOND. All right. Again, I seek recognition, and I thank my \ncolleagues for sharing their views.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wanted to share a few views on matters \nthat have been just raised. I thought it was important to bring these \nup. I will have longer remarks when we actually get on the bill.\n  I appreciated hearing from our colleague, who is an original \ncosponsor of the first FISA bill, and to learn about the negotiations \nwhich went on then. But I was a little puzzled to hear how this bill--\nthis bill, which includes significantly more protections for Americans' \ncivil liberties and constitutional rights--somehow goes back on the \noriginal FISA. The original FISA required a court review of targeting \nof U.S. persons. We have gone far beyond that in this bill. As a matter \nof fact, the Protect America Act, which he decried, contained all of \nthe protections that were in the original FISA bill.\n  Now, we have, on a bipartisan basis--I keep emphasizing that the \nIntelligence Committee, on a bipartisan basis, after being fully \nbriefed--fully briefed--by several elements of the intelligence \ncommunity--and we asked them questions. We had briefings. We went to \nthe NSA to see how it worked. We went through all of these ideas with \nthem. They said: We understand your objective. Here is how to \naccomplish it.\n  I think we have prepared a very good bill that by any fair reading--\nany fair reading--will extend the protections beyond what the original \nFISA, and even the Protect America Act, had for the surveillance, \nelectronic surveillance of anybody either in the United\n\n[[Page S15738]]\n\nStates or a U.S. person abroad. I am very much surprised that he says \nsomehow, this bill, which provides more protection, doesn't provide the \nbasic protections of FISA. I regret to say that is just not right.\n  I also want to address some questions about immunity which have been \nbrought up. I thought our committee report, a bipartisan product, said \nit pretty well when talking about why providing immunity--and it is not \namnesty because these companies, the companies alleged to have done \nwrong, did nothing wrong. This is what the Intelligence Committee said. \nWe concluded:\n\n       The providers had a good faith basis for responding to the \n     request for assistance they received. The intelligence \n     community cannot obtain the intelligence it needs without \n     assistance from these companies. Companies in the future may \n     be less willing to assist the government if they face the \n     threat of private lawsuits each time they are alleged to have \n     provided assistance. The possible reduction in intelligence \n     that might result from this delay is simply unacceptable for \n     the safety of our Nation. Allowing continued litigation also \n     risks the disclosure of highly classified information \n     regarding intelligence sources and methods. In addition to \n     providing an advantage to our adversaries by revealing \n     sources and methods during the course of litigation, the \n     potential disclosure of classified information puts both the \n     facilities and personnel of electronic communications service \n     providers and our country's continued ability to protect our \n     homeland at risk. It is imperative that Congress provide \n     liability protection to those who cooperated with our country \n     in the hour of need.\n\n  Now, there was some talk about article II, and some suggested that \nthe FISA Court would not have--this could not have been approved by the \nFISA Court. Well, my understanding is the FISA Court knew about it. The \nFISA Court has acted on this measure, and in one of the few published \nreports of the FISA Court of Review, In Re: Sealed Case--that is a very \ncompelling and provocative title, but that is the name of the case--it \nis stated in one of the footnotes dealing with the case that: The \nTruong case, where a warrantless search of U.S. persons in the United \nStates was approved by the court, the FISA Court of Review said:\n\n       The Truong court, as did all the other courts to have \n     decided this issue, held that the President did have the \n     inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain \n     foreign intelligence information. It was incumbent upon the \n     court, therefore, to determine the boundaries of that \n     constitutional authority in the case before it. We take for \n     granted that the President does have that authority and, \n     assuming that is so, FISA could not encroach on the \n     President's constitutional power.\n\n  The court went on to say:\n\n       The question before us is the reverse, does FISA amplify \n     the President's power by providing a mechanism that at least \n     approaches a classic warrant and which therefore supports the \n     government's contention that FISA searches are \n     constitutionally reasonable.\n\n  That is the view of the FISA Court of Review. Everybody is saying, \nwell, we need to find out what the FISA Court of Review has to say \nabout these certifications, about the authorizations. What I just read \nis what the FISA Court has said. The President does have the power \nunder article II of the Constitution to conduct warrantless \nsurveillances. Once that determination is made, then to go back and say \nthat any company, any U.S. person, or any corporation that got a notice \nfrom the Attorney General to carry out an order of the President \nthrough the Intelligence Committee to conduct foreign intelligence \nsurveillance is breaking the law is just absolutely beyond the bounds.\n  I am very sorry we have such a disjoint in the reading and \nunderstanding of the constitutional powers. And to say now that these \npeople should be dragged back into court where they will be subjected \nnot only to the potential of large legal bills, the potential loss in \nterms of any judgment--although I think that is minimal; I don't think \nanybody is going to be able to show any harm that would warrant the \ncourt to grant a monetary recovery--but what they will find, what they \nwill find is great damage to their reputation, as the people who are \nenemies of the United States go out actively and trash any company or \nany individual who cooperates with the United States.\n  There are evil people out there who would love to be able to get \ninformation and confirm what companies may have participated. Once that \nhappens, those companies would be at great risk abroad. Their \nreputations would suffer, and they and their personnel could be at \ngreat risk of physical harm.\n  So there are many good reasons not to bring these cases in court \nagainst the providers. Please note, as we have stated before, that this \nmeasure only protects the private sector people who might have \ncooperated. It does not protect Government employees. I hope by \nclarifying this, people will get a better understanding of why immunity \nis necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the United States \nin collecting foreign information.\n  Many of my colleagues want to speak, so I appreciate the opportunity \nto clarify the question of immunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished chairman \nand vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for \nwhat I think is an outstanding product--a bipartisan product. I can't \nthink of an area that is more important for us to act in the interests \nof our national security in a bipartisan manner than the subject before \nus today. We should resist with all of our might any impulse or tug \nthat we might feel to emphasize partisan differences, but instead we \nought to pull together to try to do what is necessary to keep our eyes \nopen and our ears to the ground when it comes to the collection of \nforeign intelligence.\n  Of course, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was passed in \n1978 to ensure that Americans' civil liberties were being protected. At \nthe same time, we made sure we were able to listen to our enemies, \nwhich has become even more important today with terrorists taking \nadvantage of the Internet, cellular phones, and other means of \ncommunications, and it is critical that we continue to take advantage \nof every opportunity to detect and deter future terrorists attacks on \nour own soil.\n  We were told last August by the Director of National Intelligence--\nthis has been widely published since--that because of some of the \narchaic provisions in the FISA law, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, and because it had not kept up with changes in modern \ntechnology, that we were being blocked from receiving as many as two-\nthirds of the communications of one foreign terrorist to another \nforeign terrorist because of the way these calls were being routed. We \nwere told time and time again that the burdensome requirement of \ngetting the paperwork necessary in order to get a FISA authorization in \ncases where the Congress never intended to require that sort of \nauthorization, which was required because of these changes in \ntechnology, that it was actually causing delays in our ability to get \ntimely information in a way to protect our country and our men and \nwomen in uniform serving in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  We know the ability to obtain the right information at the right time \nis of critical importance in our struggle against radical Islamic \nterrorists who hide among civilian populations and who don't abide by \nthe Geneva Conventions. They don't wear a uniform. They don't recognize \na chain of command or the laws of war. They hide among civilian \npopulations and quietly plot deadly attacks against civilians--innocent \nmen, women, and children--as they did on September 11, 2001.\n  I serve on the Judiciary Committee, so I am very much aware of some \nof the arguments made during the time we considered this bill on a \nserial referral against providing immunity to the telephone companies \nthat have cooperated with the President of the United States, the \nAttorney General, and the intelligence community in facilitating the \ncollection of this actual intelligence.\n  Mr. President, I think the Intelligence Committee version got it \nabout right. Why in the world would we want to do anything to \ndiscourage private citizens, whether they be individuals or corporate \ncitizens, from cooperating in the security interests of our country? \nThis is perhaps analogous to a police officer who knocks on your window \nand says, I need your car to go capture a dangerous criminal before \nthey do harm to somebody else. Well, if an individual were worried that \nthey would be sued as a result of their being a good volunteer and a \ngood member of the\n\n[[Page S15739]]\n\ncommunity in allowing a law enforcement officer the use of their car to \ncapture a dangerous criminal, do you think they would be more inclined \nor less inclined to cooperate with the lawful authorities? I think it \nis pretty clear that they would be far less inclined.\n  If we don't do everything in our power--and it is within our power--\nto encourage individual and corporate citizens to cooperate in the \nsecurity interests of our country, then shame on us. To tell them that \nyou are going to have to endure ruinous litigation costs, that you are \nnot even going to be able to defend yourself because some of the \nevidence is the subject of a State secrets privilege, and you are not \neven going to be able to explain what you did, while at the same time \nsuffering the reputation damage that they could very well suffer if \ntheir participation was known in other parts of the world, is not fair. \nIt is not fair to them and, even more importantly, it is not fair to us \nbecause to fail to give them the immunity for their cooperation with \nthe lawful request of the President of the United States, after the \nAttorney General, the country's chief law enforcement officer, has said \nthis is a lawful request, to fail to give them immunity and protection \nagainst that ruinous litigation and damage to their reputation is less \nthan responsible.\n  I think the thing more likely to protect our security from this point \nforward is to show citizens who cooperate with the lawful authorities \nof the U.S. Government to help keep us safe that they are going to be \nprotected against litigation and the vast costs that could be \nassociated with it--not to mention the potential that classified \ninformation might become public and be known to our enemies. It makes \nabsolutely no sense not to give that immunity to these individuals and \nthese corporations.\n  The Protect America Act, which is scheduled to sunset in February, \nmoved our intelligence capabilities in the right direction. But now we \nneed to make those tools permanent. Changes in technology, combined \nwith a court ruling that hampered the intelligence community, required \nthat the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act be updated. That is what \nthe Protect America Act was, although it was a temporary patch of about \n6 months. Now we need to make those provisions permanent and take this \nopportunity to further expand and enhance the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act to make sure it works in the security interests of the \nAmerican people, while taking the appropriate protections on American \ncitizens here at home.\n  In the period between the court ruling that required the Government \nto obtain FISA orders for foreign intelligence that happened to pass \nthrough the infrastructure in the United States and the passage of the \nProtect America Act, collection of foreign intelligence information \ndecreased by two-thirds. That is what prompted Congress to act in \nAugust without further delay, the likelihood that being blind to two \nout of every three communications between terrorists would likely make \nus less safe and would make it more likely that they would be \nsuccessful in killing innocent Americans and our allies. Common sense \ninforms us that this great drop in the percentage of intelligence \ncollection harms our national security efforts.\n  Of course, as I mentioned, in August we took a temporary patch to \nclose these intelligence gaps and clarify that the intelligence \ncommunity does have the authority to monitor communications of foreign \nindividuals without receiving a court approval first.\n  Now is the time for us to make that authority permanent. It has never \nbeen required, in listening in to foreign subjects talking to other \nforeign subjects, to get a court order, and the Protect America Act \nmade that temporary fix. We need to make that permanent.\n  Some have made arguments which, in the end, would hamper our \nintelligence capabilities, requiring procedures never before in place. \nIntelligence community resources--both funding and expertise--are \nscarce and should be focused in the manner that best protects our \nnational security. Our intelligence analysts should not be distracted \nfrom the important job of listening in and using information to deter \nfurther attacks by having to fill out a bunch of paperwork, \nparticularly in areas that Congress never intended that they would have \nto do so.\n  The Senate and House Democratic Judiciary Committee proposals, I am \nsorry to say, would greatly hamper our intelligence community. As I \nmentioned a moment ago, I serve on the Judiciary Committee, and proudly \nso. Unfortunately, in voting this alternative out of the Judiciary \nCommittee--along strictly partisan lines--I think we failed to meet the \nstandards that were set by the Intelligence Committee version of this \nbill. Although there are changes that I think need to be made, by and \nlarge, the bipartisan vote in the Intelligence Committee--their product \nwas superior to the product out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The House bill would require court orders for foreign targets in \nforeign lands--something that has never been required in the 30 years \nsince FISA was enacted and would completely reverse the important \nreforms, albeit temporary, we made a few months ago.\n  Delays inherent in obtaining court approval could, in fact, put \nAmerican security interests in jeopardy.\n  Here is a concrete example. This last summer, three American soldiers \nwere thought to be kidnapped by al-Qaida in Iraq. Because of delays in \nobtaining emergency authorization under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, our intelligence community was unable to set into \nplace surveillance that may have saved the lives of these soldiers on \nMay 12, 2007. There was a 10-hour delay while the authorities did the \npaperwork necessary for them to listen in on communications they never \nshould have been required to get a FISA order to listen to in the first \nplace--clearly, foreign-to-foreign communications. Instead, PFC Joseph \nAnzack was found dead a few weeks later in the Euphrates River, and an \nal-Qaida subsidiary claims to have killed and buried SPC Alex Jiminez \nand PFC Byron Fouty. Those 10 hours of delay, I believe, contributed to \nthe deaths of these 3 American soldiers. If they hadn't been required \nto wait 10 hours to do the paperwork, I think there was a better chance \nthat they could have been found safely and returned to the arms of \ntheir loved ones.\n\n  One of the key lessons the 9/11 attacks taught us was that we have to \ndo a better job of connecting the dots. Erecting more walls and \nbarriers to the collection and sharing of intelligence material ignores \nthis important lesson and gives our adversaries an unacceptable \ntactical advantage, needlessly placing Americans in greater danger of \nanother attack instead of doing everything within our power to keep \nthem safe.\n  Unlike members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I am sorry to \nsay that House Democrats refused to work with committee Republicans, or \nwith the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of \nJustice. How the House committee--or for that matter, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee--could hope to fashion a sensible, workable product \nwithout consulting with either the Department of Justice or the \nDirector of National Intelligence is beyond me. I congratulate the \nmembers of the Senate Intelligence Committee on working so carefully, \nover a long period of time, in consultation with the appropriate \nauthorities, to come up with a bipartisan product--one that I concede \nis not perfect, but no legislation is perfect.\n  We are going to be talking about ways that I think we can improve \neven that bill. But the Senate, unfortunately--the Judiciary \nCommittee--saw important suggestions from the Intelligence Community \nrejected, again, along partisan lines. No attempt was made to craft a \nbipartisan proposal. Instead, the committee chose to come up with a \nparty-line vote that raised serious operational concerns.\n  By working with the intelligence community, the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee was able to provide the intelligence community with more \nflexibility in gathering foreign intelligence. This Senate bill will \nallow the Attorney General to authorize targeting persons outside of \nthe United States to acquire this necessary information. No longer will \nthey be required to go to the FISA Court for an approval to target \nforeign terrorists and spies overseas. This will ensure that our \nintelligence community has the agility and the speed it needs to \ncollect actionable intelligence at a time when it counts.\n\n[[Page S15740]]\n\n  The Senate bill does not restrict the types of foreign intelligence \nthat may be collected. It also streamlines the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, providing for more efficient, timely processing of \nFISA applications.\n  These are only a few examples of the tools the authors of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence learned that the intelligence \ncommunity needs to make our country safer, simply by working together \nacross the aisle in a way that protects the American people more. They \nare to be applauded and congratulated for that effort.\n  When the security of our country is at stake, we should consult the \nvery people in the best position to know what they need to make sure \nthat they have the tools necessary, without causing unintended negative \nconsequences.\n  We should learn from the bipartisan lead of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee and work with them to craft a responsible, bipartisan bill \nthat keeps our eyes and our ears open, allows us to listen to our \nenemies, and will help us protect Americans against future terrorist \nattacks on our own soil and in places where Americans are located \naround the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, I am aware that down at the Old Executive Office Building \nthere are large stacks of documents, including the Justice Department \nlegal opinions, that relate to the warrantless wiretapping program and \nletters from our Government to the telecommunications companies.\n  I have read these materials. But most Members of the Senate have been \nprohibited from being able to read these vital documents. I believe \nthat a Senator who was allowed to read these materials would be \nastounded to see how flimsy the Government's case is on behalf of the \nwarrantless wiretapping program.\n  The administration has fought tooth and nail to keep almost every \nMember of this body, and the entire membership of the other body, from \nbeing able to read these materials. I believe every Senator who has not \nread these documents ought to insist on their right to be able to read \nthem before the Senate casts this critical vote. Having read these \ndocuments, I can say, as one Member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, that nothing in any of these opinions has convinced me that \nthe administration's warrantless wiretapping program was legal. Now \nthat the existence of the program has been confirmed, I can see no \nnational security reason to keep most Members of the Senate from being \nable to see these materials. As far as I can tell, these materials are \nbeing classified in order to protect the President's political \nsecurity, not our national security.\n\n  The Intelligence Committee has also reviewed written correspondence \nsent to certain telecommunications companies by the Government. I \ncannot get into the details of this correspondence, but I can say I am \ntotally unconvinced, on the basis of having read these materials, that \nCongress should grant total immunity to the companies.\n  For years, there have been a number of laws on the books, such as the \nWiretap Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and, of course, \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Together, they make it very \nclear that participating in a warrantless wiretapping program is \nagainst Federal law.\n  Many of my colleagues have argued that any companies that were asked \nto provide assistance after September 11 should be treated leniently \nsince that was a period of national confusion and great fear. I think \nthis argument personally has some merit, but the bill that was reported \nby the Intelligence Committee would not just grant immunity for 6 \nmonths or 1 year after September 11; it would grant immunity for \nactions taken up to 5 years after the attack. I think that is far too \nlong, and I am going to briefly explain why.\n  If a phone company was asked to participate in warrantless \nwiretapping in the weeks after September 11, it is understandable that \nexecutives might not have had the time to question assertions from the \nGovernment that the wiretapping was legal. But that doesn't give the \nexecutive a free pass to participate in warrantless wiretapping forever \nand forever. At some point over the following months and years, this \nphone company executive has an obligation to think about whether they \nare complying with the law, and as soon as they realize they have not \nbeen in compliance, they have an obligation to stop it.\n  In the months and years following September 11, it should have been \nincreasingly obvious to any phone company that was participating in the \nprogram that it just might not be following the law. For starters, in \nthe week after September 11, Congress and the President got together to \nrevise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, including the \nwiretapping provisions. But the Congress did not change the sections of \nthe statute that state warrantless wiretapping is illegal. That, in my \nview, should have been a huge red flag to any phone company that was \nparticipating in this program.\n  Next, in the summer of 2002, the Director of the NSA, General Hayden, \nappeared before the Intelligence Committee in open session and \ntestified about the need to get warrants when someone was inside the \nUnited States. I am sure General Hayden would argue that he was parsing \nhis words carefully, but at a minimum, it was clear at this point that \nmost of the Congress and most of the American people believed \nwarrantless wiretapping was illegal.\n  The President has argued that the program was authorized through his \nCommander in Chief authority. But in the spring of 2004, the Supreme \nCourt issued multiple rulings clearly rejecting this idea, and the \nPresident cannot do whatever he chooses to do. These rulings also have \nbeen giant red flags for any phone company engaged in warrantless \nwiretapping.\n  Finally, as the Intelligence Committee's recent report noted, most of \nthe letters requesting assistance stated that the Attorney General \nbelieved the program was legal. But, as our report points out, one of \nthe letters did not even say the Attorney General had approved. I have \nread this letter, and I believe that once again it should have set off \nloud alarm bells in the ears of anybody who received it.\n  In my view, as the years rolled by, it became increasingly \nunreasonable for any phone company to accept the Government's claim \nthat warrantless wiretapping was legal. By 2004, at the very latest, \nany companies involved in the program should have recognized that the \nPresident was asking them to do things that seemed to be against the \nlaw.\n  The former CEO of Quest has said publicly that he refused requests to \nparticipate in warrantless surveillance because he believed it violated \nprivacy statutes. I cannot comment on the accuracy of this claim, but I \nhope our colleagues will stop and think about its implications.\n  I also encourage my colleagues to insist on their right to see the \ncommunications that were sent to the telecommunications companies. My \nown view is, when they read these letters, if they are given a chance \nto read them, these letters seriously undermine the case for blanket \nretroactive immunity.\n  The legislation that passed the Intelligence Committee would grant \nimmunity long past the point at which it was reasonable for the phone \ncompanies to believe the Bush administration. It would even grant \nimmunity stretching past the point at which the program became public. \nBy the beginning of 2006, the program was public and all of the legal \narguments for and against warrantless wiretapping were subject to open \ndebate. Clearly, any companies that participated in this program in \n2006 did so with full knowledge of the possible consequences.\n  I cannot see any reason at all why retroactive immunity should cover \nthis time period. When the Senate Intelligence Committee voted to grant \ntotal retroactive immunity, I voted no because I believed it was \nnecessary to take more time to study the relevant legal opinion as well \nas the letters that were sent to the communications companies.\n  I have long felt that it is possible to fight terrorism ferociously \nand still address the civil liberties needs of our citizens. Now that I \nhave studied these documents, I am convinced that granting 6 years of \ntotal retroactive immunity is not justified and it is not justified in \nthe name of striking that crucial balance between fighting terrorism\n\n[[Page S15741]]\n\naggressively and protecting the individual liberties of our citizens.\n  I very much want to support this essential legislation. Chairman \nRockefeller is here. He has done very good work, along with the \ndistinguished vice chairman, Senator Bond, on what I think is the \ncentral issue of this debate, and that is modernizing the FISA law to \nmake sure that now it is possible to apprehend the communications of \ndangerous individuals overseas who are foreigners.\n  The administration came to our committee and made a very reasonable \ncase that the statute has not kept up with the times. Under the \nleadership of Chairman Rockefeller and the vice chairman, Senator Bond, \nwe went to work, and we went to work in a bipartisan way to address \nthat concern. That was the original concern of the Bush administration, \nthat the statute had not kept up with the times and it wasn't possible \nto get the communications of foreigners overseas. Under the leadership \nof Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond, that issue was dealt \nwith, and it was dealt with to the satisfaction of the Bush \nadministration.\n\n  But the Bush administration wouldn't take yes for an answer. After \nthe distinguished chairman of the committee and the vice chairman and \nall of us on a bipartisan basis went to work to try to address the \nreasonable concern of the Bush administration--that the statute had not \nkept up with the times--that wasn't good enough for the Bush \nadministration. So that is when we were presented with the proposition \nthat we had to have total retroactive immunity for the phone companies. \nYears after the administration had said how legal the program was, \nafter we dealt with the administration's original concern about the \nsurveillance statute, they came in and asked for something else--this \ntotal grant of immunity. In fact, most members of the Intelligence \nCommittee would not even have gotten to see the documents I had seen \nhad it not been for the fact that Chairman Rockefeller and Vice \nChairman Bond insisted on our right to do so.\n  This is an issue of enormous importance. I am very glad our \ncolleagues have come to the floor to take the time to go through it. I \nsuggest that every Member of the Senate who has not had the right to \nsee those documents at the Old Executive Office Building ought to \ninsist on their right to see those documents before they cast this \nvote. I think they will be flabbergasted at how flimsy the legal \nanalysis is to justify this program.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague, the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, on his feet. If I might, I would like to make one \nadditional point, and then I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on this last point: obviously we are in \npublic session, and the last thing I want to do is have the Senator \nfrom Oregon talk about what is in these documents; he cannot do that. \nBut I am struck by the passion with which he just spoke about those \ndocuments and the value of having Members of this body see them, \nparticularly considering the vote we are about to cast.\n  If this bill is adopted with retroactive immunity, then this issue \ndisappears; it goes away forever. There will be no court proceedings, \nnothing. We will never have the opportunity to know until, perhaps, \nsome of these documents might be released decades down the road under \nthe Freedom of Information Act.\n  But I am struck by the Senator's passion in arguing that if people \nread these documents and saw them, they would have a very difficult \ntime supporting the provision in this bill that grants retroactive \nimmunity. Is that the suggestion the Senator has made by those \ncomments?\n  Mr. WYDEN. That is my view, and I find particularly objectionable--\nand the Senator from Connecticut has touched on it--you would \nautomatically assume that every Member of this body--we know all of our \ncolleagues; I trust all of them explicitly with respect to protecting \nour national security--you would think they would certainly have a \nright to see those documents before this vote is to be cast. That is \nnot the case. In fact, the only reason members of the Intelligence \nCommittee got to see them was because of the outstanding work of \nChairman Rockefeller and Senator Bond, who battled for my right to see \nthose documents.\n  Mr. DODD. As a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I do \nnot have the right to see these documents?\n  Mr. WYDEN. That is correct. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, with 26 years in the Senate and as a senior \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, I do not have the right to \nsee these documents?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is right. And we have in the chair serving as \nPresiding Officer of our distinguished body the Senator from Virginia, \na decorated veteran. My understanding is he does not have the legal \nright to see these documents prior to the vote; that they were only \nmade available to members of the Intelligence Committee and perhaps \nseveral others in the leadership. I think that is wrong. I think every \nMember of this body ought to insist on their right to be able to go \ndown to the Old Executive Office Building and read the documents I have \nread, which I believe offer an extraordinarily skimpy case for total \nretroactive immunity.\n  I hope we will have a chance to discuss this issue further. I \nappreciate the Senator from Connecticut making the point that he has \nwith respect to his seniority in the body, his membership on key \ncommittees, such as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and he is \nnot provided the legal right to see these documents before he casts \nthis vote.\n  I wish to discuss briefly one other amendment which has come up \nduring the course of the morning, and that is an amendment I offered in \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee which won bipartisan support in the \nIntelligence Committee addressing the rights of Americans who travel \noverseas. I offered it with the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, \nMr. Feingold, and the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nWhitehouse. It was approved when the Intelligence Committee voted on \nthat matter on a bipartisan basis.\n  Most of our citizens are probably not aware that the original Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act only provided protections for Americans \ninside the United States and that it does not cover Americans who \ntravel overseas. So if the Government wants to deliberately tap the \nphone calls of a businesswoman, for example in Roanoke, VA, or an armed \nservices member in Pendleton, OR, the Government has to go to a judge, \npresent evidence, and get a FISA warrant. But if that businesswoman or \nthat serviceman is sent overseas, the Attorney General can personally \napprove the surveillance by making his own unilateral determination of \nprobable cause. In my view, this formulation makes no sense at all. In \nthe digital age, the rights and freedoms of individual Americans should \nnot be dependent on physical geography. That is why I offered the \namendment in the Intelligence Committee that would make it clear that \nAmericans have the same rights when they travel overseas as they do \ninside the United States.\n\n  Now, some have raised concerns that my amendment may have unintended \nconsequences. I certainly don't want to see that, and so I have worked \nwith Members of this body, particularly Senators Rockefeller and Bond, \nto address those concerns. We have made it clear that we are open to \ntechnical changes in the proposal so that there will not be the \nprospect of any unintended consequences, while at the same time \nprotecting the rights of our citizens who travel overseas. Our staffs \nhave been working for many weeks on a potential managers' amendment \nwhich would preserve the original intent of the provision, which is \nvery straightforward, and that is to give Americans overseas the same \nlegal protections they have in the United States to the maximum extent \npossible and to the maximum extent consistent with national security.\n  We have made progress, Mr. President, on this issue, but we are not \nquite there yet. I have gotten varying reports as to what may \nconstitute a managers' package with respect to this legislation, but I \nconsider the matter of the travel rights of Americans so fundamental in \nthe digital age, it would be my intent to object to any unanimous \nconsent agreement that waters down these travel rights of law-abiding \nAmericans during these crucial days.\n\n[[Page S15742]]\n\n  I continue to remain hopeful that, working closely with the \ndistinguished chairman of our full committee, Senator Rockefeller, and \nthe vice chairman, Senator Bond, who is not on the floor, we can reach \nan agreement. All sides are working in good faith, but without the \nproper language on this matter, which I do think is once again \nfundamental to striking that balance between fighting terrorism \naggressively and protecting individual liberty, without this amendment \nI would have to object to any unanimous consent agreement in a \nmanagers' package which didn't address the amendment that won \nbipartisan support in the committee. I hope it will not come to that, \nand I want to make it clear again to the chairman of the full \ncommittee, Senator Rockefeller, and to the vice chairman that I intend \nto work very closely with them in the upcoming hours to see if we can \nwork this out so I will not have to object to the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                 Burma Democracy Promotion Act of 2007\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, later today we hope to clear the Burma \nDemocracy Promotion Act of 2007. This legislation, which ratchets up \nour already tight sanctions against the Burmese junta, has bipartisan \nsupport in the House and Senate and comes at a critical time for the \nsuffering people of Burma.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Biden, the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, on this legislation, who has been an ally \nof mine on other sanctions legislation, and by Senator Feinstein, as \nalways in the forefront of any issue related to Burma. The Burmese \npeople have no greater friend than Senator Feinstein. Sixteen other \ncosponsors have offered their support to this important and timely \nbill.\n  The Senate bill would take a number of steps. It would first put in \nplace new financial sanctions and an extended visa ban on senior junta \nofficials. It would close existing loopholes that allow indirect \nimportation of Burmese gems and timber, and it urges an international \narms embargo on Burma, which faces no external military threats.\n  This legislation would also establish a special representative and \npolicy coordinator for Burma, appointed by the President and subject to \nSenate confirmation. The United States is fortunate to already have a \nstellar charge d'affaires in Rangoon. However, her focus is, as it \nshould be, on bilateral relations with Burma. The new envoy would help \nto ensure that U.S. diplomacy is multilateral in scope, sustained, and \nfully coordinated with other international efforts.\n  Now, the House passed its version of enhanced Burma sanctions last \nweek. I am hopeful the two bodies will soon reconcile these bills so we \ncan get this legislation signed into law.\n  Mr. President, the entire world was inspired by the brave Burmese \nprotesters who peacefully protested for justice earlier this year, and \nwe were appalled at the violent Government reprisals that followed. We \nmourn the dead, and we pray for those who are still missing.\n  Since those sad days, a fickle news cycle has moved on to other \nmatters. But with this legislation, we show that the U.S. Congress has \nnot forgotten the people of Burma, and neither has the administration, \nas witnessed by the strong leadership of the First Lady on this issue. \nIt is my hope the U.N. Security Council has an equally long memory and \nwill soon take up and pass an arms embargo against the Burmese regime. \nIn the end, multilateral sanctions are the most effective means of \npressuring this regime to change its misbegotten course. With this \nlegislation, we aim to lead by example. Our hope is that others will \nsoon follow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 39 minutes remaining under \ncloture.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I choose to yield the remainder of my time \nto the distinguished Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon. I thank \nhim for his eloquent statement and for his admonition as well about the \nimportance of these documents and how relevant they are to the \ndiscussion--and the inability of most of us here to have any idea what \nis in them. I admire the Senator from Oregon for insisting on his right \nto see them and therefore sharing with us at least in general terms the \nsubstance of those documents and their relevance to the request for \nseeking retroactive immunity, going back 5 years. I think his comments \nshould carry great weight with our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. As he has pointed out so many times, these issues should never \nbe associated with partisan debate.\n  The idea of striking that balance between security and protecting the \nrights of individuals was exactly the motivation for the original FISA \nlegislation almost 30 years ago. As the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, pointed out, there have been 30 modifications to that \nlegislation over 30 years in order to make it relevant. As the world \nchanged and technology improved, it was important to modify that \nlegislation so we would have the capacity to minimize the threats \nagainst our Nation.\n  Earlier today, Mr. President, I began some comments and interrupted \nthem when I allowed the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, to \nmake her remarks. I want to pick up where I left off.\n  Mr. President, both versions of the bill--that is, the version \nprepared by my friend from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, and \nSenator Bond, and the version prepared by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee--authorize the President of the United States to conduct \noverseas surveillance without individual warrants. I think that needs \nto be repeated. You can conduct overseas surveillance without \nindividual warrants. That is not the subject of the debate here at all. \nBoth of these bills allow the President to submit his procedures for \nthis new kind of surveillance for the review of the FISA Court--after \nthose procedures are already in place. But only one version of the bill \nbalances these significant new procedural powers with real oversight \nfrom the Congress and the courts, and that is the Judiciary Committee \nversion.\n  I say respectfully that the version by the Intelligence Committee, I \nam afraid, is a bill of token oversight and weak protections for \ninnocent Americans, and the Senate ought to vote it down. Specifically, \nthe bill fails on five counts.\n  First, its safeguards against the targeting of Americans--its \nminimization procedures--are insufficient. It significantly expands the \nPresident's surveillance power, while leaving checks on that power \nunchanged. This version of the bill provides practically no deterrent \nagainst excessive domestic spying--no consequences if the court finds \nthe President's minimization procedures, in fact, lacking. If his \ntargeting procedures are found lacking, the President hardly has to \nworry; he can keep and share all the information he obtained, and he \ncan continue his actions all the way through the judicial review \nprocess, which could take, of course, months.\n  It should be clear to all of us that real oversight includes the \npower to enforce. The Intelligence Committee's version of this bill \noffers us the semblance of judicial oversight but not the real thing. \nImagine a judge convicting a bank robber and then letting him keep the \nloot as long as he promises to never, ever, ever do it again. That \nmight as well be the bill before us. In fact, the bill before us would \nallow the President to immediately target anybody on a whim. \nWiretapping could start even before the court has approved it. In this \nbill, oversight is exactly where the President would like it--after the \nfact.\n  Don't get me wrong: when a President needs immediate emergency \nauthority to begin wiretapping, he should have it. If you need it \nimmediately, you ought to get it immediately. I think all of us find \nthat obvious. The question is what to do in those cases that aren't \nemergencies. In those cases, I believe there is no reason the court \nshouldn't give advice and approval beforehand. President Bush \ndisagrees. He believes in a permanent emergency.\n  Second, the Intelligence Committee bill fails to protect American \ncitizens\n\n[[Page S15743]]\n\nfrom reverse targeting--the practice of targeting a foreign person on \nfalse pretenses, without a warrant, in order to collect the information \nof the American on the other end of the conversation.\n  Admiral McConnell said:\n\n       Reverse targeting is not legal. It would be a breach of the \n     Fourth Amendment.\n\n  He is absolutely correct, of course, which is why it is so vital that \nthis bill contain strong, enforceable protection against it. This bill \ndoesn't have one.\n  Thirdly, this bill, while purporting to end warrantless wiretapping \nof Americans, might actually allow it to continue unabated. That is \nbecause it lacks strong exclusivity language--language stating that \nFISA is the only controlling law for foreign intelligence surveillance. \nWith that provision in place, surveillance has a place inside the rule \nof law. Without it, there is no such guarantee.\n  Who knows what specious rationale of this or any other future \nadministration might cook up for lawless spying? The last time, as we \nhave seen, Alberto Gonzales laughably tried to find grounds for \nwarrantless wiretapping on the authorization of force against \nAfghanistan. Those are the legal lengths to which the administration \nhas proved it is willing and able to go.\n  What next? Without strong exclusivity language, that question will \nremain hanging over all our heads.\n  Fourth, unlike the Judiciary version of the bill, the Intelligence \nversion lacks strong protections against bulk collection--the \nwarrantless collection of all overseas communications, a massive \ndragnet with the potential to sweep up thousands or millions of \nAmericans without cause. Today, bulk collection is infeasible, but \nAdmiral McConnell said:\n\n       It would be authorized, if it were physically possible to \n     do so.\n\n  Before any administration has that chance, we should clearly and \nexpressly prohibit such an unprecedented violation of privacy. This \nbill fails to do that.\n  Fifth and finally, this bill stays in effect until 2013, through the \nnext Presidential term and into the next one. Compare that to the 4-\nyear sunset in the Judiciary version. I believe that, when making such \ndramatic changes to the Nation's terrorist surveillance regime, we \nshould err on the side of caution. Once the new regime has been tested, \nonce its effectiveness against terrorism and its compromises of privacy \nhave been weighed, we deserve to have this debate again. It will, I \npredict, be a much less speculative and more informed debate. The \nJudiciary bill is wise not to put it off any longer than necessary.\n  I oppose this legislation on these five counts for the same reason I \noppose retroactive immunity--because when the President's power is \nstrongest, the rule of law should be the strongest, as well. The \nIntelligence Committee's bill means more power and less law. It reduces \ncourt oversight nearly to the point of symbolism. It would allow the \ntargeting of Americans on false pretenses. It opens us to new, twisted \nrationale for wireless wiretapping, the very thing it seeks to prevent. \nIt could allow bulk collection as soon as the administration has the \nwherewithal to build such an enormous dragnet. And it sets all of these \ndeeply flawed provisions in stone for the next 6 years.\n\n  In sum, this is entirely too trusting a piece of legislation. With \nits immunity, with its wiretapping provisions, it answers George \nBush's, ``Trust me,'' with an all too eager ``Yes!''\n  I leave my colleagues with a simple question: Has that trust been \nearned?\n  I don't know how many of my colleagues have ever seen the wonderful \nmovie ``A Man For All Seasons,'' the story of St. Thomas More. There is \na wonderful scene in that movie in which More is asked whether he'd be \nwilling to cut down every law in England to get his hands on the devil.\n  And More replies, absolutely not. ``When the last law was down, and \nthe Devil turned 'round on you, where you hide, the laws all being \nflat? This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast--\nMan's laws, not God's! And if you cut them down . . . do you really \nthink you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?''\n  Maybe we could find excuses for every one of this president's abuses \nof power: ``It was just a little overreach.'' ``You just have to give a \nlittle.''\n  But if you do that day after day, week after week, month after month, \nyear after year, all of a sudden you look up to find that all of the \nlaws have been cut down, that there is nothing to protect us from the \nwinds. Before that day comes, Mr. President, we must draw a line. I am \nhere today to draw it.\n  So I will do everything I can to see to it that this bill does not go \nforward. Unless retroactive immunity is struck, I will resist this bill \nwith all the tools available to me as one Member of this body. We can \ndo better than this.\n  This goes beyond ideology--or at least it should. We all care about \nthe security of our country; the FISA law protects that security, and \nit protects our privacy at the same time, from those who would \noverreach.\n  We have struggled to strike that balance throughout our history. \nToday, it is more important than ever that we stand firm in our \ndetermination not to give up or erode these very rights that are \ncritical for our security.\n  The idea that we can become more secure by giving up rights is \nfundamentally flawed. It needs to be addressed on every possible \noccasion. It is a dangerous notion. It is a totally false dichotomy. It \nneeds to be defeated as an idea.\n  When we insist upon our rights, we only grow stronger. We know it can \nbe done. For 30 years now, this law has worked well. It needs to be \nmodernized, clearly, to protect us against those who also have access \nto modern techniques to do us great harm and injury. But this is not a \nbattle between those who want to keep us secure and those who want to \nkeep our rights. It is a battle about whether we understand that we are \nmore secure precisely when we protect these rights.\n  A year ago, when the Military Commissions Act came up for a vote, I \nfelt very strongly about it. I spoke against it. I voted against it. \nThe idea of walking away from habeas corpus, the idea of allowing \ntorture, the idea of walking away from the Geneva Conventions--I \nregretted deeply then that I didn't do what I am prepared to do today, \nand that is to vigorously fight against that legislation.\n  I think most of us today recognize what a great mistake that was, to \ngive away those rights. I think most of us recognize how it hurt our \ncountry. I am determined not to let that happen again. As long as it \ntakes, I will stand here and insist that we need to strip immunity out \nof this bill.\n  I am prepared to listen to ideas about putting caps on liability, to \nprevent the telecom companies from paying outrageous fees. But if we \ngrant this immunity, we will never know whether their actions were \nright or wrong.\n  Then why not your medical records the next time? Why not your \nfinancial records? What is the difference? If I can reach in and listen \nto your phone conversation, why not grant immunity to someone who would \nlike to know your medical records or financial records? Why not grant \nimmunity to companies that would turn over those documents? Where do \nyou stop? Where do you put your foot down and say, ``That is not \nright''?\n  Today it is the phone records. Today it is the phone conversations. \nIt is e-mail traffic--without a warrant. So why not the next step? If \nwe don't put our foot down and stand up, we will be faced with the \nargument that we have already granted it. We established the precedent; \n75 Senators, Democrats and Republicans, agreed we ought to provide that \nimmunity. That argument will be heard, as it has been heard on the \nMilitary Commissions Act.\n  I respect immensely the work of the people who spent a lot of time on \nthese issues. But this is a critical moment. They don't happen every \nday; but this is an important one. This goes right to the heart of who \nwe are. This is not about selling our souls. It is about giving them \naway, if we don't stand up for these rights.\n  So I look forward to continuing debate and discussion on this vital \nissue.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened very closely to the remarks \nof my dear friend from Connecticut. I have a lot of respect for him. \nHowever, it was an easy thing for 13 members of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence to vote to grant retroactive immunity to \ncompanies that patriotically\n\n[[Page S15744]]\n\nadhered to legal letters to provide the means whereby we might be able \nto protect citizens in this country and perhaps all over the world.\n  Because of that work, we have been able to protect this country in \nways that most people will never know because this area is one of the \nareas that we don't talk about. It is, this whole area, highly \nclassified. We can talk about the law here.\n  Close inspection of the lawsuits against the telecoms reveals dubious \nclaims. The plaintiffs have confused speculation for established facts. \nThis is dangerous and the continuation of these lawsuits could lead to \nserious consequences for our national security.\n  It is very simple--Congress should not condone oversight through \nlitigation.\n  A quick scan of what plaintiffs seek in many of these cases should \nsend a chill down our spine. They are not, as many are suggesting, \nsimply saying: ``You went along with the President's Terrorist \nSurveillance Program, now give us money.'' Rather, the lawsuits seize \non the President's brief comments about the existence of a limited \nprogram to go on a fishing expedition of NSA activities. But this is \nreally worse than a fishing expedition; this is draining the Loch Ness \nto find a monster. Sometimes what you are looking for just doesn't \nexist.\n  The lawsuits represent irrational fears of Government conspiracy, and \nseek to expose classified information, regardless of who is harmed in \nthe process.\n  We all realize that the sources and methods our intelligence \ncommunity utilizes to conduct surveillance are highly classified. The \nrisks that classified details could be revealed through these lawsuits \nare severe. Remember, the very point of these lawsuits is to prove \nplaintiffs' claims by disclosing classified information.\n  Our enemies have tough decisions to make regarding how they \ncommunicate. They can't stay silent forever, and they have to weigh the \nneed to communicate against the chance that their communications are \nintercepted. Given this, they are carefully watching us and reading \nevery proceeding to see how our government collects information. If \nthey think they see a weakness in our collection capabilities, they \nwill certainly try and take advantage of it.\n  Given the legitimate problems that these lawsuits pose, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee adopted a bill which will alleviate them. The \ncommittee worked in a bipartisan manner to craft an immunity provision \nthat met the needs of Congress, the Government, and the American \npeople.\n  In an overwhelmingly bipartisan tally, the committee voted to include \nretroactive immunity for service providers that were alleged to have \ncooperated with the intelligence community following 9/11. Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle, after careful consideration, came to this \nconclusion. Make no mistake, this was the right conclusion.\n  It was the right conclusion for the Intelligence Committee, and it \nshould be the right conclusion for the full Senate today.\n  Our Senate Intelligence Committee has already noted that the \nintelligence community cannot obtain the intelligence it needs without \nthe assistance of these companies. It goes without saying, companies in \nthe future will certainly be less willing to assist the Government if \nthey face the threat of extremely costly lawsuits each time they are \nalleged to have provided assistance.\n  The companies will shy away. Their attorneys will scour future \nGovernment requests, feverishly looking for any technicality to avoid \ncompliance. And even if these private attorneys approve future \nparticipation, the company will have to listen to cautious \nstockholders, whose financial interests will undoubtedly make them \nadamantly opposed to situations which could lead to any financial risk \nor exposure.\n  But let's be clear: The telecoms are not threatening anyone. They are \nnot saying ``do this, or we will never help you again.'' But, they \ndon't need to say these things for us to understand the obvious. If the \nfinancial foundations of these companies crumble due to frivolous \nlitigation, they will rebuild it to withstand future Government \nrequests that may again lead to their collapse.\n  Now some have asked a valid question: If the companies did not break \nthe law, why do they need immunity? Quite simply, the Government's \nassertion of the state secrets privilege prevents these companies from \ndefending themselves.\n  This assertion by the Government is absolutely essential, as the \npossible disclosure of classified materials from ongoing court \nproceedings is a grave threat to national security. Simply put, you \ndon't tell your enemies how you track them. This is why the NSA and \nother Government agencies won't say what they do, how they do it, or \nwho they watch. Nor should they! To confirm or deny any of these \nactivities, which are at the heart of the civil lawsuits, would harm \nnational security. We should not discuss what our capabilities are.\n  Given the necessity for the state secrets privilege, the drawback is \nthat the companies being sued are forbidden from making their case. In \nfact, the companies cannot even confirm or deny any involvement in the \nprogram whatsoever. They have no ability to defend themselves, and that \nis after patriotically doing what has to be done to protect each and \nevery citizen in this country.\n  Ordinarily, these companies would be able to address allegations and \nmake their case. However, the classified nature of the topic means the \ncompanies are not free to do so. They cannot even have discussions with \nshareholders or business partners.\n  But we need to remember, lawful silence does not equate to guilt. \nThere is no guilt here. These are companies that cooperated with the \nFederal Government in helping us track terrorists to protect our \ncitizens.\n  The identities of any company that assisted the Government following \nthe attacks of September 11 are highly classified. While there have \nbeen numerous allegations, they are nothing more than accusations. If \nthe identities of these companies are revealed and officially confirmed \nthrough litigation, they will face irreversible harm: harm in their \nbusiness relations with foreign governments and companies and possible \nharm to their employees both here and abroad, who are truly soft \ntargets for terrorist attacks.\n  My admiration and respect for the companies that did their part to \ndefend Americans is well known. As I have said in the past, any company \nthat assisted us following the attacks of 9/11 deserves a round of \napplause and a helping hand, not a slap in the face and a kick to the \ngut.\n  When companies are asked to assist the intelligence community based \non a program authorized by the President and based on assurances from \nthe highest levels of Government that the program has been determined \nto be lawful and necessary, they should be able to rely on those \nrepresentations. For those who argue we need a compromise, let me be \nclear: We already have a compromise. The Government certainly wanted \nmore than what is represented in this Intelligence Committee bill. And \nthey did not get all they wanted. I think they should have. The \nchairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence stated the \nfollowing in the Intelligence Committee report:\n\n       This immunity provision is not the broad and vague immunity \n     sought by the administration. The committee did not endorse \n     the immunity provision lightly. It was the informed judgment \n     of the Committee after months in which we carefully reviewed \n     the facts in this matter. The Committee reached the \n     conclusion that the immunity remedy was appropriate in this \n     case after holding numerous hearings and briefings on the \n     subject and conducting a thorough examination of the letters \n     sent by the U.S. Government to the telecommunications \n     companies.\n\n  That is after numerous top-secret Intelligence Committee hearings. \nThe immunity provisions in this bill are limited in scope. Not everyone \nwill be happy with them, and that is the whole point. I, for one, \nwanted to see more protections for companies and Government officials \nin this bill. But I am willing to accept a compromise. My colleagues \nshould be willing to do the same.\n  We are not all getting what we want. We are getting what the public \nneeds for its protection. I will continue to oppose any efforts to \nweaken the Rockefeller-Bond immunity provision.\n  For nearly 2 months, Congress and the public have had the ability to \nreview the immunity provisions in this\n\n[[Page S15745]]\n\nbill. Today we are hearing a great deal about how the Intelligence and \nJudiciary Committees handled the immunity provision. So let's look at \nhow they voted.\n  The Intelligence Committee rejected an amendment to strip immunity \nfrom the bill, 12 to 3, and the committee voted to favorably report the \nbill, including the immunity provision, 13 to 2.\n  In addition, the Judiciary Committee rejected an amendment to strike \nthe immunity provision from the bill, 12 to 7. What do all those votes \nhave in common? They supported immunity and they were bipartisan. How \nmany times are we going to hear about alternatives to S. 2248 which \nsimply do not address the problem? How many trial balloons are going to \nbe released? The first alternative we heard was the Government should \nindemnify the companies following possible adverse rulings in the \ncases.\n  There are myriad reasons why this option was lacking. The idea of \nindemnification apparently was not well received, as we now hear very \nlittle discussion of it. So let us call indemnification the first trial \nballoon to pop.\n  The next alternative we heard was the Government should be \nsubstituted in place of the companies being sued. But this alternative \nwas full of problems, given that there is no way to remove the \ncompanies from the litigation. Remember, it is their very conduct that \nis in question. In order to try to prove their claims, plaintiffs will \ncontinue to seek discovery, including: document requests, depositions, \ninterrogatories, technical data, trade secrets, proprietary company \ninformation and confidential, secret and highly classified information \nand the list goes on and on.\n  Obviously, the companies would still face many burdens of litigation, \neven though they are not parties because the Government is substituted \nfor them.\n  This idea has also been skeptically viewed and the Judiciary \nCommittee on Thursday rejected an idea in a resounding 13 to 5 \nbipartisan vote. So let's call Government substitution the second trial \nballoon to pop.\n  Now we are hearing another alternative which would dramatically \nexpand the jurisdiction of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, \nand utilizes ambiguous terms such as ``objectively reasonable belief.''\n  The FISA Court was not created to review classified programs or the \nconduct of private companies. This new proposed alternative would \ncompletely revise the mission of the FISA Court, putting them in a role \nthey have not had in their nearly 30 years of existence. This judicial \nexpansion should be the third trial balloon to pop.\n  How long are we going to entertain inadequate alternatives and \nappease fringe political groups? Is it not time that we embrace the \nbipartisan compromise that puts the interest and safety of Americans \nover political interests? How long will it take? Are we willing to take \nthat stand?\n  Let me also take a few minutes to unequivocally state my opposition \nto the Judiciary substitute. One of the basic requirements of any FISA \nmodernization proposal is we should not have any provisions which could \nbe interpreted as requiring warrants to target foreign terrorists \noverseas.\n  Quite simply, foreign terrorists living overseas should never receive \nprotections provided by the fourth amendment to the Constitution. The \nConstitution never contemplated that. One of the controversial \nprovisions added in the Judiciary Committee relates to ``reverse \ntargeting.'' Reverse targeting is the practice of targeting a foreign \nperson when the real intention is to target a U.S. person, thus \ncircumventing the need to get a warrant for the U.S. person.\n  Reverse targeting has always been unlawful, in order to protect the \ncommunications of U.S. persons. Now, contrary to what most people \nbelieve, the legal definition of ``U.S. person,'' is not limited to \nU.S. citizens. See this chart: What is a U.S. person?\n\n       An ``alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,'' a \n     ``corporation which is incorporated in the United States.''\n\n  Now, that is according to 50 U.S.C. 1801. The U.S. person definition \nincludes aliens lawfully admitted, legal residence, legal permanent \nresidence. A U.S. person is also defined as a business incorporated \nwithin the United States.\n  From an intelligence-gathering standpoint, reverse targeting makes no \nsense. From an efficiency standpoint, if the Government was interested \nin targeting an American, it would apply for a warrant to listen to all \nthe American's conversations, not just his conversations with a \nterrorist overseas.\n  But let's not let logic get in the way of a good conspiracy theory. \nEven though reverse targeting is already considered unlawful, a \nprovision is included in the Intelligence bill which makes it explicit. \nThis provision is clearly written and universally supported. However, \nthe Judiciary Committee passed an amendment by a 10-to-9 partisan \nparty-line vote which altered the clear language of that provision.\n  Now, where before the provision said you cannot target a foreign \nperson if the purpose is to target a U.S. person, the new language adds \nthe ambiguous term ``significant purpose.''\n  Now, words have meaning and in this context have very serious \nmeaning. If this amendment becomes law, an analyst would now have to \nask himself this question when targeting a terrorist overseas: Is a \n``significant purpose'' of why I am targeting this foreign terrorist \noverseas the fact that the terrorist may call an airline in America to \nmake flight reservations or a terrorist with a green card living in the \nUSA?\n  If the answer is yes, then the language in this amendment would \nrequire the analyst to get a warrant to listen to that foreign \nterrorist overseas.\n  Now, if there is one thing we can all agree on, it is we should \nnever, ever need a warrant to listen to a foreign terrorist overseas. \nThe ambiguous and unnecessary text of this amendment should not be left \nup to judicial interpretation. Enactment of this amendment could lead \nto our analysts seeking warrants when targeting any foreign terrorists, \nsince the analyst may be afraid he or she is otherwise breaking our new \nlaw.\n  Now, remember, the Intelligence Committee spent months working on a \nbipartisan compromise bill. This amendment I have been talking about \nwas not in the Intelligence bill. So people should assume the Judiciary \nCommittee spent a great deal of time debating this amendment, right? \nWrong. The Judiciary Committee spent 7 minutes debating this amendment \nbefore it was adopted, again, on a 10-to-9 partisan vote, party-line \nvote.\n  Let me repeat that. Seven minutes on something that is this \nimportant. The Intelligence Committee spent months coming up with a \ncompromise that the leaders of the intelligence community say is the \nminimum--minimum--they need to have.\n  We are enacting national security legislation, and it is our \nresponsibility to ensure this bill does not lead to unintended \nconsequences which provide protections to terrorists. This provision is \none example of an amendment adopted by the Judiciary Committee which \ncould and probably would, if it were enacted, harm national security. \nIt also serves as yet another reason why we should not support the \nJudiciary substitute or any aspect of it.\n  I am a member of both committees. In fact, I believe I am probably \nthe longest serving member on the Intelligence Committee. The Judiciary \nbill includes provisions that could weaken national security. Why are \nwe thinking of handcuffing ourselves? We should not blindfold our \nintelligence agencies, spin them around to disorient them, and then \nsend them out to find terrorists. We are not playing pin the tail on \nthe donkey. We are legislating on national security, and the stakes are \ntoo high to allow legal loopholes in the Judiciary substitute to go \nforward.\n  Now, I am not alone in this view, as the Executive Office of the \nPresident today released a statement of administration policy which \nstated:\n\n       If the Judiciary Committee substitute amendment is part of \n     the bill that is presented to the President, the Director of \n     National Intelligence, the Attorney General of the United \n     States, and the President's other senior advisers will \n     recommend that he veto this bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S15746]]\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\nS. 2248--To amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, to \n   modernize and streamline the provisions of that act and for other \n                                purposes\n\n       Protection of the American people and American interests at \n     home and abroad requires access to timely, accurate, and \n     insightful intelligence on the capabilities, intentions, and \n     activities of foreign powers, including terrorists. The \n     Protect America Act of 2007 (PAA), which amended the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) this past \n     August, has greatly improved the Intelligence Community's \n     ability to protect the Nation from terrorist attacks and \n     other national security threats. The PAA has allowed us to \n     close intelligence gaps, and it has enabled our intelligence \n     professionals to collect foreign intelligence information \n     from targets overseas more efficiently and effectively. The \n     Intelligence Community has implemented the PAA under a robust \n     oversight regime that has protected the civil liberties and \n     privacy rights of Americans. Unfortunately, the benefits \n     conferred by the PAA are only temporary because the act \n     sunsets on February 1, 2008.\n       The Director of National Intelligence has frequently \n     discussed what the Intelligence Community needs in permanent \n     FISA legislation, including two key principles. First, \n     judicial authorization should not be required to gather \n     foreign intelligence from targets located in foreign \n     countries. Second, the law must provide liability protection \n     for the private sector.\n       The Senate is considering two bills to extend the core \n     authorities provided by the PAA and modernize FISA. In \n     October, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) \n     passed a consensus, bipartisan bill (S. 2248) that would \n     establish a sound foundation for our Intelligence Community's \n     efforts to target terrorists and other foreign intelligence \n     targets located overseas. Although the bill is not perfect \n     and its flaws must be addressed, it nevertheless represents a \n     bipartisan compromise that will ensure that the Intelligence \n     Community retains the authorities it needs to protect the \n     Nation. Indeed, the SSCI bill is an improvement over the PAA \n     in one essential way-it would provide retroactive liability \n     protection to electronic communication service providers that \n     are alleged to have assisted the Government with intelligence \n     activities in the aftermath of September 11th.\n       In sharp contrast to the SSCI's bipartisan approach to \n     modernizing FISA, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported an \n     amendment to the SSCI bill that would have devastating \n     consequences to the Intelligence Community's ability to \n     detect and prevent terrorist attacks and to protect the \n     Nation from other national security threats. The Judiciary \n     Committee proposal would degrade our foreign intelligence \n     collection capabilities. The Judiciary Committee's amendment \n     would impose unacceptable and potentially crippling burdens \n     on the collection of foreign intelligence information by \n     expanding FISA to restrict facets of foreign intelligence \n     collection never intended to be covered under the statute. \n     Furthermore, the Judiciary Committee amendment altogether \n     fails to address the critical issue of liability \n     protection. Accordingly, if the Judiciary Committee's \n     substitute amendment is part of a bill that is presented \n     to the President the Director of National Intelligence, \n     the Attorney General, and the President's other senior \n     advisors will recommend that he veto the bill.\n     The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence bill\n       Building on the authorities and oversight protections \n     included in the PAA, the SSCI drafted S. 2248 to provide a \n     sound legal framework for essential foreign intelligence \n     collection in a manner consistent with the Fourth Amendment. \n     As in the PAA, S. 2248 permits the targeting of foreign \n     terrorists and other foreign intelligence targets outside the \n     United States based upon the approval of the Director of \n     National Intelligence and the Attorney General.\n       The SSCI drafted its bill in extensive coordination with \n     Intelligence Community and national security professionals--\n     those who are most familiar with the needs of the \n     Intelligence Community and the complexities of our \n     intelligence laws. The SSCI also heard testimony from privacy \n     experts in order to craft a balanced approach. As a result, \n     the SSCI bill recognizes the importance of clarity in laws \n     governing intelligence operations. Although the \n     Administration would strongly prefer that the provisions of \n     the PAA be made permanent without modification, the \n     Administration engaged in extensive consultation in the \n     interest of achieving permanent legislation in a bipartisan \n     manner.\n       The SSCI bill is not perfect, however. Indeed, certain \n     provisions represent a major modification of the PAA and will \n     create additional burdens for the Intelligence Community, \n     including by dramatically expanding the role of the FISA \n     Court in reviewing foreign intelligence operations targeted \n     at persons located outside the United States, a role never \n     envisioned when Congress created the FISA court.\n       In particular, the SSCI bill contains two provisions that \n     must be modified in order to avoid significant negative \n     impacts on intelligence operations. Both of these provisions \n     are also included in the Judiciary Committee substitute, \n     detailed further below.\n       First, as part of the debate over FISA modernization, \n     concerns have been raised regarding acquiring information \n     from U.S. persons outside the United States. Accordingly, the \n     SSCI bill provides for FISA Court approval of surveillance of \n     U.S. persons abroad. The Administration opposes this \n     provision. Under executive orders in place since before the \n     enactment of FISA in 1978, Attorney General approval is \n     required before foreign intelligence surveillance and \n     searches may be conducted against a U.S. person abroad under \n     circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation \n     of privacy. More specifically, section 2.5 of Executive Order \n     12333 requires that the Attorney General find probable cause \n     that the U.S. person target is a foreign power or an agent of \n     a foreign power. S. 2248 dramatically increases the role of \n     the FISA Court by requiring court approval of this probable \n     cause determination before an intelligence operation may be \n     conducted beyond the borders of the United States. This \n     provision imposes burdens on foreign intelligence collection \n     abroad that frequently do not exist even with respect to \n     searches and surveillance abroad for law enforcement \n     purposes. Were the Administration to consider accepting FISA \n     Court approval for foreign intelligence searches and \n     surveillance of U.S. persons overseas, technical corrections \n     would be necessary. The Administration appreciates the \n     efforts that have been made by Congress to address these \n     issues, but notes that while it may be willing to accept \n     that the FISA Court, rather than the Attorney General, \n     must make the required findings, limitations on the scope \n     of the collection currently allowed are unacceptable.\n       Second, the Senate Intelligence Committee bill contains a \n     requirement that intelligence analysts count ``the number of \n     persons located in the United States whose communications \n     were reviewed.'' This provision would likely be impossible to \n     implement. It places potentially insurmountable burdens on \n     intelligence professionals without meaningfully protecting \n     the privacy of Americans, and takes scarce analytic resources \n     away from protecting our country. The Intelligence Community \n     has provided Congress with a detailed classified explanation \n     of this problem.\n       Although the Administration believes that the PAA achieved \n     foreign intelligence objectives with reasonable and robust \n     oversight protections, S. 2248, as drafted by the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee, provides a workable alternative and \n     improves on the PAA in one critical respect by providing \n     retroactive liability protection. The Senate Intelligence \n     Committee bill would achieve an effective legislative result \n     by returning FISA to its appropriate focus on the protection \n     of privacy interests of persons inside the United States, \n     while retaining our improved capability under PAA to collect \n     timely foreign intelligence information needed to protect the \n     Nation.\n     The Senate Judiciary Committee proposal\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee amendment contains a number \n     of provisions that would have a devastating impact on our \n     foreign intelligence operations.\n       Among the provisions of greatest concern are:\n       An Overbroad Exclusive Means Provision That Threatens \n     Worldwide Foreign Intelligence Operations. Consistent with \n     current law, the exclusive means provision in the SSCI's bill \n     addresses only ``electronic surveillance'' and ``the \n     interception of domestic wire, oral, and electronic \n     communications.'' But the exclusive means provision in the \n     Judiciary Committee substitute goes much further and would \n     dramatically expand the scope of activities covered by that \n     provision. The Judiciary Committee substitute makes FISA the \n     exclusive means for acquiring ``communications information'' \n     for foreign intelligence purposes. The term ``communications \n     information'' is not defined and potentially covers a vast \n     array of information--and effectively bars the acquisition of \n     much of this information that is currently authorized under \n     other statues such as the National Security Act of 1947, as \n     amended. It is unprecedented to require specific statutory \n     authorization for every activity undertaken worldwide by the \n     Intelligence Community. In addition, the exclusivity \n     provision in the Judiciary Committee substitute ignores \n     FISA's complexity and its interrelationship with other \n     federal laws and, as a result, could operate to preclude the \n     Intelligence Community from using current tools and \n     authorities, or preclude Congress from acting quickly to give \n     the Intelligence Community the tools it may need in the \n     aftermath of a terrorist attack in the United States or in \n     response to a grave threat to the national security. In \n     short, the Judiciary Committee's exclusive means provision \n     would radically reshape the intelligence collection framework \n     and is unacceptable.\n       Limits on Foreign Intelligence Collection. The Judiciary \n     Committee substitute would require the Attorney General and \n     the Director of National Intelligence to certify for certain \n     acquisitions that they are ``limited to communications to \n     which at least one party is a specific individual target who \n     is reasonably believed to be located outside the United \n     States.'' This provision is unacceptable because it could \n     hamper U.S. intelligence operations that are currently \n     authorized to be conducted overseas and that could be \n     conducted more effectively from the United States without \n     harming U.S. privacy rights.\n       Significant Purpose Requirement. The Judiciary Committee \n     substitute would require a FISA court order if a \n     ``significant purpose''\n\n[[Page S15747]]\n\n     of an acquisition targeting a person abroad is to acquire the \n     communications of a specific person reasonably believed to be \n     in the United States. If the concern driving this proposal is \n     so-called ``reverse targeting''--circumstances in which the \n     Government would conduct surveillance of a person overseas \n     when the Government's actual target is a person in the United \n     States with whom the person overseas is communicating--that \n     situation is already addressed in FISA today: If the person \n     in the United States is the target, a significant purpose of \n     the acquisition must be to collect foreign intelligence \n     information, and an order from the FISA court is required. \n     Indeed, the SSCI bill codifies this longstanding Executive \n     Branch interpretation of FISA. The Judiciary Committee \n     substitute would place an unnecessary and debilitating burden \n     on our Intelligence Community's ability to conduct \n     surveillance without enhancing the protection of the privacy \n     of Americans.\n       Part of the value of the PAA, and any subsequent \n     legislation, is to enable the Intelligence Community to \n     collect expeditiously the communications of terrorists in \n     foreign countries who may contact an associate in the United \n     States. The Intelligence Community was heavily criticized by \n     numerous reviews after September 11, including by the \n     Congressional Joint Inquiry into September 11, regarding its \n     insufficient attention to detecting communications indicating \n     homeland attack plotting. To quote the Congressional Joint \n     Inquiry: ``The Joint Inquiry has learned that one of the \n     future hijackers communicated with a known terrorist facility \n     in the Middle East while he was living in the United States. \n     The Intelligence Community did not identify the domestic \n     origin of those communications prior to September 11, 2001 so \n     that additional FBI investigative efforts could be \n     coordinated. Despite this country's substantial advantages, \n     there was insufficient focus on what many would have thought \n     was among the most critically important kinds of terrorist-\n     related communications, at least in terms of protecting the \n     Homeland.'' (S. Rept. No. 107-351, H. Rept. No. 107-792 at \n     36.) To be clear, a ``significant purpose'' of Intelligence \n     Community activities is to detect communications that may \n     provide warning of homeland attacks and that may include \n     communication between a terrorist overseas who places a call \n     to associates in the United States. A provision that bars the \n     Intelligence Community from collecting these communications \n     is unacceptable, as Congress has stated previously.\n       Liability Protection. In contrast to the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee bill, the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     substitute would not protect electronic communication service \n     providers who are alleged to have assisted the Government \n     with communications intelligence activities in the aftermath \n     of September 11th from potentially debilitating lawsuits. \n     Providing liability protection to these companies is a just \n     result. In its Conference Report, the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee ``concluded that the providers . . . had a good \n     faith basis for responding to the requests for assistance \n     they received.'' The Committee further recognized that \n     ``the Intelligence Community cannot obtain the \n     intelligence it needs without assistance from these \n     companies.'' Companies in the future may be less willing \n     to assist the Government if they face the threat of \n     private lawsuits each time they are alleged to have \n     provided assistance. The Senate Intelligence Committee \n     concluded that: ``The possible reduction in intelligence \n     that might result from this delay is simply unacceptable \n     for the safety of our Nation.'' Allowing continued \n     litigation also risks the disclosure of highly classified \n     information regarding intelligence sources and methods. In \n     addition to providing an advantage to our adversaries by \n     revealing sources and methods during the course of \n     litigation, the potential disclosure of classified \n     information puts both the facilities and personnel of \n     electronic communication service providers and our \n     country's continued ability to protect our homeland at \n     risk. It is imperative that Congress provide liability \n     protection to those who cooperated with this country in \n     its hour of need.\n       The ramifications of the Judiciary Committee's decision to \n     afford no relief to private parties that cooperated in good \n     faith with the U.S. Government in the immediate aftermath of \n     the attacks of September 11 could extend well beyond the \n     particular issues and activities that have been of primary \n     interest and concern to the Committee. The Intelligence \n     Community, as well as law enforcement and homeland security \n     agencies, continue to rely on the voluntary cooperation and \n     assistance of private parties. A decision by the Senate to \n     abandon those who may have provided assistance after \n     September 11 will invariably be noted by those who may \n     someday be called upon again to help the Nation.\n       Mandates an Unnecessary Review of Historical Programs. The \n     Judiciary Committee substitute would require that inspectors \n     general of the Department of Justice and relevant \n     Intelligence Community agencies audit the Terrorist \n     Surveillance Program and ``any closely related intelligence \n     activities.'' If this ``audit'' is intended to look at \n     operational activities, there has been an ongoing oversight \n     activity by the Inspector General of the National Security \n     Agency (NSA) of operational activities and the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee has that material. Mandating a new and \n     undefined ``audit'' will divert significant operational \n     resources from current issues to redoing past audits. The \n     Administration understands, however, the ``audit'' may in \n     fact not be related to technical NSA operations. If it is the \n     case that in fact the Judiciary Committee is interested in \n     historical reviews of legal issues, the provision is \n     unnecessary. The Department of Justice Inspector General and \n     the Office of Professional Responsibility are already doing a \n     comprehensive review. In addition, the phrase ``closely \n     related intelligence activities'' would introduce substantial \n     ambiguities in the scope of this review. Finally, this \n     provision would require the inspectors general to acquire \n     ``all documents relevant to such programs'' and submit those \n     documents with its report to the congressional intelligence \n     and judiciary committees. The requirement to collect and \n     disseminate this wide range of highly classified documents--\n     including all those ``relevant'' to activities ``closely \n     related'' to the Terrorist Surveillance Program--\n     unnecessarily risks the disclosure of extremely sensitive \n     information about our intelligence activities, as does the \n     audit requirement itself. Taking such national security risks \n     for a backwards-looking purpose is unacceptable.\n       Allows for Dangerous Intelligence Gaps During the Pendency \n     of an Appeal. The Judiciary Committee substitute would delete \n     an important provision in the SSCI bill that enables the \n     Intelligence Community to collect foreign intelligence from \n     overseas terrorists and other foreign intelligence targets \n     during an appeal. Without that provision, we could lose vital \n     intelligence necessary to protect the Nation because of the \n     views of one judge.\n       Limits Dissemination of Foreign Intelligence Information. \n     The Judiciary Committee substitute would impose significant \n     new restrictions on the use of foreign intelligence \n     information, including information not concerning United \n     States persons, obtained or derived from acquisitions using \n     targeting procedures that the FISA Court later found to be \n     unsatisfactory for any reason. By requiring analysts to go \n     back to the databases and pull out certain information, as \n     well as to determine what other information is derived from \n     that information, this requirement would place a difficult, \n     and perhaps insurmountable, burden on the Intelligence \n     Community. Moreover, this provision would degrade privacy \n     protections, as it would require analysts to locate and \n     examine U.S. person information that would otherwise not be \n     reviewed.\n        Requires FISA Court Approval of All ``Targeting'' for \n     Foreign Intelligence Purposes. The Judiciary Committee \n     substitute potentially requires the FISA Court to approve \n     ``[a]ny targeting of persons reasonably believed to be \n     located outside the United States.'' Although we assume that \n     the Committee did not intend to require these procedures to \n     govern all ``targeting'' done of any person in the world for \n     any purpose--whether it is to gather human intelligence, \n     communications intelligence, or for other reasons--the text \n     as passed by the Committee contains no limitation. Such a \n     requirement would bring within the FISA Court a vast range of \n     overseas intelligence activities with little or no connection \n     to civil liberties and privacy rights of Americans.\n       Imposes Court Review of Compliance with Minimization \n     Procedures. The Judiciary Committee substitute would require \n     the FISA Court to review and assess compliance with \n     minimization procedures. Together with provisions discussed \n     above, this would constitute a massive expansion of the \n     Court's role in overseeing the Intelligence Community's \n     implementation of foreign intelligence collection abroad.\n       Amends FISA to Impose Burdensome Document Production \n     Requirements. The Judiciary Committee substitute would amend \n     FISA to require the Government to submit to oversight \n     committees a copy of any decision, order, or opinion issued \n     by the FISA Court or the FISA Court of Review that includes \n     significant construction or interpretation of any provision \n     of FISA, including any pleadings associated with those \n     documents, no later than 45 days after the document is \n     issued. The Judiciary Committee substitute also would require \n     the Government to retrieve historical documents of this \n     nature from the last 5 years. As drafted, this provision \n     could impose significant burdens on Department of Justice \n     staff assigned to support national security operational and \n     oversight missions.\n       Includes an Even Shorter Sunset Provision Than That \n     Contained in the SSCI Bill. The Judiciary Committee \n     substitute and the SSCI bill share the same flaw of failing \n     to achieve permanent FISA reform. The Judiciary Committee \n     substitute worsens this flaw, however, by shortening the \n     sunset provision in the SSCI bill from 6 years to 4 years. \n     Any sunset provision, but particularly one as short as \n     contemplated in the Judiciary Committee substitute, would \n     adversely impact the Intelligence Community's ability to \n     conduct its mission efficiently and effectively by \n     introducing uncertainty and requiring re-training of all \n     intelligence professionals on new policies and procedures \n     implementing ever-changing authorities. Moreover, over the \n     past year, in the interest of providing an extensive \n     legislative record and allowing public discussion on this \n     issue, the Intelligence Community has discussed in open \n     settings extraordinary information dealing with intelligence \n     operations. To repeat this process in several years will \n     unnecessarily highlight our intelligence sources and methods \n     to our adversaries. There is now a lengthy factual record \n     on the need for this\n\n[[Page S15748]]\n\n     legislation, and it is time to provide the Intelligence \n     Community the permanent stability it needs.\n       Fails to Provide Procedures for Implementing Existing \n     Statutory Defenses. The Judiciary Committee substitute fails \n     to include the important provisions in the SSCI bill that \n     would establish procedures for implementing existing \n     statutory defenses and that would preempt state \n     investigations of assistance allegedly provided by an \n     electronic communication service provider to an element of \n     the Intelligence Community. These provisions are important to \n     ensure that electronic communication service providers can \n     take full advantage of existing liability protection and to \n     protect highly classified information.\n       Fails to Address Transition Procedures. Unlike the SSCI \n     bill, the Judiciary Committee bill contains no procedures \n     designed to ensure a smooth transition from the PAA to new \n     legislation, and for a potential transition resulting from an \n     expiration of the new legislation. This omission could result \n     in uncertainty regarding the continuing validity of \n     authorizations and directives under the Protect America Act \n     that are in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     legislation.\n       Fails to Include a Severability Provision. The Judiciary \n     Committee substitute, unlike the SSCI bill, lacks a \n     severability provision. Such a provision should be included \n     in the bill.\n       The Administration is prepared to continue to work with \n     Congress towards the passage of a permanent FISA \n     modernization bill that would strengthen the Nation's \n     intelligence capabilities while protecting the constitutional \n     rights of Americans, so that the President can sign such a \n     bill into law. The Senate Intelligence Committee bill \n     provides a solid foundation to meet the needs of our \n     Intelligence Community, but the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     bill represents a major step backwards from the PAA and would \n     compromise our Intelligence Community's ability to protect \n     the Nation. The Administration calls on Congress to forge \n     ahead and pass legislation that will protect our national \n     security, not weaken it in critical ways.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. To my distinguished colleagues, I urge you to support the \nbipartisan Rockefeller-Bond compromise bill, one that has been superbly \ndebated within the Intelligence Committee and has been carefully \nthought out.\n  It provides protections to civil liberties and ensures that \ntechnological changes do not outpace our laws.\n  I wanted to personally pay tribute to the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee and the distinguished Vice Chairman. They \nknow what they accomplished in the Intelligence Committee was very \nimportant, and it should be followed by us on the floor.\n  We cannot even begin to talk about some classified issues on this \nfloor. We cannot even begin to talk about the dangers that will come \nfrom going beyond that bill that passed 13 to 2 in the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. I refuse to place our country at risk. I refuse \nto do anything that would make our country be at risk. I suggest to you \nthat if we follow the Judiciary Committee bill, I think we would be \ndoing exactly that.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the bill and \nask for approximately 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we have a great country. Here we are, we \nare debating essentially what is going to be the Federal statute on \nelectronic surveillance on the American people and on those who might \nhave predatory intent toward us.\n  We are doing it in an open, public session, with the world to watch \non C-SPAN and talking about what are the right parameters to be able to \nprotect the American people and yet protect the American Constitution.\n  I think this shows the strength of our democracy and also calls upon \nus, as we deliberate, to come up with the widest and most prudent \nchoice. For those who are following this debate, I would encourage them \nto turn to the report that has been put out by the committee, called \nthe Foreign--note it said ``Foreign''--Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, the amendments of 2007 to the act of 1978.\n  This report will go into detail about the deliberations of the \ncommittee, the amendments that were offered, the debate we had, and \nadditional views offered by colleagues. I commend it to their attention \nbecause it goes through the background in more detail. We are talking \nabout law, which can be quite technical, but we are also talking about \nthe consequences of the law which are quite important.\n  I sit on the Intelligence Committee. In that job, I have two \nresponsibilities: No. 1, to protect the American people and, No. 2, to \nprotect the Constitution of the United States. Implicit in that is the \nright of privacy and explicit in that is their civil liberties. The \nIntelligence Committee's job was to modernize FISA in a way that would \ndo both--protect the American people against predatory attacks and yet \nat the same time protect their constitutional rights, explicit and \nimplicit. What this legislation does is gives our intelligence \ncommunity the tools it needs to prevent, disrupt, detect, and derail \nterrorist plots while at the same time safeguarding the rights of \nAmerican citizens.\n  The FISA law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was created \nin 1978. Since then, technology has changed with great speed and \nsophistication. I have at my home in Baltimore a rotary phone. I bought \nit in 1977, when I remodeled my home in Fells Point. My nieces and \nnephews are regaled with laughter when they say: Oh, Aunt Barb, how \n'70s. But when we look at the rotary phones and a blackberry was \nsomething you ate with cereal, look how far we have come since 1978. \nTechnology has changed with speed and will continue to change with ever \nincreasing sophistication. At the same time we are facing constantly \nemerging, radical, and treacherous threats that demand a new reform of \nthe FISA law. Yet while technology and the nature of the threats have \nchanged, we have to be very clear that our democratic values and the \nConstitution have not. It is an imperative that this Congress uphold \nboth, our Constitution and our democratic values.\n  I believe our Intel Committee bill will do exactly that. It will make \nAmerica safer. It does this by giving the U.S. intelligence \nprofessionals the tools they need to safeguard and protect against \npredatory attacks. Six years ago, after September 11, terrorists \nremained--and continue to remain--on the hunt for U.S. vulnerabilities. \nThey use now disposable phone cards, laptop computers, and different e-\nmail addresses. They are always on the run, and they are always probing \nto find our vulnerabilities. The old FISA law made it impossible for \nthe U.S. intel community to engage in any kind of realistic techno hot \npursuit, unless we change the law. This bill enables intel \nprofessionals to keep pace with those who have this predatory intent. \nThey have to be able to monitor terrorists overseas with speed and \nflexibility.\n  This reform legislation empowers the intel community to detect, \ndisrupt, and prevent terrorist attacks. It does it, though, in a way \nthat protects the constitutional rights of American citizens, both in \nthe United States and when they travel overseas.\n  This bill protects their privacy in two important ways. First, it \nstrengthens the role of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. \nThe Intel Committee requires a FISA court to approve a warrant in order \nfor a U.S. person to be monitored in the United States. Let me repeat \nthat. If a U.S. person is at home in the United States, not only their \nhome address but on the physical territory of the United States, any \nsurveillance of them requires a warrant that is approved by the FISA \nCourt. This means the FISA Court determines whether the surveillance is \nlegal and necessary. The FISA Court must also judge the procedures \nused. The FISA Court, also looking at terrorists, takes a look at the \nprocedures used to target them to be sure there is no reverse targeting \nof U.S. citizens.\n  Second, this bill protects the privacy rights of all Americans, \nwhether or not they are in the United States. One can ask: What about \nthose U.S. citizens who are traveling overseas or who are actually \nliving overseas? What about people who are students? What about those \nconducting business? What about those on the cruise of a lifetime? Our \ngood colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, offered a terrific amendment \nwhich said: Your privacy rights as an American don't stop when you \nleave the borders of the United States. I am giving plain English. I am \nusing Barbara Mikulski language rather than committee language. In a \nnutshell, the Wyden amendment requires the FISA\n\n[[Page S15749]]\n\nCourt to approve any targeting of Americans overseas. The FISA Court \napproval is required in order to do this. It means your constitutional \nrights are based on your citizenship, not your geographic location. It \nis your right as a citizen that gives you the right of constitutional \nprotections, not what ZIP Code or area code you are in at any given \ntime. The Constitution travels with you wherever you go. This is \nabsolutely important. I believe the Wyden amendment sets out very clear \nlanguage about this.\n  Let's talk about the immunity for the telecommunications industry. \nOrdinarily I am skeptical of any giveaway to these corporations, \nwhether tax breaks or whatever. But this is one I do support. I \nunderstand there are a lot of concerns about that, and they have been \nraised by my colleagues in a very eloquent way. But let's examine what \nthe telecom community was asked to do, what legal assurances they were \ngiven and by whom, and the context in which they acted. Think about \nwhere we were on September 11. There had been an attack on the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon. The people of Flight 93 had given their \nlives in the most gallant kind of way, ostensibly to protect us against \na plane that was heading to the Capitol. All of us will tell you where \nwe were that day. Quite frankly, I was in a meeting with Senator \nDaschle when the Pentagon was hit. Sixty Marylanders died, and I \nthought I might die that day. I think there were a lot of other people \nhere who worried about that as well. We got through that day, and we \nstood on the Capitol steps and linked arms and said: God bless America. \nBut we were filled with fear and apprehension. We were concerned that \nother attacks were being planned, that another attack might even be \nimminent. We were worried about the Sears Tower in Chicago, the Golden \nGate bridge, about getting on planes, about getting on trains, about \nriding subways. We were even worried about going to football games.\n  I remember on the eve of the Army-Navy game, wondering what would \nthat mean with the best and brightest of our leadership, would even the \nArmy-Navy game be attacked? The U.S. Capitol at that same time was hit \nby an anthrax attack. Don't you remember the wonderful day when they \nsealed the Hart Building, when I was told that my office was a crime \nscene and a public health incident? My chief of staff, who was a new \nnursing mother, was filled with fear that she might have anthrax. I \nremember taking that little swab with the Navy medic who shook my hand \nand said: Good luck. Good luck? I wanted Cipro. I didn't want good \nluck. We were scared to death. People were snapping up gas masks and \nsurvival kits. You walk around this Capitol today, you see all of that.\n  So every single American was clear that they wanted to do anything to \nprevent or disrupt the next attack. We were all asked to do our part. \nIt was in this context, then, that the Bush administration went to the \ntelecom companies. These companies were asked to assist with a \ncommunications program to prevent further attacks. They were given \nletters of assurance that essentially said: The Attorney General of the \nUnited States, then John Ashcroft, deemed what they were being asked to \ndo legal and necessary. There was a subsequent letter where then White \nHouse counsel Alberto Gonzales also assured these companies that what \nthey were doing was legal and necessary. The correspondence declares \nthat these activities were also authorized by the President of the \nUnited States during this time of anxiety.\n  I know my colleagues would say the lawyers knew that and it was law \nschool and so on. But what would you have done if you headed up a \ncompany in the law department? Would you have fretted over the law or \nwould you look at how maybe you could cooperate, how maybe when you see \nthe Beamer family on TV and they said they were ready to roll and we \nall felt as though we were ready to roll, maybe if you were a telecom \ncompany, you were ready to roll too? Maybe you were rolling the dice. \nBut you did have a letter that assured you what was legal and necessary \nfrom the Attorney General, the White House, and that also had been \nauthorized by the President.\n  Within this context, the telecom companies thought what they were \ndoing was patriotic and legal. At a time when the United States felt it \nwas under imminent threat of an attack by a new kind of emerging \nthreat, they were given these assurances. That is why I support giving \nthem focused immunity, because they thought what they were doing was \npatriotic. Look at the context. At the same time they had these letters \nof assurance. What I do not support is what the Government additionally \nwanted, which was to give immunity to all persons connected to this, \nwhich means essentially the Bush officials, officials in the Bush \nadministration who either knowingly broke or sidestepped the law. That \nis not what the committee bill would do. What the committee bill does \nis focus only on the telecom community. It does not give immunity to \nthese Bush administration people.\n  When we look at this, I ask everybody to remember what this was. This \nbill also has a sunset of 6 years which I think we need. We are now in \nthe heat of war, and we must continue to reevaluate and improve this \nlaw when cool heads will prevail.\n  I know others want to speak. I will speak later on on this bill in a \nmore amplified and legal way. But I think the time has come to reform \nFISA, to make ourselves modern and contemporary and, at the same time, \nnot to punish those who thought they were working with us; last, but \nnot at all least, to protect the American people, both in terms of \ntheir safety but also their constitutional rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would first just express my \nappreciation for the thoughtfulness and eloquence of the Senator from \nMaryland. I think she has analyzed the matter very well and has called \nus to a compromise agreement that we should rally around and pass--an \nagreement that will protect our country and also protect our liberty; \nand that is, the agreement that came out of the Intelligence Committee \n13 to 2. It is the kind of agreement that reflects weeks, even months, \nof study, both of law and of technology.\n  Our Intelligence Committee, more than our Judiciary Committee, of \nwhich I am a member, was deeply involved in exactly what is being done \nin foreign intelligence and how it was being done. They studied it \ncarefully. There are a lot of members of the Intelligence Committee who \nwould not hesitate to object if they thought what was being done was in \nerror or certainly if it violated our Constitution. As a result, we \nhave moved forward with their bill.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate Judiciary Committee that had referral on \nthe matter has now come forward with additional ideas and proposals \nthat are not wise, in my view. We did not spend nearly as much time on \nthe matter. We are not nearly as involved and knowledgeable of the \ndetails of what has gone on as the Intel Committee is. I believe we \nshould not move forward on the Judiciary Committee bill. I opposed it \nin committee and remain in opposition to it.\n  With regard to this matter of immunity for our telecom companies that \ncooperated with the President, the Senator from Maryland has explained \nhow we got to this point. Mr. President, 9/11 occurred. We had a 9/11 \nCommission that said we did not have good intelligence, we did not \nshare the intelligence we had correctly, we were not analyzing properly \nthe intelligence we had, and we ought to do much better with regard to \nintelligence.\n  That was a uniform view, and the President authorized these programs, \nsome of which basically had been authorized for years and had never \nbeen considered to be improper in any way. Government officials met \nwith the telecom providers and asked for their assistance because the \nGovernment does not handle these communications systems. It is private \ncompanies that do. These companies were given a legal statement from \nthe Attorney General that said the President had declared their \ncooperation to be important to national security, that it was legal, \nand asked them to help.\n  Now, we discussed the basic principle in the Judiciary Committee at \nsome length, and I would like to go back to it. The basic principle \nthat has been embedded in our law for hundreds of years, from our \nBritish heritage, is that a citizen--when called upon by a law officer, \nthe gendarme, the Federal\n\n[[Page S15750]]\n\nofficial, or the State law officer who has apparent legal authority, to \nhelp in a situation involving a danger in the community--that citizen \nshould respond. OK. How have we dealt with that?\n  We are so committed to that fundamental principle that we have \nembedded in our common law the concept that if the Government official \nwas in error and should not have asked the citizen to do something--an \nexample would be where somebody is running from a building, and \napparently, a burglary has occurred. Several uniformed police officers \nare chasing the apparent burglar. They ask a citizen to help. The \ncitizen assaults, tackles, and holds the person he has been told to try \nto capture. He helps the police officers capture that person, and it \nturns out he is not the burglar, but an innocent person.\n  It is absolutely clear as a matter of Anglo-American law--this is not \nsome new deal; this is our heritage--that the citizen is not \nresponsible and cannot be held legally liable because the only question \nis: Was he or she responding to what appeared to be a legitimate \nrequest by the Government to assist them?\n  So that is the deal. That is what our telecom companies did. More \nthan that, they did not just respond to some police officer in uniform, \nthey did not just respond to a military officer or a National Guardsman \nor a Coast Guardsman to help, they responded to the Attorney General of \nthe United States of America requesting in a formal letter saying that \nhe was authorized by the President of the United States to ask for \ntheir assistance to preserve and protect the safety of American \ncitizens. They were given assurance that what they were being asked to \ndo by the Attorney General was lawful.\n  How could we possibly suggest that these companies now are going to \nbe rightfully sued for money damages? It is unthinkable we would allow \nthat to happen. It would contradict our fundamental principles as a \ncountry.\n  They say: Well, how do we know? We need to have a lawsuit. Well, we \nhave all kinds of telecom communications statutes that we have imposed \nover the years. Apparently, a court, in reviewing these matters, \ninterpreted one of these statutes in a way that rendered the procedures \nthen utilized under the request of the White House incorrect. The court \ndid not say that the program could not be done, but that it had to be \ndone using different techniques and different procedures. But the \npractical effect of that decision, it turns out, was to make it \nimpossible for those techniques to be continued to be used. You just \ncould not do it. As a practical matter, you could not continue to \nconduct the surveillance the Intelligence community said was required.\n  So the net result was we passed the Protect America Act this summer \nso the surveillance could continue because we, after great study, \nconcluded it was needed and basically a lawful procedure. We passed the \nProtect America Act that allowed it to continue.\n  So I want to go back to say, the fact there was an alteration in the \nway this process was ongoing does not mean American companies that \nagreed to be supportive of the Attorney General and the President of \nthe United States in a time of national emergency ought to have been \nsued. The person responsible if there was an error was the Government, \nnot the companies--the Government. And many of these matters are very \ncomplex.\n\n  If we now are going to place the burden on the CEO or the legal \ncounsel of every company in America to conduct their own independent \nresearch as to whether a request to participate in helping to defend \nAmerica is constitutional, and they now are required to go beyond a \ncertified letter from the Attorney General of the United States and \nhave their lawyers express their own opinion, we are at a point where \nwe are not going to get help in the future. It is just that simple.\n  So I think we ought to be careful about it. In fact, in the letter \nSenator Hatch has referred to, which is a Statement of Administration \nPolicy--what they call a SAP--issued today by the Executive Office of \nthe President, the President's advisors indicate they would recommend \nto the President that this important, critical legislation be vetoed if \ncertain objectionable matters are in it.\n  One of the matters they are concerned about is this question of \nliability. I would like to read from page 4 from that SAP that deals \nwith this issue. It sets out the question clearly. It says:\n\n       In contrast to the Senate Intelligence Committee bill, the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee substitute would not protect \n     electronic communication service providers who are alleged to \n     have assisted the Government with communications intelligence \n     activities in the aftermath of September 11th from \n     potentially debilitating lawsuits. Providing liability \n     protection to these companies is a just result. In its \n     Conference Report, the Senate Intelligence Committee \n     ``concluded that the providers . . . had a good faith basis \n     for responding to the requests for assistance they \n     received.''\n\n  That was a bipartisan vote, 13 to 2. Senator Rockefeller, the \nDemocratic chairman, and Senator Bond, the ranking Republican, and all \nmembers voted on that language.\n  I am still quoting now from this SAP:\n\n       The Committee further recognized that ``the Intelligence \n     Community cannot obtain the intelligence it needs without \n     assistance from these companies.''\n\n  In other words, we cannot get this intelligence without the \ncooperation of these companies, for heaven's sake. This is not a matter \nof dispute. This is an absolutely undeniable fact. It goes on to say:\n\n       Companies in the future may be less willing to assist the \n     Government if they face the threat of private lawsuits each \n     time they are alleged to have provided assistance. The Senate \n     Intelligence Committee concluded that: ``The possible \n     reduction in intelligence that might result from this delay \n     is simply unacceptable for the safety of our Nation.''\n\n  It is unacceptable. This SAP goes on to say:\n\n       Allowing continued litigation also risks the disclosure of \n     highly classified information regarding intelligence sources \n     and methods. In addition to providing an advantage to our \n     adversaries by revealing sources and methods during the \n     course of litigation, the potential disclosure of classified \n     information puts both the facilities and personnel of \n     electronic communication service providers and our country's \n     continued ability to protect our homeland at risk. It is \n     imperative that Congress provide liability protection to \n     those who cooperated with this country in its hour of need.\n\n  It goes on to say this:\n\n       The ramifications of the Judiciary Committee's decision to \n     afford no relief to private parties that cooperated in good \n     faith with the U.S. Government in the immediate aftermath of \n     the attacks of September 11 could extend well beyond the \n     particular issues and activities that have been of primary \n     interest and concern to the Committee. The Intelligence \n     Community, as well as law enforcement and homeland security \n     agencies, continue to rely on the voluntary cooperation and \n     assistance of private parties. A decision by the Senate to \n     abandon those who may have provided assistance after \n     September 11 will invariably be noted by those who may \n     someday be called upon again to help the Nation.\n\n  I think that is indisputable. So I do not know how we got to a place \nwhere we are supporting an effort by some to allow these companies, \nthese good corporate citizens, to be sued. I know it is being driven by \na lot of leftist, the ``blame America first'' folks who seek to undo \nevery single thing that is done to protect America from attack by \nforeign adversaries. They go through it. They attempt to find anything \nthat can be complained about, and we end up having a big debate on \nthese issues. But these matters have serious consequences.\n  So I would say to my colleagues, we did not deny moveon.org any right \nto be heard. They have been heard--moveon.org, that's the organization \nthat declared our fabulous General Petraeus to be a betrayer. But we \nhave listened to all of their complaints. We have listened to the ACLU. \nThe Intelligence Committee has spent months looking at it. The \nDepartment of Justice has been involved in it. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has been involved in it. I would submit we have found that \nthese surveillance procedures are not an extreme thing, that this is \nall consistent with the law of America and that it is legitimate in the \nway it was done. We ratified these procedures just this summer in the \nProtect America Act. I said a little earlier this morning that I know \nit is too much to expect that we would apologize to our security \nofficers and the President for saying--as some have done--that they \nviolated our Constitution to do these procedures because, after all \nthis debate and\n\n[[Page S15751]]\n\neffort, we have now passed laws, including the Protect America Act, \nthat allows them to continue. If they are so horrible, why did we \noverwhelmingly vote to allow them to continue? I would say there was \nnothing fundamentally wrong with what was being done to begin with. \nThis was necessary and legitimate.\n\n  One more thought I wish to share on the basic question of \nsurveillance abroad is this: American citizens abroad are protected by \na rather strong Presidential order--Executive Order 12333--that \nprotects them from surveillance without probable cause having been \nshown. It is a pretty strong order. Why have we never had the Supreme \nCourt, which has ruled on surveillance in the United States, declare \nits power on the issue of surveillance abroad? Think about this: Can \nthe Supreme Court--can a Federal judge in America approve a \nsurveillance, electronic surveillance in a foreign country of an \nAmerican citizen? The answer is, no, because they don't have \njurisdiction. Federal judges don't have jurisdiction in France or \nRussia or Afghanistan. If you don't have jurisdiction to authorize a \nsurveillance, you don't have jurisdiction to issue warrants or to \nassert jurisdiction at all, and that is the way it has always been \ninterpreted. But because people were concerned about American citizens \nabroad, President Reagan issued an Executive order that controls those \nsituations and that is being followed today.\n  So I wish to say we need to be careful about our thought processes as \nwe go forward. There has never, ever been any doubt that an American \nintelligence operative can surveil foreign persons abroad whom they \nbelieve may pose a threat to the United States or may possess \ninformation valuable to the United States. That has never been in \ndoubt.\n  So as we go through with this, I hope we will listen to the work of \nthe Intelligence Committee. I think, for the most part, it is a pretty \ngood bill. Their bill is something I can support. It has some things in \nit I don't believe are necessary that put restrictions on our efforts \nto make sure our officials don't overreach. We can create safeguards in \na bipartisan way, and I hope we will. But in truth, we need to pass \nlegislation soon because the current bill, the Protect America Act, \nexpires in February.\n  I went out a few weeks ago to the National Security Agency and got a \nfull briefing, as a number of Senators have, on what is being done \nthere. I was so proud of our personnel. These are fabulous Americans. \nThe suggestions that have been made by some that they are sitting out \nthere trying to listen in on somebody's private conversation about \nChristmas from Paris or Afghanistan is beyond reality. They are out \nthere trying to protect America. They are looking to see if they have \nany information that they can legally pick up that would indicate an \nattack may be imminent or that people are plotting to attack the United \nStates.\n  So I thank the Chair. I hope we will move forward with this \nlegislation based on the Intel bill and that we will reject efforts to \ndeny liability protection to Americans who serve our country. Also, I \nhope we will reject the Wyden language in the Intel bill because I \nthink it goes far too far in constricting the ability of our \nintelligence personnel to do their job, and it is not legally or \nconstitutionally required.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wish to take this time to talk a \nlittle bit about the FISA bill we are considering today. I heard my \nfriend from Alabama talk about the work that is being done at the \nNational Security Agency. I have also taken the opportunity to visit \nwith NSA to see firsthand the work they are doing. It wasn't my first \nvisit. NSA, as my colleagues know, is located in Maryland. I have been \nthere on numerous occasions. I had an opportunity to observe the manner \nin which our security intelligence agencies operate, and I must tell my \ncolleagues these men and women are dedicated public servants doing a \ngreat job on behalf of their country and trying to get it done right. \nThey are trying to do it the way it is supposed to be done and \ncomplying with laws, but they need the right legal basis, and it is our \nresponsibility in Congress to get the statutes right to allow them to \nobtain the information they need in order to keep us safe. There is a \nright way of doing it. Congress needs to get this bill done right.\n  We passed this bill in a hurry in August. We didn't have an \nopportunity at that time to review the classified information about the \nadvice that was given in regard to the collection of data. Since that \ntime, some of us have had that opportunity. I regret all of us have not \nhad that opportunity. I have taken advantage of that opportunity as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, and I have seen the information. I \nhave seen the opinions of counsel. I have seen the information the \ntelecommunications companies operated under. I have had a chance to \nreview that information. It makes it a lot easier for me now to \nevaluate what we should do.\n  I will tell my colleagues I wish to get this bill done. I think it is \nimportant that our intelligence community have the legal authority to \nbe able to intercept communications that are foreign to foreign. That \nwas the basic reason why they asked for us to modify the FISA law, \nbecause technology changed and we had a lot of foreign-to-foreign \ncommunications. But it was through facilities that were located within \nthe jurisdiction of the United States; therefore, the FISA laws \napplied. The administration thought originally they didn't apply, but \nthen the court said: Hey, wait a minute. Read the statute. It does \napply. You have to come to Congress and get it done right. That is why \nthey came to us. They wouldn't have come to us if the courts didn't \ndemand they come to us. Now it is our responsibility to get the statute \nright.\n  I wish to thank Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond for the work \nthey did in the Intelligence Committee. I serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee. I can tell my colleagues, Senator Leahy, Senator Specter, \nand every member of our committee has taken our responsibility very \nseriously to try to understand the circumstances. But I can tell my \ncolleagues it is important we modify the bill that has come out of the \nIntelligence Committee. I call my colleagues' attention to the work of \nthe Judiciary Committee because we wanted to make sure the bill we \nrecommended gives the intelligence community the tools they need, \nparticularly as it relates to foreign-to-foreign communications but \nalso protects the constitutional rights of the citizens of our own \ncountry, and it will be defensible before our courts. That is our \nresponsibility. I think we got it right.\n  So we are going to see some differences between these two bills, \nbesides the big difference which is the immunity. I am going to get to \nthe retroactive immunity in a moment. However, there are other \ndifferences which are very important, including exclusivity, to make it \nclear this statute controls so the administration can't say: Well, we \nhave additional authority and we are going to do it our way, regardless \nof what the Congress says. That is an important provision. It is in the \nSenate bill. We need to make sure it is in the final bill that is sent \nto the President.\n  There are other provisions that are important that are in the Senate \nbill but not in the House bill: Changes in minimization rules; changes \nin how--when we target an American overseas--we do, in fact, get \nappropriate court authorization to do it. I thank Senator Whitehouse \nfor his contributions in that regard. These might be technical changes, \nbut they are important to make sure they get into the bill that is \nfinally passed and sent to the President.\n  Let me talk for a moment, if I might, about the retroactive immunity \nbecause there has been a lot of conversation about retroactive \nimmunity. I oppose retroactive immunity. I think it is the wrong way to \nhelp the carriers. Retroactive immunity, to me, violates our \nresponsibility to respect each branch of Government. I want the courts \nto be able to look at what the executive branch is doing. I want the \ncourts to protect individual rights. I think that when we start looking \nat retroactive immunity, we start violating the basic separation of \npowers.\n  I must tell my colleagues that the telecommunications carriers that \ncooperated with the Government, believing that the authority was there \nand\n\n[[Page S15752]]\n\noperating in good faith, are entitled to relief. But they shouldn't be \ngiven retroactive immunity.\n  There are other suggestions which have been made. I hope my \ncolleagues will listen to some of the amendments that are being \noffered. Senator Specter has an amendment that I call to the attention \nof my colleagues. Because if you believe that Government is \nresponsible--and I have heard many of my colleagues say this--that if \nthe Government was wrong, let them be sued and held accountable. That \nis exactly what Senator Specter's amendment does. It substitutes the \nGovernment for the carriers in the same position that the carriers \nwould be so we can get the protection of the courts and the carriers \nget the protection they need, and the Government can control the case \nfor national security purposes. It seems to be a compromise that if, in \nfact, the carriers were operating in good faith, then let the \nGovernment be there to take its responsibility in this matter.\n  I call my colleagues' attention to another amendment offered by \nSenator Feinstein. I think it is a good amendment on this issue. It may \nbe able to help us in trying to find common ground. Her amendment says: \nLook, the bill we passed that is supported by the Intelligence \nCommittee--the bill we passed last August, now amended by the \nIntelligence Committee, would say: OK, we are going to grant \nretroactive immunity, and guess who is going to make the decision as to \nwhether the carrier operated in good faith according to law. It is \ngoing to be the Attorney General, the administration. Well, to me, that \ndoesn't sound quite objective. After all, we know it was the Attorney \nGeneral who gave the advice. So at least let's have an objective \nreview. The Feinstein amendment says: Let the FISA Court, which was set \nup for this purpose and which has the expertise in this area, make the \njudgment as to whether the carriers followed the law in good faith. \nBecause I tell my colleagues, if they did, I believe they are entitled \nto relief. I do. But I don't think we should strip the court of its \njurisdiction in solving that problem. I think there are better ways to \ndo it. I urge my colleagues to look at the work of the Judiciary \nCommittee because I think they will find some help in a product that \nwill be submitted vis-a-vis amendments as we consider this legislation.\n  I wish to mention one additional item I am going to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues, and that is an amendment I offered in the \nJudiciary Committee that was approved and one I hope will have \nbipartisan support: A 4-year sunset on the legislation. Why do I want \nto see this sunset in 4 years? The Intelligence bill has 6 years. I \nwant the next administration to focus on this issue. I want them to \ncome to Congress and cooperate with us on how they are using this \npower. It is interesting we have gotten tremendous cooperation, since \nAugust, from the administration because they knew they had to come back \nhere in February, so we got their cooperation. We got the information \nwe needed. But I don't know if we are going to see any information from \nthe next administration. When they know they have the authority during \nthe entire time, they don't have to come back to us.\n  So I hope this 4-year sunset provision will be agreed to by all of \nus, so this Congress can exercise its appropriate oversight as to how \nthis administration and the next administration use this extraordinary \npower.\n  FISA is extraordinary power. These are secret courts. These aren't \ncourts that issue written opinions that people can attend. These are \nsecret courts, in order to protect the security of America but also the \nrights of the people of our Nation. They should at least have the \nability for Congress to exercise appropriate oversight responsibility. \nA 4-year sunset will give us that opportunity in the next \nadministration, and I hope that will be improved.\n  So this is an important bill. This is a bill I hope will reach the \nPresident's desk and will be signed into law. But let's make sure we \nget it right. Let's make sure it is legislation we are proud of to \nprotect the safety of the people of America and our civil liberties and \nlegislation that can withstand the review of our courts as to \nconstitutionality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this morning I laid out the reasons \nwhy I opposed cloture on the motion to proceed. Now I would like to \ndescribe in more detail the reasons that the Senate should be \nconsidering the Judiciary bill rather than the Intelligence Committee \nbill. And I will lay out again why I strongly oppose the immunity \nprovision in the Intelligence Committee bill.\n  There are a number of similarities between the bills reported by the \nIntelligence and Judiciary Committees. Their basic structure is the \nsame. Both bills authorize the Government to conduct surveillance of \nindividuals reasonably believed to be overseas without court approval \nfor individual warrants. Both bills authorize the Government to develop \nand implement procedures to govern this new type of surveillance, and \nprovide the procedures to the FISA Court for review after they have \ngone into effect.\n  But in critical ways, the bills take different approaches. The \nJudiciary bill contains a number of important changes to improve court \noversight of these broad new executive branch authorities, and to \nprotect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.\n  Let me be clear: The differences between these two bills have nothing \nto do with our ability to combat terrorism. They have everything to do \nwith ensuring that the executive branch adheres to the rule of law and \ndoesn't unnecessarily listen in on the private communications of \nAmericans.\n  This debate is about whether the court should have an independent \noversight role, and what protections should apply to the communications \nof Americans that get swept up in these broad new surveillance powers.\n  If you believe that courts should have a meaningful oversight role \nwith respect to Government surveillance, then you should support the \nJudiciary bill. And if you believe that Congress should try to limit \nthe number of communications of Americans here at home that will be \nswept up in a broad new surveillance program that is supposed to be \nfocused on foreigners overseas, then you should support the Judiciary \nbill.\n  That said, the Judiciary bill is not perfect. More still needs to be \ndone to protect the privacy of Americans. But that is why it should be \nsuch an easy decision to support the Judiciary bill as a starting \npoint.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that the process by which the \nJudiciary Committee considered, drafted, amended and reported out its \nbill was an open one, allowing outside experts and the public at large \nthe opportunity to review and comment. With regard to legislation so \ndirectly connected to the constitutional rights of Americans, the \nresults of this open process should be accorded great weight, \nespecially in light of the Judiciary Commiittee's unique role and \nexpertise in protecting those rights.\n  So what are the differences between the two bills?\n  First, the Judiciary bill gives the secret FISA court more authority \nto operate as an independent check on the executive branch.\n  One provision in the Judiciary bill fixes an enormous problem with \nthe Intelligence Committee bill--the complete lack of incentives for \nthe Government to do what the bill tells it to do, which is target \npeople overseas rather than people here in America. The Judiciary bill \nsolves this problem by limiting the use of information concerning \nAmericans when that information is obtained through procedures the FISA \nCourt ultimately finds are not reasonably designed to target persons \noverseas.\n  The Judiciary bill states that if the court determines that the \nGovernment has been using unlawful procedures, then its use of that \ninformation is limited--in exactly the same way that it is limited \nunder FISA today if the Government starts surveillance in an emergency \nand is later turned down for a court order. But the new provision in \nthe Judiciary bill is more flexible: It gives the court the option to \nallow the use of the information the Government collected the first \ntime around, depending on the circumstances.\n  Another provision of the Judiciary bill ensures that the FISA Court \nhas the authority to oversee compliance with minimization procedures.\n\n[[Page S15753]]\n\n  Minimization procedures have been held up as the primary protection \nfor the privacy of Americans whose communications get swept up in this \nnew surveillance authority.\n\n  I don't think current minimization procedures are strong enough to do \nthe job. But to the extent that minimization can help protect \nAmericans' privacy, its implementation needs to be overseen by the \ncourt. That means giving the court the authority to review whether the \nGovernment is complying with minimization rules and to ask for the \ninformation it needs to make that assessment. Without this provision \nfrom the Judiciary bill, the Government's dissemination and use of \ninformation on innocent, law-abiding Americans will occur without any \nchecks and balances whatsoever. Once again, ``trust us'' will have to \ndo. I believe in this case, as in so many others, ``trust us'' is not \nenough.\n  The Judiciary bill furthers other types of oversight, as well. It \nrequires relevant inspectors general to conduct an audit of the \nPresident's illegal wiretapping program, which is long overdue.\n  And it improves congressional access to FISA Court orders. The \nIntelligence Committee bill requires that Congress be provided with \norders, decisions and opinions of the FISA Court that include \nsignificant interpretations of law within 45 days after they are \nissued. That is good as far as it goes, but the Judiciary bill adds \nthat Congress should be provided with pleadings associated with \nopinions that contain significant interpretations of law. These \npleadings may be critical to understanding the reasoning behind any \nparticular interpretation as well as how the Government interprets and \nseeks to implement the law. It also requires that significant \ninterpretations of law not previously provided to Congress over the \npast 5 years be provided.\n  The Judiciary bill also does a better job of protecting Americans \nfrom widespread warrantless wiretapping.\n  First, it protects against reverse targeting. It ensures that if the \nGovernment is wiretapping a foreigner overseas in order to collect the \ncommunications of the American with whom that foreign target is \ncommunicating, it has to get a court order on the American. This is \nvery reasonable. Specifically, the Judiciary bill says that the \nGovernment needs an individualized court order when a significant \npurpose of its surveillance is listening to an American at home. The \nDNI himself said that reverse targeting violates the Fourth Amendment; \nthis provision simply codifies that principle. The administration \ncontinues to oppose this provision, and I have a simple question for \nit: ``Why?'' Why is it opposed to a provision that prohibits a practice \nthat its own Director of National Intelligence says is \nunconstitutional?\n  The Judiciary bill also prohibits bulk collection--that is, the \nsweeping up of all communications between the United States and \noverseas. The DNI said in public testimony that this type of massive \nbulk collection would be permitted by the Protect America Act. But he \nhas also said that what the Government is seeking to do with these \nauthorities is something very different. It is ``surgical. A telephone \nnumber is surgical. So, if you know that number, you can select it \nout.'' If the DNI has said it doesn't even need broader authorities, we \nshould certainly should not be providing them.\n  All this modest provision does is hold the DNI to his word. It \nensures that the Government has some foreign intelligence interest in \nindividual targets, and is not just vacuuming up every last \ncommunication between Americans and their friends and business \ncolleagues overseas. Targets do not need to be known or named \nindividuals; they can be anonymous phone numbers, which is how the DNI \nhas described how the Government collects. And the Government does not \nhave to identify or explain its interest in the targets to the FISA \nCourt; it merely has to make a general certification that individual \ntargets exist. Again, why does the administration oppose this \nprovision? I have yet to hear a convincing answer.\n  The Judiciary bill also has a sunset of 4 years rather than 6 years, \nensuring that Congress will reevaluate this law before the end of the \nnext Presidential administration. And, critically, it contains a strong \nstatement that Congress intends for FISA to be the exclusive means by \nwhich foreign intelligence surveillance is conducted. It closes \npurported statutory loopholes that the Justice Department relied on to \nmake its tortured arguments that the congressional authorization for \nuse of force against al-Qaida somehow authorized the President's \nillegal wiretapping program. The Judiciary bill makes clear, once and \nfor all, that the President must follow the law.\n\n  Madam President, the Judiciary bill also does not contain the \nprovision in the Intelligence Committee bill granting automatic, \nretroactive immunity to companies that allegedly cooperated with the \nPresident's illegal NSA wiretapping program. I supported an amendment \nto strike the immunity provision in the Intelligence Committee when it \nwas offered by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson--I offered an \namendment to strike the immunity provision in the Judiciary Committee--\nand I will cosponsor Senator Dodd's amendment to strike the immunity \nprovision on the Senate floor. The immunity provision does not belong \nin this bill.\n  Granting immunity, first of all, is unnecessary. Current law already \nspecifically provides immunity from lawsuits for companies that \ncooperate with the Government's request for assistance, as long as they \nreceive either a court order or a certification from the Attorney \nGeneral that no court order is needed and the request meets all \nstatutory requirements. This current FISA immunity provision, contained \nin 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511, already protects companies that act at the \nrequest of the Government, while also protecting the privacy of \nAmericans' communications by assuring that immunity is granted only if \nthe law is followed.\n  Some supporters of immunity argue that companies should not be \npenalized for relying in good faith on the legality of a request from \nthe executive branch. This argument ignores the history of FISA. \nPrivate companies have a long history of receiving requests for \nassistance from the Government, and they worked with Congress when FISA \nwas first enacted to devise a law that tells them exactly which \nGovernment requests they should honor. They also have experienced, \nwell-trained lawyers to examine the written requests they receive from \nthe Government and determine whether those requests comply with the \nclear requirements of the law or not.\n  The idea that telephone companies could not have foreseen that the \nGovernment might overstep the law makes no sense. FISA's requirement of \na court order or a valid certification was designed precisely to \nrespond to Government abuses that took place in the 1960s and 1970s, \nand to prevent such abuses from occurring in the future.\n  The Judiciary Committee heard testimony from Mort Halperin, a former \nNixon administration official who had himself been the subject of a \nwarrantless wiretap, and was involved in drafting FISA in the 1970s. He \ntestified that before FISA:\n\n       Government communication with the telephone company . . . \n     could not have been more casual. A designated official of the \n     FBI called a designated official of [the company] and passed \n     on a phone number. Within minutes all of the calls from that \n     number were being routed to the local FBI field office and \n     monitored.\n\n  Not surprisingly, this casual, ad hoc system failed to protect \nAmericans' privacy; the abuses that took place are well documented and \nquite shocking. FISA was supposed to give everyone involved a level of \ncertainty about what was permitted and what was not. And the provision \nspecifying the circumstances under which a Government request could be \nhonored, in particular, was supposed to play a significant role in \nensuring that certainty. AT, which was the only telephone company in \nexistence at the time, was at the table when this provision was \ndrafted. As Halperin described it in his testimony, the company:\n\n     received the clarity that it sought and deserved. The rule, \n     spelled out clearly in several places in the legislation and \n     well understood by all, was this: If [the phone company] \n     received a copy of a warrant or a certification under the \n     statute, it was required to cooperate. If it did not receive \n     authorization by means outlined in the statute, it was to \n     refuse to cooperate and was to be subjected to State and \n     Federal civil and criminal penalties for unlawful acquisition \n     of electronic communications.\n\n\n[[Page S15754]]\n\n\n  This is the history. This is why we have the FISA statute. This is \nthe whole point.\n  This history should give all of us pause as we consider the immunity \nprovision in this bill. Granting companies that allegedly cooperated \nwith an illegal program this new form of automatic, retroactive \nimmunity undermines the law that has been on the books for decades--a \nlaw that was designed to prevent exactly the type of actions that \nallegedly occurred here. Perhaps more importantly, it will undermine \nany new laws that we pass to govern Government surveillance.\n  If we want companies to follow the law in the future, it sends a \nterrible message, and sets a terrible precedent, to grant a new form of \nretroactive, blanket immunity for alleged cooperation with an illegal \nprogram. We not only want companies to follow the law, we want the \nGovernment to follow the law. If we don't give the companies a solid \nbasis for refusing to respond to a Government request that falls short \nof statutory requirements, we take away the incentive for the \nGovernment to follow the law. It would be irresponsible for Congress to \nallow this to happen.\n  It is time for Congress to state clearly and unequivocally: ``When we \npass a law, we mean what we say and we expect the law to be followed.'' \nBut if we grant immunity to companies that may have broken the law, the \nmessage we send will be quite the opposite. We will be effectively \nmaking compliance with the law optional. We will be saying: ``If a high \nGovernment official asks you to ignore the law, go ahead. Congress can \nalways change the law retroactively so you won't pay any penalty for \nyour lawbreaking.'' I ask my colleagues to think long and hard about \nthis as they consider this amendment. Is that the message that we \nreally want to send?\n  This retroactive immunity provision presents another serious problem.\n  It could very well prevent the courts from ruling on the \nadministration's warrantless wiretapping program. That may explain why \nthe administration is pushing so hard for this part of the bill. This \nprogram is one of the worst abuses of executive power in our Nation's \nhistory, and the courts should be able to rule on it once and for all. \nFor Congress to step in and likely wipe out the pending court cases, \nwhen the administration has stonewalled congressional oversight efforts \nfor so long, would be an unacceptable capitulation to an administration \nthat thinks it is above the law.\n  Finally, I must emphasize that a vote to strike immunity is not a \nvote to hold telephone companies liable. Rather, it is a vote to let \nthe courts decide whether the existing immunity provisions apply. If \ntelephone companies received a directive from the Government and \ncomplied with well-established law, the courts will find that they are \nentitled to immunity and these cases will be dismissed. But if they \nfailed to follow the law that applied specifically to them--a law they \nhelped create and a law that their lawyers knew inside and out--we will \nhave done American citizens a grave injustice by saying that sometimes \nit is just plain OK to break the law.\n  In other words, Congress should not prejudge the guilt or innocence \nof the companies, especially without knowing the facts. Unfortunately, \nmost of the Members of this Chamber have not had access to those facts. \nThe members of only two committees have had the opportunity to study \nwhat happened. I happen to sit on both committees, and after seeing all \nthe evidence, my firm view is we should leave this to the courts to \ndecide under existing law. But it is wrong for the administration to \nask my colleagues who do not serve on these committees to vote for \nimmunity. They are effectively being asked to grant immunity without \nbeing told for what they are granting immunity. This is fundamentally \nunfair.\n  The Senate can stand up for the rule of law and let the courts handle \nthese cases as they see fit, or it can decide to change the rules in \nthe middle of the game and block accountability for possible past law \nbreaking. Voting to preserve retroactive immunity means they are \nblessing the behavior of the administration and the companies that \nallegedly cooperated with it. I urge my colleagues not to take that \nstep.\n  Before I close, I wish to respond briefly to the comments made by the \nvice chair of the Intelligence Committee concerning the President's so-\ncalled inherent constitutional power to order surveillance. Relying on \na nonbinding statement made in passing in a FISA Court of Review \ndecision on another issue and a 1980 circuit court case that addresses \nsurveillance before FISA was passed, the vice chairman asserts that the \nPresident has inherent constitutional authority to wiretap without a \ncourt order.\n  I am afraid to say that argument is an invitation to lawlessness. \nWhat he basically said is that because in his view the President has \nwiretapping authority that cannot be limited by statute, a company that \ncomplies with his request for assistance cannot be held accountable, no \nmatter how unreasonable the request was. If that is the case, then \nCongress may as well pack up and go home because the laws we pass don't \nmatter.\n  Congress has spoken very clearly in FISA and limited Presidential \npower to conduct surveillance. Congress had the authority to take this \naction, and the courts have never upheld an assertion of Presidential \npower over statutory restriction in a case where Congress has acted \nwithin its authority. In this case, the President must follow the law \nthat Congress passes, and so should the telecommunications companies.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Forty-one minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent to yield my remaining time to \nSenator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before my colleague leaves, I thank my \ncolleague Senator Feingold for not only his statements today but for \nspeaking eloquently about this issue, with which he has been deeply \ninvolved with for a long time. Drawing on his service on both the \nIntelligence and Judiciary Committees, he eloquently pointed out that \nthese provisions are designed to guarantee exactly what FISA intended \nto provide the security of our country and the sanctity of our rights, \nsimultaneously.\n  And the idea that these companies were acting out of patriotism and \nnaive to the provisions of the law when the very same companies were \ninvolved in crafting that law 30 years ago says volumes. I thank \nSenator Feingold immensely for his work.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor his kind words, and I thank him for his important leadership on \nthis issue. What he is doing today is extremely helpful to the \npreservation of the rule of law in this country.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the time is such, I understand from the \nSenator, that I may deliver a few remarks to the Senate; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed under cloture. The \nSenate is operating under cloture.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today because of the timely and \ncritical importance of the issue before us. It is absolutely vital that \nwe reform FISA, and we must do so quickly because the Protect America \nAct passed in August to close a dangerous intelligence gap is set to \nexpire shortly. We must keep this gap closed, and we must do it in a \nway that protects civil liberties, protects telecommunications \ncompanies from unnecessary and costly lawsuits, and ensures that our \nhard-working and dedicated intelligence professionals have the tools \nthey need to protect the Nation.\n  I have been privileged these 29 years I have been in the Senate to \nrepresent the Commonwealth of Virginia in which largely the \nintelligence community and the professionals therein have their base of \noperations. I have had the privilege of knowing these people. Stop to \nthink: They have children in the schools in which our children are in, \nthey attend the churches, they live in the communities. It has been my \nprivilege to get to know many of them throughout the course of my \ncareer in the Senate and some 5 years plus previous that I had in the \nDepartment of Defense where I worked with these professionals. They are \namong America's finest individuals. They are dedicated. They take \nrisks, great risks, so often when they are abroad. Indeed, we have\n\n[[Page S15755]]\n\nlost them at home right at the gateway to the entrance of the Central \nIntelligence Agency.\n  I was somewhat discouraged recently to hear broad accusations against \nthe intelligence community, a lack of confidence that certain \nindividuals in the Congress profess publicly to have. I assure them, \nbased on my rather lengthy career and the good fortune to have worked \nwith these professionals for so many years, I rank them among America's \nfinest and most dedicated. It has been my privilege to take this floor \nmany times in the past quarter century to speak on their behalf and to \nadvocate causes which I think were in the best interests of the United \nStates and which could, in many ways, affect their careers.\n  So I do so again today because reforming FISA has not been an easy \nprocess. I thank Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond for the \nwork they have done to garner bipartisan support for the Senate \nIntelligence Committee bill, the FISA Amendments Act.\n  The committee members and staff have worked together for many months \nto produce this responsible bipartisan legislation that strikes the \nright balance between civil liberties and foreign surveillance. All of \nthe parties involved had to make compromises, but the 13-to-2--I \nrepeat, 13-to-2--vote in the committee on which I am privileged to \nserve in favor of this bill shows that the bill will protect America's \nprivate civil liberties without unnecessarily hindering the ability of \nour intelligence professionals to intercept terrorist communications.\n  In addition to bipartisan congressional support, the FISA Amendments \nAct has, after consultation, the support of Admiral McConnell, the \nDirector of National Intelligence. I have known this fine public \nservant for many years. When I was privileged to serve as Secretary of \nthe Navy, he was on the staff of the Navy at that time. As a junior \nofficer, he would often brief me in my capacity as Secretary early in \nthe morning. I have enjoyed our friendship through the years and had \nthe privilege to introduce him to the Senate for purposes of \nconfirmation on several occasions.\n  History has ranked and will continue to rank Admiral McConnell among \nthe foremost of those who stepped forward in my time for public \nservice.\n  As I say, I have deep admiration and respect for Admiral McConnell's \ncontinued public service to the Nation and for the work of thousands of \ndedicated intelligence community professionals that he leads. His \nefforts to work with the Congress to formulate this bipartisan and \ncomplicated set of solutions to this serious national security issue \nare to be commended.\n  The committee was uniquely positioned to weigh and assess the many \nhighly classified aspects of our foreign intelligence surveillance \noperations and to discuss and debate those sensitive issues before we \ndrafted this legislation. The result is a bill that has the support of \nthose valued public servants trusted to follow the law and a bill that \nwill protect national security and will protect America's privacy.\n  The bill allows the intelligence community, through a joint \ncertification by the Attorney General of the United States and the \nDirector of National Intelligence, to target the communications of \nforeign overseas targets without the necessity of the FISA Court \napproval. This provides the speed and the agility the intelligence \ncommunity needs--I emphasize ``the speed and the agility''--and keeps \nthe foreign intelligence targets outside the purview of the FISA Court, \nwhich was the original intention of Congress when it drafted the FISA \nbill in 1978.\n  The FISA amendments also ensure the protection of America's civil \nliberties by providing that acquisition may only be conducted in \naccordance with targeting and minimization procedures adopted by the \nAttorney General of the United States and reviewed by the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court. Targeting must be consistent with the \nfourth amendment, and reverse targeting is specifically prohibited. \nThere is also enhanced oversight by Congress, the Attorney General, the \nDirector of National Intelligence, and inspectors general.\n  One of the most important provisions in this bill is the retroactive \ncarrier liability protection for those telecommunications carriers \nalleged to have assisted the Government with the terrorist surveillance \nprogram, known as TSP. While I believe that TSP was legal, essential, \nand contributed to preventing further terrorist attacks against our \nhomeland, others may disagree.\n  There is no doubt, however, that the carriers that have participated \nin the program relied upon our Government's assurances that their \nactions were legal and in the best interests of the security of the \nUnited States of America.\n  These companies deserve and must be protected from costly and \ndamaging lawsuits. The boards of directors have a fundamental \nobligation, as they do in all public corporations, to shareholders of \nthese publicly owned institutions. Those who ask why the companies need \nsuch protection if they did not do anything illegal do not grasp the \npoint that the Government's invocation of state secrets precludes \ncompanies from providing a court of law with any factual evidence \nconfirming or denying their involvement in the program. That is to \nprevent sources and method. Sources and methods are the very heart of \nAmerica's intelligence operations, as they are the world over. Some \ncompanies facing lawsuits, even if they never participated in the \nprogram, can likewise not defend themselves.\n  Some Senators have suggested Government substitution or \nindemnification of these companies, as the ones who did work in the \nprogram, as an alternate to the retroactive liability language in the \nbill. These are not suitable alternatives, in my judgment, for the \ncompanies or the intelligence community.\n  It is a recognized fact that lawsuits are most often extremely costly \nto a company in terms of damage to the business reputation and stock \nvaluation could fluctuate. Even if a company ultimately prevails, they \nwill suffer not only money damages possibly, costs possibly, in all \nprobability even though there may be Government reimbursement, but \ndamage which is incalculable in amount to their reputation and standing \nin their community. Again, if the Government pays the legal bill, that \nwill not erase other injurious consequences that come about as a result \nof court proceedings. I myself engaged in the practice of law before I \nentered public service many years ago, and not much has changed. \nFurther, the Government being substituted as the defendant in a trial \nopens evidentiary problems regarding, again, sources and methods, which \nis the vital ingredient of all our intelligence collecting processes. \nIndividuals who believe the Government violated their civil liberties \ncan pursue legal action against the Government--the United States \nGovernment--and the FISA Amendments Act does nothing to limit the legal \nrecourse.\n\n  The bottom line, companies that participate in this program do so to \nhelp America protect its freedom and the safety, individually and \ncollectively, of our citizens. Without this retroactive liability \nprovision, I believe companies will no longer, and understandably, \nvoluntarily participate in this program. The consequence of the loss of \nthose companies stepping up--solely in the security interests of the \nUnited States, solely in the interests of protecting our citizens--to \noffer their services will result in irreparable damage to our \ncollection of vital intelligence. It is as simple as that.\n  It is for these reasons I urge my colleagues to support the \nIntelligence-Committee-passed FISA Amendments Act and grant the men and \nwomen of the intelligence community the tools they need to protect the \ncountry and, indeed, the respect and admiration they deserve.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, first of all, I know others may want to \nspeak as well, but let me take a few minutes, if I can, to share with \nmy colleagues some of the background and information concerning my \nconcern with Title II of this legislation.\n  I certainly agree with my friend and colleague from Virginia, the \nformer chairman of the Armed Services Committee, that it is critically \nimportant we modernize FISA. The 30-year-old piece of legislation has \nserved our country well, striking a balance between acquiring the \nintelligence we\n\n[[Page S15756]]\n\nneed to protect our country and protecting us against the erosion of \nour rights. My main concern with the proposal, as many know, is Title \nII, the retroactive immunity provision. I am deeply concerned about the \nprecedent it would set.\n  The telecoms' 5-year-old program only became public information \nbecause there was a whistleblower, Madam President, a gentleman by the \nname of Mark Klein, who was an employee of AT for more than 20 years. \nHe was really responsible for us being aware of this program. Had it \nnot been for Mark Klein stepping up, this story might have remained \nsecret for years and years, causing further erosion of our rights. Mark \nKlein and others were principally responsible for coming forward and \nexpressing their deep concerns.\n  I think it is important for my colleagues in this body to understand \nprecisely what these telecom communities are doing at the behest of the \nBush administration. Mark Klein was courageous enough to blow the \nwhistle on one such program at AT's facility at 611 Folsom Street in \nSan Francisco. When the government's warrantless surveillance program \ncame to light in December of 2005, Mr. Klein realized he had \nunwittingly aided and abetted an extensive, untargeted spying program \nthat may have violated the civil liberties of millions of Americans. In \nearly 2006, Mr. Klein went public with evidence of this program, \nproviding over 100 pages of authenticated schematic diagrams and tables \ndetailing how AT diverted its customers' communications to a room \ncontrolled by the NSA, with sophisticated equipment inside capable of \nanalyzing millions of customers' Internet activities and e-mails in \nreal time. The following are Mr. Klein's own words as to what he saw.\n\n       For 5 years, the Bush administration's National Security \n     Agency, with the help of the country's largest \n     telecommunication companies, has been collecting your e-mail, \n     accumulating information on your web browser, and gathering \n     details on your Internet activity, all without warrants and \n     in violation of the United States constitution and several \n     Federal statutes and State laws. Even after the program was \n     exposed by The New York Times in December of 2005, the \n     President and other government officials consistently \n     defended the NSA's activities, insisting that the NSA only \n     collects communications into or from the United States where \n     one party to the communication is someone they believe to be \n     a member of al-Qaida or an associated terrorist organization. \n     But these claims are not true. I know they are not true, \n     because I have firsthand knowledge of the clandestine \n     collaboration between one giant telecommunications company \n     and the NSA to facilitate the most comprehensive spying \n     program in history. I have seen the NSA's vacuum cleaner \n     surveillance infrastructure with my own eyes. It is a vast \n     government-sponsored warrantless spying program. For over 22 \n     years, I worked as a technician for AT While working in \n     San Francisco in 2002, I learned that a management level \n     technician, with AT's knowledge, had been cleared by the \n     NSA to work on a special but secret project--the installation \n     and maintenance of Internet equipment in a newly constructed \n     secure room at AT's central office in San Francisco. Other \n     than the NSA cleared technician, no employees were allowed \n     in that room. In October of 2003, I was transferred to \n     that office and was in particular assigned to oversee \n     AT's operations. As part of my duties, I was required to \n     connect circuits carrying data to optical splitters, which \n     made a copy of the light signal. But the splitters \n     weakened the light signal causing problems I had to \n     troubleshoot. After examining engineering documents given \n     to the technicians which showed the connections of the \n     splitters, I discovered they were hard wired to a secret \n     room. In short, an exact copy of all traffic that flowed \n     through critical AT cables, e-mails documents, pictures, \n     web browsers, voice-over-Internet phone conversations, \n     everything, was being diverted to equipment inside the \n     secret room. In addition, the documents revealed the \n     technological gear used in their secret project, including \n     a highly sophisticated search component capable of quickly \n     sifting through huge amounts of digital data, including \n     text, voice, and images in real time according to \n     preprogrammed criteria. It is important to understand that \n     the Internet links connected to the splitters contained \n     not just foreign communications but vast amounts of \n     domestic traffic, all mixed together. Furthermore, the \n     splitter has no selectively abilities. It is just a dumb \n     device which copies everything to the secret room, and the \n     links going through the splitter are AT's physical \n     connections to many other Internet providers--Sprint, \n     Quest, Global Crossing, cable and wireless, and the \n     critical West Coast exchange point known as Mae West. \n     Since these networks are interconnected, the government \n     surveillance affects not only AT customer matters but \n     everyone else--millions of Americans. I also discovered in \n     my conversations with other technicians that other secret \n     rooms were established in Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles, \n     and San Diego. One of the documents I obtained also \n     mentions Atlanta, and the clear inference and the logic of \n     this setup and the language of the documents is that there \n     are other such rooms across the country to complete the \n     coverage, possibly 15 or 20 more. So when reports of the \n     government's extensive wiretapping program surfaced in \n     December 2005, after I had left AT, I realized two \n     things: First, that I had been a witness to a massive \n     spying effort that violated the rights of millions of \n     Americans; and, second, that the government was not \n     telling the public the truth about the extent of their \n     unconstitutional invasion of privacy. In the spring of \n     2006, I became a witness for the Electronic Frontier \n     Foundation's lawsuit against AT The New York Times, on \n     April 13, 2006, reported that four independent technical \n     experts examined the AT documents. All said that the \n     documents showed that AT had an agreement with the \n     Federal Government to systematically gather information \n     flowing on the Internet.\n\n  Now, Madam President, there is a further statement of \ntelecommunication expert Brian Reid on AT whistleblower Mark Klein's \nrevelations. Dr. Reid is currently the Director of Engineering and \nTechnical Operations at Internet Systems Consortium, a nonprofit \norganization devoted to supporting a nonproprietary Internet.\n  Dr. Reid, who has taught at Stanford and Carnegie-Mellon \nUniversities, was an early pioneer in the development of Internet and \nnetwork technology and received numerous awards for his work in the \nfield of information technology. I think Dr. Reid's expertise in \ntelecommunications is vital to understanding the depth and breadth of \nthe program found at AT's Folsom Street facility in San Francisco. \nLet me read from Dr. Reid's testimony.\n\n       I am a telecommunications and data networking expert who \n     has been involved in the development of several critical \n     Internet technologies. I was a professor of electrical \n     engineering at Stanford University and in computer science at \n     Carnegie-Mellon university west. I have carefully reviewed \n     the AT authenticated documents and declaration provided by \n     Mark Klein and the public redacted version of the expert \n     declaration of J. Scott Marcus both filed in the Hepping vs. \n     AT litigation. Provided the information contained in those \n     declarations and documents, with my extensive knowledge of \n     the international communications infrastructure and the \n     technology regularly used for lawful surveillance pursuant to \n     warrants and court orders, I believe Mr. Klein's evidence is \n     strongly supported of widespread untargeted surveillance of \n     ordinary people, both AT customers and others. The AT \n     documents describe a technological setup at the AT facility \n     in San Francisco. This setup is particularly well suited to \n     wholesale dragnet surveillance of all communications passing \n     through that facility, whether international or domestic. \n     These documents describe how the fiber-optic cables were cut \n     and splitters installed at the cut point. Fiber-optic cables \n     work just like ordinary TV splitters. One cable feeds in and \n     two cables feed out. Both cables carry a copy of absolutely \n     everything that is sent, and if the second cable is connected \n     to a monitoring station, that station sees all traffic going \n     over the cable. Mr. Klein stated the second cable was routed \n     into a room at the facility whose access was restricted to \n     AT employees having clearances from the NSA. The documents \n     indicate that similar facilities were being installed in \n     Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Diego, and also a \n     reference to a somewhat similar facility in Atlanta. This \n     infrastructure is capable of monitoring all traffic passing \n     through the AT facility, some of it not even from AT \n     customers, whether voice or data or fax or international or \n     domestic. The most likely use of this infrastructure is \n     wholesale untargeted surveillance of ordinary Americans at \n     the behest of the NSA. NSA involvement undermines arguments \n     the facility is intended for use by AT in protecting its \n     own network operations. This infrastructure is not limited \n     to, nor would it be, especially efficient for target \n     surveillance or even untargeted surveillance aimed at \n     communications where one of the ends is located outside of \n     the United States. It is also not reasonably aimed at \n     supporting AT operations in security procedures. There are \n     three main reasons. The technological infrastructure is far \n     more powerful and expensive than that needed to do targeted \n     surveillance or surveillance aimed only at international or \n     one-end foreign communications. For example, it includes a \n     NARUS Norris 6400, a computer that can simultaneously analyze \n     huge amounts of information based on rules provided by the \n     machine operator, analyze the content of messages and other \n     information--not just headers or routing information--conduct \n     the analysis in real time, rather than after a delay, and \n     correlate information for multiple sources, multiple formats, \n     over many protocols and through different periods of time in \n     that analysis. The document describes a secret private \n     backbone network, separate\n\n[[Page S15757]]\n\n     from the public network where normal AT customer traffic is \n     carried and transmitted. A separate backbone network would \n     not be required for transmission of the smaller amounts of \n     data captured by a targeted surveillance. You don't need \n     the magnitude of capacity doing targeted surveillance. The \n     San Francisco facility is not located near an entry point \n     for international communications that happen to be \n     transmitted through the United States, either through \n     undersea cable or via satellite. As a result, it would not \n     be a sensible place to locate a facility aimed at simply \n     monitoring traffic to or from northern countries.\n\n  I apologize for those rather elaborate statements from two rather \ntechnical people, but I thought it was important for our colleagues \nconsidering the matter before us that the information that broke this \nstory did not just come from casual observers, but from highly skilled \npeople who could comment on the rather broad use of this information. \nThe idea that we are just focusing our attention on foreigners who \nmight be engaged in activities threatening our existence of course is \nbelied by the evidence provided by both of these very substantial \nwitnesses.\n  I would like to maybe take another few minutes, if I can, to address \nsome of the questions that have been raised by a number of people today \nin support of the retroactive immunity.\n  Let me state again, it is very important that we have the FISA \nlegislation. It is very important that we have the modern means to \nmaintain the technological advances to be able to trap and capture \ninformation that poses a risk to our country. No one here, I believe, \nis arguing against that. The question simply was, For 5 years, why \ndidn't the telecommunications industry and why didn't the individuals \nin the Bush administration simply do what had been done more than \n18,000 times before, and that is go and get a court order from the FISA \nCourt?\n  Don't blame the NSA here. I have talked about them. The NSA is a \nFederal Government agency responsible for collecting the data. It was \nthe administration officials here and the lawyers within these \ntelecommunications companies who decided to avoid the law. The NSA \nofficials whom I have dealt with over the years want to be able to \noperate within Federal statutes. Their job is not to draft the law but \nto gather intelligence.\n  The responsibility is on those in the administration responsible for \ngranting this kind of legal authority without going to the FISA Court. \nAnd it is on the legal departments in these major communications \ncompanies for not understanding what they should know--and did know, I \nbelieve--and that is that they merely had to go to the FISA Court and \nget a court order, and the information sought by the NSA would be \nimmune from any further legal proceedings. That is the issue. The law \nhad been in place for three decades.\n  Those who are fighting immunity want an open debate on the balance of \nsecurity and civil liberties. The President disagrees. He is saying: If \nyou strike the immunity for these corporations, I will veto the bill. I \nfind it remarkable that Members have worked hard over weeks to craft a \nbill to balance the needs of civil liberties and the ability to gather \ninformation, and the President is saying: I don't care if you have done \nall of that; if you don't protect these corporations from lawsuits, I \nam going to put the whole legislation at risk. It seems to me the \nimmunity issue ought not dominate the decision the committees have made \nabout what needs to be done to balance civil liberties and the need to \ngather information.\n  Mr. President, I see great danger in this immunity. It would replace \nthe rule of law with the rule of secrecy.\n  Those who are fighting immunity offer open debate on the balance of \nsecurity and civil liberties. But this President tells us that he knows \nbest, that he has set the balance already and the rest of us do not \nneed to worry our heads about it. I oppose immunity because I find that \nthinking to be dead wrong. The power at stake today--the power to spy, \nthe power to invade privacy, the power to put one's friends outside the \nlaw--does not belong in the hands of any one individual, no matter how \nwise--and certainly not the hands of a President whose contempt for the \nlaw has been too obvious for too many years.\n  As we fight this immunity, that is what is at stake today. Not \npunishment. Not payback. Openness. Americans deserve to know what this \nPresident and these corporations have done to them, and we are never \ngoing to know that if this immunity is granted. We are never, ever \ngoing to know. It will be as if it never happened.\n  As a Member of this body for 26 years, a senior member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, I don't have the right to even look at the \nrelevant documents. Only a handful of people have the right to do it. \nSo I am being asked, as a 26-year veteran of this Senate, serving on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, to grant blanket immunity to the \nPresident's favored corporations. I find that rather remarkable.\n  As you know, I have serious doubts about the legality of the \ncorporations' actions, but I would never presume to come to this floor \nand render a verdict on them. I am not a judge. None of my colleagues \nare, either, nor is the President of the United States. Just as it \nwould be absurd for me to declare the telecoms clearly guilty, it is \nequally wrong to declare them effectively innocent. That power belongs \nto the courts, to the coequal branch of government, the judiciary. To \nslam the courthouse door shut on American citizens seeking redress \nwould be to forget the meaning of checks and balances in our system of \ngovernance altogether.\n  I believe in letting the courts do their job. It seems the \nPresident's allies only believe in the courts when the verdict goes \ntheir way. They offer any number of arguments for immunity, but one by \none, they fail. They are false and often misleading. I would like to \ntake a few minutes to look at those claims and their failures one by \none.\n  First of all, immunity supporters argue that granting immunity is a \nPresidential prerogative. That was one of the arguments made by Alberto \nGonzales. The answer to that is, of course, the fact is that this case \nbelongs in the courts. The judiciary should be allowed to determine \nwhether the President has exceeded his powers by obtaining wholesale \naccess to the domestic communications of ordinary citizens without a \ncourt order. That is why the courts exist, to determine if the actions \nby the Chief Executive or the Congress are, in fact, appropriate and \nproper and legal.\n  Because the telecom corporations are intimately bound up with the \nPresident's warrantless wiretapping, immunity supporters are proposing \nthat the President sit as a judge over himself. The administration's \noriginal immunity proposal protected not just telecommunications but \neveryone involved in the wiretapping program. In their original \nproposal, they wanted to immunize themselves.\n  Think about that. It speaks to their fear and perhaps their guilt, as \nwell: their guilt that they had broken the law, and their fear that in \nthe years to come, they would be found liable or convicted. They knew \nbetter than anyone else what they had done--they must have had good \nreason to be concerned!\n  Thankfully, executive immunity is not part of the bill before us, but \nthe origin of immunity tells us a great deal about what is at stake \nhere. That is, and always has been, a self-preservation bill.\n  Second, immunity supporters claim that only foreign communications \nwere targeted, not Americans' domestic calls. For those who were \nlistening, I just read two documents from an AT official of 22 years \nwho was deeply involved in helping set up the very systems, and from \nDr. Reid, who then analyzed all the materials that have been presented \nby Mark Klein to determine exactly how the system worked. The fact is \nclear: Firsthand evidence, authenticated by corporations in court, \ncontradicts the claim. Splitters at the AT Internet hub in San \nFrancisco diverted to a secret, NSA-controlled room every e-mail, every \ntext message, every phone call, foreign and domestic, carried over the \nmassive fiber-optic links of 16 separate companies.\n  Third, immunity supporters claim that the Intelligence Committee \nversion of this bill actually does preserve a role for the judiciary. \nBut, again, the fact is that the role would be empty. The Intelligence \nversion of this bill would require the cases to be dismissed at a word \nfrom the Attorney General. The central legal questions raised by these \ncases would never be heard in court. The cases would never\n\n[[Page S15758]]\n\nbe fully closed. We would never truly know what happened.\n  The fourth argument is that a lack of immunity will make the telecom \nindustry less likely to cooperate with surveillance in the future.\n  However, in the 1970s, FISA compelled telecommunications companies to \ncooperate with surveillance. In fact, AT helped write this law some \n30 years ago. But they could only get that cooperation from the \ntelecommunications industry when it is warranted, literally where there \nis a court order. But if the court order is given, the cooperating \ntelecom is immunized. No warrant, no immunity.\n  So cooperation in warranted wiretapping is not at stake today. \nCollusion in warrantless wiretapping is--and the warrant makes all the \ndifference, because it is precisely the court's blessing that brings \nPresidential power under the rule of law.\n  The fifth argument immunity supporters offer is that the telecoms \ncannot defend themselves without exposing state secrets. But the fact \nis that Federal district court judge Vaughn Walker--I might point out, \nappointed by a Republican administration--has already ruled on this \nmatter that the issue can go to trial without putting state secrets in \njeopardy. Judge Walker reasonably pointed out that the existence of the \nPresident's surveillance program is all hardly a secret at all today. \nWe are debating it here, and have been. It is has been in the \ndiscussion for weeks on end. You can't claim there is a secret about \nthe surveillance program.\n  As Judge Walker said:\n\n       The Government has already disclosed the general contours \n     of the Terrorist Surveillance Program, which requires the \n     assistance of a telecommunications provider.\n\n  The sixth argument offered by supporters of immunity claims that \ntelecom companies are already protected by common law principles.\n  But again, the fact is that common law immunities do not trump \nspecific legal duties imposed by statute, such as the specific duties \nto protect customer privacy that Congress has long imposed on these \ntelecommunication companies, going back almost 30 years.\n  In the pending case against AT, the judge has already ruled \nunequivocally, and I quote:\n\n       That AT cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity \n     in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic \n     dragnet was legal.\n\n  Even so, the communication company defendants can and should, I \nbelieve, have the opportunity to present these defenses to the courts. \nI am not suggesting by that quote that there ought to be a \npredetermined verdict. As I said a moment ago, I am not pretending I am \na judge here. All I am asking is that these cases go forward and a \ndetermination made as to whether they were legal. The defendants can \nand should have the opportunity to present these defenses to the \ncourts; and the courts, not the Congress preemptively, should decide \nwhether they are sufficient.\n  The seventh argument offered by the supporters of the retroactive \nimmunity says that leaks from the trial might damage national security. \nWe heard this argument from my good friend from Virginia, Senator \nWarner. But the fact is, our Federal court system has already dealt for \ndecades with the most delicate national security matters, building up \nexpertise in protecting classified information behind closed doors in \nwhat are called ex parte and in camera proceedings. We can expect, I \nthink, no less in these cases as well.\n  If we are worried about national security being threatened as a \nresult, we can simply get the principals a security clearance. No \nintelligence sources need be compromised; no state secrets need to be \nexposed. And we can say so with increasing confidence, because after \nthe extensive litigation that has taken place at both the district \ncourt and circuit court levels on this matter already, no sensitive \ninformation has leaked out. I think it is a red herring to suggest \nsomehow that you cannot go to court here when we have proved for \ndecades the courts' ability to handle national security matters without \nleaking.\n  An eighth argument offered by immunity supporters claims that \nlitigation will harm the telecoms by causing them ``reputational \ndamage.'' The fact is there is no evidence that this legislation has \nreduced or would reduce the defendant companies' bottom lines or \ncustomer base. This morning I quoted from the Dow Jones Market Watch. \nThe date is October 23, 2007, well after the reports were out about \nAT's involvement in the surveillance program.\n\n       Third quarter earnings rose 41.5 percent. Boosted by the \n     acquisition of BellSouth and the addition of 2 million net \n     wireless customers, AT's net income was $3.06 billion, \n     compared with $2.17 billion a year ago.\n\n  Hardly a company that is suffering reputational damage. AT has \nposted these record profits during a time of very public litigation. So \nthe argument that reputational damage somehow prevents us from going \nforward has no basis in fact.\n  But moreover, to claim that ``reputational damage'' ought to trump \nour rights and liberties--I find it frightening that anyone in \ngovernment would even make that argument. To say that a violation of \nmillions of Americans' privacy over 5 years is outweighed by the \npotential for reputational damage is to show a rather extraordinary \nlack of balance when it comes to understanding the relative importance \nof these issues.\n  A ninth argument made by those in favor of retroactive immunity \nclaims that these lawsuits could bankrupt the telecommunications \nindustry. But the fact is that only the most exorbitant and unlikely \njudgment could completely wipe out such enormous corporations. To \nassume that the telecommunications industry would lose and that the \njudges would then hand down such back-breaking penalties is already to \ntake several leaps from where we are today.\n  The point, after all, has never been to cripple our \ntelecommunications industry; the point is to bring checks and balances \nback to domestic surveillance. Setting that precedent would hardly \nrequire a crippling judgment.\n  But on another level, immunity supporters are staking their claim on \na dangerous principle: that a lawsuit can be stopped simply on the \nbasis of how much a defendant stands to lose. The larger the \ncorporation, in other words, the more lawless it could be. If we accept \nthe immunity supporters' premises, we could conceive of a corporation \nso wealthy, so integral to our economy, that its riches place it \noutside the law altogether. And if the administration's thinking even \nadmits that possibility, we know instinctively how flawed it is.\n  We see then none of those arguments for immunity stand up to the \ntest. All nine of them fail.\n  I am not here again to render judgment on the telecom corporations. I \nhave my doubts, but that's not why I'm here. All I am suggesting is \nthat when you grant this kind of immunity once, what is to stop someone \nfrom making that argument again, in a later debate, when maybe someone \nwill be asked to collect information about our medical histories or our \nfinancial records or some other personal matters? They would wave that \nvote back in our face: Democrats, Republicans found no difficulty in \ngranting retroactive immunity for telecommunications surveillance; why \nwould you object today when it comes to people's medical records, or \ntheir financial records, or other private information?\n\n  You start down that slippery slope, and nothing good can come of it. \nThis ought not be a difficult debate.\n  So I am surprised and stunned to listen to some of my more \nconservative colleagues here. I used to associate conservative \nprinciples with standing up for privacy, a principle once held \nsacrosanct. It is rather stunning to me today to listen to some of the \nmore conservative Members argue for retroactive immunity, that somehow \nit was all right for those companies to do what they did. I hear that \nthey did not know any better, that somehow they got drawn into this by \nmistake. If that were true of every one of them, well, maybe that point \nwould have a little more weight. But there were companies such as Qwest \nthat said, ``No, give me a court order, and then I will comply.'' Why \ndid the Qwest lawyers arrive at a different decision? Was it a great \nsecret within the telecommunications industry that there were those who \nsaid no? Why did Qwest say no and others say yes? I believe they \nunderstood the law, and they realized that without a court order they \ncould not legally comply with that request.\n\n[[Page S15759]]\n\n  I might point out that no court order was ever forthcoming. Why did \nnot the administration seek that court order for Qwest to get \nadditional information? Why did they drop that kind of request? I might \npoint out, as I did earlier today, that over the years, I am told by \nThe Washington Post, there have been over 18,000 requests of the FISA \nCourt for court orders, and of more than 18,000 requests, only 5 have \nbeen rejected. 99.9 percent of the requests by administrations for \ncourt orders over the years in the FISA Court have been granted.\n  Why would you not ask? Why did they not go forward and make that \nrequest? Why did Qwest say no? Why did the others say yes? Why are we \ngranting immunity to these companies, without going through the courts \nof law to determine what is right?\n  Again, this ought not be a debate between Democrats and Republicans \nand conservatives and liberals. It ought to be a debate about defending \nthese basic rights we have here in America. Companies that may have \nviolated them deserve their day in a court of law. But immunizing them \nfor a program that went on for not for a day or two or a week or 6 \nmonths or even a year, but for 5 years and only stopped when exposed by \na whistleblower ought to cause all of us to pause. Clearly we want to \nkeep our country safe, but if we are being asked to keep our country \nsafe by giving up our rights, then we are granting these jihadists and \nterrorists victories far beyond anything they have yet achieved.\n  As tragic as the events of 9/11 were, if we begin to undo our own \nliberties and rights, we give them a success far beyond anything they \ncould have ever imagined. I have been here today for the last 8 hours, \nand I will stay here for as long as it takes.\n  At the appropriate time, when we have exhausted the ability to talk \nabout it generally, I will offer the language to strike it, and I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in that effort. But I am determined not to \nlet this go forward, because I think we have done that too often. I \nmyself have been guilty of accepting far too much from this \nadministration. Just one small thing is at issue today. But then I \nstart to look back at all of the small things that have been done, so-\ncalled ``small things'' over the last 5 or 6 years--most recently, the \ndestruction of interrogation tapes at the CIA. And the combined weight \nof these ``small things'' truly frightens me.\n  What was going on at the CIA? Why did that happen? Why Abu Ghraib? \nWhy Guantanamo? Why get rid of habeas corpus? Why bring back \nwaterboarding? Why do away with the Geneva Conventions? Why nominate \nsomeone to be the Attorney General who believes that Presidents have \nthe right to violate Federal statutes here under the guise of \nprotecting the Nation's security?\n  Why, after each one of those these things? Why the Military \nCommissions Act? In case after case after case, we see the slow erosion \ngoing on. And again, regardless of what your politics are, regardless \nof where you find yourself on the spectrum, when our basic rights are \ninvolved, we must stand up and say, ``Enough!''\n  A generation ago, Members of this body sat here, and had only one \nnegative vote as they worked out the original FISA law, that balance \nbetween our needs to protect our security and to protect our rights. \nHere we are about to make a major step in the opposite direction. And \nthose gentlemen faced tough times. They were wrestling with the threat \nof nuclear war in the 1970s. The Soviet Union still existed. They had \nbeen through World War II, many of them, Korea and Vietnam. They knew \nwhat hostility and difficulty were like. And yet Democrats and \nRepublicans came together and wrote that legislation. On 30 separate \noccasions since then they modernized it to keep pace with the changes \noccurring throughout the world, where new risks and new dangers are \nposed every day. So yes, we should modernize FISA and bring it up to \ndate. I applaud the committees' efforts to do so. But to add \nretroactive immunity, to grant blanket immunity to companies that \nlistened in on millions of people in this country without a court \norder, is a step too far.\n  Listen to the remarks of our colleague from Massachusetts today in \ntalking about the legal counsel of this administration. Their words: to \nblow through these laws. They did not like them? Blow through them! \nThat was their attitude. Well, I am going to stop the blowing through. \nNo more blowing through the laws. Not here, not tonight, not this \nMember, not on this bill. No more blowing through the law!\n  You do not get immunity, not as long as I can stand here and fight \nthis. I intend to do just that.\n  Madam President, I withhold the remainder of my time, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. It is not \ncounted against the time.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on numerous occasions in the FISA debate, \nwe have seen dramatic fear mongering. Many individuals, particularly on \npartisan blogs, are spreading misleading and malicious information in \norder to incite fear of alleged governmental activities. This bill \nshould not include text which panders to people who believe in \nimaginary Government conspiracies. There is such a thing as irrational \nfear of Government.\n  Let's not forget, our Government did not kill thousands of innocent \nAmericans on September 11. Our Government did not kill hundreds of \npeople in car bombings in U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Our \nGovernment did not kill 191 people in the Madrid train bombings. Our \nGovernment did not kill 52 people in the London train bombings. Our \nGovernment did not kill 202 people in suicide bombings Bali, Indonesia. \nThe indisputable fact is terrorists have committed heinous attacks on \nAmericans and have pledged themselves to conduct more. It is not \npolitics of fear to acknowledge this. If we bury our heads in the sand \nand pass legislation that ignores these risks, we make ourselves and \nall our people more vulnerable. I will not stand by and see Congress \npass laws which could create vulnerabilities for our people, \nvulnerabilities which expose our families and our friends to danger.\n  Let me tell you what our Government does to protect us. It hires the \nfinest men and women of this great country to utilize their skills to \nhelp prevent these types of attacks. Our job in Congress is to make \nsure these people who have sworn to defend us have the necessary tools \nto try and prevent terrorist attacks. What they don't need are laws \nwith ambiguous language, as has been proposed, making their jobs more \ndifficult.\n  One of my colleagues previously stated:\n\n       The authority in this bill greatly expands the Government's \n     ability to conduct surveillance of foreign targets.\n\n  How in the world he can make that statement, I don't understand. The \nonly great expansion I see in this bill is judicial jurisdiction. In \nfact, I am amazed we don't rename the bill the unlimited expansion of \njudicial authority act. We have advocated so much new responsibility \nfor the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that I wonder whether \npeople realize that court is composed of only 11 judges. Where is this \ngreat expansion in surveillance authority that has been argued on the \nfloor?\n  Since FISA was passed in 1978, the Government has been able to target \nterrorists overseas. This bill amends FISA so we can continue to target \nforeign terrorists when they utilize communications over a wire, not \njust communications over radio or satellite. This does not sound to me \nlike a great expansion. Maybe that is why the Government has continued \nto say FISA needed to be ``modernized,'' not that it needed to be \ngreatly expanded. There is, however, a key expansion in the bill. It is \na statutory warrant requirement when targeting U.S. persons, regardless \nof who they are, what they have done or where they are located. Notice \nI said U.S. persons, not U.S. citizens. This idea may sound great to \neveryone, but we should realize, with eyes wide open, what this means. \nWe have heard some individuals claim the Government could use the power \nof the Protect America Act to spy on innocent Americans. We have heard \nthe fear\n\n[[Page S15760]]\n\nmongering that the Government can spy on innocent Americans when they \ntravel overseas. We have heard all about American families on vacation \noverseas in the Caribbean or in Europe. We have even heard our \nGovernment could spy on American military members who are overseas \ndefending our country.\n  I find these scare tactics not only ridiculous but extremely \noffensive. They walk a fine line in seemingly questioning the integrity \nand the judgment of these fine men and women who work for us and who \ndon't have a political agenda, who have dedicated their professional \nlives to prevent catastrophic attacks on Americans. Do we think our \nintelligence analysts are sitting around waiting for the Smith family \nto go on their family vacation to Italy so they can tap their cell \nphones? Give me a break. To imply that our country's intelligence \nanalysts are more concerned with random innocent Americans than foreign \nterrorists overseas is a slap in the face to the people who protect our \nNation. Our Government is focusing their attention on terrorists who \nwish us death, not on innocent Americans.\n  When some decry the lack of statutory protection for Americans \noverseas in the Protect America Act, I wonder if they realize the 1978 \nFISA law itself provides no statutory protections for Americans \noverseas. Yet we have called that the gold standard all these years. I \nwould, however, tell my colleagues that Americans overseas are \nprotected by the most important document in the history of our great \nNation, and that is the U.S. Constitution. The fourth amendment to the \nConstitution provides protection from unreasonable search and seizure. \nThat is the question. Is it always unreasonable for the Government to \ntarget an American overseas without a court order? Of course not. I \nwould suggest the process that has worked for 26 years is the best \napproach. It is Executive Order 12333. Since 1981, the Government could \nonly target Americans overseas if the Attorney General determined via \nprobable cause that the American was an agent of a foreign power. Do we \nthink an intelligence analyst is going to disregard an executive order \nand wiretap innocent Americans overseas? Of course not.\n  Now, with the policy change included in both the Intelligence and \nJudiciary bills, I want to give an example of how this provision will \napply in real life.\n  Adam Gadahn is an American citizen from Orange County, CA. He is also \none of the FBI's most wanted terrorists now believed to be living \noverseas. He has been indicted for treason and providing material \nsupport to al-Qaida. Here is what he said:\n\n       The streets of America shall run red with blood . . . \n     casualties will be too many to count and the next wave of \n     attacks may come at any moment.\n\n  He has appeared on multiple al-Qaida propaganda tapes. Here is \nanother quote:\n\n       The magnitude and ferocity of what is coming your way will \n     make you forget all about September 11.\n\n  Here is something that should make all Americans scratch their heads. \nBefore September 11, the Government would not need a warrant to target \nthis criminal. After September 11, the Government would not need a \nwarrant to target Gadahn. But after this bill is signed, the Government \nwill be required to get a warrant to target Gadahn. This bill does \nrequire that.\n  Let's explain that one to the American public.\n  Would a warrantless interception of Gadahn's communications be \n``unreasonable'' under the fourth amendment? Of course not. But we are \nrequiring something that even the Founding Fathers did not--a warrant \nfor all electronic searches of U.S. persons.\n  Now I understand the administration is willing to accept a modified \nversion of this amendment that does not include unintended \nconsequences. It is yet another example of how far this proposal goes \nto satisfy determined detractors who never seem to be satisfied that we \nare doing enough to ``protect'' innocent Americans.\n  I am also amazed at the false descriptions floating around the \nInternet of the program which the President described on December 17, \n2005, during a radio address. We have all heard the terms: \n``warrantless wiretapping'' or ``domestic spying.'' But let's look at \nwhat the President actually said during his radio address on December \n17, 2005. This is what he said:\n\n       In the weeks following the terrorist attacks on our Nation, \n     I authorized the National Security Agency, consistent with \n     U.S. law and the Constitution, to intercept the international \n     communications of people with known links to al Qaeda and \n     related terrorist organizations. Before we intercept these \n     communications, the government must have information that \n     establishes a clear link to these terrorist networks.\n\n  Now I do not see anything in this statement about domestic spying. I \nthought the definition of the word ``domestic'' was pretty clear. If \nthe program intercepted communications in which at least one party was \noverseas, not to mention a member of al-Qaida, then it seems fairly \nobvious that the calls were not domestic.\n  Here, as shown on this chart, is a call from the United States of \nAmerica to overseas; or a call from overseas to the United States of \nAmerica. Is that a domestic call? I hardly think so. Is this such a \nhard concept to grasp? The last time I flew overseas, I did not fly on \na domestic flight. I flew on an international flight. ``Domestic \nspying'' may sound catchy and mysterious, but it is a completely \ninaccurate way to describe the terrorist surveillance program. Why \ndon't the partisan blogs describe it as ``international spying''? Isn't \nthat a more accurate description? I guess accurate descriptions take a \nback seat to terms which incite fear and distrust in our Government.\n  Since so many are so interested in the opinion of the FISC, or the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court, on these matters, I wish to \ndraw attention to a recent decision. On Tuesday, the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court denied a motion by the ACLU for release \nof court records related to alleged NSA surveillance programs. This \nFISC opinion was publicly released, which is only the third time in the \nentire history of the FISC in which this has occurred.\n  Given the rarity of this event--this issued public opinion that \ndenied a motion by the ACLU for the release of court records related to \nalleged NSA surveillance programs--I want to highlight a few sentences \nfrom that ruling:\n\n       [T]he identification of targets and methods of surveillance \n     would permit adversaries to evade surveillance, conceal their \n     activities, and possibly mislead investigators through false \n     information. Public identification of targets, and those in \n     communication with them, would also likely result in \n     harassment of, or more grievous injury to, persons who might \n     be exonerated after full investigation. Disclosures about \n     confidential sources of information would chill current and \n     potential sources from providing information, and might put \n     some in personal jeopardy. Disclosure of some forms of \n     intelligence gathering could harm national security in other \n     ways, such as damaging relations with foreign governments. \n     All these possible harms are real and significant, and, quite \n     frankly, beyond debate.\n\n  Now, that is in re: Motion for release of court records of the U.S. \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court, December 7 of this year.\n  I think we can all agree this is a vitally important public opinion \nfrom the FISA, and I commend it to my colleagues.\n  Regardless of how we came to this moment, it is time to do what is \nright for our country. The time has come for us to work together. We \nall know it is going to take bipartisan support to get this legislation \npassed. Let's represent our constituents with our heads held high, \nknowing we are doing our very best to balance the necessity for \nprotections of civil liberties with the need to keep American families \nsafe from deadly attacks. We owe our people this much.\n  I hope we can continue to work, as the Intelligence Committee did, in \na bipartisan way to resolve these very difficult problems. I have to \nsay that the 13-to-2 bipartisan approach is one of the highlights of \nthis year. It is probably the best example of bipartisanship we have \nthis year. I have to tell you, to try to change that with some of the \nlanguage from the Judiciary Committee--where it was a pure partisan \nvote on both sides--to try to change that is not the way to do it.\n  So I hope our colleagues will realize that in the Intelligence \nCommittee, in a bipartisan way, we have worked together to come up with \nthe ways of solving these very technical and difficult problems, and to \ndo so in the best traditions of the intelligence community, in the best \ntraditions of gathering intelligence information, and in the best \ntraditions of protecting our\n\n[[Page S15761]]\n\ncountry that this country has ever known.\n  Frankly, I compliment the distinguished chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, the distinguished vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, and my fellow Senators on the committee, Democrats and \nRepublicans, who were willing to put partisanship aside and pass that \nbill 13 to 2 out of that committee.\n  Mr. President, I notice my dear friend from Florida is desirous to \nspeak on the floor, so I will withhold my further remarks and turn the \ntime over to him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from \nUtah, who has been a member of the Intelligence Committee for years and \nyears, and who brings a lot of good common sense to the committee. I \necho his comments about the bipartisan nature of Chairman Rockefeller \nand Vice Chairman Bond working together. It was something that this \nmember of the Intelligence Committee had seen earlier this year break \ndown, and I must say this member of the Intelligence Committee \nabsolutely reminded everybody on the committee that the committee ought \nto work of one accord, reaching consensus when we can reach that \nconsensus, and, at the end of the day, that the product not only be a \nbipartisan product, it ought to be a nonpartisan product.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I certainly do yield to my friend.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks. \nHe was one of the Senators who helped to put this bill together, and a \ndistinguished Senator at that.\n  Would the Senator agree with me that should this bill pass, it would \nbe one of the best illustrations of bipartisanship in this whole \nCongress so far?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Indeed, Mr. President, it would be. And we \nhave to pass a FISA bill. For many of the reasons you have heard--the \nchanging technology--we have to give the legal authorization to the \nU.S. Government. That is another reason for having a clear delineation \nin law of what the Government can do and what it cannot do. Because, \nunfortunately, what we have seen over the last several years is the \nintrusion into this murky area without the necessary legal binding, \nthat it was clearly legal as to what was being done. That is what is so \nnecessary about passing a piece of legislation such as we have before \nus in the form of which we are just on the motion to proceed.\n  Now, I voted for closing off debate on the motion to proceed because \nit is clearly important that we get a law and pass this legislation. It \nimproves on the legislation we passed last August, where it is going to \nprovide protections for Americans both in the United States and abroad. \nBut naturally in something as complicated as this, I am not satisfied \ncompletely with what is in the bill. That is why we ought to get to the \nbill, so we can start amending or considering amendments.\n  For example, the Senator from Connecticut--when we ever get to the \nbill--is going to offer the amendment that I offered in the \nIntelligence Committee, which was the amendment to take away immunity \nfrom the telephone companies. It was specifically targeted to strip the \nprovisions of the bill that provided immunity to the telecommunications \ncompanies for assistance provided to the administration for warrantless \nsurveillance in a defined period of time--from September 11, 2001, \nuntil January 17, 2007.\n  The reason I offered that in the committee was, I felt it was hugely \npremature for our committee to grant that retroactive immunity to those \ntelecommunications carriers when, in fact, the White House had only \ncome forth with the documents that we could inspect only 48 hours prior \nto when we were going to vote on it.\n  I am still troubled by the idea of a blanket retroactive immunity. \nWhether they deserve a break for their cooperation with the \nGovernment's warrantless program in the aftermath of September 11, that \nis one thing. But this went on for 6 years.\n  I can certainly understand, in the aftermath of the horror of what we \nsaw on September 11, 2001, that a President would need, for the \nprotection of the country--and using his article II powers of the \nConstitution as Commander in Chief to protect the country--that he \ncould say to telecommunications companies: We need this information. \nThere is a law over here called the FISA law that says if you want to \nsnoop on any American person, you have to do it by getting a court \norder by a special Federal court that is organized under law to handle \nthese secret national security matters in secret.\n  I can see telecommunications companies going along, that in the \nurgency of the aftermath of September 11--we do not know when the next \nstrike is coming; it may be the next day, it may be the next week--that \nthe telecommunications companies cooperated when the President said and \nthe communications come to them saying: This is under the legal \nauthority of the President. I can understand that. But after a year? \nAfter 2 years? After 3 years? How about 4 years? How about 5 years, \nwhen clearly there is a law on the books that if it is going to touch \nAmericans, you have to go to the special Federal court impaneled by \nFederal judges who are cleared for top-secret information? Now, that is \nwhat bothers me.\n\n  There is another part that bothers me, which is that in the \nseparation of powers envisioned in our Constitution, the first article \nof the Constitution is setting up the legislative branch of Government. \nThe second article sets up the executive branch of Government--the \nPresident. The Constitution envisioned that there is a check and a \nbalance of each of those on the other. For example, something doesn't \nbecome law that the legislative branch--the Congress--passes. It can't \nbecome law without the signature of the President. But if Congress \ndisagrees with the President, they can override the President's Veto \nwith a two-thirds vote. So there is this tension built into the system \nof one branch overseeing the other. It is appropriate that the \nlegislative branch oversees the activities of the executive branch.\n  But that is not what was going on with this matter of surveillance \nbecause the legislative branch was left in the dark. The President \nignored the Congress. The President ignored the courts when he \nauthorized the warrantless surveillance program and Congress's attempts \nto conduct the oversight of the program. All those attempts were \nconstantly thwarted. So, therefore, I also have a problem with \nretroactive immunity--that it would make a mockery of our separation of \npowers.\n  Now, having said all that, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, \nI have still a check in my gut as to whether there would be some lack \nof cooperation among telecommunications companies with the executive \nbranch of government on a going-forward basis if there is not some form \nof immunity that is given to these telecommunications companies. I know \nthat on a going-forward basis there cannot be any question that we have \nthe cooperation of those companies with the Government in order to \nprotect this country and to provide for the national security.\n  So I am looking forward to the debate continuing as we flesh out all \nthese ideas. I am particularly intrigued with an amendment that is \ngoing to be offered by Senator Feinstein, of which I am a cosponsor, \nwhich would provide a forum handling classified material in the FISA \ncourt itself in order to consider the question of immunity and that \nthere would be a determination in this special Federal court as to \nwhether the immunity ought to be given. I think that is something we \nought to debate. We ought to get it clear when we get to the bill. But \nin the meantime, I share with the Senate my reservations about this \npart of the bill and about the immunity.\n  Let me say at the end of the day--whether we have immunity in the \nbill or whether it is not in the bill or whether there is some hybrid \nversion such as the Feinstein amendment, at the end of the day, we are \ngoing to need to make this FISA law permanent because it is going to \nrun out in February. We have to clearly have this etched into law so on \na going-forward basis we can provide for the security of this country.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S15762]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I certainly will yield to my friend from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague from Florida, I appreciate immensely \nhis leadership on so many issues, but especially on the committee \nitself. I was stunned by the number of requests made of the FISA Court \nover the years for court orders to various entities. There have been \nover 18,000 granted court order requests and 5 rejections in 25 years. \nSome have argued a fear that we might not get an approval by the FISA \nCourt, but in 99.9 percent of the times that Presidents of both parties \nover the years or administrations have sought the approval of the FISA \nCourt for a court order to seek information, in only 5 cases over more \nthan 25 years have those requests been rejected.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida for raising the point. This is not \nabout denying our agencies the opportunity, the ability, the means by \nwhich they gather information to keep us secure; it is merely saying so \nthat in the process of doing so, there is a way of doing this, which \ngrants them the opportunity to do that while simultaneously protecting \nour basic liberties. So I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would respond to the very \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut that those kinds of reports have \nbeen in the press for some time, and I think generally they are \nconsidered to be true. However, a lot of that operated under the old \nlaw, which had a 3-day limit, that in the case of a national emergency, \nthe President wouldn't have to first go and get a court order.\n  Instead, he could go on under the emergency conditions and surveil \nthe particular target, if it were an American person but, under the old \nlaw, would have to go back to the court within 3 days to get that order \nor else cease their surveillance. In the new law that was passed on a \ntemporary basis for 6 months, that we passed last August, that 3 days \nhas been extended to 7 days to give more leeway. Certainly, if someone \nin the Government feels that a person--an American person--should be \nsurveilled in their communications but it was an emergency basis, that \nthey don't have time to go to the court, the law as it stands now and \nunder the new FISA bill we are considering on this floor would say that \nwithin 7 days, the executive branch would have to go and get that court \norder called a warrant or else cease the surveillance.\n  Now, that is very reasonable, and it is a lot of that kind of stuff \nthat is in this bill that is so necessary to have this etched into a \npermanent law, not a law that is going to sunset in 6 months--next \nFebruary. That is part of the gravity of the legislation before us. Now \nwe have to get to this very sensitive issue of immunity and how to \nhandle it. Although I have stated I am certainly sympathetic; indeed, \nthe Senator's amendment he is going to offer is the one I offered and \nthat was defeated. It only got three affirmative votes in the \ncommittee. So my amendment in the committee did not prevail. \nNevertheless, there are other amendments coming after the Senator's \namendment, if his is not--if the amendment of the Senator from \nConnecticut is not adopted--that do take a very practical approach. The \nFeinstein amendment which I have cosponsored is one where the issue of \nimmunity would be determined in the FISA Court itself that is set up in \norder to handle these national security matters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I join the senior Senator in Connecticut in \nrising in strong opposition to the retroactive immunity provisions \ncontained in the bill before us today. I thank Senator Dodd for his \nstrong opposition and leadership and courage to make this fight.\n  Earlier today, I opposed the cloture vote because I don't believe we \nshould consider providing immunity to corporations that broke the law, \nbreached the Constitution, and trampled on Americans' civil liberties. \nIt is pretty much as simple as that.\n  As Senators Dodd, Feingold, and others have made clear throughout \nthis day, this is a matter of law, this is a matter of basic civil \nliberties, and this is a matter of accountability.\n  The decisions we make when we vote on this bill have bearing on every \nsingle American because the rights and protections the Constitution \nprovides are precious to every single American. That is what we stand \nfor as a nation.\n  No individual or corporation can breach the Constitution and break \nthe law. No individual or corporation can breach the Constitution and \nbreak the law, even if the Federal Government tells them to do it.\n  Corporations cannot rely on a piece of paper handed to them by the \nadministration that says that an act on the very face of it sounds \nillegal but it is, in fact, legal. They have, and they had, an \nindependent obligation as corporations to assess the legality of \nwiretapping before engaging in it. That is why some telecommunications \ncompanies refused to comply when the administration asked them to \nwiretap. All of them should have taken that step.\n  The Constitution does not allow companies to rely on the executive \nbranch to interpret the Constitution for them. When the fundamental \nconstitutional rights of Americans are at issue, corporations have \none--and only one--course of action: they must act in accordance with \nthe law; they must act in accordance with the Constitution.\n  Some in this body have suggested that these companies were compelled \nto go along with the administration's illegal wiretapping program \nbecause of 9/11 and because of the very real danger of foreign \nterrorist attacks. Mr. President, while all of us--every 1 of the 100 \nMembers of this body--wants to protect America at all costs, these \ncompanies went along with this program absent a legal warrant or court \norder for over 5 years after 9/11.\n  These multibillion-dollar corporations have teams of lawyers that \nassess the meaning and implication of Federal law as it relates to \nevery move they make. But this time, now, we are asked to accept that \nhighly trained lawyers working for these companies could not clearly \nunderstand and interpret the Constitution or interpret the requirements \nof FISA, a law that is more than 30 years old.\n  It would be a total and absolute assault on the Constitution to allow \na small group of companies to ignore Federal law simply because they \nwere asked to by the President--whoever the President is.\n  It is important for all those listening to take a good look at whom \nthe administration is fighting for and whom it is representing.\n  President Bush has threatened to veto this bill unless it contains \nthe retroactive immunity provisions but not because the protections for \ncitizens are too weak. The President will veto this bill, he says, \nfrankly, because he is concerned about the bank accounts of a handful \nof telecommunications companies.\n  Since when did money trump constitutional freedom? Since when did \ncorporate connections matter more than the rule of law?\n  Congress has the responsibility to protect the freedoms and the \nrights of all citizens. Our Government should be open and transparent \nand, when rights are infringed, there should be an opportunity to seek \nlegal redress in a court of law.\n  That is why our system of government contains a judicial branch: to \nlitigate infringements of rights, to assess the constitutionality of \nlaws and programs.\n  The retroactive immunity provisions in this bill will make it \nimpossible to hold those who broke the law accountable for their \nillegal actions. That is wrong, Mr. President, and that is dangerous.\n  We must remember that by protecting our civil liberties we protect \nour Nation and our values.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote for the Dodd-Feingold amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio for his \ncontinuing efforts here. He is not a newcomer at\n\n[[Page S15763]]\n\nall to these issues. I thank him for his words, support, and knowledge \nof the issue, and his continuing efforts to see if we can get a good \nbill out of here and not add extraneous matters such as this.\n  As I heard Senator Nelson of Florida talk earlier, I thought--I think \nmany of us thought that had this been a day or a week after 9/11, we \nmight have found the telecoms' actions more understandable. In the heat \nof emergency, we might have accepted some excessive aggression. I can \nunderstand people drawing that conclusion.\n  But this program went on for 5 long years. The idea that we grant \nretroactive immunity for actions over 5 long years goes way beyond \nanything anybody ought to accept in this body.\n  Retroactive immunity, under these circumstance, would be a massive \nstep backward in light of this administration's assault on the \nConstitution and the rule of law. Again, I thank my colleague from \nOhio.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I voted against cloture on the motion \nto proceed to S. 2448 as reported by the Senate Intelligence Committee \nbecause I believe that we should instead be taking up on the Senate \nfloor the far better bill reported out by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Congress has a duty to protect the American people--and to protect \nthe Constitution. That is the oath we take. It is a solemn pledge, and \nin my judgment the Judiciary Committee bill better reflects the oath we \neach swear to uphold. Why? The Judiciary Committee's bill gives the \nPresident the added flexibility he needs to hunt and capture terrorists \nwho would strike our homeland--but it strikes an appropriate balance \nbetween protecting the privacy rights of American citizens and \nproviding the President adequate tools to fight international \nterrorism.\n  This is no small issue. It is the job of Congress to find the right \nbalance between protecting privacy and safeguarding national security. \nThe judiciary bill makes critical improvements to the Protect America \nAct to ensure independent judicial oversight by the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court, FISC. It allows the secret FISC \ngreater authority to act as an independent check on unfettered \nExecutive power. The judiciary bill provides the court the authority to \nassess the Government's ongoing compliance with its wiretapping \nprocedures, places limits on the way the Government uses information \nacquired about Americans, and lets the court enforce its own orders.\n  The judiciary bill also safeguards Americans against widespread \nwarrantless spying. It reaffirms that FISA is the exclusive statutory \nauthority for conducting foreign intelligence surveillance, prohibits \nlimitless ``fishing expeditions''--so-called ``bulk collection'' of all \ncommunications between the United States and overseas, and ensures that \nthe Government cannot eavesdrop on Americans under the guise of \ntargeting foreigners--what is known as ``reverse targeting.''\n  Most importantly, unlike the Intelligence bill, the judiciary bill \ndoes not provide retroactive amnesty to telecommunications providers \nthat were complicit in the administration's warrantless spying program. \nI fear this administration is deliberately stonewalling to avoid an \nadverse court decision finding its surveillance program to be \nunconstitutional. It is seeking political security in the name of \nnational security.\n  The heart of the matter is that allowing Americans their day in \ncourt--introducing some kind of accountability, affording some kind of \nobjective authority, in lieu of the Bush administration, to adjudicate \ncompeting claims--will shed much-needed light on the administration's \nsecret surveillance program. If the lawsuits are shielded by Congress, \nthe courts may never rule on whether the administration's surveillance \nactivities were lawful. We must hold the administration to account. And \nan impartial court of law insulated from political pressure is the most \nappropriate setting in which to receive a fair hearing.\n  If the telecoms were following the law, they should get immunity, as \nCongress explicitly provided under the original FISA law. But our \ncourts should decide, not Congress--and that is a matter of principle \nprotected in the judiciary bill, which is the bipartisan bill that \nshould be under consideration.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--\nFISA--is intended to protect both our national security and the privacy \nand civil liberties of Americans. We are considering amendments to that \nimportant act that will provide new flexibility to our intelligence \ncommunity. I think we all support surveillance authority, and we have \njoined together to update FISA dozens of times since its historic \npassage after the intelligence abuses of earlier decades. I thank the \nmajority leader for his efforts in bringing this matter before the \nSenate. He has consulted with me and with Chairman Rockefeller and is \nproceeding by regular order to bring this legislation before the Senate \nin a manner that allows deliberation of the many protections of \nAmericans' rights added to the bill during consideration by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  It is vitally important that we correct the excesses of the so-called \nProtect America Act that was rushed through the Senate in an atmosphere \nof fear and intimidation just before the August recess after the \nadministration reneged on agreements reached with congressional \nleaders. That bill was hurriedly passed under intense, partisan \npressure from the administration. It provided sweeping new powers to \nthe Government to engage in surveillance, without a warrant, of \ninternational calls to and from the United States involving Americans, \nand it provided no meaningful protection for the privacy and civil \nliberties of the Americans who are on those calls.\n  Before that flawed bill passed, Senator Rockefeller and I, and \nseveral others in the House and the Senate, worked hard and in good \nfaith with the administration to craft legislation that solved an \nidentified problem but also protected Americans' privacy and liberties. \nJust before the August recess the administration decided, instead, to \nram through its version of the so-called Protect America Act with \nexcessive grants of Government authority and without accountability or \nchecks and balances. After almost 6 years of violating FISA through \nsecret warrantless wiretapping programs, that was wrong. A number of us \nsupported the better balanced alternative and voted against the Protect \nAmerica Act as drafted by the administration.\n  Fortunately, because the Protect America Act has a 6-month sunset, we \nhave a chance to revisit this matter and do it right. The Judiciary \nCommittees and Intelligence Committees in the Senate and the House have \nspent the past months considering changes to FISA. In the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, we held open hearings and countless briefings and \nmeetings to consider new surveillance legislation. We considered \nlegislative language in a number of open business meetings of the \ncommittee and reported a good bill to the Senate before Thanksgiving.\n  The bill we are considering will permit the Government, while \ntargeting overseas, to review more Americans' communications with less \ncourt supervision than ever before. I support this surveillance, but we \nmust also take care to protect Americans' liberties. Attorney General \nMukasey said at his nomination hearing that ``protecting civil \nliberties, and people's confidence that those liberties are protected, \nis a part of protecting national security.'' On that I agree with him. \nThat is what the Senate Judiciary bill does.\n\n  I commend the House of Representatives for passing a bill, the \nRESTORE Act, that takes a balanced approach to these issues. It allows \nour intelligence community great flexibility to conduct surveillance on \noverseas targets, while providing oversight and protection for \nAmericans' civil liberties. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nhas also worked hard. I know that Chairman Rockefeller was as \ndisappointed as I at the administration's partisan maneuvering just \nbefore the August recess. I commended his efforts this summer and do \nso, again, now. I believe that he and I both want surveillance with \noversight and accountability.\n  I also want to praise our joint members, Senators Feinstein, \nFeingold, and Whitehouse, who as members of both the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Select Committee on Intelligence contributed so much \nto the work of the Judiciary Committee and who worked with me to author \nmany of the additional protections that we adopted and\n\n[[Page S15764]]\n\nreported. These Senators and others on the Judiciary Committee worked \nhard to craft amendments that preserve the basic structure and \nauthority proposed in the bill reported by the Select Committee on \nIntelligence, while adding crucial protections for Americans.\n  In my view, and I think the view of many Senators, we need to do more \nthan the bill initially reported by the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence to protect the rights of Americans. Indeed, Senator \nRockefeller joins with me to support many of the Judiciary Committee's \nimprovements.\n  The Judiciary bill, for example, makes clear that the Government \ncannot claim authority to operate outside the law--outside of FISA--by \nalluding to legislative measures that were never intended to provide \nsuch exceptional authority. This administration has come to argue that \nthe Authorization for the Use of Military Force, AUMF, passed after \nSeptember 11, justified conducting warrantless surveillance of \nAmericans for more than 5 years. I introduced a resolution on this in \nthe last Congress, when we first heard this canard. When we authorized \ngoing after Osama bin Laden, the Senate did not authorize--explicitly \nor implicitly--warrantless wiretapping of Americans. Yet this \nadministration still clings to this phony legal argument. The Judiciary \nbill would prevent that dangerous contention with strong language \nreaffirming that FISA is the exclusive means for conducting electronic \nsurveillance for foreign intelligence purposes.\n  The Judiciary bill would also provide a more meaningful role for the \nFISA Court in this new surveillance. The court is a critical \nindependent check on Government excess in the very sensitive area of \nelectronic surveillance. The fundamental purpose of many of the \nJudiciary Committee changes is to assure that this important, \nindependent check remains meaningful.\n  On one important issue, I strongly oppose the bill reported by the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence. That bill includes one \nprovision that goes beyond even the so-called Protect America Act. It \nwould grant blanket retroactive immunity to telecommunications carriers \nfor their warrantless surveillance activities from 2001 through earlier \nthis year contrary to FISA and in violation of the privacy rights of \nAmericans.\n\n  This administration violated FISA by conducting warrantless \nsurveillance for more than 5 years. They got caught, and if they \nhadn't, they would probably still be doing it. When the public found \nout about the President's illegal surveillance of Americans, the \nadministration and the telephone companies were sued by citizens who \nbelieve their privacy and their rights were violated. Now the \nadministration is trying to get this Congress to terminate those \nlawsuits in order to insulate itself from accountability. We should not \nallow this to happen.\n  The rule of law is fundamentally important in our system, and so is \nprotecting the rights of Americans from unlawful surveillance. I do not \nbelieve that Congress can or should seek to take those rights and those \nclaims from those already harmed. Instead, I will continue to work with \nSenator Specter, as well as with Senators Feinstein and Whitehouse, to \ntry to craft a more effective alternative to retroactive immunity. We \nare working with the legal concept of substitution to place the \nGovernment in the shoes of the private defendants that acted at its \nbehest and to let it assume full responsibility for the illegal \nconduct.\n  I voted for cloture on the motion to proceed to the measure, just as \nI would have supported proceeding to the House-passed bill, because I \nbelieve it is important that we correct the excesses of the so-called \nProtect America Act. The Judiciary Committee has done good work in \nreporting protective measures to the Senate to add balance to the \nsurveillance powers of the Government and to better ensure the rights \nof Americans. I strongly oppose retroactive immunity in favor of \naccountability.\n  As we debate these issues, let us keep in mind the reason we have \nFISA in the first place. Not so long ago, we painfully learned the hard \nlesson that powerful surveillance tools, without adequate oversight or \nthe checks and balances of judicial review, lead to abuses of the \nrights of the American people. I hope this debate will provide us an \nopportunity to show the American people what we stand for, that we will \ndo all we can to secure our future while protecting their cherished \nrights and freedoms.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, title II of the Intelligence Committee bill \nprovides retroactive immunity to companies that are alleged to have \ncooperated with the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping \nprogram. When we are on this bill, we are going to have an opportunity \nto vote on the amendment to strike title II so the actions of the \ntelephone companies will be subject to legal proceedings. I will \nsupport this amendment, which insists on fair accounting for the \nactions of the telephone companies and proper accountability if they \nare found to have violated the law.\n  The Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping program was clearly \nan illegal circumvention of the provisions included in FISA designed to \nprotect the privacy of law-abiding Americans. I, once again, wish to \napplaud Chairman Rockefeller's tireless work over the course of the \nlast several years to bring strong congressional oversight to the \nillegal Bush administration's spying programs. This type of lawlessness \nand misguided legal reasoning by the Bush administration will not be \nlooked upon kindly in the history books.\n  The amendment now before us can begin to right the injustices the \nBush administration has committed. I am pleased Chairman Rockefeller's \nSenate Intelligence Committee rejected the administration's efforts to \nprovide immunity for the Government officials who conceived and \nauthorized this program. Democrats have made certain no one in the Bush \nadministration who broke the law will be let off the hook.\n  I am also sympathetic to the phone companies' compliance with \nGovernment requests for assistance in the immediate aftermath of the \nterrible attacks of September 11. I can understand the argument that in \na time of national emergency, they did their utmost to act in the best \ninterests of our country. But this illegal program continued for 5 \nyears after the rubble of 9/11 had been cleared--5 years--5 years \nduring which the executive branch could have come to Congress and asked \nfor the program to be put on solid legal footing--all they would have \nhad to have done is come and tell us there were a few changes that \nneeded to be made--and 5 years that the phone companies could have \nforced the administration to do a number of different things.\n  Public reports indicate that at least one phone company refused to \nfollow the administration's request. This fact appears to undermine the \nargument for immunity of those who complied. When Congress drafted and \nenacted FISA in 1978, it was responding to widespread and egregious \nexecutive branch abuses of the power to spy on American citizens. \nLiability protections were included for phone companies responding in \ngood faith to Government requests for assistance. But at the same time, \nCongress set out specific statutory requirements for the form such \nrequests must take.\n  The intention was that the phone companies would have refused an \nillegal request not in compliance with FISA requirements. In other \nwords, FISA's drafters intended for the phone companies to serve as an \nactive check, not as a rubberstamp, on an executive branch acting \noutside the bounds of the law. It is not clear whether the telephone \ncompanies fulfilled that responsibility.\n  In light of that, I believe it is more than appropriate to ask the \ncourts to examine the telephone companies' actions and to evaluate \nwhether they acted properly. It would certainly be within the power of \na judge to provide immunity if the telephone companies make a \ncompelling case their actions were appropriate and legal. But providing \nimmunity without ever undertaking such an evaluation would send a\n\n[[Page S15765]]\n\ndangerous signal that requirements we enact prospectively may be \nignored with impunity.\n  I appreciate the need for an intelligence community to gather \ninformation that makes our country safer in a way that does not violate \nthe privacy of law-abiding Americans. In many cases, the telephone \ncompanies played an important and responsible role in that process. It \nis not my desire to bankrupt the industry. That is an understatement. \nShould the courts determine their actions were illegal and impose a \npotential bankrupting judgment, I would be inclined to support \ncongressional intervention, of course. But we must not attempt to \nanswer these questions prematurely. This process must be allowed to \nwork its way through the courts. It would be wrong to deny that \nprocess.\n  I would also like to say again I believe this process deserves the \ninformed input of every Senator. To that end, last Friday, I sent a \nletter to the Director of National Intelligence, strongly urging him to \nmake the documents previously provided to the Intelligence and \nJudiciary Committees regarding retroactive immunity available in a \nsecure location to any Senator who wishes to review them during the \nfloor debate. This would also help every Senator reach an informed \ndecision on how to proceed. I am hopeful that decision will be to \nsupport this amendment and allow the legal process to move forward, \nwhich will give all Americans confidence that their safety and their \nprivacy are both respected and protected.\n  I wish to again outline briefly how much I appreciate the work of \nSenator Rockefeller. It is a very difficult piece of work. He has done \nit with integrity and with good judgment. I also wish to express my \nappreciation for the work done by the Judiciary Committee. It is not \noften we have sequential referral on the bills, but we have had in this \ninstance. The Judiciary Committee will have, if they so choose, the \nfirst amendments offered in this matter. They have done a good job. The \ntitle I work they did was extremely good.\n  It is my understanding now that Senators Rockefeller and Leahy have \nagreed with certain parts of the Judiciary Committee title I; that they \nwill offer amendments either en bloc or individual amendments jointly, \nand that is a significant improvement. So in short, this legislation \nhas been handled very well by the Intelligence Committee and the \nJudiciary Committee, and I look forward to hearing the response from \nAdmiral McConnell as to whether these documents that have been shown to \nthe Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee will be \navailable to us, I assume, in room 407 in this building.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I sent to \nAdmiral McConnell be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate.\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 16, 2007.\n     Admiral John M. McConnell,\n     Director of National Intelligence, Office of the Director of \n         National Intelligence, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Admiral McConnell: As you know, the Senate will begin \n     debate on the FISA Amendments Act of 2007 this week. Among \n     the issues the Senate will consider is whether to grant \n     retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that are \n     alleged to have assisted the government in its warrantless \n     wiretapping program. You recently wrote in the New York Times \n     that immunity is one of the three most critical issues in \n     this bill.\n       We appreciate that you have provided access to the \n     documents necessary for evaluation of this issue to the \n     Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, as each has in \n     turn considered it. As the debate now moves to the full \n     Senate, I believe it is of critical importance that all \n     Senators who will be called upon to vote on this important \n     question have an opportunity to review these key documents \n     themselves so that they may draw their own conclusions. In my \n     view, each sitting Senator has a constitutional right of \n     access to these documents before voting on this matter.\n       I strongly urge you to make the documents previously \n     provided to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committee \n     regarding retroactive immunity available in a secure location \n     to any Senator who wishes to review them during the floor \n     debate. I appreciate your cooperation in this matter.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                        Harry Reid\n                                           Senate Majority Leader.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have tried to work through this process, \nand it appears quite clear at this stage, on this bill, we are not \ngoing to be able to do that. As everyone knows, we are in the last \nhours, days, certainly, of this first year of this session of Congress, \nand we have to take care of the domestic spending, we have the debate \ncoming up on funding for the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, the \nsupplemental, and I think it is very clear we are not going to be able \nto move into these amendments.\n  We have had a number of suggestions by a number of different people \nhow we can move through this legislation, and it appears quite clear at \nthis stage that we can't. I have spoken to a number of the Senators, \nand everyone feels it would be in the best interest of the Senate that \nwe take a look at this when we come back after the first of the year \nand resume this. I have spoken to, for example, Senator Dodd, a few \nminutes ago, and he and I have talked about ways to move forward--of \ncourse, Senator Dodd can always speak for himself--but my feeling, \nafter having visited with him, is we would be better off moving into \nthis sometime after we come back after the holiday recess, after the \nadjournment sine die of this year of the Congress.\n  So unless something untoward appears, which I doubt extremely \nseriously, this is what we will do on FISA; that is, we will take it \nback up when we return in January.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Before he leaves the floor, I wish to thank the Democratic \nleader. He has a very difficult job under any circumstances. To people \nwho ask: What is it like to be the leader in the Senate, I often \ndescribe it as trying to keep frogs in a wheelbarrow. It always gets a \npretty good reaction when I mention that. He has a lot of frogs to deal \nwith around here. Trying to keep us all moving in the same direction is \nnot easy.\n  Mr. REID. If I could respond to my friend, at this stage, in Iowa, \nthey are laughing at just about all the jokes, aren't they?\n  Mr. DODD. As Mo Udall once said: I walked into a barber shop in New \nHampshire and said: I am Mo Udall, and I am running for President. And \nthe barber said: We were just laughing about that.\n  But I wished to thank the leader. This is an awkward time, obviously, \nand I wanted to get the bill done. I think Senators Rockefeller and \nBond did a good part of this bill, and it is worthy of our support.\n  The leader knows my longstanding concerns over this retroactive \nimmunity. There is significant debate about this, and I feel strongly \nabout it. I will look forward to coming back in January, and hopefully \nbetween now and coming back, maybe there would be some suggestions on \nhow we might ease some of the concerns people have and satisfy them, \nwithout necessarily granting retroactive immunity.\n  I know there are various ideas kicking around, some sort of a \ncompromise idea that may be worked out. Certainly, there will be some \ntime to think about this so we can avoid this when it comes back again. \nI appreciate the fact we are not going to proceed with it now. That \ngives us a chance to work on this some more. We have at least some \ntime, I think the end of January or early February before the law will \nexpire, so we have some time to come back and deal with this again. I \nappreciate the fact we are not going to have to go forward. I would \nhave been put in a position to contest this in every possible way, \nutilizing all the tools available to us, and I am very grateful to the \nleader for moving on. I promise I certainly will be willing to listen \nto various ideas how we can resolve this, so when we come back here, \nthis will be a matter we can deal with more expeditiously, but I am \nvery grateful to him for giving me an opportunity to make my case.\n\n[[Page S15766]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the kind comments of my friend from \nConnecticut. He is one of our most articulate spokespersons we have in \nthe Senate and always has been. I have enjoyed my work with him.\n  This is a very difficult issue. The American public is terribly \nconcerned about this issue because it is easy to focus on. What has \ntaken place in this country the last 7 years has really hurt the \nconfidence of the American people in their Government.\n  We have the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the \ncountry in the invasion of Iraq. We are spending now $12 billion a \nmonth there.\n  We have now a condition where much of the Government has been \ncontracted out. The poster for that, of course, is Blackwater. I heard \nan account on the radio this morning that the Iraqis can't tell the \ndifference between the American troops and these contractors, and all \nthe contractors do is hurt them--not the troops but these contractors.\n  We have had this domestic surveillance situation, which is really \nfrightening to people. In Nevada, we don't like wiretaps. We don't like \nlie detector tests. We are very private people. I think that is \nbasically where America is. They don't like their privacy invaded.\n  We all want to get the bad guys. We know there are evil people out \nthere trying to hurt us. The patriotism of the Senator from Connecticut \nand the Senator from Nevada will compare to that of anyone else in the \nSenate. Because we believe this retroactive immunity is something that \nneeds to be studied very closely, that doesn't mean we are any less \npatriotic than anyone else.\n  This is an issue on which the American people are focused. I have \ngotten, in the last week or so, thousands of inquiries from around the \ncountry. This is an issue they understand and they do not like. \nHopefully, when we come back after the first of the year, we can figure \nout a way to move through this. We know we have to do something, but we \ncan't continue to make mistakes in this regard that continually take \naway the confidence of the American people in what we are doing back \nhere.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see the majority whip as well. I just want \nto take a couple of minutes and conclude my thoughts on this matter, \nsince we will be moving on.\n\n       Americans have rightfully been concerned since before World \n     War II about the dangers of hostile foreign agents likely to \n     commit acts of espionage. Similarly, the violent acts of \n     political terrorists can seriously endanger the rights of \n     Americans. Carefully focused intelligence investigations can \n     help prevent such acts.\n       But too often intelligence has lost this focus and domestic \n     intelligence activities have invaded individual privacy and \n     violated the rights of lawful assembly and political \n     expression. Unless new and tighter controls are established \n     by legislation, domestic intelligence activities threaten to \n     undermine our democratic society and fundamentally alter its \n     nature.\n                                  ____\n\n       A tension between order and liberty is inevitable in any \n     society. A Government must protect its citizens from those \n     bent on engaging in violence and criminal behavior, or in \n     espionage and other hostile foreign intelligence activity  .  \n     .  . Intelligence work has, at times, successfully prevented \n     dangerous and abhorrent acts, such as bombings and foreign \n     spying, and aided in the prosecution of those responsible for \n     such acts.\n       But, intelligence activity in the past decades has, all too \n     often, exceeded the restraints on the exercise of \n     governmental power which are imposed by our country's \n     Constitution, laws, and traditions.\n                                  ____\n\n       We have seen segments of our Government, in their attitudes \n     and action, adopt tactics unworthy of a democracy, and \n     occasionally reminiscent of the tactics of totalitarian \n     regimes. We have seen a consistent pattern in which programs \n     initiated with limited goals, such as preventing criminal \n     violence or identifying foreign spies, were expanded to what \n     witnesses characterized as `vacuum cleaners,'' sweeping in \n     information about lawful activities of American citizens.\n                                  ____\n\n       That these abuses have adversely affected the \n     constitutional rights of particular Americans is beyond \n     question. But we believe the harm extends far beyond the \n     citizens directly affected.\n       Personal privacy is protected because it is essential to \n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Our Constitution checks \n     the power of Government for the purpose of protecting the \n     rights of individuals, in order that all our citizens may \n     live in a free and decent society. Unlike totalitarian \n     states, we do not believe that any government has a monopoly \n     on truth.\n       When Government infringes those rights instead of nurturing \n     and protecting them, the injury spreads far beyond the \n     particular citizens targeted to untold number of other \n     Americans who may be intimidated.\n                                  ____\n\n       Abuse thrives on secrecy. Obviously, public disclosure of \n     matters such as the names of intelligence agents or the \n     technological details of collection methods is inappropriate. \n     But in the field of intelligence, secrecy has been extended \n     to inhibit review of the basic programs and practices \n     themselves.\n       Those within the Executive branch and the Congress who \n     would exercise their responsibilities wisely must be fully \n     informed. The American public, as well, should know enough \n     about intelligence activities to be able to apply its good \n     sense to the underlying issues of policy and morality.\n       Knowledge is the key to control. Secrecy should no longer \n     be allowed to shield the existence of constitutional, legal \n     and moral problems from the scrutiny of all three branches of \n     government or from the American people themselves.\n\n  These words I wish I could claim them as my own. These are words that \nwere written some 31 years ago by Frank Church, in a committee that \ninitiated the idea of FISA. They talked about the problems they had \nworked on that gave birth to this legislation we are dealing with \ntoday--some 30 changes later after some 28 years. But they are words to \nlive by. They would fit almost any time, to strike that balance between \nsecurity and liberty.\n  As I quoted earlier today, some 220 years ago, Benjamin Franklin \nwarned the country that those who would sacrifice liberty for security \ndeserve neither. In many ways, today we are being asked to make a \nchoice. It was a false choice 220 years ago. It is still a false choice \ntoday. It is a false dichotomy. In fact, we are more secure when we \nsecure our liberties, when we defend them and protect them. That is the \nnature of our society. It is what has given us great strength through \nthese past more than 20 decades here and I believe will keep us more \nsecure in the years ahead.\n  It is true, technology is changing, and the means of causing us harm \nor injury are more sophisticated today; but these eternal transcendent \nrights we embrace as a nation, which each and every generation has been \nresponsible for guarding, are no less important today than they were \nyears ago.\n  So the words of Frank Church and the committee members, Republican \nand Democratic, who signed this document some 31 years ago, are as true \ntoday. They are what caused me to stand here today for 8 or 9 hours. \nThey are what caused me to stand here a year ago to speak out strongly \nagainst the Military Commissions Act and other such actions by this \nadministration over the past number of years.\n  I know it is not normal--certainly for this Member--to threaten to \nfilibuster or to engage in extended debate, but I felt so strongly \nabout this provision in this bill, this retroactive immunity, that I \nwas determined to do everything I could to stop this legislation going \nforward with those provisions included. I am grateful we are going to \nmove on to other legislation.\n  We will return to this, apparently, in January. My hope is that \nbetween now and then we can resolve this matter, and that retroactive \nimmunity will no longer be a part of this. We will not allow it. I \ndon't know if it is possible. I hope it is. If not, I will be back here \nengaging in the same effort to stop this legislation going forward with \nthose provisions included.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues, to Senator Kennedy, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Wyden, Senator Bill Nelson, Senator Boxer, who spoke earlier \ntoday, to Senator Sherrod Brown, who spoke, as well, about this \nlegislation, and others who came to the floor to express their concerns \nprincipally about this provision.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, who certainly gave \nme the opportunity to continue this effort. He has at his disposal \nprocedures he could engage in, and he did not utilize those. He allowed \nthis Senator to make his case to extend this debate to 30 hours, which \nis what I was prepared to do, then offer amendments to engage in \nextended debate if necessary to stop this from going forward. That, \napparently, will not be necessary now, to engage in those efforts. So I \nam grateful to my colleagues for giving me this opportunity to make my \ncase and hopeful that when we pass FISA legislation, it will not \ninclude retroactive immunity. That would be the wrong thing to do, a \ndangerous precedent, and I hope my\n\n[[Page S15767]]\n\ncolleagues on both sides will come to that conclusion.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude I honor the life of a brave soldier from Richmond, IN. SPC \nJohnathan Lahmann, 21 years old, died December 10th in Tikrit, Iraq. \nSpecialist Lahmann died of injuries he sustained in Bayhi, Iraq, when \nan improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. With an \noptimistic future before him, John risked everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the \nworld.\n  John was a 2004 graduate of Richmond High School where he avidly \nstudied auto repair with plans to be a mechanic. According to his \nteacher, Roy Reisinger, John was so dedicated to studying auto repair \nthat he would go to Mr. Reisinger's house on the weekends to work on \ncars. Mr. Reisinger described John to a local newspaper as ``a top-\nnotch mechanic'' and ``an all-around good young man.'' In addition to \nhis strong work ethic praised by his teachers, his fellow classmates \nrecall John's pleasant demeanor and his friendship.\n  After graduation, John worked at Mosey Manufacturing. In September \n2005, John joined the Army, where he was trained as a combat engineer. \nHe was assigned to the 59th Engineer Company, 20th Engineer Battalion, \n36th Engineer Brigade, Fort Hood, TX. In November 2007, John was \ndeployed to Iraq. He is survived by his parents, Linda and Alan C. \nLahmann.\n  Today, I join John's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of John. Today and always, John will be \nremembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true \nAmerican hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring John's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of John's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of SPC Johnathan Alan Lahmann in \nthe official record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like John's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Johnathan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/17/senate-section/article/S15767-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15767-S15768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IRAQ FUNDING\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of debate in \nrecent weeks about whether to fund the needs of our soldiers overseas. \nThe time to act has come.\n  We are nearing the end of the first quarter of the fiscal year, and \ndespite steady progress in Iraq, Congress still has not passed a \nfunding bill for our soldiers. Members of this body have been aware of \nthe consequences of delaying funding for a long time.\n  In a November 8 letter, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England \nexplained that failure to fund military operations will ``result in \nhaving to shut down significant portions of the Defense Department by \nearly next year.'' The specific consequences, in Secretary England's \nwords, include ``closure of military facilities, furloughing of \ncivilian workers and deferral of contract activity.'' In case there is \nany confusion about what this means to the military, Secretary England \nis quite clear: ``this situation will result in a profoundly negative \nimpact on the defense civilian workforce, depot maintenance, base \noperations, and training activities.''\n  He also acknowledged that this delay in funding doesn't only harm our \nmilitary but also sets back the training and equipping of Iraqi and \nAfghan security forces, whose expeditious development is critical to \nlasting peace in those nations.\n  This delay in funding shows a lack of support for our troops in \nharm's way, disregard for the measurable progress they have achieved in \nrecent months, and indifference to the future of Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThat is not the kind of leadership the American people expect of \nCongress.\n  It is time to heed the clear warnings from the Department of Defense, \ncome together in support of the progress our soldiers are making, and \nprovide them with the necessary resources so that they can continue \ntheir important work on behalf of the American people.\n  A December 8 article in the Washington Post by LT Pete Hegseth and \nGEN John Batista, a prominent critic of the Administration's policy in \nIraq, encouraged Americans ``to stand together, in and out of \nuniform,'' and commit to defeating our enemies. That means supporting \nthe progress our soldiers are achieving and providing them the funds \nnecessary to complete their mission and, thus, make Americans safer.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the attached article printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Washington Post, 8, 2007]\n\n       Congress has been entangled in a war-funding debate that \n     pits war ``supporters'' against antiwar ``defeatists.'' With \n     all sides seemingly entrenched, a stalemate looms. The \n     Pentagon, meanwhile, will soon begin stripping money from its \n     training budget to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       Our military men and women deserve better than partisan \n     politics; they deserve honest assessments of our nation's \n     performance in fighting the Long War.\n       We are veterans of the Iraq war with vastly different \n     experiences. Both of us commanded troops in Iraq. We, too, \n     held seemingly entrenched, and incompatible, views upon our \n     return. One of us spoke out against mismanagement of the \n     war--failed leadership, lack of strategy and misdirection. \n     The other championed the cause of successfully completing our \n     mission.\n       Our perspectives were different, yet not as stark as the \n     ``outspoken general'' and ``stay-the-course supporter'' \n     labels we received. Such labels are oversimplified and \n     inaccurate, and we are united behind a greater purpose.\n       It's time to discuss the way forward rather than prosecute \n     the past. Congress must do the same, for our nation and the \n     troops.\n       Overall, this will require learning from our strategic \n     blunders, acknowledging successes achieved by our courageous \n     military and forging a bold path. We believe America can and \n     must rally around five fundamental tenets:\n       First, the United States must be successful in the fight \n     against worldwide Islamic extremism.\n       We have seen this ruthless enemy firsthand, and its global \n     ambitions are undeniable. This struggle, the Long War, will \n     probably take decades to prosecute. Failure is not an option.\n       Second, whether or not we like it, Iraq is central to that \n     fight. We cannot walk away from our strategic interests in \n     the region. Iraq cannot become a staging ground for Islamic \n     extremism or be dominated by other powers in the region, such \n     as Iran and Syria. A premature or precipitous withdrawal from\n\n[[Page S15768]]\n\n     Iraq, without the requisite stability and security, is likely \n     to cause the violence there--which has decreased \n     substantially but is still present--to cascade into an even \n     larger humanitarian crisis.\n       Third, the counterinsurgency campaign led by Gen. David \n     Petraeus is the correct approach in Iraq. It is showing \n     promise of success and, if continued, will provide the Iraqi \n     government the opportunities it desperately needs to \n     stabilize its country. Ultimately, however, these military \n     gains must be cemented with regional and global diplomacy, \n     political reconciliation, and economic recovery--tools yet \n     sufficiently utilized. Today's tactical gains in Iraq--while \n     a necessary pre-condition for political reconciliation--will \n     crumble without a deliberate and comprehensive strategy.\n       Fourth, our strategy in fighting the Long War must address \n     Iran. Much has been made this week of the intelligence \n     judgments that Iran has stopped its weapons program. No \n     matter what, Iran must not be permitted to become a nuclear \n     power. All options should be exhausted before we use military \n     force, but force, nonetheless, should never be off the table. \n     Diplomatic efforts--from a position of strength, both \n     regionally and globally--must be used to engage our friends \n     and coerce our enemies to apply pressure on the Iranian \n     regime.\n       Fifth, our military capabilities need to match our national \n     strategy. Our military is stretched thin and will be hard-\n     pressed to maintain its current cycle of deployments. At this \n     critical juncture, we cannot afford to be weak. Numbers and \n     capacity matter.\n       After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, America was not \n     mobilized for the Long War. This was an opportunity lost, but \n     it is not too late. Many Americans are frustrated by the war \n     effort, the burden of which has been shouldered by less than \n     one percent of our citizenry. Our country is accustomed to \n     winning. We deserve a comprehensive strategy that is focused \n     on victory and guided by decisive leadership. America must \n     succeed in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we also cannot focus too \n     narrowly on those conflicts. We need a regional and global \n     strategy to defeat worldwide Islamic extremism to ensure a \n     safer world today and for future generations.\n       The day after his famous Pearl Harbor speech, President \n     Franklin D. Roosevelt again addressed the nation. ``I was \n     about to add that ahead there lies sacrifice for all of us,'' \n     he said. ``But it is not correct to use that word. The United \n     States does not consider it a sacrifice to do all one can, to \n     give one's best to our nation, when the nation is fighting \n     for its existence and its future life.'' His words inspired \n     the ``Greatest Generation,'' and they should inspire us again \n     today.\n       Americans must mobilize for the Long War--bolster our \n     strained military, galvanize industry to supply troops with \n     what they need right now and fund the strategy with long-term \n     solutions. We have no doubt that Americans will rally behind \n     a call to arms.\n       America's veterans--young and old--are resolved to support \n     and defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and \n     domestic. This commitment, and nothing less, should compel us \n     to stand together, in and out of uniform. Would that Congress \n     finds the courage to bury its pride and do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/17/senate-section/article/S15768-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FHA MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the FHA \nModernization Act of 2007, and I hope the House and Senate can quickly \nwork together to get this legislation to the President. This bill is a \ngood first step to helping address both housing affordability issues \nand problems in the subprime lending industry. I look forward to \nmonitoring the legislation's implementation to ensure that the FHA \nreforms truly benefit low-income and middle-income homeowners.\n  The rising rate of foreclosures and its broader impact on the \nnation's economy is a serious issue that requires the involvement of \nall levels of government as well as both private and non-profit \norganizations. Subprime lending and rising foreclosure rates are \ncomplicated issues to unravel and any response, whether legislative or \nregulatory, will bring with it a set of consequences, some intended and \nsome unintended. We need to examine a variety of responses to the \nrising foreclosure rates and their consequences, including providing \nmore housing counseling for borrowers and more effectively regulating \nlending practices to prevent some of the unscrupulous practices that \nhave occurred. Some of the more egregious lending practices include \nhigh rates of predatory lending in minority communities, steering \nborrowers into subprime mortgage products even if the borrowers \nqualified for more conventional loans, and not ensuring that borrowers \nfully understood the terms of subprime loans.\n  I was disappointed that the Senate FHA Modernization Act did not \ncontain a provision directing some of the revenue realized by the FHA \nbill into an affordable housing fund as the House FHA reform bill did. \nI hope that conferees will work hard to find a fiscally responsible way \nto direct some of the increased revenue from the FHA bill into a \nnational affordable housing trust fund. I also hope that Congress can \npass stand-alone legislation creating a national affordable housing \ntrust fund in the coming year.\n  The creation of more affordable housing through a national affordable \nhousing trust fund will also help to alleviate the affordable housing \ncrisis we are facing throughout the country. Local communities around \nthe country are creating such trust funds, including in my state of \nWisconsin. Congress needs to act promptly so that a national affordable \nhousing trust fund can complement the good work going on in states and \nlocal communities throughout the country.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced legislation, the Affordable Housing \nExpansion and Public Safety Act, which contained provisions designed to \nassist low-income Americans in affording safe and adequate housing, \nincluding authorizing 100,000 new Section 8 vouchers, authorizing new \ntargeted funding for the HOME program, reauthorizing the Public and \nAssisted Housing Crime and Drug Elimination Program, and calling on \nCongress to create a national affordable housing trust fund. I hope \nthat Congress can take a step toward the creation of such a fund by \nincluding a provision in the FHA reform bill conference report to \ndedicate a fiscally responsible revenue stream toward such a national \naffordable housing trust fund.\n  This Nation faces a severe shortage of affordable housing for our \nmost vulnerable citizens. Shelter is one of our most basic needs, and, \nunfortunately, too many Wisconsinites and people around the country are \nstruggling to afford a place to live for themselves and their families. \nAs Congress continues to take steps to deal with affordability issues, \nrising foreclosure rates, and reform of lending practices by banks and \nmortgage brokers, we need to ensure that any such reforms benefit those \nAmericans most in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/17/senate-section/article/S15768-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes \nlaw, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Early in the morning of December 8, 2007, 25-year-old Nathaniel \nSalerno was attacked by five to seven men on a Washington, DC, Metro \nsubway train. Salerno, a gay man, had been at several clubs prior to \nreturning home. Shortly after boarding the train, the men approached \nhim and allegedly demanded that Salerno give them his wallet and \nBlackBerry. When he stood up, the attackers snatched the items and \nbegan to punch and kick him, screaming antigay slurs. Salerno received \nstitches for the lacerations he received to his face during the attack. \nWashington's Metro police are investigating the assault as a bias-\nrelated violent crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/17/senate-section/article/S15768-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15768-S15769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the energy \nlegislation Congress is on the brink of passing in these last days of \nthe first session of the 110th Congress. I voted against this \nlegislation in the Senate because it contains numerous provisions that \nwill distort competitive markets for energy through subsidies, \nGovernment mandates, special projects, and irresponsible increases in \nFederal spending. This bill will not promote the goal of energy \nsecurity but will likely increase fuel and food prices and reduce \nconsumer choice for everything from cars to light bulbs.\n\n[[Page S15769]]\n\n  First, I want to talk about ethanol. It is difficult to understand \nwhy Congress continues to believe that ethanol is a desirable \nsubstitute for gasoline. It is widely reported that even if all of the \n300 million acres--500,000 square miles--of currently harvested U.S. \ncropland produced ethanol, they wouldn't supply all of the gasoline and \ndiesel fuel we now burn for transport, and they would supply only about \nhalf of the demand for the year 2025. We are not going to grow our way \nto energy security. We are also starting to see the devastating effects \nour current ethanol production is having on our scarce water supply, \nthe environment, and human health.\n  Despite these facts, one of the bill's most prominent features is a \nfive-fold increase in the ethanol mandate from the currently required \n7.5 billon gallons by 2012 to 36 billion gallons by 2022. Meeting this \nmandate will require even more corn-based ethanol and the production of \nother so-called advanced biofuels, largely made from cellulosic \nethanol. Although cellulosic ethanol production is in its infancy and \ndoes not exist commercially today, the bill specifies that 21 billion \ngallons of the 36 billion gallons mandated be cellulosic ethanol. This \nis nothing more than a congressional gamble with American taxpayer \ndollars.\n  If Congress is serious about moving away from oil to alternative \nfuels it cannot, as it has done here, subsidize political favorites and \nengage in statutory prescription. This will actually slow energy \ninnovation and may even retard the gains we have made. An excellent \nexample of this point is the exclusion of woody biomass material from \nour Nation's overgrown forests from the production of advanced \nbiofuels. Companies throughout the West, including many small \nbusinesses, are working in partnership with the Federal Government to \nhelp restore our national forests by removing this woody biomass \nmaterial and using it to produce energy. This oversight in the bill \ncomplicates these efforts and could seriously slow the gains my home \nState of Arizona and other Western States dominated by Federal lands \nhave made to combat catastrophic wildfire.\n  Now, let's turn to the other major feature of this bill--federally \nmandated increases in corporate average fuel economy, CAFE, standards. \nThis bill requires each manufacturer's fleet to average 35 miles per \ngallon by 2020, a roughly 40 percent increase over current standards \nfor cars and trucks. What this proposal seems to overlook is that more \nfuel efficient cars and trucks already exist on the market for those \nwho want them. And as gas prices rise, my guess is increasing numbers \nof consumers will buy smaller, more fuel efficient cars without being \ntold to do so by Congress. The point is that this is a consumer choice \nissue. By federally mandating these increases there will be less \nchoice, increases in car sticker prices, and the very real possibility \nof more unnecessary highway deaths due to the increases in lighter \nvehicles, which generally are less safe in collisions on the road. A \nNational Academy of Sciences study concluded that vehicle downsizing \ncosts 1,300 to 2,600 lives per year.\n  Another major problem with the CAFE provisions in the bill is the \nfailure to clarify the regulatory responsibilities of the National \nHighway Transportation Safety Board and the Environmental Protection \nAgency over the regulation of tailpipe emissions and fuel economy \nrequirements. The administration in its Statement of Administration \nPolicy makes this point. Failing to address this issue will likely \nleave industry to sort through layers of contradictory regulation.\n  Beyond the biofuels and CAFE provisions, the bill includes a full \nassortment of new efficiency mandates for appliances and buildings and \neven takes measures to phase out incandescent lightbulbs. Industry in \nthe private sector has already brought to market alternative lighting \ntechnologies to the traditional lightbulb, and as prices drop consumers \nare switching over to them. Provisions like these are nothing more than \nCongress's attempt to take credit for something the market is already \ndoing and accomplishing far more quickly and efficiently than the \ngovernment can, I might add.\n  In sum, instead of enacting poor energy policy, Congress should focus \non what it must do before we leave here this year--fund the Government \nby enacting fiscally responsible appropriations bills and ensuring our \ntroops have what they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/17/senate-section/article/S15769-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PASSAGE OF FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

For more a half century, \nhe has kept the people of Maine informed, he has entertained us, and he \nhas brought us together as a community of friends and neighbors. He has \nbrought the best of Maine into our homes, and he has always been a \nwelcome guest.\n  Still going strong today, George Hale will forever be associated with \nthe Bangor Auditorium and the great high school basketball tournaments \nheld there, but that is just a start. University of Maine football, \nbaseball, and basketball have all benefited from his great work, and he \nis beloved by generations of fans, coaches, and players. Whether \ndescribing victory or defeat, he always treats the athletes with \nrespect and appreciation for their efforts.\n  Generations of Mainers have begun their day with George. Many used to \nbegin their day by tuning in at 5:45 a.m. to hear his thoughts and \ncomments on everything ranging from Red Sox to world affairs.\n  And the tradition continues today. Along with his friend and cohost \nRic Tyler, George's show provides news and insight about the issues \nfacing Maine and the Nation. As one who has appeared on his show many \ntimes, I can say that George always treats his guests with fairness and \nrespect.\n  George was blessed with a great voice, and he has used it well as a \npowerful spokesman for great causes. His support for the March of \nDimes, and especially his advocacy for the folic acid campaign, has \ngreatly helped this outstanding organization carry out is vital mission \nof improving the health of babies by preventing birth defects and \ninfant mortality. The March of Dimes and George Hale truly are a \nchampionship team.\n  WABI-AM radio is known as the Voice of Maine. It is a fitting name \nbecause George Hale truly is the Voice of Maine. He is a great friend \nto me and to all the people of my State. I know we all look forward to \nmany more years of hearing that great voice from the George Hale \nStudio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/17/senate-section/article/S15769-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15769-S15770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-4357.

I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 660, and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 660) to amend title 18, United States Code, to \n     protect judges, prosecutors, witnesses, victims, and their \n     family members, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at the very beginning of this Congress, one \nof the very first actions I took was to re-introduce the Court Security \nImprovement Act of 2007, along with Senators Reid, Specter, Durbin, \nCornyn, Kennedy, Hatch, Schumer and Collins. The Judiciary Committee \nconsidered this important legislation, and recommended it to the full \nSenate. When Majority Leader Reid wanted to move to consider it, he \ncould not get a time agreement. We were forced to dedicate almost a \nweek of precious floor time to overcome a Republican objection, just to \nproceed to debate on the bill. Eventually, the measure passed by a 97 \nto 0 vote. Not a single Senator voted against it. A short time later, a \nnearly identical bill passed the House by a voice vote. Despite the \nbroad bipartisan support for both bills, however, we were blocked from \ngoing to conference to resolve the minor differences between them by an \nanonymous hold placed by a Republican Senator. For months, we \nnegotiated the minor differences between the House and Senate versions \nof this legislation.\n  When we are responding to attacks and threats on our Federal judges, \nwitnesses and officers, time is of the essence. Just last month in \nNevada, a man admitted to shooting and injuring the family court judge \nwho was presiding over his divorce. This type of violence against our \njudiciary can and must be prevented. For our justice system to function \neffectively, our judges and other court personnel must be safe and \nsecure. They and their families must be free from the fear of \nretaliation and harassment. Witnesses who come forward must be \nprotected, and the courthouses where our laws are enforced must be \nsecure. Today, almost eleven months after introducing this legislation, \nwe may actually reach consent to pass a compromise version that will \npass the House and be sent to the President.\n  We must act now to get these protections in place and stop delaying \nsuch protective measures by anonymous holds. I urge Senators to take up \nand pass this compromise version of the Court Security Improvement Act \nso that we can provide the necessary protections that our Federal \ncourts so desperately need. The security of our Federal judges and our \ncourthouses around the Nation is at stake.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on H.R. 660, the \nCourt Security Improvement Act of 2007. Section 509 of the final \nsubstitute transfers one seat from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit. The reasons for this change are explained in Senator \nFeinstein's and my additional views in S. Rept. 110-42.\n  Section 102 of the bill authorizes the U.S. Marshals Service to \nprovide protection to the U.S. Tax Court, and stipulates that the \nMarshals Service retains final authority regarding the Tax Court's \nsecurity needs. The Tax Court has expressed concern to me and to other \nMembers that the Marshals Service should consult with the Tax Court \nabout the costs that it expects to incur for providing security--costs \nthat will be charged to the Tax Court. The Marshals Service has assured \nCongress that it will consult with the Tax Court on these matters and \nthat it will not surprise the Tax Court with charges that the court may \nhave difficulty paying. Rather than include heavy-handed consultation \nrequirements in the text of the legislation, we have agreed to adopt \nthe bill in its current form on the strength of these assurances.\n  Section 202 of the bill makes it an offense to disseminate sensitive \npersonal information about Federal police officers and criminal \ninformants and witnesses. The final version extends this offense to \nalso protect State law enforcement officers, but only to the extent \nthat their participation in Federal activities creates a Federal \ninterest sufficient to maintain this provision's consistency with \nprinciples of federalism.\n  Section 207 increases statutory maximum penalties for manslaughter \nunder section 1112 of title 18. I expect the U.S. Sentencing Commission \nto revise its guidelines for these offenses in light of these new \nhigher statutory maxima. I commented on the need for these changes when \nthe Senate version of this bill passed the Senate earlier this year and \nwould refer interested parties to those remarks and especially to Paul \nCharlton's testimony, at 153 Cong. Rec. S4739-4741, daily ed. April 19, \n2007.\n  Section 208 increases the penalties for retaliatory assaults against \nFederal judges' family members. This provision also clarifies an \nassault offense that was created by Congress in 1994. The offense \nestablishes penalties for simple assault, assault with bodily injury, \nand for assault in ``all other cases.'' As one might imagine, the \nmeaning of assault in ``all other cases'' has been the subject of \nconfusion and judicial debate. The offense has also been the subject of \nconstant vagueness challenges, and although those legal challenges have \nbeen rejected, the offense is rather vague. Section 208 takes the \nopportunity to correct this legislative sin, codifying what I believe \nis the most thoughtful explanation of what this\n\n[[Page S15790]]\n\nlanguage means, the 10th Circuit's decision in United States v. \nHathaway, 318 F.3d 1001, 1008-09, 10th Cir. 2003. A conforming change \nhas also been made to section Ill of title 18, so that sections 111 and \n115 will match each other and, again, so that people can easily figure \nout what this offense actually proscribes.\n  Section 503 of the bill guarantees that senior district judges may \nelect to participate in court rulemaking, appointment of magistrates \nand court officers, and other administrative matters, so long as such \njudges carry at least half of the caseload of an active district judge. \nI believe that this provision is a bad idea, though its negative \nconsequences have been greatly mitigated in this final substitute as a \nresult of the intervention of Senator Sessions. Many senior judges are \noften not present at the courthouse and are disengaged from the work of \nthe court and the life of the court. Moreover, Congress has no business \ntelling the courts how to manage these types of internal organizational \nmatters. Those jurists who share my objection to this provision should \nbe grateful to Senator Sessions, who insisted that the provision be \nlimited to district judges as opposed to circuit judges, that a senior \njudge be required to elect to exercise these functions, and that a \nsenior judge carry at least half of a full caseload in order to be \nentitled to assume these powers.\n  Finally, section 511 adds nomenclature to section 2255 of title 28, a \nchange recommended to me by Kent Scheidegger of the Criminal Justice \nLegal Foundation. This change has no substantive effect but should make \nthis code section easier for litigants to cite.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that a Leahy substitute amendment \nat the desk be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements related to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the work by my colleague, \nSenator Feinstein, who chairs the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, and by other Senators over many years to accomplish \nthis merger of the U.S. Capitol Police and the Library of Congress \nPolice.\n  The U.S. Capitol Police and Library of Congress Police Merger and \nImplementation Act of 2007 provides that employees of the Library of \nCongress Police shall be transferred to the United States Capitol \nPolice. I would like to ask my colleague Senator Feinstein about \nprovisions under which the Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police will make \ncertain final determinations regarding the incoming Library of Congress \nPolice employees that shall not be appealable or reviewable in any \nmanner. It is my understanding that these provisions would generally \nprevent individuals from appealing or seeking review of the \ndeterminations of the Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police, but would not \nlimit the right of any individual to seek any appropriate relief under \nthe Congressional Accountability Act if these determinations by the \nChief allegedly violated that act.\n  The Congressional Accountability Act was enacted in 1995 to provide \nto congressional employees the same rights and protections that are \navailable to other employees in our Nation, including protection \nagainst discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, \nreligion, or age. My understanding is that the merger legislation would \nin no way limit the right of any employee covered under the \nCongressional Accountability Act to initiate an action regarding any \nalleged violation of rights protected under that Act. I have also been \ntold that this interpretation of the legislation is shared by the Chief \nof the U.S. Capitol Police, and that Library of Congress employees \ntransferring to the U.S. Capitol Police will be informed and educated \nabout their rights and protections under the Congressional \nAccountability Act.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The understanding of my colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman, is correct. The finality provisions in this \nlegislation were intended to give the Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police \nauthority to transfer employees and assign duties as necessary to meet \nthe mission of the U.S. Capitol Police in maintaining the security of \nthe Capitol complex. However, the provisions in this legislation in no \nway limit the protections and rights of an employee to seek relief \nunder the Congressional Accountability Act.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator for her assistance and courtesy.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk be \nconsidered and agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time, \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record without \nfurther intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3869) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 3690)was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/17/senate-section/article/S15790-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15790-S15791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NATIONAL TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION WEEK\n\n  Mr. DODD.
