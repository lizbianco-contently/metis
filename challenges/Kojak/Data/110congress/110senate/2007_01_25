Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from South Carolina \nsuch time as he might consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina \ncontrols the time.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair.\n  Well, here we are again. A couple of weeks ago, we were here in the \nSenate Chamber talking about the need to have full disclosure of \nearmarks--pet projects that are added into bills, only to find that the \nunderlying bill only disclosed about 5 percent of all the earmarks. \nAfter a lot of procedural maneuvering and give-and-take, fortunately, \nRepublicans and Democrats came together and realized that if we are \ngoing to do this--tell the American people we are going to disclose \nearmarks--then we should do it, and we should do it for all earmarks, \nand we should be open and honest about what we do. Fortunately, we \nfixed that problem. But here we are again today.\n  Now we are talking about raising the minimum wage for American \nworkers. We have had passionate pleas, which are warranted. There are \ntoo many people in this country who don't make a livable wage. We, as \nSenators, Congressmen, and as Americans, should do everything we can to \nhelp people earn a livable wage and better.\n  There have been a lot of passionate speeches on the floor about, What \ndo we do with a single mom with two kids working at the minimum wage? \nHow can they possibly get by? It is true. It is very true. But as we \nlook at this minimum wage bill and as we look out on America and \npromise to give every minimum wage worker a raise, we find that, if you \nreally look at the bill, less than half of the workers who are working \nat the minimum wage will receive a $2.10 increase. Many will receive \nnothing at all. So the amendment I have introduced is one that would \ngive 100 percent of Americans working at the minimum wage a raise \nbecause that is, in effect, what we are promising as we debate on the \nfloor. This amendment is called minimum fairness for workers. That is \nwhat it is all about. The idea is that every American working at \nminimum wage will receive a $2.10 increase as we have promised.\n  It is important to realize that America is very diverse and \ndifferent. States have very different costs of living. As we look \nacross the country, there are many States that have a much higher than \naverage cost of living, and some have a much lower cost of living. \nActually, more than half of the States in this country--29--have passed \na minimum wage that is higher than the $5.15 national Federal minimum \nwage.\n  We see, if you look at Massachusetts, for instance--the State of \nSenator Kennedy, who has been a great defender of the minimum wage and \nthe average worker, which I commend him on--it is one of the higher \ncost of living States in this country. They have raised their minimum \nwage to $7.50. I think we would all agree that a single mom with two \nchildren living in Boston, MA, making $7.50 an hour is not making a \nlivable wage. The fact is, that same family living in South Carolina \nand making $5.15 an hour is doing better than those who are making \n$7.50 in Massachusetts because of the cost of living. Many of the \nSouthern States have a lower average cost of living--cost of an \napartment, cost of food, and cost of transportation and taxes; it is \nmuch lower. So many States across the country have looked at their cost \nof living and have raised their minimum wage higher than the national \naverage because of that cost of living.\n  As we look at raising the national minimum wage again--and we know it \nhas been years since we have done that--we need to realize that the \ncost of living across this country is different. I commend States such \nas Massachusetts that have recognized that and passed a minimum wage \nthat is higher than the national average. But\n\n[[Page S1137]]\n\nit is not fair and it is not honest for us to have a national minimum \nwage debate and leave more than half of the minimum wage workers out of \nthis whole promise of a wage increase. It is important for us to look \nacross the country and see what this minimum wage bill will do if we \ndon't adopt the amendment I am talking about. All of the States here on \nthe chart in blue are States where the minimum wage workers will \nreceive less than a one-dime--10 cents--increase if we pass this bill. \nMost of them will receive nothing at all--after all of the promises. \nThese are some of the highest cost of living States in the country.\n  My distinguished colleague from Massachusetts talked about the \nimportance of raising the minimum wage. I know he would agree that \nsomeone making $7.50 an hour in Boston, MA, is not making a livable \nwage. If we are going to promise to help these people, the people \nworking in Massachusetts deserve a raise as much as the people working \nin South Carolina. But under this bill, the minimum wage worker in \nMassachusetts will receive no increase; Vermont will receive no \nincrease; Connecticut, Rhode Island, Washington State, Oregon, and \nCalifornia will receive no increase at all. Illinois will receive a \ndime. Yet with all this big national debate and hoopla, which has \nbecome symbolic of trying to help low-income Americans make more money, \nwe know as a body that only a fraction of 1 percent of Americans \nworking at the minimum wage will get it.\n  Yet we are trying to tell them this bill is going to raise their \nstandard of living, and we know that less than half of the minimum wage \nworkers in this country are going to receive a $2.10 increase. This \namendment is about 100 percent, just as we did 100 percent of earmarks. \nWe got together, we realized the underlying bill didn't work, and we \ndid the right thing.\n  I think there are much better ways to help people earn a livable wage \nthan mandating that they get an increase. But if we are going to do it, \nlet's do it right and let's be fair to all Americans. If we promise an \nincrease for minimum wage workers, let's give every American working at \nthe minimum wage a $2.10 increase so that a person working in \nMassachusetts with a higher cost of living would get a raise, just as \nin Louisiana or Alabama or South Carolina. Every minimum wage worker \nacross this land would have a $2.10 increase.\n  I don't think that is too much to ask. If the Senate is going to \nspend 2 weeks talking about it, if we are going to have these \nimpassioned pleas to help minimum wage workers, how can we leave half \nof minimum wage workers out of this whole process and pretend to be \nhelping everyone? It doesn't make sense. This is about 100 percent. It \nis about fairness. It is about looking at these cameras in this Chamber \nand telling people the truth.\n  If we are going to pass a minimum wage, if we think we are doing the \nright thing by mandating that we raise the minimum wage above where it \nis across this land, then let's have it apply to 50 States, 100 percent \nof our workers. That is the only fair and honest way.\n  Again, I commend the States that have had the good judgment and the \nwisdom to recognize that their cost of living is higher, but if we \ndon't include them here, then we have done an injustice to their \nworkers.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to look at this amendment. This is \nnot a trick. It is clear and simple. Every minimum wage worker in \nAmerica will get a $2.10 increase if we adopt this amendment and then \npass this final bill.\n  I will make a commitment to the Senator from Massachusetts and to \nothers here that while I have not supported this idea of mandating a \nminimum wage as the best way to improve and increase salaries, if we \nare fair, if we adopt this amendment, I will vote for the final bill \nfor raising the minimum wage because it will be fair to all Americans, \nand I will encourage my colleagues who have not supported it in the \npast to be together as a Senate.\n  Let's not come out and make an impassioned plea to raise the minimum \nwage in one State but not another. That doesn't make sense, and it is \nnot fair and it is not open. It is about 100 percent, and I encourage \n100 percent of my colleagues to look at this amendment, do the right \nthing, and include every minimum wage worker.\n  I yield back my time to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use.\n  This is the fourth day that the Senate is addressing an issue of \nenormous importance to those on the lower end of the economic ladder--\nan increase in the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25. It is not a \ncomplicated issue. Everybody in this body knows what the issues are. \nUsually, we have great debates about complicated issues in the United \nStates of America. Soon we will be debating varied policies with regard \nto Iraq, as we should. But this issue is a simple issue. It is an issue \nof simple justice. It is as old as many of us in this body. Minimum \nwage was advanced more than 70 years ago. We have increased it now nine \ntimes over recent years, and yet Republicans want to continue to delay, \ndelay, delay, delay, delay, delay, delay; oppose, oppose, oppose.\n  There was opposition yesterday in insisting that we get cloture in \nthe Senate on an increase in the minimum wage, requiring that we get 60 \nvotes before we can vote up or down on a simple, easy issue and \nquestion of fundamental fairness to workers in this country.\n  We are glad to have debates, but the message ought to go out to the \nAmerican people exactly what is going on here on day 5 in the Senate on \nthe issue of minimum wage. And we continue to have, as the minority \nleader said, scores--40, 50, more amendments, 90 amendments--on the \nissue of the increase in the minimum wage--90 amendments. Make no \nmistake about it, America, who is holding up the increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  Eight times the Senate has increased its own salary, increased the \nsalary of the good Senator from South Carolina $32,000 in the last 10 \nyears--$32,000. And if we have had 1 hour of debate on that issue--1 \nhour of debate on that issue, 1 hour of debate on that issue--I would \nbe surprised. This is the fifth day our Republican friends who, as \nMembers on the Democratic side, have enjoyed a $32,000 increase in \ntheir pay have 90 amendments to try and scuttle an increase in the \nminimum wage for low-income workers--trying to scuttle, to sink the \nincrease.\n\n  These workers understand it. Workers across this country understand \nit. Working families understand it. Middle-income people understand it. \nAll Americans understand it. This is one of those basic and fundamental \nissues people understand because it is an issue of fairness.\n  I don't impugn the motives of my friend from South Carolina, but he \nhas opposed the minimum wage on every single occasion he has addressed \nit--every single occasion. We have the record here as to how the good \nSenator has voted every time on the issue of an increase in the minimum \nwage: going back to the House of Representatives in 2002, 2005, and \nover here on seven different occasions he has voted against the \nincrease in the minimum wage. So the idea that he wants to provide \n$2.10 more to every worker in States that have raised--under the age-\nold law of the minimum wage--their minimum wage because of the failure \nof the Senate to do it has a sort of hollow ring to it. It has sort of \na hollow ring to it since he has opposed an increase in the minimum \nwage on each and every occasion we have considered it. We have to take \na look at exactly what is being done.\n  I assure my friend from South Carolina that the workers in my State \nunderstand the battle they have had to increase the minimum wage. And I \ndaresay, in the various States across the country that have increased \ntheir minimum wage, they have understood that, too. The legislators \nhave gone out and worked, and workers understand what they have done. \nThey have understood what they have done. They have understood that the \nminimum wage is a basic standard which is supposed to be the lowest \nliving wage. It is supposed to be the lowest living wage. Historically, \nit is supposed to be half of what the average wage is in the country. \nThat goes back to the time beginning of the minimum wage and the record \nshows that all the way up to probably the 1980s, and then it has\n\n[[Page S1138]]\n\ndropped precipitously, half of what it was.\n  Going back to the 1930s, the minimum wage was designed to be a floor. \nIf States want to add something to it, they can, but it ought to be a \nfloor for all workers in this country. One of the principal reasons it \nwas passed at that time is because the Members of this body, the House \nof Representatives, and the President of the United States saw what was \nhappening in different parts of the country where States were lowering \ntheir wages to try and attract industries and companies in a rush to \nthe bottom, with the exploitation of worker after worker, family after \nfamily, in a rush to the bottom. So the national decision was taken, in \nterms of fairness and as a moral issue, that workers who were going to \nwork hard were going to receive a minimum wage.\n  One of the age-old values in our country, in society, is that work \nought to pay. We hear that stated around here with great ease and \nfrequency, and that is what we are trying to do with a minimum wage \nincrease. We are trying to make work pay, pay people who are doing some \nof the most difficult work in America, and demonstrate a respect for \nthat work, give them pay because they are doing hard, difficult work, \nbut we respect our fellow Americans and respect their efforts.\n  This is not the law of the jungle. The economy of the United States \nof America isn't survival of the fittest. Some would like to have it \nthat way. Some who oppose the minimum wage would like to have it that \nway, but it isn't that way, thank God, in the United States of America. \nIt is in the jungle, but not with regard to a democracy and a free \neconomy.\n  Let me state specifically what this proposal does. The good Senator \nyesterday voted to permit any State to effectively opt out of any kind \nof minimum wage. So that would have fundamentally destroyed any kind of \nuniformity across the country.\n  His proposal is, in the wake of the Senate and Congress over 10 years \nunder Republican leadership refusing to increase the minimum wage, the \nStates in their own good judgments have done so, and now he says let's \nadd on $2.10 to do that. It does seem to me appealing in a certain \nrespect, because I believe the minimum wage is not a livable wage in \nmany parts of the country. We have seen these livable wage campaigns \nthat are taking place in Baltimore, Los Angeles--many cities around the \ncountry--my own city of Boston, and they have raised it in a particular \nregion, and it has had great success.\n  But that isn't the issue. This particular amendment of the Senator \nwould basically do what was attempted yesterday, but do it in a \ndifferent way. Yesterday was to effectively end the minimum wage by \nletting any State opt out. Today the swing of the pendulum has gone the \nother way. The amendment says we are going to add additional funds on \nto any State. Every State over these past years has noted the failure \nof the Senate as a result of Republican leadership because we have had \na majority read back the records of the votes in the Senate. We had a \nmajority in the Senate with good Republican support to raise the \nminimum wage, but we couldn't get to the 60 votes, and our Republican \nleadership wouldn't let us. So the States moved ahead. Now that the \nStates have moved ahead, the Senator wants to say: Oh, you have moved \nahead because you made a judgment about the respect for your own \nworkers, and we are going to add on to it to try to disrupt the minimum \nwage.\n  I hope this amendment will not be accepted, and I hope we will be \nable to move along and make further progress on this issue.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, could I ask what the time situation is?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina has \n18 minutes 40 seconds. The Senator from Massachusetts has 17 minutes 35 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask to have the Senator from South \nCarolina yield me 8 minutes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I need to address a few of the things that were said. ``We \nare on the fifth day of this debate.'' Yes, we are. ``It's a simple \nbill.'' No, it is not a simple bill. It is simple in the one proposal \nthat is out there, but it has a lot of interlocking implications. We \nhad some debate yesterday, separate from an amendment on tip credits. \nWe talked about work opportunity tax credits. We talked about earned-\nincome tax credits. All of those tie in with the minimum wage, so it \nhas a lot of implications.\n  It has a lot of implications for small businesses, too. I showed some \nquotes from a lady who would lose hours, another from someone who would \nlose their job. They were all in situations where they can't afford to \ndo that. There have been charts showing that on the aggregate it helps \nthe whole economy to raise the minimum wage. But on an individual basis \nit affects people individually. Small business employees understand. \nThey are really connected to their business. They know how much the \nemployer is making. They know what the markup is on things. And they \nknow whether their job is in danger or not, so there is that concern.\n  But I want to clear up something. There has not been an argument \nagainst raising the minimum wage. The argument has been for doing \nsomething to help counter the impact on small business. We have been \nacting in a bipartisan way on some things; we can act in a bipartisan \nway on this. I contend that as soon as there is some assurance to the \nminority that there will be some tax offsets for the small businesses, \nthis process will speed up dramatically. But until there is that \nassurance we will be using our opportunities, the process, to make sure \nwe can take care of small business at the same time and not put them \nout of business.\n  There has been some cooperation, at least through the press. I would \nmention that Senator Reid said:\n\n       If it takes adding small-business tax cuts to have a \n     minimum wage tax increase, we're going to do that. Maybe we \n     can get 60 votes to invoke cloture on a straight minimum \n     wage. I'm not sure we want to do that. . . . A one-party town \n     doesn't work. We have a majority of 51-49. We're going to \n     accomplish the possible; that's what we're going to do.\n\n  That was on January 5 at a press conference. I have some other quotes \nfrom him, too, but Senator Baucus said:\n\n       Small business is the engine that drives our economy and \n     creates jobs on Main Street. That's why I'm proud we are \n     getting them some tax relief from Uncle Sam. . . . It's high \n     time our workers get a raise. At the same time we are going \n     to give a boost to small business.\n\n  That was a January 17 press release.\n  Senator Kerry:\n\n       I support the majority of the provisions of the Small \n     Business and Work Opportunity Act of 2007. I would have \n     preferred that this package moved separately rather than in \n     tandem with a minimum wage bill. However, the reality is we \n     need a tax package in order to advance minimum wage \n     legislation.\n\n  That is from a January 2007 committee report, Small Business and Work \nOpportunity Act of 2007.\n  I have a whole lot of quotes from the other side of the aisle that \nhave encouraged me that we can do both things--raise the minimum wage \nand have some offsets for small business.\n  I have talked to the Senator from Massachusetts about this before. I \nunderstand his desire to have just the minimum wage increase and his \nconcern that any other discussion takes away from that. I suggested \nthat it wouldn't take away from it if it were a whole package to begin \nwith; that it would be a minimum wage increase and our concerns about \nhaving some tax breaks for the small businesses would overcome that. \nBut we have not gone that route yet.\n  The debate we had yesterday, the cloture vote we had yesterday, would \nhave excluded the possibility of doing the tax breaks. I have to tell \nyou, to get those tax breaks to offset the impact on small business has \na long road to go because the House didn't pass any of those. In fact, \nthe House has made some very detrimental comments about it. There is a \nprocess over here that enforces the rights of the minority and can \nprovide some protection for the small businesses, the mom-and-pops out \nthere trying to make enough living for their own families and provide \nfor some workers that we can take care of at the same time. But it is\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\ngoing to take some showing that there is some dual concern, both for \nthe employee and for the mom-and-pop businesses, before we move along \nmuch faster.\n  That is what the debate is about. It is not about whether to raise \nthe minimum wage. The minimum wage will be raised. I hope there are a \nwhole lot of other things that will be done in the process, too, \nbecause we need to move these people to more skilled jobs, and we need \nto get a Workforce Investment Act through, too, and I would have liked \nto see this be part of this same bill, too, so we could increase the \nskills of the employees and get them into better jobs. We don't want to \njust remove the bottom rung of the ladder and have them have to make a \nbigger step to get a job to begin with. We want them to have better \njobs. Better jobs do not hit the inflationary core quite as much.\n  I want to be sure people understand we are not talking about whether \nto do a minimum wage, we are talking about whether to do a minimum wage \nincrease and offset some of the impact for small businesses.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from South \nCarolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, this is a good debate and I think it is \nan important debate. I appreciate the points of Senator Kennedy. Many \nof them I agree with, but it is my hope that those same points will \napply to the many States, such as Massachusetts and Washington State \nand California and many other States so that those people working at \nthe minimum wage in those States will receive a minimum wage, too.\n  I appreciate the fact that he has recognized that States such as \nMassachusetts did respond to the higher cost of living that their \nworkers face by passing their own minimum wage. I think if we look \nacross the country we will see that, again, 29 States have taken that \naction because it does cost more to live there. He points out that in \nthe past I have not supported the increase in the minimum wage. It is \nnot completely true, but many times I have not supported it because it \nhas not been fair. It does not apply to all American workers.\n  As the Senator from Wyoming just pointed out, if these bills that \nmandate wage increases do not include some provisions that help small \nbusinesses stay profitable, then they cannot hire these minimum wage \nworkers. Many times they are teenagers. Many times they are trainees. \nWe want to encourage every small business in this country to bring in \nas many workers as it can to train them and develop them because all \nthe statistics tell us that folks who start at the minimum wage are \ngenerally only making it a few months before they prove that they can \ndo the work and move on. It is a way to get a lot of people into the \nworkforce.\n  I think it is important to point out, as the Senator said I never \nsupported a minimum wage, that I did, in fact, last year. The Family \nProsperity Act was a package, a compromise package that raised the \nminimum wage just as we are talking about now, although it did not do \nit for every American. It eliminated the death tax, which adversely \naffects so many small businesses in the event of the death of an owner, \nwhether it is a farm or small business. Many low-wage workers lose \ntheir jobs in the process of those businesses or farms closing. We \npackaged those together so we could do both: we could help the worker, \nbut we could also make sure these small businesses continue to survive \nso they can hire those workers. There were other tax provisions in the \nFamily Prosperity Act, but it was a good bill.\n  This bill was not blocked by Republicans. It was proposed by \nRepublicans and blocked by Democrats. It was a sad time when we saw in \norder to score political points that we turned our backs on workers in \norder to avoid giving small businesses the provision on the death tax \nthat would allow families to continue to operate businesses.\n  I would like to summarize my amendment so it is not misrepresented. \nIt is not a trick. We are talking on the floor of the Senate about \ngiving minimum wage workers a raise of $2.10. States have already \npassed minimum wage laws, and some of them are different. In most cases \nit is because of the higher cost of living.\n  If we come in and raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 in a \nnumber of States, South Carolina and Massachusetts will have \nessentially the same minimum wage--maybe a quarter difference. But a \nminimum wage worker living in Boston, MA, faces tremendously higher \ncosts than a minimum wage worker who lives and works in Greenville, SC. \nIf we are going to be fair, and if we are going to make all these \nspeeches on the floor of the Senate that we are going to help minimum \nwage workers, it does not make sense to leave out over half of the \nminimum wage workers in this country and go home and pretend that we \nhave done something good.\n  I have told the Senator that while I have opposed the strategies of \nwage mandates in the past, that if we are fair, if this bill includes \n100 percent of minimum wage workers, I will not only support it, the \nfinal bill, I will encourage my colleagues to support it because it is \nthe right thing to do. I believe if we were all speaking openly and \nhonestly, we could say that even $7.50 an hour in Boston, MA, is not a \nliveable wage. If you took that up to $9.60, hopefully, we are getting \nat the point where people can survive. But $9.60 in Boston, MA, is no \nmore money than $7.25 in South Carolina.\n  Let's be fair to workers. Let's use what has already been started by \nthe States, and that is recognizing cost of living to help every \nAmerican worker.\n  Again, this is just about simple fairness, as the Senator from \nMassachusetts has said. If we are going to promise an increase of $2.10 \nto minimum wage workers, let's do it for 100 percent of the workers in \nevery State of our Union. Let's give them that increase today.\n  I encourage my colleagues to not look at the past. If we can support \nfairness together, let's all vote together to give every American \nminimum wage worker a $2.10 increase. That is my amendment. I encourage \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I yield and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the good Senator for his \nconcern about the workers in Massachusetts. In Boston we have a living \nwage of $11.95. We made that judgment in Boston, and it is working very \nwell.\n  I take note, in this American Chamber of Commerce Researchers \nAssociation publication, that South Carolina ranks 18th in terms of the \ncost of living. There are 17 other States that have a lower cost of \nliving. But South Carolina is 18th in this list. It is not at the \nlowest; it is 18th.\n  The fact is, it is not greatly out of sync. It is close to the \naverage across the country. But let's get back to the effect of the \nSenator's amendment.\n  In Arizona, in this last election, there were 756,144 people who \nvoted for an increase in the minimum wage to $6.75. That vote would be \noverturned, effectively, by the Senator from South Carolina. In \nColorado, 725,700 turned out for a $6.85 minimum wage. The citizens of \nColorado--their votes would be overturned. In Missouri, 1,583,340 \nmillion voted for $6.50. That vote would be overturned. Montana, $6.15, \n283,258 turned out. Nevada, 394,058 turned out, $6.15 an hour. Ohio, \n$6.85, 2,080,648 turned out. Those are 5,823,148 in six different \nStates. That is in regard to the initial referendum. All of that would \nbe overturned by the Senator from South Carolina.\n\n  So I come back to the basic concept, and that is that we have \nestablished some minimum standards. There are a lot of objections to \nthose minimum health standards, so workers are not going to be--since \nwe passed OSHA in 1970, we have cut in half the number of workers who \nhave been killed in the workplace. We have cut that in half. About 60 \npercent less workers have been killed. There are other kinds of \nillnesses that have come up with changes in our economy, but a decision \nin judgment was made that we are not going to have the exploitation of \nworkers. We are going to have safe workplaces. We don't permit the \nexploitation of children in our factories. We think they ought to be in \nschools. Some economists think: Oh, let's have children in there. Let's \nwork those\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\nchildren and see what the market does. Let's let those workers go in \nand work in those dangerous places. If the market, if it is going to be \nthat disruptive in terms of the employer, let's go ahead and do that.\n  Well, we had decided at another time that we were not going to permit \nthe exploitation of children or women in the workplace, and we were \nalso going to insist on health and safety regulations and we were going \nto establish a basic floor, a basic floor, a minimum. It is not high \nenough even at $7.25, I don't believe myself, but that is the judgment \nthat has been basically made by the Congress, by our side, the \nDemocrats, and by a handful of Republicans, and we wish to see that \nraised. We wish to see that raised.\n  I suppose you could take the good Senator's argument and logic and \nsay: Well, we have increased our salaries $32,000, and they have a \ndifferent cost of living, so maybe South Carolina ought to get less, if \nwe want to follow that logic. We say: No, we are one country with one \nhistory and one destiny, and we are going--obviously, Members of \nCongress and Members of the Senate are going to be treated as they \nshould be, and that is fairly, for the work they do.\n  We say workers ought to be treated fairly for the work they do. \nMinimum standard. This amendment does injustice to that.\n  I would mention there is obviously a disparity in the cost of living. \nI have mentioned what the Energy Information Administration says a \nworker across the country pays, on average, for gasoline, and that is \n$2.17 a gallon. In South Carolina, it is $2.13 a gallon. It is 3 cents \nmore in my State of Massachusetts. I was going to get the basic \nindicators. Health care, the average cost for a family is going to be \n$11,000. Try and do that on $5.15 an hour--$11,000. It is probably a \nlittle more, closer to $12,000 in Massachusetts--but $11,000 for a \nfamily of four. Try and do that on $5.15. We have the housing charts up \nhere. I would think that even $5.15 or $7.25 an hour for people who \nwork hard in South Carolina, they are going to have a tight belt strap \nin providing for their children, providing for their food, and \nproviding for their general well-being.\n  But this does a major alteration and change to a very fundamental \nconcept to what the minimum wage is all about, and I hope the Senator's \namendment will not be successful and that our colleagues will vote no.\n  Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 11 minutes 10 seconds for the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have 11 minutes 10 seconds. Well, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold the quorum call?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes 6 seconds.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for his good debate. I appreciate this \nopportunity. I think if we listen to what each other is saying--I \nappreciate the Senator's concern for South Carolina workers and I hope \nhe appreciate my concern for Massachusetts. As Senator Kennedy has \nsaid, you set the livable wage in Massachusetts at over $11, so $7.50 \nan hour for the minimum wage is certainly not acceptable. I do not \nthink anyone would argue that that is enough, and we need to do better. \nI would hope no Member of the Senate would be concerned that a worker \nmandating over $7.50 is a problem, and particularly in high cost of \nliving States.\n  There are a number of things that have been said we need to think \nabout because we put up that my amendment would cause States which have \nalready passed their minimum wage to have to pay more. In fact, this \nunderlying bill is going to do that to many States. There are many \nStates in this country which have passed their own minimum wage that is \nover $5.15 but is under the current mandate in this bill. So when we \npass it, we are going to override the legislatures and the people in \nmany States. That is part of this whole argument.\n  Now, in this day and time, with the varying costs of living across \nthis country and 29 States already passing their own minimum wage, does \nit continue to make sense for us to establish a one-size-fits-all \nminimum wage for this whole country? I think not. But I do think if we \nare going to stand on the floor of the Senate and argue on behalf of \nthe American worker, the minimum wage worker in this country, and \npromise to raise that minimum wage, then we should do it fairly and \nequitably across this country.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to realize what this bill does is \noverride States. That is the whole idea of the Federal minimum wage, to \nsay we do not believe States will do the right thing, so we are going \nto. But if we are going to do the right thing, let's make it 100 \npercent. Let's not make another false promise to the American people. \nIf we are going to raise the minimum wage $2.10, let's do it across the \nentire country.\n  So again, I appeal to my colleagues. If we are going to do it, let's \ndo it right, let's do it fairly, and let's meet this promise to every \nAmerican minimum wage worker.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes 3 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I think we had notified Members we \nwould try and vote at half past, and I will certainly follow that \nguidance. I would say, as we wind up this debate on this particular \namendment, the underlying legislation provides for an increase in the \nminimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25. It is well understood by all of the \nMembers. We are taking a good deal of time for those who differ with \nthat as a concept. We have had those who have opposed it, who tried to \ncircumvent it, to come up with ways to avoid it, and we are glad to \ndeal with those issues. But nonetheless, this is an amendment now by my \nfriend from South Carolina that would effectively undermine a very \nimportant concept that has been the basis of the minimum wage for over \n70 years and that is to establish a basic floor across this country, a \nbasic floor for minimum wage, permitting States to raise--if they want \nto increase their wages, they can do that. If cities want to increase \ntheir wages, they can do that, such as my city of Boston, such as the \nDistrict of Columbia, such as Baltimore, and such as other cities have \ndone, and they have had very remarkable success in terms of the \nreduction of absenteeism, the continuation of workers remaining in \nemployment, increasing productivity, and the rest. But that is a \ndifferent issue for a different time.\n  The Senator from South Carolina's amendment, in effect, says we will \ntake this $2.10, which will be the value of the increase in the minimum \nwage, and add that to every State across the country. That is an \nentirely different concept. I, myself, find that certain parts of this \nare attractive to think that we do need to raise the minimum wage \nbeyond the $7.25, but that is not the debate today. That is not the \ndebate. That is not the issue. The basic issue is whether we are going \nto violate the very fundamental understanding we have, with regard to \nthis issue at this time in this body now, and that is that we are going \nto pass a floor in this country applicable to all the States and raise \nit from $5.15 an hour to $7.25. That is the issue. The amendment of the \nSenator from South Carolina, however well-intentioned, does serious \ninjury, disruption, and violence to that very basic and fundamental \nconcept. I hope it will not be accepted in the Senate.\n  We are approaching the time of 10:30, and we are very hopeful we will \nhave a vote in relation to the amendment of the Senator from South \nCarolina in the next couple of moments.\n  Madam President, I am prepared to yield back my time.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n[[Page S1141]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 425 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I move to waive the applicable section \nof the Budget Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have a good deal of business to do. \nSince some of these issues relate to the Finance Committee, we are \nworking out with Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley their proposal and \nschedule. There are several important amendments they are addressing \nand working out. We expect to have action on those, if not in the very \nlate morning, in the early afternoon.\n  We had an amendment by Senator Sessions that we were looking forward \nhopefully to at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I wish to compliment both sides on working \non amendments. We have not had any shortage of amendments being \noffered. In fact, we have a whole bunch of people who would like to \noffer amendments that have already been filed. So it is not the usual \nproblem of trying to get people to come down and offer amendments; it \nis a problem of being able to get some agreements so we can have votes \non those amendments.\n  Both sides are working diligently to try to get it set up so we can \nhave a whole series of votes yet today and move along substantially on \nthis legislation. Of course, what we are kind of waiting for is to get \nsome assurance that there will be a small business tax package to \noffset the impact of this before we get some progress.\n  But I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold his suggestion of an \nabsence of a quorum?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 105 to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside and I call up amendment No. 105 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration. I ask that if it does not run afoul of \nwhat the bill managers were attempting to do at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Martinez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 105 to amendment No. 100.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify the house parent exemption to certain wage and \n                           hour requirements)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. HOUSE PARENT EXCEPTION.\n\n       Section 13(b)(24) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n     (29 U.S.C. 212(b)(24)) is amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking \n     ``and his spouse''; and\n       (2) in the matter following subparagraph (B)--\n       (A) by striking ``and his spouse reside'' and inserting \n     ``resides'';\n       (B) by striking ``receive'' and inserting ``receives''; and\n       (C) by striking ``are together'' and inserting ``is''.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I simply wished to call up this \namendment. I think it is a rather important amendment and is of great \ninterest to me personally. It is offered in order to assist charitable \norganizations that look after children who are in need of foster care. \nIt is an attempt to not allow a raise in the minimum wage to work \nagainst the opportunity for single individuals to continue to work with \nthese young children in ways that are helpful to them.\n  I have been urged to move this amendment by a number of not-for-\nprofit groups in Florida that care for children, groups such as the \nChildren's Home Society. I think it is a rather important amendment, \nand I look forward to its consideration as we go forward.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to express my appreciation for my \ncolleagues' efforts to do what, in their view, would help promote a \nbetter quality of life for the people of this great country. We are \nhere to debate specifically a proposal to increase the minimum wage, \nbut, in my view, we should aspire to more than a minimum wage for the \nworkers across this country. Instead, we should work to provide the \ntraining and educational opportunities that will allow individuals \nacross this great Nation to enter the workforce at perhaps minimum wage \nbut, more importantly, to then move up the economic ladder.\n  When we put ourselves in the position of Government rather than the \nmarket dictating wages, we will most certainly see some unintended \neffects of less opportunity for some of the very American workers whom \nwe are attempting to help.\n  Let's put this proposal in perspective. Research reveals that the \nnegative effects of raising the minimum wage would, in fact, fall most \nheavily on the shoulders of the most vulnerable workers. Let me say \nthat again. Research shows that the effects of raising the minimum \nwage--that is, of the Federal Government rather than the market \ndictating the wages at which employers must pay workers--that the \nburden would actually fall most heavily on the most vulnerable workers.\n  When employers are forced to raise their costs in order to comply \nwith a government mandate, they are most likely going to reduce the \nhours their workers can work or perhaps even lay\n\n[[Page S1142]]\n\npeople off in order to meet their bottom line. Of course, they will \nalso choose, if costs go up because government has increased the wages \nwhich an employer must pay, to retain their most skilled and \nexperienced and productive employees, not the less skilled or lower \nwage earners. That is important because teenagers and those who are \nworking on a part-time basis or who are just entering the workforce are \nthe ones who predominantly receive the minimum wage under the status \nquo.\n  So why in the world would government decide to put people out of \nwork, presumably the very people whom this amendment is designed to \nhelp? We need to ask ourselves that question and come up with a better \nanswer than I have heard so far.\n  I saw a cartoon, which was really not funny, distributed a couple of \ndays ago where an employer is talking to an employee. He says: I have \ngood news and bad news. The good news is that the minimum wage has been \nincreased, so you are going to get a pay raise. The bad news is you are \nfired.\n  The point of the cartoon is--as I said, it is really not funny--that \nif fixed costs of employers go up, something has to give. And where \nthat give actually impacts the workers is going to be, I am afraid, on \nthe most vulnerable workers, the less educated, the less trained, and \nunfortunately, more often, on minorities and women, the very groups the \nadvocates of this bill have said they want to help.\n  Consider this statistic: Of the 75.6 million Americans who are paid \nby the hour, 1.9 million workers earn wages at or below the minimum \nwage. In other words, that is 2.5 percent of all hourly paid workers. \nSo the debate we are having this week--and, presumably, will carry over \nto next week--will affect 2.5 percent of all hourly paid workers. The \nlargest share of minimum wage earners include teenagers and young \nadults who have only entered the workforce. Based on the most recent \ndata available, approximately one-fourth of minimum wage earners are \nteenagers between the ages of 16 and 19, and about one-half are between \nthe ages of 16 and 24.\n  Over the past few weeks, in anticipation of this debate, there have \nbeen a number of articles in national and State publications addressing \nthis topic. Many of them have been very thoughtful and informative. One \narticle that demonstrates the complexity of this issue, that there is \nactually more than meets the eye on this topic, was published by the \nValley Morning Star in Brownsville, TX, a story about Belinda \nCampirano. Ms. Campirano, along with her sister, is an owner of Media \nLuna, a small restaurant in Brownsville, TX. Ms. Campirano has only one \nemployee, whom she pays $6 an hour. And while she understands, from the \nstandpoint of simple human compassion, the difficulty of getting by on \n$5.15 an hour, she also realizes that a government-mandated wage \nincrease would put a significant dent into her operating budget, \nliterally in her ability to keep the doors open and keep this \nindividual, her single employee, on the payroll.\n  There was also another great series of articles in the Washington \nPost, one on January 10 entitled ``Life at $7.25 an Hour, As House \nPrepares to Vote on Minimum Wage Increase, Issue is Complex for Those \nWho Earn or Pay That Amount.'' That article does an excellent job of \ncutting through the rhetoric and exposing the reality of what it is we \nare debating.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both articles be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate the numerous ways in which many of our \ncolleagues have worked to improve this bill; significantly, the \nbipartisan work of the Finance Committee, Senators Grassley and Baucus, \ncertainly the good work of the minority manager of the bill, Senator \nEnzi, and numerous others to try to improve it, to try to ameliorate \nsome of the unintended consequences of government-mandated wages. I \nsupport the small business package which is part of what we are \nattempting to do to provide a better bill, one that rounds out the \nprovisions of the bill and one that actually produces intended effects, \nwhich are not to hurt small businesses, the primary engine of our \neconomy.\n  The fact is, small businesses employ about 70 percent of the workers \nin America today. Why would this body do anything that would actually \nput more people out of work? Well, the provisions of the legislation \nthat came out of the Finance Committee, as modest as they are, \nrepresent a real attempt to try to round out and improve the bill in \norder to reduce the unintended impact, which would be to put people out \nof work, and to provide some regulatory and tax relief for small \nbusinesses, the employers that employ 70 percent of the people in the \nAmerican workforce.\n  Small business expensing allows mom-and-pop shops and entrepreneurs \nto reinvest in their businesses and grow and, in so growing, hire more \npeople and create jobs, not just in my State of Texas but across the \ncountry. It will help locally owned businesses and other small \nenterprises make much needed improvements in their infrastructure, \nwhich will help them compete and improve their productivity. I have \nconcerns, however, that while the minimum wage increase in this \nlegislation is permanent, the regulatory and tax relief that is part of \nthe package is only temporary and not permanent as well. Nevertheless, \nthese fixes are necessary.\n  But don't take it from me. Take it from people like Jonathan Meller \nwho e-mailed me recently. Mr. Meller is the owner of Papa Murphy's \npizza restaurant in Burleson, TX. He talked about the economics of a \nwage increase and what it would mean for his small business. Like a \nmajority of employees slated to earn the minimum wage, Mr. Meller's \nemployees are, true to the statistic I mentioned a moment ago, under 20 \nyears of age. Like many business owners, Mr. Meller operates in a free \nmarket. He believes in free enterprise. He believes in competition. \nFrankly, he doesn't appreciate the fact that government sticks its big \nfinger right in the middle of his business and mandates that he pay \nwages that are above the market. Any government-mandated wage hike will \nhave a dramatic impact on how he is able to do business and on the \nnumber of employees he is able to hire.\n  Then there is William Goodman, the owner of Scooters in El Paso. Mr. \nGoodman has only one employee. If the minimum wage is raised, where \ndoes that leave him? Mr. Goodman says he will have no employees, if the \ngovernment, rather than the market, forces him to increase the wages he \npays his one employee. He says--and I take him as his word--he will not \nbe able to absorb the additional cost that would go along with this \nlegislation.\n\n  My point is this: Raising the minimum wage and the taxes that come \nwith it will similarly leave many employees without jobs. We need to \nthink long and hard before we choose to impose this sort of regulation \non small businesses. In the end, my hope is that we can come together \nwith a sensible package that will enjoy bipartisan support; that will, \naccording to the intentions of the authors, increase the minimum wage \nbut also soften the blow on small business and thus protect the jobs of \nmany workers who might otherwise be laid off.\n  The important point, though, that this legislation misses is that the \nbest way to increase the quality of life for workers in America is not \njust to raise the minimum wage. That puts a patch or a Band-Aid on what \nis a much more serious and larger problem. Education and workforce \ntraining are the best ways to increase the quality of life for \nAmerica's workers instead of a wage increase that could hurt small \nbusinesses and consumers and, indeed, some of the very employees we are \ntrying to help.\n  We all understand--it is a given--that every American should receive \na good-quality education. We must continue to pursue policies to ensure \nthat this is not merely a dream but a reality. No one, though, should \nend their education just when they receive a diploma or degree. Indeed, \nthe world has become so complex, competition has become so globalized, \nthat we need to think of education as a lifelong learning experience. \nIn that vein, I emphasize the importance of providing workers with the \nkinds of skills and talent and training they need, not only to earn the \nminimum wage but to earn\n\n[[Page S1143]]\n\ngood living wages much higher than the minimum wage and the important \nrole our universities, community colleges, trade schools, and workforce \ndevelopment centers play in providing the training and education \nnecessary for thousands and thousands of people across this great \ncountry to improve their standard of living and to achieve their \ndreams.\n  I strongly believe that joint workforce-education projects are \ncritical to our efforts as our economy continues its upswing and as \ncompetition increases on a global scale. It is imperative that we focus \nour efforts not only on setting a wage that may be out of sync with \nmarket forces but literally on liberating people to achieve their \ndreams by giving them the skills necessary to earn higher wages which \nwill allow them to enjoy the American dream. It is imperative that we \ndo everything we can to provide this training through our colleges and \nuniversities, working with the private sector to try to develop \nprograms relevant to the local economy and, hence, jobs that are \navailable in the local economy, and thus increase our competitiveness.\n  This is not just a temporary or passing interest of mine. I have \ntraveled across my State, as have many of my colleagues, to community \ncolleges and have seen some of the effective partnerships that \ncommunity colleges have entered into with local employers. Frankly, \nemployers are wanting for lack of trained employees to fill job \nvacancies at much higher than the minimum wage. One stands out in my \nmind--a young woman I met at the Bell Helicopter plant in Amarillo, TX, \nby the name of Jeanette Hudson Gibbs. The reason I remember Ms. Gibbs \nis because she works on the assembly line for the V-22 tilt rotor at \nBell Helicopter at their Amarillo plant. This is a young Hispanic \nwoman, a single mother with a special needs child, who, before she went \nto work at Bell Helicopter on the assembly line for the V-22 tilt \nrotor, was a prison guard, a single mom. You can imagine the concerns \nher family had, not just about the fact that she was earning much lower \nwages but, in fact, the dangers associated with that job. Thanks to the \ngreat partnership Bell Helicopter had entered into with Amarillo \nCommunity College, Ms. Gibbs is now earning $16 an hour, and that was \nthe last time I heard from her. It could be she is even doing better \nnow because of the job skills she acquired through this partnership \nbetween Bell Helicopter and Amarillo Community College. This is a great \nsuccess story of which I am proud. I know she must be proud of her \naccomplishments. And it is exactly the sort of emphasis we ought to be \nplacing through legislation we pass on the floor.\n  I worry that by looking at mandating minimum wages rather than \nfocusing on workforce development and the kind of job training that is \ngoing to be able to produce more people like her, somehow we have not \nset our sights high enough.\n  Last April, I hosted an event back in my home of Austin, TX. It is \nsomething we call the Texas Workforce Summit. This was a gathering of \ncommunity college leaders from all across the State. The purpose of \nthat was to learn more about Federal grant opportunities and to learn \nmore about the successes of partnerships such as the one I just \nmentioned between Amarillo Community College and Bell Helicopter. \nBecause of this initiative, Del Mar College in Corpus Christi applied \nfor and received a grant of nearly $2 million to improve employment \nopportunities for technical employees in the aerospace industry. This \nis an even better story because Del Mar College has the same kind of \nworkforce training partnership that I described a moment ago in \nAmarillo but this time in Corpus Christi. This is a workforce \ndevelopment program which Del Mar has entered into at the Corpus \nChristi Depot. The Corpus Christi Depot, for those who don't know, is \nthe place where the military refurbishes and refits the military \nhelicopters that are damaged through use in the conflicts in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. We have a wonderful training program there \nthrough the same kind of partnership I mentioned a moment ago, which is \ncreating a better way of life and a better opportunity for many workers \nthere--and also, in a patriotic fashion, supporting our effort in the \nglobal war on terror.\n  As you can tell, I have been a long advocate of these initiatives. I \nhave taken the opportunity to visit these community colleges all across \nmy State, in cities such as Austin, Houston, Pasadena, Laredo, \nBeaumont, Sherman, El Paso, Lubbock, and Victoria, to highlight the \nvery thing I am talking about here on the floor of the Senate today. So \nI hope that as we move forward, we will not forget about the great \npromises community colleges hold in terms of workforce training and \nlook to maybe setting our sights a little bit higher than we have been \nlast week and this week in talking about minimum wage, when we ought to \ntalk about how we can prepare people to earn much higher wages and, \nfrankly, wages and jobs that go wanting for lack of a trained \nworkforce.\n  Just this last week, the National Journal highlighted community \ncolleges as a true American success story. They have offered \noccupational skills training for decades and will continue to lead the \neffort to stimulate industry and job growth. This article says:\n\n       Bridging the gaps between high schools and four-year \n     institutions and between employers and workers, two-year \n     community colleges will help determine how America fares in \n     the global economic competition.\n\n  So I say it again, Mr. President: We should aspire to much more for \nthe workforce in America, for the American worker, than just the \nminimum wage. Education and workforce training are the way forward to \nboth increase the quality of life for more workers and provide a way \nfor them to achieve their dreams.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                           Raising Questions\n\n\n       many employers unsure about possible rise in minimum wage\n\n                          (By Matt Whittaker)\n\n       Brownsville.--Restaurant owner Belinda Campirano is torn \n     when asked to weigh in on what Congress should do about \n     raising the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour from $5.15, where \n     it has been for a decade.\n       She has only one $6-an-hour employee at Media Luna, the \n     Brownsville eatery I she and her sister own. Still, a \n     mandated wage increase would put a dent in her budget, she \n     said.\n       But she empathizes with those supporting their families on \n     service industry wages. Her employee, who has a child and is \n     married to a waitress, sometimes works an extra job at \n     another restaurant to help make ends meet.\n       ``I'm kind of sitting on the fence on it,'' Campirano said \n     of the minimum wage. ``I do believe we need to up it, but it \n     is going to impact small businesses. As an employer, it would \n     be tough for me if I had more employees.''\n       Of 5.5 million hourly workers in Texas, 176,000 earned at \n     or below $5.15 an hour in 2005, according to Labor Department \n     data. The liberal Economic Policy Institute, a Washington, \n     D.C., think tank in favor of increasing the nation's base \n     pay, estimates 863,000 Texas workers would be directly \n     affected by a federal minimum wage increase to $7.25 an hour.\n       More workers would be affected in the Rio Grande Valley \n     than in other parts of the country because the area has lower \n     wages, said Jose A. Pagan, a labor economist at the \n     University of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg. In the second \n     quarter of 2006, Cameron County had the lowest average weekly \n     wages in the nation, at $484. Hidalgo County followed at $494 \n     a week.\n       On Jan. 10, the U.S. House passed a measure that would \n     increase the minimum wage to $7.25 in three stages over more \n     than two years. Passage of a companion bill introduced in the \n     Senate could hinge on tax breaks for businesses.\n       The bill is expected to be brought up in the Senate this \n     week, and U.S. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn, \n     both Texas Republicans, support an increase if it is coupled \n     with tax help for small businesses.\n       Proponents of the increase say it is a long overdue raise \n     for U.S. workers. A memorandum from the Economic Policy \n     Institute said business owners have received tax cuts since \n     1997 (when the last minimum wage increase took effect), \n     ``while minimum wage workers have been kept waiting at the \n     back of the line.''\n       Opponents of a minimum wage increase say it would hurt \n     small businesses and the working poor alike and increase \n     unemployment.\n       ``It's a bad thing for any area,'' said Jill Jenkins, chief \n     economist at the conservative Employment Policies Institute, \n     a Washington, D.C., think tank that opposes a minimum wage \n     increase.\n\n\n                         EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS\n\n       Jenkins says only a fraction of the benefits of such a \n     boost would go to the working poor. And if they earned more, \n     some could lose benefits like the earned income tax credit, \n     food stamps and housing.\n       In extreme cases, some people could be worse off earning \n     $7.25 an hour than earning $5.15 an hour and getting the tax \n     credit, she said.\n\n[[Page S1144]]\n\n       ``It does cause job losses,'' Jenkins said. ``The \n     unemployment rates will go up.''\n       That's because some firms will not hire as many workers as \n     labor costs go up, said Pagan, the UTPA labor economist. \n     Higher wages will attract more people to look for jobs, also \n     contributing to higher unemployment rates.\n       Raising the minimum wage could, in theory, make \n     undocumented workers more attractive hires for employers \n     looking to save on labor costs, Pagan said. But many illegal \n     workers already are in formal sectors, getting paid the same \n     as everyone else.\n       Some politicians and business owners are not strenuously \n     opposing a minimum wage increase, he said; salaries for most \n     workers already are higher than $5.15 an hour because it has \n     been so long since the last national raise.\n       ``The impact of all of this is fairly minimal,'' Pagan \n     said. ``It's mostly symbolic or political more than anything \n     else.''\n       Past increases in the minimum wage affected more workers, \n     he said.\n       The last time the minimum wage went up, some businesses \n     feared it would hurt, said Dalia Rodriguez, director for \n     corporate communications at Edinburg-based WorkFORCE \n     Solutions, which is funded by the state's employer and labor \n     agency.\n       ``There was some effect but not what we thought it was \n     going to be,'' she said.\n       Nationally, there are some concerns about labor costs from \n     the small business community, said Sofia Hernandez, chief \n     executive of the Southwest Community Investment Corp., which \n     oversees the Small Business Administration-funded Women's \n     Business Center in McAllen. But she hasn't heard of any such \n     fears locally.\n       ``It's important to the economy to have people earning \n     more, but I know on the business side it's a cost,'' she \n     said. ``So you have to balance those two issues.''\n       As far as students at the University of Texas-Brownsville/\n     Texas Southmost College who are paying for an education with \n     minimum wage work-study jobs are concerned, Congress should \n     raise the Nation's base pay.\n       One, Ilianna Garza, a 19-year-old freshman biology student, \n     has been working 20 hours a week at the university's news and \n     information department since October. She earns $5.15 an hour \n     and says a raise would help her pay for books, gas and \n     clothes and save for the next semester.\n       ``Every little bit helps, especially when you have to put \n     yourself through school,'' she said.\n       At Media Luna restaurant in Brownsville, Campirano \n     contemplates how a higher Federal minimum wage would affect \n     her business and sole employee. Depending on whether tax \n     breaks are included in the proposed wage increase bill, \n     paying her worker more might mean taking money from her \n     advertising budget or upping the cost of a sandwich 20 cents.\n       ``You don't want to raise prices because that's going to \n     deter people from coming to your establishment, but it's got \n     to come from somewhere,'' she said.\n       On the other hand, ``There's no way anyone can live on \n     $5.15.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 10, 2007]\n\n                         Life at $7.25 an Hour\n\n\n As House Prepares to Vote on Minimum-Wage Increase, Issue Is Complex \n                for Those Who Earn, or Pay, That Amount\n\n                           (By David Finkel)\n\n       Atchison, Kan.--It was payday. Money, at last. Twenty-two-\n     year-old Robert Iles wanted to celebrate. ``Tonight, \n     chimichangas!'' he announced.\n       He was on his way out of the store where his full-time job \n     pays him $7.25 an hour--the rate that is likely to become the \n     nation's new minimum wage. Life at $7.25: This is the life of \n     Robert Iles, and with $70 in a wallet that had been empty \n     that morning, he headed to a grocery store where for $4.98 he \n     bought not only 10 chimichangas but two burritos as well.\n       From there he stopped at a convenience store, where for \n     $16.70 he filled the gas tank of the car he purchased when he \n     got his raise to $7.25; then he went to another grocery \n     store, where he got a $21.78 money order to pay down some \n     bills, including $8,000 in medical bills from the day he \n     accidentally sliced open several fingers with a knife while \n     trying to cut a tomato; and then he headed toward the family \n     trailer 19 miles away, where his parents were waiting for \n     dinner.\n       Today in Washington, the House is scheduled to vote on \n     whether to increase the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to \n     $7.25. Passage is expected, with Senate approval soon to \n     follow, and if President Bush signs the resulting bill into \n     law, as he indicated he would, the U.S. minimum wage would \n     rise for the first time since 1997, ending a debate about \n     whether such a raise would be good or bad for the economy.\n       But even if the matter is settled in Congress, it isn't \n     settled at all in Atchison, and Robert Iles's drive home is \n     proof. Every stop he made on his ride home revealed a \n     different facet of how complicated the minimum wage can be in \n     the parts of America where, instead of a debatable issue, it \n     is a way of life.\n       At the store where Iles works, for instance, the owner \n     thinks the minimum wage should be increased as a moral issue \n     but worries about which employees' hours he will have to cut \n     to compensate.\n       At the store where he bought the chimichangas, the cashier \n     who makes $6.25 worries that a raise will force her out of \n     her subsidized apartment and onto the street.\n       At the convenience store where he bought gas, the owner \n     worries that he will have to either raise prices, angering \n     his customers, or make less money, ``and why would I want to \n     make less money?''\n       At the store where he got the money order, the worries are \n     about Wal-Mart, which not only supports an increase but also \n     built a Supercenter on the edge of town that has been sucking \n     up customers since it opened three years ago.\n       As for Iles--who keeps $70 out of every paycheck to cover \n     two weeks' worth of food and gas and in a matter of minutes \n     was already down to $26.54--his worry was as basic as how \n     fast to drive home.\n       Drive too fast and he'd be wasting gas. But his family was \n     waiting. And his chimichangas, best cooked frozen, were \n     starting to thaw.\n\n\n                        The Meaning of a Dollar\n\n       The debate about the minimum wage usually comes down to \n     jobs. If Congress approves the increase, it will result in \n     raises for an estimated 13 million Americans, or about 9 \n     percent of the total workforce. That's a percentage that most \n     economists agree would cause a modest increase in national \n     unemployment. In Kansas, however, ``it would have a fairly \n     significant impact,'' said Beth Martino, a spokeswoman for \n     the state Department of Labor. According to one independent \n     analysis, 16 percent of the workforce, or 237,000 workers, \n     would be affected--and that doesn't include the 20,000 whose \n     wages aren't governed by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act \n     and earn the state minimum wage of $2.65. That rate, the \n     lowest in the nation and unchanged since 1988, hints at the \n     prevailing wisdom in Kansas about the minimum wage, which is \n     that the only way low-wage earners will make more is through \n     congressional action.\n       This holds true from Topeka, where the powerful Kansas \n     Chamber of Commerce has long opposed any raise, to rural \n     Mulvane, home of Republican state legislator Ted Powers, who \n     says his futile effort three years ago to raise the state \n     minimum wage resulted in his being branded a ``dirty dog,'' \n     to Atchison, a working-class city of 11,000 where the stores \n     that depend on low-wage workers include one called ``Wow Only \n     $1.00!'' This is the store where Robert Iles has worked for \n     five years.\n       ``Robert, would you help me a second?'' Jack Bower, the \n     owner, called to Iles soon after opening, as the line at the \n     cash register grew. A onetime Wal-Mart vice president, Bower \n     moved back to Atchison several years ago to teach and ended \n     up buying the old J.C. Penney store, and now runs a business \n     where the meaning of a dollar is displayed on shelf after \n     shelf. The jar of Peter Piper's Hot Dog Relish? That's what a \n     dollar is worth. The Wolfgang Puck Odor Eliminator that a \n     customer was looking at as she said to a friend, ``I just \n     don't know how I'm ever going to make it. My ex-husband's not \n     paying his child support''? That's a dollar, too, as is \n     the home pregnancy test, the most shoplifted item in the \n     store.\n       ``This is not a wealthy community,'' Bower explained. ``The \n     thing is, a lot of people depend on this store.''\n       Robert Iles has his own version of a dollar's meaning, \n     learned last February when Bower took him aside and said he \n     would be getting a pay raise to $7.25. ``Okay,'' Iles \n     remembers replying, wanting to seem businesslike. ``But \n     inside I was doing the cha-cha-cha,'' he said. ``It was like \n     going from lower class to lower middle class.''\n       Soon after, he bought his car, a used 2005 Dodge Neon, and \n     just about every workday since then he has spent his lunch \n     break in the driver's seat, eating a bologna sandwich with \n     the engine off to save gas, even in winter. An hour later, he \n     was back behind the cash register, telling customers ``Thank \n     you and have a nice day'' again and again.\n       And meanwhile, Jack Bower wondered whose hours he will cut \n     if he has to give his employees a raise.\n       It's not that he's against raising the minimum wage--``I \n     don't think $5.15 is adequate,'' he said, adding that $7.25 \n     seems fair--but his profit margin is thin, and wages are his \n     biggest controllable expense. So if wages go up, he said, \n     hours will have to come down, and the question will become: \n     Whose?\n       Will it be Neil Simpson, 66, who works six hours a day as a \n     stockman, and then five more hours somewhere else cleaning \n     floors, and takes care of a wife who is blind and arthritic?\n       Will it be Susan Irons, 57, who was infected with hepatitis \n     C from a blood transfusion, is on a waiting list for a liver \n     transplant and needs more hours rather than fewer?\n       Will it be Christina Lux, who is 22 years old and 13 weeks \n     pregnant?\n       Will it be Iles?\n       ``Attention, all shoppers,'' he said into the microphone. \n     ``We will be closing in 10 minutes. Please begin making your \n     final selections.'' Ten minutes later, he was clocked out and \n     back in his Neon. ``My brand-new car,'' he called it proudly, \n     and he explained how he was able to afford it on $7.25 an \n     hour: a no-money-down loan for which he will pay $313.13 a \n     month until 2012.\n\n\n                      small business ``at bottom''\n\n       Seven dollars and twenty-five cents an hour equals $15,080 \n     per year, and out of that comes $313 for the car loan and \n     $100 for car insurance, lies said, going over his monthly\n\n[[Page S1145]]\n\n     bills. An additional $90 for the 1995 car with 135,000 miles \n     on it that he is buying from a friend for his mother, $150 \n     for the family phone bills, $35 on his credit card, $100 for \n     gas, $100 toward the mortgage on the trailer. ``That's about \n     it. Oh yeah, $20 in doctors'' bills,'' he said, and totaled \n     it up on fingers scarred by surgical stitches. Nine hundred \n     and eight dollars. ``I bring home 900 a month,'' he said. \n     ``So I very rarely have any money for myself.''\n       He parked in front of a store called Always Low Prices, \n     which has the cheapest chimichangas in town.\n       Once it was a full-service grocery store with 28 employees. \n     Then came word that Wal-Mart was looking for land for a \n     Supercenter, and now it has become a bare-bones operation \n     where the starting pay for its few employees is $5.50, and \n     the manager wonders how the store will survive if wages \n     increase.\n       ``We're at the bottom. If the minimum wage went up, I don't \n     know how we would make the cuts to cover it,'' Michelle Henry \n     said. The lone salaried employee, she works 80 hours a week \n     to make up for the lack of workers. ``I have mixed \n     feelings,'' she continued. ``I know that people can't afford \n     to live on $5.15 an hour. But on the business side, small \n     businesses can't afford to pay it.''\n       At the register, meanwhile, Shannon Wilk, 33, who makes \n     $6.25 an hour, said that of course she would like to earn \n     more money. It would help her. It would help her 18-month-old \n     daughter. ``It would be good,'' she said, ``but also, for me, \n     I live in income-based housing, and if I get a raise, my rent \n     would go up, and I would lose my assistance.'' Even the \n     tiniest raise would affect her, she said, and with nowhere to \n     go, the last thing she can afford is a raise to $7.25.\n       In such an equation, the fact that she was working in \n     Kansas was to her benefit. Atchison sits on the Kansas-\n     Missouri border, and if Wilk worked a few hundred yards to \n     the east, she would already be in jeopardy: In November, \n     Missouri voters supported a ballot initiative increasing the \n     state's minimum wage to $6.50, with an annual adjustment for \n     inflation. Five other states had similar votes, with similar \n     results, bringing to 29 the number that now require an hourly \n     wage above the federal minimum. In the District the minimum \n     is $7, in Maryland it's $6.15, and in Virginia it's $5.15.\n       Such is the arbitrariness of state-by-state minimum wage \n     laws that Wilk feels lucky to be in Kansas making $6.25 an \n     hour while inside at the first grocery store across the \n     Missouri state line, the cashier was ecstatic that she was in \n     a place where her pay was going from $6.20 to $6.50, \n     explaining, ``That's 30 cents more I ain't got.''\n       Iles handed over a $10 bill for his 10 chimichangas and two \n     burritos. He stuffed the change deep in his pocket, and \n     headed next to a convenience store owned by a man named Bill \n     Murphy, who said that if he had the chance to talk to new \n     House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, he would ask one question. \n     ``Where does she think the money will come from? And that is \n     the question,'' he said. ``My wages are going to go up 10 \n     percent''\n       Unlike Jack Bower, who would compensate by cutting hours, \n     Murphy said that in his two convenience stores there are no \n     hours to cut. ``I'm going to have to raise my prices,'' he \n     said--not only because his workers who make less than the new \n     minimum wage would get raises but also because those who earn \n     more would insist on raises as well. Employees at $7.25 will \n     want $8.25. Those at $8.25 will want $9.25.\n       Economists classify such workers as the ones who would be \n     indirectly affected by a minimum-wage increase. Of the \n     estimated 13 million workers expected to get raises, 7.4 \n     million are in that category. ``You've created this \n     entitlement,'' Murphy said he would tell Pelosi.\n       And yet he will pay it, he said, and compensate with price \n     increases, which he worries will be inflationary, even though \n     most economists say that won't happen. He will raise prices, \n     he continued, because the only other option would be to earn \n     less money, which he doesn't want to do because he owes $1.5 \n     million on his businesses and wouldn't want to default\n       ``Now that might be a stretch in some people's minds, from \n     giving a guy a raise to not being able to pay the bank, but \n     that's the path I'm talking about,'' he said. Against such a \n     dire backdrop, Iles put $17 worth of gas in his car.\n       ``That'll be $16.70,'' the clerk said to him, and instead \n     of correcting this, Iles gladly took the change.\n       Thirty cents, suddenly got.\n\n\n                          The Wal-Mart Factor\n\n       Iles drove past the Atchison Inn, where starting pay is \n     $5.15, past Movie Gallery, where it's also $5.15, and stopped \n     in front of Country Mart, the fanciest grocery store in town, \n     where high school students start at $5.15 and, according to \n     owner Dennis Garrett, ``some of them aren't worth that.''\n       A few days earlier, Garrett had gotten a letter from a \n     lobbying consortium called the Coalition for Job \n     Opportunities, urging him to write Congress to protest the \n     minimum-wage increase. It came in the form of a letter \n     already written, to which he merely had to add his \n     congressman's name and send it off to Washington.\n       ``We are very concerned,'' the letter began, and it was \n     signed by 25 organizations.\n       The most conspicuous signature, though, was the one that \n     wasn't there, that of Wal-Mart, the nation's largest private \n     employer, with 1.3 million workers. Wal-Mart won't say how \n     many of those workers earn less than what the new minimum \n     wage would be, but if the Atchison store is an example, \n     starting pay is $6 an hour.\n       Nonetheless, in October 2005, Wal-Mart chief executive H. \n     Lee Scott Jr. said in a speech that the ``U.S. minimum wage \n     of $5.15 an hour has not been raised in nearly a decade, and \n     we believe it is out of date with the times.'' He went on to \n     say, ``Our customers simply don't have the money to buy basic \n     necessities between paychecks.''\n       When it comes to Wal-Mart, however, just about any \n     announcement that affects public policy is greeted with \n     suspicion, and that has been the case with the minimum wage. \n     Some have said that Wal-Mart, in need of good publicity, is \n     supporting an increase for public relations reasons; others \n     have declared it an attempt to drive small, independently \n     owned stores out of business.\n       These suspicions exist in Atchison as well. As in many \n     small communities, Wal-Mart defines local retail, and just as \n     Always Low Prices had to retool itself, Country Mart was \n     significantly affected by Wal-Mart's new food-stocked \n     Supercenter several miles away.\n       What is Wal-Mart up to? What are its true motives? Like \n     many others, Dennis Garrett wonders. He imagines public \n     relations is part of it, but he didn't want to speculate on \n     whether this was an attempt to put him out of business, \n     except to say that raising some wages wouldn't do that. He'd \n     reduce some hours, he said. He'd manage.\n       Yes, Atchison businesses would be hurt initially, but in \n     the long run, if unemployment increases, those hurt the most \n     would be the very ones Wal-Mart insists would be helped--the \n     customers, especially the younger ones, ``the people who \n     don't advance their education and need a job between the ages \n     of 16 and 21, 22, 23.''\n       In other words, many of the workers in Atchison, one of \n     whom was now at Garrett's service counter buying a money \n     order so he could pay bills. Even though Iles has a checking \n     account, this is the method he prefers because if he were to \n     pay by check, and the check were to bounce because of \n     insufficient funds, the penalty would be devastating. A $25 \n     fee would require more than three hours of work.\n       And where would those hours come from?\n       ``It's Tough for Me''\n       So go the calculations of a $7.25 worker, now headed home.\n       ``It's an old trailer,'' he explained earlier in the day.\n       The heat doesn't work, he said, and the water heater works \n     sporadically.\n       One of the bedroom ceilings is caving in. He sleeps in the \n     other bedroom, and his parents sleep in the living room \n     because his father, who has diabetes and had to have several \n     inches of one of his feet amputated, can't really get around.\n       Also, his father has leukemia. And is legally blind. And \n     his mother, who once made $6.50 an hour as an aide at a \n     nursing home, quit to take care of her husband.\n       ``We're pretty much living off my money,'' Iles said, and \n     in he went to cook them dinner, bring payday to an end and, \n     the next morning, start the cycle again.\n       Life at $7.25. Should that be the minimum wage?\n       ``Yes,'' Iles said.\n       Even if it hurts job opportunities for people like him, as \n     Dennis Garrett had suggested?\n       ``Yes.''\n       Or causes price increases, as Bill Murphy had suggested?\n       ``Yes.''\n       Or damages businesses such as Always Low Prices?\n       ``I mean, it's tough for me, and I'm already making $7.25 \n     an hour.''\n       Or causes Jack Bower to reduce hours for one of his \n     employees? Perhaps for Iles himself?\n       ``It's just so hard for people. I mean, it's hard,'' Iles \n     said, and then he went to work.\n       ``I think it'll be bad today,'' one of the workers \n     suggested as the line at the Wow Only $1.00! cash register \n     began to form.\n       ``Well, it depends on your perspective,'' Iles said.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDorgan be recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes, to be followed by \nSenator Martinez for up to 5 minutes, and then the Senate resume \nconsideration of the Ensign amendment No. 154; that the time for those \nstatements last until 12:20, to be equally divided and controlled by \nSenators Ensign and Stabenow; that at 12:20, the Senate proceed to vote \nin relation to the Ensign amendment; provided further that no second-\ndegree amendment be in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been listening to my colleagues on \nthis issue of the minimum wage and thinking about a time 70-some years \nago that I read about when there was an initiative on the floor of the \nCongress\n\n[[Page S1146]]\n\ndealing with the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act, which President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt wanted, was considered radical. They said it was going to \ninjure business and there would be trouble in this country. That \nprovision said, on behalf of America's workers, that employers ought to \nkeep time records, ought to pay overtime for over a certain number of \nhours--the kinds of things you would expect. But once again, the sky \nwas going to fall if this sort of thing was embraced. We have heard \nthis every time we have had something on the floor of the Senate.\n  My colleagues have talked about initiatives that are important. I \nthink many of these initiatives are important. What about the \ninitiative to help the people at the bottom rung of the economic \nladder? It has been almost 10 years since the minimum wage has been \nincreased. Yet it is unbelievable how difficult it is to pull it \nthrough this Chamber. The price for pulling it through the Chamber is \nto add additional tax breaks.\n  There was a time when in this Chamber we considered tax breaks, \nsaying to the biggest corporations in America that moved many of their \njobs overseas: We want to give you the right--the only people in the \ncountry--to pay an income tax of 5\\1/4\\ percent. It will cost us $104 \nbillion in lost revenue to our Treasury, in my calculation. That went \nthrough like greased lightning. Did you hear anybody say: If we are \ngoing to give a $104 billion tax break to the biggest companies, maybe \nwe ought to help the people at the bottom of the economic ladder. Oh, \nno, nobody wanted to leverage that because nobody cared about that.\n  As I have described before, it is like the lyrics of the Bob Willis \nand the Texas Playboys song; it is the same thing that plays out in \nevery situation. The lyrics are, ``The little bee sucks the blossom and \nthe big bee gets the honey.'' In this case, the big guy gets the money. \nIt is always the case in these debates.\n  What about a maximum wage? We hear about a minimum wage, and the \npeople at the bottom who have not had a raise for 10 years.\n  This notion that I have heard all week, which is that this is impacts \njust a bunch of teenagers, is just not true. This is not a bunch of \nteenagers. Well over 70 percent of the workers who will benefit from \nthe minimum wage are adults; 60 percent are women; 6.4 million children \nwill benefit because their parents are working for the minimum wage. \nFor a third of them, that is their sole family income. So it is just \nnot true to come to the floor and banter around and say it is just a \nbunch of teenagers working.\n  But if we are so concerned about the people at the bottom getting too \nmuch, let me make this point to you: Wages and salaries, which is the \ncompensation given to workers in this country, are at their lowest \nlevels as a percentage of GDP since they started keeping score in 1947. \nThey are the lowest since they started keeping score. Now, why is that \nthe case? There is plenty of income in this country, but it is going to \nothers.\n  I mentioned the maximum wage. Is there a maximum wage? Did anybody \nrush to the Senate floor to express concern when we read in the paper \none morning that the head of Exxon got a $400 million buyout, or $400 \nmillion in benefits, as he left his job? That is $150,000 a day in \nincome. What is the minimum wage these days? It is about $40 a day. \nThere is a lot of concern about that on the floor of the Senate. Maybe \nit will go to $50 a day for the folks at the bottom of the ladder in \nthis economy of ours. Does anybody come over here and say: You know \nwhat, when I read that somebody gets $150,000 a day, I am concerned. \nNo, it is just quiet; you can hear a pin drop in the Chamber about the \nissue of the maximum wages. It is unbelievable.\n  The other day, $180 million was given to a person who was leaving a \ncompany because the company was displeased with his performance. I \ncould spend a couple of hours here talking about those kinds of \npayouts. Nobody is talking about a maximum wage. I am not here talking \nabout a maximum wage. Why so much concern about a minimum wage for the \nfolks who work at the bottom in this country?\n  I support expensing for small business investments in equipment and \nmachinery, but why is this bill being held hostage for that sort of \nthing? I voted for that in other circumstances and will again. Why is \nit so hard to pull a minimum wage through this Chamber? It is really \npretty bizarre.\n  You know, I have watched people work in circumstances that are very \ndifficult. We have a lot of people who work two and three jobs and work \nvery hard. One day, I talked to a woman who was an unbelievable success \nstory. She was working for very little money at the bottom of the \nladder, cleaning toilets and the hallways of a very small college--a \nsingle mother with four kids, working right at the bottom. She thought: \nYou know, somehow, some day, I want to graduate from this college. I \nwas there when she did. I was a speaker at the commencement. She was 42 \nyears old and had four kids. She was wearing a cap and a gown and a \nsmile, and she did it because we cared enough for Pell grants and the \nkinds of things that can give someone hope.\n\n  The fact is that people who work at the bottom of the economic ladder \nfor minimum wage have been lost and forgotten, particularly here. They \nare the people who make the beds in the hotels in which we sleep. They \nare the people who serve the food at the fast food places we frequent. \nThey are people who work hard. They want an opportunity and a chance. \nAfter 10 years, this bill isn't a major policy change; this is an \nobligation this Congress has had for years, which it has ignored. Now \nwe bring it to the floor of the Senate, and we are told that the price \nfor this is additional tax breaks. The only way you will help somebody \nat the bottom after 10 years is to give additional tax breaks.\n  Go back and look at the tax breaks that have been given. I just \nmentioned one, by the way--a 5\\1/4\\ percent income tax rate. There is \nno one listening to this debate who is paying 5\\1/4\\ percent. Everyone \nis paying more than that. But the biggest corporations in America got \nto pay 5\\1/4\\ percent on income they earned overseas in plants where \noften they sent American jobs. They get to pay 5\\1/4\\ percent on income \nthey earn there. That is the break they get. Nobody else gets that. \nThat went through here very easily. Nobody is going to hold that \nhostage; my gosh, that benefits the folks at the top.\n  Let me make one other point that I think is important. The very \npeople who are opposed to a minimum wage--George Will says the minimum \nwage ought to be zero, by the way. That is all right for him because he \nis not earning the minimum wage. But the very people in this Chamber \nwho are opposed to a minimum wage, if you go back and check the votes, \nare the ones who have voted for a tax incentive or tax break for the \ncompanies that ship their jobs overseas.\n  That is easy to track, by the way, because we have had four votes on \nthat--to shut down that pernicious, unbelievable tax break. We say to a \ncompany: Shut your manufacturing plant down, fire your workers, move \nyour production to China, and we will give you a big fat tax break. We \nhave tried to get rid of that four times, and four times we have \nfailed.\n  The same colleagues who are so concerned about helping people at the \nbottom with a very reasonable adjustment in the minimum wage after 10 \nyears are the very same people who said: We want to continue a tax \nbreak to ship American jobs overseas.\n  I am just telling you that everybody has a right to their opinion, \nand I will respect it. But I certainly have a right to say I believe it \nis wrong. I believe it is bad policy for this country. This economic \nengine works best when everybody works. There is no social program in \nthis country as important as a good job that pays well. We all \nunderstand that. We also understand there are a lot of jobs in this \ncountry with substantial downward pressure on income because of this \nso-called globalization by which the largest enterprises can go find \nthe lowest paid workers anywhere in the world and move their jobs, \nputting downward pressure on American workers' income. We know what is \nhappening in the workplace.\n  Let me end as I started, by saying that salaries and wages, which is \nthe income workers in this country get, are at their lowest percentage \nof our economy since they started keeping score in 1947. It doesn't \ntake a rocket\n\n[[Page S1147]]\n\nscientist to interpret that. If the interpretation of that doesn't \npersuade one that we have an obligation to do something for the people \nworking at the bottom of the economic ladder for the minimum wage, then \nI don't know what would persuade them.\n  Finally, this is not about teenagers. No matter how often you say it, \nthat does not make it true.\n  This is not about teenagers. Over 70 percent of the people on the \nminimum wage are adults, many of them with children, 60 percent of them \nwomen, a third of them working as their only job and their only income \nfor their family. Those are the facts.\n  There is one other fact that is certain. There is no one in this \nChamber--no one in this Chamber--who puts on a dark suit in the morning \nand goes to work for a minimum wage. No one in this Chamber understands \nthe requirement to work for a minimum wage at two or three jobs to try \nto keep your family going. But there are a lot of people in this \ncountry who do understand, and they wake up every morning hoping and \npraying that somehow they will get a fair break and get a fair wage.\n  Productivity is going up in this country, and we are blessed by that. \nBut the income for workers who have become more productive has lagged \nway behind. And I wonder why. I guess we know the answer. This country \nis a better country if we understand that the share of wealth and the \nshare of income in this country ought to go to those who deserve it. \nAnd if American workers are much, much, much more productive--and they \nhave been--then they also deserve a fair share of this country's \nincome. That has always been the case.\n  In the last century, the kinds of things we have done to make this a \nbetter place in which to work--safe workplace, child labor, minimum \nwage, the right to organize, and a range of issues--have strengthened \nthis country and made this a better country.\n  This legislation that we are considering today is also legislation \nthat will strengthen this country and do the right thing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 105\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, the amendment that I called up earlier, \namendment No. 105, is one that touches on a little different issue. I \nhad hoped there would be a bipartisan consensus base. It involves \nchildren and youth in our foster care system. Inconsistencies in our \nFederal wage laws, coupled with increases in the minimum wage, are \nfinancially crippling nonprofit organizations and institutions that \nmake up a necessary part of our communities' support systems for the \nmost vulnerable in our society--the children.\n  More than 500,000 children are in America's foster care system at any \ngiven time because their own families are in crisis or unable to \nprovide for their essential well-being--most because they have been \nsubject to abuse and neglect. Thankfully, most are able to be placed \nwith individual caring families. But for children without a suitable or \navailable foster family, they are placed in one of the many group homes \nassociated with our foster care system.\n  Many of these group homes are specially tailored with the specific \nneeds of foster care children, offering unique programs and onsite \neducation to help heal the emotional scarring they have experienced.\n  These homes--often run by private, nonprofit organizations--are \ndedicated to providing residential care and treatment for the so-called \norphans of the living, and they have long been a vital part of the \nsocial service networks in America's communities.\n  An essential component of the foster care network is the presence of \ncaring parents in a family-like situation. And as in traditional \nparenting, the house parents of group foster homes seek to provide the \nsame love, care, and supervision of a traditional family for the five \nto eight children who reside with them.\n  House parents volunteer to permanently reside at a group home in \norder to create a family-like environment for those without a true \nsense of home, one that offers a structured atmosphere where these most \nvulnerable youth can heal, grow, and become productive members of \nsociety.\n  Foster care alumni studies show us that it is the consistent and \nlifelong connection of caring foster parents that plays the biggest \nrole in helping foster children transition into society.\n  However, our current laws are working against this cause, forcing \ngroup homes to move away from what they know is best for the children \nand preventing them from providing the most consistent care. These \nyouth so desperately need the stability that a family-like situation \ncan provide, and that is what my amendment seeks to address.\n  Traditionally, in addition to a modest, fixed salary, house parents \nhave received food, lodging, insurance, and transportation free of \ncharge. In 1974, Congress recognized and confirmed the unique role \nhouse parents serve when it passed the Hershey exemption. This amended \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act to preserve the appropriate method of \ncompensation for house parents and allowed the lodging and food \nprovided them to be considered when determining an appropriate salary \nfor married house parents serving with their spouse at nonprofit \neducational institutions.\n  Through this exemption, Congress supplied a way for these vital \nsocial services to continue to be provided by nonprofit organizations \nin a way that is cost-effective and at the same time appropriate and \nmeaningful to both the children and the house parents.\n  However, since the addition of this exemption, the demographics of \nAmerica and of America's foster children have changed. Research now \nshows that due to the negative experiences some youth have faced, they \nmay find a better environment for growth and healing in having a single \nhouse parent of the same sex. Our labor standards for these group homes \nhave not kept pace with the ever-changing needs of these children.\n  Because the Hershey exemption was only extended to married couples, \ngroup homes are now forced to choose between what is cheaper and what \nis best for the children. Unfortunately, the financial realities of the \nsituation place these facilities in a compromising situation.\n  You see, when a group home employs a single house parent for a home, \nthey are required to pay them as an hourly employee, whereas married \nhouse parents serving together are allowed to be paid as salaried \nemployees.\n  As a result, it costs a facility in Florida more than $74,000 \nannually at the current minimum wage rate to provide a full-time single \nhouse parent using the traditional live-in model.\n  In response, most facilities have resorted to teams of house parents \nwho work in 8-to-12-hour shifts just to avoid the additional cost of \novertime pay. Yet even this team model is pricey and means tough \ncoordination and inconsistencies in care for these children. It also \ndestroys the family-like arrangement of the home.\n  If the minimum wage bill, to which I am offering this amendment, \npasses, it would cost facilities across the United States in excess of \n$84,000 annually to house and employ a single, full-time house parent \nin a foster care or educational group home. However, if it were a \nmarried couple serving in the same environment, it would only require \nminimum wage guidelines be met.\n  Can you see, Mr. President, how this inconsistency in our labor laws \nis, and will continue to be, crippling for the private, nonprofit \nfacilities?\n  In order to enable group homes to provide the most appropriate and \nconsistent care for foster and emotionally scarred youth, my amendment \nwill extend the Hershey exemption to single house parents, allowing \nthem to be treated as salaried employees when free lodge and board are \nprovided.\n  Voting in favor of my amendment will enable private, nonprofit group \nhomes to continue providing these vital services for our communities \nwith a stronger atmosphere of love and growth for the children.\n  Voting against this amendment--that is, allowing it not to be \nadopted--will mean that the already heavy financial burden for these \nfacilities will continue to grow. Homes will be forced to close or have \nto scale back on the number of children they can help.\n  To vote against this amendment--or to not allow it to be adopted--is \nto\n\n[[Page S1148]]\n\nturn children out on the street at a time when they need us most.\n  As a loving parent and grandparent, I want what is best for my \nchildren. I want to make sure they have whatever they need to overcome \nall the obstacles life may throw at them. And I also know what it means \nto be a foster child.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute in \nwhich to conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I conclude with this. I had the \nexperience in life of being a child in foster care for 4 years. I was \nfortunate to have had two different loving families that cared for me. \nDuring that time, I also had the benefit of two parents working to help \nme. I have maintained, until their deaths, relationships with three of \nthese four loving foster parents, and one of them today struggles for \nlife in a hospital in Tampa, FL, Eileen Young. I pray for her speedy \nrecovery.\n  However, these people made a difference in my life at a time when it \nmattered. I hope we are not going to deny today those children who need \nthat care of a foster environment to have their lives complicated by \nwhat the unintended effect of the minimum wage will be.\n  I urge the adoption of amendment No. 105 so we can continue this type \nof loving foster care relationship for the children of Florida and \nthroughout the United States who so desperately need it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 154\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, not seeing the sponsor of the Ensign \namendment in the Chamber, I will proceed to speak on his amendment. I \nam sure he will be coming to the floor at some point, but I wish to \nproceed at this point to speak about this amendment because I have \ngreat concern about the approach put forward in the Ensign amendment.\n  My colleague from North Dakota spoke a few moments ago about the \nchallenge we face as it relates to a global economy and whether in \nAmerica we are going to have an American strategy for everyone to do \nwell, to keep our middle class, to keep opportunity for people who want \nto work hard to move into the middle class.\n  This amendment, I believe, falls into that broad category of where \nare we going to create opportunity; how are we going to make sure \neverybody has the opportunity to have health care as part of that great \nAmerican dream.\n  What I see happening overall is a strategy that has been put in place \nright now that certainly I do not support and I believe the majority of \npeople in the majority in the Senate do not support. This basically \ncreates a race to the bottom saying to workers: If you only work for \nless, pay more in health care, and lose your pension, we can be \nsuccessful. We all know that is a losing strategy because there is \nalways going to be somebody in another country who can work for less, \nwho will work for less.\n  What we want to do is trade in a global economy, create an \nopportunity for other countries to move up to our standard of living--\nfair trade, addressing health care in a way that moves it off business \nbut creates health care for everyone, investing in education, \ninnovation, and opportunity and that great American engine.\n  I say that as a backdrop because, unfortunately, this amendment on \nHSAs, health savings accounts, moves us in the opposite direction. \nSenator Ensign's proposal would spend an additional $8 billion on \nhealth savings accounts. There is no good evidence that HSAs are \nsuccessful at expanding coverage or controlling costs. In fact, many \nbelieve that HSAs may do the opposite. They make health care coverage \nless affordable for those who really need it, encouraging healthy \npeople to leave comprehensive health care and go to these kinds of \nhigh-deductible plans.\n  This amendment would permit individually purchased high-deductible \npolicies to be financed with HSA funds, encouraging more healthy people \nto move to high-deductible policies in the individual market. What does \nthat mean?\n  We know that HSAs have deductibles of at least $1,000 for an \nindividual and $2,000 for a family. We also know that someone who has a \nsick child, a disabled child, someone who has high health indicators, \nhealth risks, somebody who is a baby boomer or older may not be able \nchoose to have a high-risk policy because they know they are going to \nneed their health insurance, they are going to need comprehensive \nhealth care.\n  So who chooses an HSA? Someone younger, healthy, or wealthier where \nthey can get a better deductible and the $1,000 out of pocket doesn't \nmatter to them. I find it ironic that we would be putting such a \nproposal on a minimum wage bill.\n  We certainly know that minimum wage workers are not those who can \ntake the risk of a health savings account and have the confidence that \nthey will have up to $1,000 to put into their health care before their \ncoverage kicks in.\n  In fact, we know from GAO that for those earning under $30,000 a \nyear, about 16 percent of tax filers have a health savings account \ncontribution, but for those earning $75,000 or above, that is 51 \npercent of the filings.\n  Even in that category, though, we also know, according to the \nCommonwealth Fund, that over 40 percent of people with a $1,000 \ndeductible reported that even though they had a medical problem, they \ndidn't see a doctor. They didn't fill a needed prescription or they \nskipped a recommended test or followup visit because they didn't want \nto have to pay directly the full amount for that under this deductible. \nWhat happens in that circumstance we all know. Someone waits until they \nget really sick, so health care costs go up because people didn't get \nthe care they need--the prevention, the tests, and so on.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask when I am within 5 minutes of the time for the \nmajority side that the Chair indicate that to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. We are in a situation now where we have to decide, are \nwe going to continue health insurance for what it should be, which is \npooling the risk? The whole idea of insurance is to pool the risk. We \nwant healthy, younger individuals, we want my son and daughter who are \nhealthier and younger, to buy into the same plan that I am buying into, \nthat the Presiding Officer is buying into, that others who are older \nare buying into, so that we pool that risk. We may not need that health \ncare as frequently as our mom and dad or aunt and uncle or your \nneighbor or colleague who has a health problem, but their ability to \nget health coverage is kept at a reasonable cost because the risk is \npooled. That is what health insurance is all about.\n  That is what auto insurance is all about. We don't have auto \ninsurance where we have a pool only for people we know are going to \nhave an accident and those over here whom we know are not. We pool the \nrisk. This particular amendment expands a concept, a proposal that \nbreaks that apart. It basically encourages people who can afford it, or \nwho are going to gamble because they are very healthy, that they are \nnot going to need any kind of health care this coming year. They get a \ntax benefit. They get to write off a premium for a high-deductible plan \nas long as it is in the individual market. But someone, in fact, who is \nlikely to be sick or does have children or does have more risk factors \nor more need to see the doctor doesn't get the same benefit.\n  That makes absolutely no sense to me. Certainly, when we look at how \nwe, as America, move forward on health care, that moves in the opposite \ndirection from where we need to go, of pooling the risk. We need to be \npooling it even further. We need to be creating large pools so we are \npooling the risk and lowering the cost, not doing what this talks \nabout.\n  I appreciate the great pressure we all feel right now to address \nhealth care, as we should, as we must. I believe it is the single \ndriving factor for our businesses. I know in the State of Michigan, \nwith many people working in manufacturing, and those people very \nconcerned about the global economy and how we are going to compete, the\n\n[[Page S1149]]\n\nquestion of health care and how we fund health insurance becomes a \ncompetitiveness issue. It is costing us jobs, the way we structure the \nfunding of health care. We also know we pay more because of the way we \nfund it.\n  Every single time somebody with a high-deductible policy, somebody \nwho knows they have a $1,000 deductible, decides they are getting a \nlittle bit sick, if they don't believe they have the money or want to \nspend the money to go through their insurance plan they are going to go \nto the emergency room when they are sick. Who pays when that happens? \nWe all pay. The hospital treats them and then they turn around and \nraise the rates on everybody with insurance. That is how we get a $20 \naspirin. That is how we get all these costs that are shifted onto \neveryone else.\n  When the Commonwealth Fund says over 40 percent of the people with \nthese kinds of policies don't get their medical problems addressed or \nskip a doctor or a prescription or recommended test, that means we are \ntalking about individuals who are more likely to be very ill, more \nlikely to walk into that emergency room, more likely to have their \ncosts shifted onto everyone else.\n  I urge my colleagues not to proceed with this kind of proposal. I \nthank the chairman of the Finance Committee for his willingness to \nseriously address the issues of health care. We intend, in the Finance \nCommittee, to have a series of hearings. Our chairman, who is a very \nthoughtful, thorough individual, I know will be looking at a wide \nvariety of proposals. We need the opportunity to do that. My opposition \nto this proposal does not mean that I don't believe health care is at \nthe top of the list on priorities. I do. But we need the opportunity to \nlook at all of the ramifications because what we have seen to date is \nthat this kind of proposal moves us in exactly the opposite direction.\n  We know a number of things that we can do that would take $8 billion \nand add health insurance for people. We have colleagues--Senator Durbin \nand Senator Lincoln--who have offered a proposal for national pooling \nof small businesses to be able to buy into systems nationally to be \nable to lower costs. Other colleagues have proposals as well. We know \nwe are going to have proposals to extend children's health care before \nus very shortly. Again, I commend our chairman for his commitment to \nthe issue of expanding children's health care to all children. That is \nan important way for us to be able to spend $8 billion and be able to \nprovide health care to more children, more families, and to lower \ncosts--not raise costs.\n  Senator Snowe and I are working on a proposal, with our distinguished \nfriend from Wyoming as well, on health IT. We know we can dramatically \nsave costs and put money back into the provision of health insurance \npaying for health care by using health information technology. I think \na more productive way to spend $8 billion at this point would be to \nprovide tax incentives for our physicians and other private sector \nproviders to be able to help them purchase hardware and software, to be \nable to do ``e-prescribing,'' to be able to use technology and have all \nthe benefits both from a quality standpoint and saving lives as well as \nsaving dollars.\n  At this point I would simply say that I believe very strongly that \nHSAs are the wrong direction in which to go fundamentally. They do not \nexpand who receives health insurance, they do not lower costs, and I \nbelieve very strongly that there are other ways to use $8 billion. The \nFinance Committee, I have every confidence, is going to look at a wide \nvariety of opportunities, including expanding health insurance for \nchildren.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Most of the analyses of health benefit accounts say they \nprimarily benefit people who are healthy and wealthy, and it seems to \nme the challenge for health insurance in America is for those in the \nlower income categories, and particularly those who may be \nvulnerable from a health situation. It seems putting more money into a \nplan that helps people who are doing fairly well in comparison to \nothers is not the right investment at this moment.\n\n  I wonder if the Senator from Michigan agrees with that.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I absolutely agree with our distinguished assistant \nmajority leader. Let me say I indicated a moment ago that he has a \nbetter proposal himself, and Senator Lincoln. We know for the majority \nof people who are not insured, 80 percent of those who are uninsured \nwork for small businesses. I am very excited about the approach that \nthe Senator has proposed in terms of a national pool and a tax credit \nto help fund it. I think we all are very committed to expanding health \ncare coverage and to doing it the right way.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Michigan will yield on that point, \nSenator Lincoln and I and many others have introduced a bill to help \nsmall businesses buy the same kind of health insurance that is \navailable to Members of Congress. If it is good enough for us, it is \ngood enough for America. Some 250 private insurance companies across \nAmerica sell insurance to Federal employees and to Members of Congress. \nWhat we want to do is make that insurance available to small \nbusinesses. The $8 billion in this bill could be used to help small \nbusinesses pay for the health insurance premiums of lower income \nemployees. Instead of focusing on the healthy and wealthy, we would be \nfocusing on businesses that want to do the right thing and need a \nhelping hand from the Tax Code.\n  I ask the Senator from Michigan, if we are going to invest money to \ntry to deal with 48 million uninsured and underinsured Americans, \nwouldn't it be better to expand opportunities for small business than \nto focus on those among us who are already pretty well off?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my friend. I couldn't agree more. I think he \nvery eloquently stated what is in front of us. We have 8 billion \nprecious dollars in the middle of a deficit, and we have to be very \nstrategic about where we put our dollars. The proposal for small \nbusiness pooling is similar to what we receive. I think that is the \nleast we can do for small business, particularly when we know that 80 \npercent of the people who do not have health insurance are in small \nbusinesses.\n  I thank my colleague. I know colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwant very much to address this issue of health care. It is a question \nof how we do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask in closing at the moment that we, at a minimum, \nwithhold on this amendment; that we not proceed on this particular \nproposal to allow us on the Finance Committee to look at all of the \noptions, to look at the facts, to look at what actually expands \ncoverage, what actually lowers costs, and do this together. This is \nsomething we need to do on a bipartisan basis, and I hope we will do \nthis in a very positive way so that when we are spending $8 billion, we \nknow we are getting every single penny of value out of that for people \nwho desperately need health care today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Can I inquire as to the time remaining? I was under a \nlittle different impression on the time to vote, I guess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 21 minutes. The \nSenator from Michigan has 4 minutes 20 seconds. The Senator from \nWyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I had hoped that the discussions that are happening on \nhealth care would continue to happen and that they would not be a focus \nof this particular bill. But, again, until we get some assurance that \nthere is going to be a tax package that provides for some of the impact \nfor small business, we will be discussing a variety of topics. I can \ntell by the amendments that have been put in.\n  I need to do some clarification on this particular amendment. While I \nencourage people to keep working across the aisle on a whole variety of \nproposals, this particular amendment deals with helping to pay premiums \nfor high-deductible plans in the individual market, not in the group \nmarket. This is in the individual market. I think everybody who works \nwith health care pretty much agrees that one of the difficulties we \nhave with health care is that primarily the premiums are paid\n\n[[Page S1150]]\n\nfor by companies that get a huge tax deduction for doing that. When the \npremiums are paid for that way, the insurance is paid for that way, \nthere isn't nearly as much responsibility on the part of the individual \nto see that they are getting the best care at the lowest cost. It has \nallowed the system to blossom and grow.\n  But this particular amendment deals with the individual nongroup \nmarket. At the present time, while we allow companies to deduct \nanything they put in for premiums, we don't allow individuals to do \nthat. We do allow individuals to buy health savings accounts. That \nmeans they pay a premium for a high deductible, which helps to bring \ndown that premium and puts people in a market that they could not have \nbeen in before. But the part that they get the deduction on is the part \nthat covers the deductible, the high deductible. They can put that in a \nsavings account, and they can actually roll that over from year to year \nif they don't have to use the deductible on it. But nobody helps them \nwith the tax on their premium.\n  For most people it is the premium that is the biggest cost. For \nindividuals it is the premium that is the biggest cost. If they work \nfor a company that provides insurance, they don't have that cost. But \nif they are an individual, they get taxed on the money they pay to pay \ntheir premium.\n  What this amendment is suggesting is that we need to level the field \na little bit, and while they are paying a smaller premium on a high \ndeductible and allowed to deduct the portion that would be the \ndeductible, if they put that in a savings account, allowing them to \ntake part of that savings account and pay it for the premium so that \ntheir premium would also be deductible.\n  I don't know where the $8 billion comes from. There is not a formal \nscore on this, but there is a 2006 informal opinion from the Treasury \nstaff. It indicates that the cost is probably going to be about $50 \nmillion over 5 years, which is pretty modest compared even to the cost \nof other proposals for HSA expansion. The intent and effect would be to \nmake this HSA high-deductible option more easily available and \naffordable outside of the employment context.\n  We have to admit, if it is an individual buying the policy, it is the \nmost portable there is in the United States. We also talked about the \nneed for portability. When someone loses their job there are some ways \nthey can still get insurance, but that runs out. But if you have a \nhealth savings account, that is completely portable. It goes with you. \nThe whole works goes with you.\n\n  There are some small businesses that have been taking advantage of \nthis and paying the premium for their employees and then paying a \nportion of the deductible that goes into a savings account. They found \nthat this is the only mechanism by which they could afford insurance \nfor their employees. So we are not even talking about those folks \nbecause this is about ones in the individual market, which limits it \nconsiderably.\n  Everyone recognizes the difficulties with health care costs and \nobtaining health care coverage in the United States, and real solutions \nto this growing problem has to allow individuals and families to make \ndecisions based on their unique health care needs too. We can't just \nlimit health care to those who work for particularly big corporations \nwho, also, are having problems being able to fund the insurance they \nare buying for their people. The cost is dramatically escalating in the \nhealth care area. I think it is the No. 1 concern of people across the \nUnited States.\n  We have a lot of proposals that will help to bring down or at least \nstabilize those costs. I appreciate the help we have had from people on \nboth sides of the aisle in coming up with those proposals. A lot of \ntimes we have agreed on principle and now we are trying to get down to \ndetails and the detail is always the tough part, but I think we can \nmake some progress.\n  I am for choices. I am for individuals and families having more \noptions for obtaining health care insurance. I think more options help \nto bring down the cost; it is a competition factor. For that reason, I \nsupport Senator Ensign's amendment to provide more choices to allow \nindividuals and families who work--not the ones working for companies \nwhere the company is getting a tax deduction to buy their insurance. \nThis is for the individuals and families so they will have additional \noptions for obtaining health care coverage, especially when the \nemployer does not provide adequate options for health insurance. \nSenator Ensign's amendment does that. It provides more choices by \nallowing individuals without employer-based health coverage to use \nfunds from their health savings to pay for their high-deductible health \nplan premiums. Right now they only get to use the money they have in \nsavings to take care of deductibles. We would like for them to be able \nto take care of some of the premiums, too, which takes some of the \npressure off that end, and since most people in the country already get \nthat benefit through their company, which gets the tax deduction, we \nthought it would be nice if individuals had that too.\n  I think this is a modest proposal, with an estimated score of $50 \nmillion over 5 years. There will not be a lot of people who will take \nadvantage of it, but there will be some people who will take advantage \nof it, and it will provide additional options for individuals and \nfamilies without employer-based health coverage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am wondering whether my friend from \nMichigan would yield me the last 4 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am happy to yield the balance of the time to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment does nothing to help \nworking families, especially those earning the minimum wage. It is a \ntravesty that we are debating more tax breaks for the wealthy who use \nhealth savings accounts as another way to shelter their income when we \nshould be talking about a long overdue pay increase for working \nfamilies.\n  The real-world impact of this amendment is one more tax break that \nmakes health savings accounts, already the most tax-preferred accounts \nin history, even more alluring to those who are healthy and wealthy. It \nseems my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have yet to run out \nof more sweeteners for wealthy health savings account holders.\n  We shouldn't spend another dime on health savings accounts. At the \nsame time, there is no money--no money--for health care for children of \nthose who are poor or frail, there is no limit to the money they want \nto spend for new tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  Health savings accounts don't work for working families. A minimum \nwage worker who works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, makes \n$10,712. The deductible for a high-deductible family plan can be as \nmuch as $11,000--more than the worker makes in a year. And that is just \nthe deductible, that doesn't even include the premiums.\n  These accounts are no solution for working families who are uninsured \nor underinsured. A recent survey by the Commonwealth Fund found that \ncompared with those with traditional comprehensive insurance, families \nusing high-deductible health plans with health savings accounts were \nless than half as likely to have been uninsured before being covered by \ntheir current plan. Instead, those opening health savings accounts are \nmore likely to be healthy and wealthy and switching to a health savings \naccount to take advantage of tax breaks. Do we understand? Do we \nunderstand the growth in the health savings are for people who are \nalready insured? This doesn't do anything for workers, let alone \nminimum wage workers. Why does the increase in the minimum wage have to \nbe--have to carry the burden of providing a tax break for the \nwealthiest individuals in this country? Why don't we put this on some \nother program? Why is it the hardest working Americans at the lowest \nend of the economic ladder have to be out there and to have a sweetener \nfor the wealthiest individuals? Why is it, Mr. President? That is what \nthis amendment is all about.\n  The GAO found the average income of those using health savings \naccounts was $133,000--three times that of all tax filers. That is the \naverage income of use. We are trying to get an increase in\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\nthe minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25, and our friends on the other side \nwant to have a tax break for those whose average income is $133,000. We \nknow our Republican friends are opposed to an increase in the minimum \nwage. Isn't a vote against it enough? Do you have such disdain for \nhard-working Americans who are earning the minimum wage that you have \nto file these kinds of amendments? Put it on your tax extenders. That \nis what the health savings accounts were on before. Put it on that. Why \ntake it out on hard-working Americans who are at the lower end of the \neconomic ladder?\n  These plans don't work for working families because the high out-of-\npocket costs associated with the high-deductible plan leaves these \nfamilies at great financial risk. It's no wonder that over half of all \nbankruptcies in America are caused by patients unable to pay their \nmedical bills.\n  Of those who go bankrupt due to medical expenses, 75 percent had \nhealth insurance but found it didn't cover the care they needed when \nthey got sick. Health savings accounts contribute to this, with those \nwho are in high-deductible health plans with the accounts twice as \nlikely to spend 5 percent or more of their income on medical costs and \ntwice as likely to delay or avoid needed health care as those with \ntraditional health plans.\n  The large majority of low- and moderate-income working families who \nare given no choice but a high-deductible plan can't afford to fund a \nhealth savings account. And many employers don't contribute to their \nemployee's accounts, and if they do, the contributions are well below \nthe funds needed to meet the high deductible.\n  While more than half of those with incomes above $50,000 contribute \n$1,000 or more annually to their accounts, more than two-thirds of \nthose with lower incomes contribute less than $1,000, and more than \none-quarter are unable to contribute any money to their account.\n  Even if they manage to come up with money to put into their account, \nthose with lower incomes are disadvantaged because of the \nregressiveness of the tax code. A family of four earning $20,000 who \nmanages to scrape together $1,000 gets no tax advantage for their \ncontribution, while a family earning $120,000 gets a $3l0 tax \nreduction.\n  The inequity only increases with higher contributions. In the \nunlikely event that a family earning $20,000 was able to contribute \n$5,450, last year's maximum contribution, would still get no tax \nadvantage for their contribution, while a family earning $120,000 would \nreceive a tax break of $1,667.\n  It's no surprise that a study late last year by the Government \nAccountability Office found that health savings accounts were being \ndisproportionately used by those with high incomes. The GAO found that \nthe average income of those using health savings accounts was $133,000, \nalmost three times that of all tax filers. And account holders in a \nhealth savings account focus group acknowledged that many were using \ntheir health savings accounts to shelter income.\n  Finally, the GAO noted that:\n\n       when individuals are given a choice between HSA-eligible \n     and traditional plans . . . HSA-eligible plans may attract \n     healthier individuals who use less health care or, as we \n     found, higher-income individuals with the means to pay higher \n     deductibles and the desire to accrue tax-free savings.\n\n  The adverse selection that would result will raise premiums for \nworking families in traditional plans, increasing the likelihood they \nwill join the ranks of the uninsured.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. Promoting health \nsavings accounts is bad health policy, it is bad tax policy, and it \ndoes nothing to help low- and moderate-income working families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we are debating about whether to raise the \nFederal minimum wage in our country. I think that people on both sides \nof the aisle have agreed that it is time to raise the minimum wage in \nthis country. But health care is an important issue, and ensuring that \nhealth care is more affordable, available, and accessible affects a lot \nmore people in the United States than does the minimum wage. So at the \nsame time we are helping some in our society, shouldn't we be looking \nat ways to help many more Americans obtain health care that is \naccessible, affordable, and available?\n  Our health care system does not work to keep costs down and quality \nup because the people who actually receive health care services are not \nresponsible for paying for the services. The vast majority of people \nreceive health care through their employer and have low-deductible \npolicies. This provides no incentive to shop for better prices or high \nquality of care. If there was such an incentive, most people would shop \nfor better prices and better quality. However, many people are covered \nby a health insurance plan where they are told where to go and which \ndoctor to see. These individuals do not shop for quality or for price. \nMarket forces can improve both the quality of medicine and the cost of \nmedicine in the United States. Health savings accounts are an example \nof one instrument that can bring the idea of market forces into the \nhealth care field.\n  I can use several examples to illustrate how insurance can provide \nthe wrong incentives for people, ultimately driving up costs and \nutilization. Try to imagine if your homeowners policy was similar to \nwhat our health care policies are today. In other words, try to imagine \nif your homeowners insurance covered items beyond the structure of your \nhome if it was damaged and destroyed. For example, what if your \nhomeowners policy covered painting the trim on your house or doing the \nyard maintenance. If that were the case, what would happen? Well, all \nof us would paint the trim on our houses a lot more often. And, all of \nus would probably have landscapers instead of doing the yard work \nourselves. As a result, the cost of all of our homeowners insurance \nwould skyrocket.\n  We have seen the cost of health insurance skyrocket for the last \nseveral decades. As the cost of health care increases every year, \nfaster than inflation, more and more Americans are becoming uninsured. \nSo, in order to try to drive down the cost of health insurance, health \nsavings accounts were created. These accounts allow individuals with a \nhigh deductible health insurance plan to set aside money, tax-free, up \nto a set limit, to use for routine medical expenses. Health savings \naccounts allow individuals to shop for quality and for price.\n  With the health care system we have today, employers, who pay most of \nthe costs, indicated that something had to be done about the high cost \nof health care. As a result, health maintenance organizations were \ncreated. HMOs were supposed to help manage care, but became more about \nmanaging costs. HMOs are not viewed positively by most of the American \npeople. Individuals who are enrolled in HMOs often don't have a lot of \nchoice when it comes to picking a doctor. These individuals also do not \nget to spend a lot of time with their doctor because their doctors are \npaid on what is called a capitated rate. This means that doctors are \npaid a certain amount of dollars per patient.\n  The more patients these doctors can move through their offices, the \nbetter off they do. As a result, the doctor-patient relationship has \nbeen hurt.\n  Health savings accounts allow you to walk into the doctor's office \nwith your own money, so you will want your doctor to spend appropriate \ntime with you. Health savings accounts do something else fairly \nwonderful. Since 30 to 35 percent of our health care costs today are \nspent in the bureaucracy of paying the bills, every single doctor's \noffice has to hire people to collect the bills. With a health savings \naccount, you are paying for your care at the time of your visit. As a \nresult, you are not spending all of your money in an HMO, where there \nare layers of administration when it comes to billing. Health savings \naccounts go a long way toward eliminating a lot of the bill collecting \nthat is conducted, and the money that is saved can go into providing \nbetter quality of health care in the United States.\n  My amendment is simple. It would make health savings accounts more \nattractive. It would make it easier for people to get health care \ncoverage by allowing people to use their pre-tax Health Savings Account \ndollars to pay for health premiums. I believe my amendment will \nencourage more people to adopt health savings accounts.\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\n  Now that Federal employees are eligible for health savings accounts, \nmy family and I signed up for our own health savings accounts. We \nactually had some health care issues with our children this last month. \nSo my wife has been spending a lot of time talking with doctors. I told \nher to negotiate for prices and talk about quality and all of the \nvarious things that shoppers do in the marketplace. When market forces \nare brought in--whether it is with regard to cars, airplanes, or \ncomputers--costs not only go down, but quality goes up.\n\n  I have introduced this amendment today to urge more health savings \naccounts, so there are more market forces brought into our current \nhealth care system. My amendment will make health care more affordable \nand more accessible. It may also reduce the number of uninsured.\n  If we can bring the cost of health care down, more people will be \nable to afford health insurance. A lot of healthy young people say: \nHealth insurance is expensive. I can use that money to do other things. \nI am probably not going to get sick.\n  If we can bring down the cost of health care, a lot of the young \npeople who are currently choosing not to enroll in a health plan can be \nbrought into the health insurance market. What does this mean for the \nrest of us? It means that risk will be spread out among healthier \npeople, which brings the cost of health insurance down for everyone \nelse in the system. Health insurance is all about spreading out risk. \nWhat does that do? It makes health insurance even more affordable. It \nbrings in more people who are healthier and younger into the health \ninsurance market.\n  Of those 40-plus million people who are identified as not having \nhealth insurance coverage today, a lot of them are young, healthy \npeople. The more of these people we can get into the health care \nsystem, the more affordable health care is going to be for everyone \nelse. It can have a magical spiraling effect that can make health care \nmore accessible, more affordable, and more available to the citizens of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is the right thing to do for America. \nIf Members care about getting better quality health care to more people \nin the United States, vote for my amendment to expand health savings \naccounts today.\n  How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes remain.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Just on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Senator's side.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 13 seconds.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I will take 13 seconds to say, \nunfortunately, evidence shows exactly the opposite of what my friend is \nsaying. Any person who chooses on their own to buy insurance not \nthrough an HSA will not get the same benefit.\n  If you have a child who is sick, if you are older, if you have health \nissues, this issue does not address, unfortunately, the issues my \ncolleague has been talking about.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order the pending amendment \nviolates section 505(a) of House Concurrent Resolution 95, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I move to waive all points of order that lie against the \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside and that Senator Kyl be recognized \nto offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  I say to the Senator, do I understand there is a Member on his side \nwho would like to give some brief remarks?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Arizona, \nthere is always a Member on our side who would like to give some brief \nremarks. I ask, when might the Senator be ready to offer his amendment?\n  Mr. KYL. We are ready to offer the amendment. I thought what I could \ndo is get it pending, and then if someone wants to make some remarks.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I asked unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be laid aside so Senator Kyl can offer his amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as soon as the staff brings it to me, I will \nsend it to the desk.\n  There is an amendment I sent to the desk earlier, and I will briefly \ndescribe it. It simply extends the provisions in the Finance Committee \nbill that provide tax assistance to small business in terms of \nexpensing, depreciation, leasehold improvements, and so on, from the \nperiod of March 31 of next year through the end of next year. So it \nextends those provisions an additional 9 months. That legislation is \npending at the desk.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 205 to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. President, at this time, I send to the desk the legislation which \nadds to that the element that provides for the pay-for or the tax \nprovisions that will ensure this is revenue neutral. So I send this \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I can further describe the amendment, and we \ncan discuss it, debate it, when the chairman is ready to do that or \nthere is no one who intends to speak. I hope we can get this amendment \nvoted on as soon as possible today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for the interest of moving this along the \nrest of the day, there are two Senators who wish to speak, and it is my \nhope after they speak we can get some other amendments up and start \nvoting.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Ohio, \nMr. Brown, be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, and following Senator \nBrown, that the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders, be allowed to speak \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I grew up in Mansfield, OH, a small, blue-\ncollar city in the middle of America, a town of famous names--junior \nhighs named after U.S. Secretary of State John Sherman and the \nlegendary Johnny Appleseed; factories called Westinghouse and Tappan \nStove and Fisher Body. Like many of our country's greatest cities and \nour Nation's most comfortable small towns, Mansfield has a Park Avenue \nand a Main Street, a Central Park and a town square, a Carnegie Library \nand a corner drugstore.\n  In those days, people who worked hard, who paid their taxes, who \nplayed by the rules just about always had something to show for it. \nAlmost everyone--virtually almost everyone--in my hometown believed \nthat their children would enjoy a better life than they did. The more \nproductive they were--insurance salesmen and factory worker, clerk and \nfarmer--the better off they would be. The harder they worked, the more \nopportunity for their children. The middle class and all that it meant \nwas much closer to them and for them than a distant aspiration.\n  One-third of this body, 32 of my colleagues, came off the campaign \ntrail victorious last November. Ten of us joined the Senate earlier \nthis month. We are here for a reason. We are here because for too long \nGovernment betrayed the middle class.\n  In recent years, Ohioans have watched the drug companies write the \nMedicare law, the oil industry dictate our Nation's energy policy, the \ninsurance companies shape our health care. And perhaps worst of all, \nmany of our largest corporations, untethered to any community, have \nforced through a willing and compliant Congress job-killing trade \nagreements which outsource our jobs, divide our families, and hurt our \ncommunities.\n  We are here because Ohioans and people across our land understand the \nwords of Pope John Paul II:\n\n       We judge any economic system by what it does for and to \n     ordinary people and by how it permits all to participate in \n     it. The economy should serve the people, not the other way \n     around.\n\n  We are here because we have heard from people who have worked hard \nand played by the rules all their lives, yet have so little to show for \nit. I met a man at the free clinic in Youngstown who had all but given \nup because of his diabetes. He came to the free clinic, his blue eyes \ntearing up, because his daughter insisted, he told me, that she simply \nwanted him to live. The number of free clinics in Ohio--a rich State in \na rich country, a State known for some of the best medical facilities \nin the world--has doubled in the last decade. In rural Appalachia, the \nsmall community of Lottridge in Athens County is suffering from such \nstaggering job loss that the local food bank now serves more than 200 \nlocal families. And to maintain their sense of community pride and \ntogetherness, the food bank workers put up curtains and decorations to \nresemble a general store, not a place of charity.\n  A worker in Jackson, locked out of his factory because the company \nrefused to negotiate with the union and now without health care, told \nme his doctor advised him he needed heart surgery. ``I take aspirin \nevery day instead,'' he said, hoping his heart lasts longer than the \nlockout.\n  A woman in Cincinnati suffering from hypertension, high blood \npressure, and diabetes told me, with fear in her voice, that she was \nabout to fall in the doughnut hole in the new Medicare prescription \ndrug law. She needs help, but she was hiding it from her family. ``I'm \nso ashamed,'' she sobbed, as if it were her fault.\n  Last fall, my wife Connie was waiting in line at the local drugstore \nin the affluent community of Shaker Heights. The woman in front of her \nwas, for all intents and purposes, negotiating prices with the \npharmacist to save money. ``What if I cut my pill in half and then take \nit twice a day,'' she asked. The very understanding pharmacist told her \nthe doctor wants her to take her full medication twice a day. ``But \nisn't it better, since I can't afford this, to take half a pill twice a \nday than the whole pill just once?'' she asked. My wife asked the \npharmacist: How often does this happen? ``Every day,'' the pharmacist \nshrugged, ``Every day, all day long.''\n  At one time, our Government looked out for its people. I wear on my \nlapel a pin depicting a canary in a birdcage. A mine worker, 100 years \nago, used to take a canary down in the mines. The mine worker had no \ngovernment that cared enough to help him and no union strong enough to \nhelp him. He was on his own. In those days, a child born in this \ncountry had a life expectancy of about 46 or 47 years. Today we live \nthree decades longer because of what this Government has done. People \nof faith, people in their union halls, advocates for children and for \nwomen and for the poor have pushed this Government to pass clean air \nand safe drinking water laws, to pass Medicare and Medicaid and \nworkers' compensation and mine safety laws to protect the elderly and \nthe disabled and women and children. Today it seems to be a different \nstory.\n  Will and Ariel Durant, who probably have documented a wider sweep of \nhistory than any writers of the 20th century, warned us:\n\n       No society has survived without a middle class.\n\n  Something is profoundly wrong with our economy. The CEO of a major \nretail company recently was awarded a $210 million severance package \nafter the company's stock value dropped. Yet our Nation's working \nfamilies, Ohio's middle-class families, often cannot afford to send \ntheir sons and daughters to school. The Nation's wealthiest 1 percent \ncontrol as much wealth as 90 percent of the rest of us combined, yet 47 \nmillion of us do not have health insurance. That class difference is a \nthreat to our democratic system. A minimum wage worker earns less than \n$11,000 a year, yet some CEOs in our country make more than $11,000 an \nhour.\n  Today we consider legislation to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to \n$7.25 an hour. In the last decade, our Government has failed to raise \nthe minimum wage but given ourselves six pay increases. Those who plan \nto vote against the minimum wage in this Chamber, those who for 10 \nyears have blocked a minimum wage increase in the House of \nRepresentatives and in this body, are saying to the single mother \nworking as a chambermaid in a Cleveland hotel, to a farm worker outside \nToledo, to a janitor in Zanesville, those who plan to vote against the \nminimum wage are telling those minimum wage workers that they don't \ndeserve a fraction of what we get, not even a fraction.\n  There have been failures, to be sure, in this institution. And there \nhave been great moments.\n  Today, I am joined on the floor of the Senate by Senator Byrd of West \nVirginia. Three weeks ago, I stood next to him as I was sworn in for my \nfirst term and he was sworn in for his ninth term. More than 4 years \nago, in October of 2002, Senator Byrd stood in this Chamber and spoke \nwith prophetic wisdom about the pending war with Iraq. He instructed \nand taught millions of Americans, and he, with Senator Kennedy, \ninspired and emboldened many of us in the House of Representatives. I \nwas a House Member then. More than 130 of us voted against that war. He \nwarned us then that authorizing war in Iraq was ``both blind and \nimprovident.''\n\n  ``We are rushing into war,'' he said, ``without fully discussing why, \nwithout\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\nthoroughly considering the consequences, or without making any attempt \nto explore what steps we might take to avert conflict.''\n  I thank the senior Senator from my neighboring State of West \nVirginia.\n  The 110th Congress brings with it the breath of bipartisanship too \nlong absent from our discourse. Democrats and Republicans alike are \nalready working toward rebuilding our Nation's middle class. Earlier \nthis week, I stood with Senator Dorgan of North Dakota and Senator \nGraham of South Carolina as we called for a new direction in our trade \npolicy. I look forward to more of the same. Our Government needs to \nstand up for the middle class. We know why our constituents sent us \nhere. We need to get to work. Raising the minimum wage is a very \nimportant first step.\n  We must also work to create an alternative energy industry that not \nonly fosters development of renewable fuels but also creates solid \nmiddle-class jobs and new businesses. We must invest in education at \nall levels. We must provide for our veterans. We must lower the cost of \nprescription drugs and make health care more affordable. And we must \nfinally bring our troops home from Iraq.\n  There is much work to do in this Congress. The people of this Nation \nhave placed great trust in our ability to transcend partisanship. We \ncannot, we must not violate that trust.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we cannot, we must not violate that trust.\n  This is my 49th year in the U.S. Senate. When I came here 49 years \nago, there was no sound system in the Senate--none. And so when a \nSenator spoke, especially if he was giving his maiden speech, the word \ngot around that a Senator was going to make his maiden speech. Senators \ncame to the floor. The speeches, as I say, were not televised. There \nwas no audio. A Senator spoke from his desk, and he spoke out. He spoke \nout. He spoke without an audio system. But other Senators would come \nup. They would come closer to the Senator who was speaking. They would \ngather around. I can remember when I made my maiden speech in the \nSenate. It was a long time ago.\n  It has been my privilege today to sit at my desk here and listen to \nthe distinguished Senator who comes from my neighboring State just \nacross the great Ohio River. It has been my privilege to listen to him. \nHe spoke well. Senators are at their offices, most of them. A lot of \nthem heard this speech. They were not here to hear it, but I was here. \nI wish to commend the Senator on his maiden speech. It was a good \nspeech. I like the way he spoke. I like the way he spoke from his \nheart. That speech will be in the Record for 1,000 years. I compliment \nthe Senator. I am proud to be here in his audience today. I want him to \ncontinue to take the floor and speak his mind, speak for his people and \nto the people all across this country. I thank him for his speech. It \nwas well done. The content was splendid. It meant much to him, and it \nmeant much to me as I sat here. I thank him. May God continue to bless \nhim in his work here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my friend from West Virginia in \ncommending Mr. Brown, the Senator from Ohio, for his speech today.\n  When I first arrived here--the Senator from West Virginia probably \nremembers--freshman Senators were rarely expected to speak. If you \nspoke within the first 2 years, people thought you were coming along a \nlittle more rapidly than others might expect. That tradition has long \npassed. We can understand why.\n  Today in the Senate, working families and the middle class have a new \nchampion. His name is Sherrod Brown, and he comes from Ohio. He has \nspoken eloquently and movingly and compellingly about the challenges \nfacing citizens in the small towns and big cities of his State. He \ncould be speaking for the middle class and working families in New \nBedford, Fall River, Lowell, Lawrence, Springfield or Worcester or \nother places around the State of Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. When he summons us to the great challenge in foreign \npolicy, the war in Iraq, he speaks what is in the hearts, the souls, \nand the minds of all Americans.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. And the quicker we begin that debate and the quicker \nwe begin to bring the change and alteration in policy, as he has spoken \nto on other occasions, the better it is going to be not only for those \nextraordinary, brave service men and women who have been fighting \nbravely and gallantly for over 4 years in Iraq, but we will begin to \nrestore the prestige and influence of this country and the State he \nrepresents and loves. I thank the Senator for an excellent statement.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Vermont will be recognized for 10 minutes. Is the Senator from \nMissouri seeking time?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I am.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would also like to be recognized, as would the Senator \nfrom Arizona. I believe the Senator from West Virginia still has time. \nI wonder if we can organize an order so we know when we are going to \nspeak. The Senator from Vermont is going to speak----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVermont will speak for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \ncompletion of the statement of the Senator from Vermont, I be \nrecognized for 10 minutes, the Senator from Missouri for 10 minutes, \nand the Senator from Arizona be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask what the Senators are going to speak \non.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I have an amendment dealing with poverty in America.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have an amendment dealing with employee option time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from Arizona wants to speak on the amendment?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And the Senator from Missouri?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I have been asked to speak on the President's health \ncare plan today.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. For how long?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Less than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. So the understanding is that the Senator from Vermont \nwill speak for 10 minutes, the Senator from New Hampshire for 10, the \nSenator from Missouri for less than 10, and then Mr. Kyl for 10 \nminutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the order of speakers be as just stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, we \nhave a rule which provides that a Senator who wishes to speak should \naddress the Presiding Officer and that the Senator first seeking to \nspeak shall be recognized. We have rules around here.\n  I don't much like this idea of having people stand in line to speak, \nand when some Senator comes to the floor and seeks recognition, he or \nshe finds that somebody else already has consent to speak, and then \nsomeone else, and then someone else.\n  I will not object at this moment to this batting order, this lineup \nof speakers. I think the rules provide that if a Senator wants to \nspeak, he or she shall stand and ask for recognition. That is the way \nto do it. So I will not object to this lineup of speakers which puts at \na disadvantage a Senator who has not been here to listen to this lineup \nand who wants to come to the floor and speak--comes to the floor and \nseeks recognition and finds that somebody else has already gotten \nunanimous consent to speak. Let's do it right. I will not object today, \nbut let's not have this lining up of speakers. Let Senators come to the \nfloor and seek recognition and get recognition. That is what the rules \nsay. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will speak for just a minute. I very \nmuch appreciate the remarks of our very good friend from West Virginia. \nHe is right. He is always right, especially on matters of procedure. It \nis my thought that we will have no more than four. In\n\n[[Page S1155]]\n\nhonor of the Senator's points, I deeply appreciate that sentiment. We \nwon't go beyond the four. In an attempt to try to move the bill \nforward, we are trying to get floor speakers and, hopefully, get the \namendments up so that there is enough opportunity to offer their \namendments and we can vote on the amendments. But the Senator's basic \npoint is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. Senator Baucus, who is \nthe chairman and who is managing this bill--am I correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. At this point.\n  Mr. BYRD. He is a fine Senator. I take off my hat to him and thank \nhim for what he has said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 201 to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that it be in order for me to call up \namendment No. 201, and once the amendment is reported by number, I be \nrecognized under the order and, at the conclusion of my statement, the \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 201.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning poverty)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING POVERTY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States has the highest rate of poverty and \n     the highest rate of childhood poverty among 17 major \n     countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development including Germany, France, Italy, the United \n     Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, \n     Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and \n     Switzerland;\n       (2) 36,950,000 Americans are living in poverty, an increase \n     of 5,400,000 since 2000;\n       (3) 12,896,000 children in the United States under the age \n     of 18 lived in poverty in 2005, and the number of children \n     living in extreme poverty rose by 87,000 from 2004 through \n     2005;\n       (4) in 2005, an estimated 33 percent of the homeless \n     population were children and an estimated 1,350,000 children \n     will experience homelessness in a year;\n       (5) the number of uninsured Americans rose to 46,577,000 in \n     2005, 1,272,000 more than in the previous year, and the \n     number of Americans without health insurance has risen for 4 \n     consecutive years;\n       (6) the Department of Agriculture has found that, in 2005, \n     35,100,000 people lived in households experiencing food \n     insecurity, meaning that they did not have adequate access to \n     enough food to meet basic dietary needs to all times due to a \n     lack of financial resources;\n       (7) households with children experience food insecurity at \n     more than double the rate for households without children;\n       (8) The United States has the largest gap between the rich \n     and the poor of any major industrialized country;\n       (9) the wealthiest 400 Americans saw their combined net \n     worth increase by $120,000,000,000 from 2004 to 2005;\n       (10) the richest 400 Americans have a combined net worth of \n     $1,250,000,000,000 equaling the annual income of over 45 \n     percent of the entire world's population or 2,500,000,000 \n     people;\n       (11) of the world's 793 billionaires, over 400 are \n     Americans;\n       (12) in 1989, we only had 66 billionaires in this country; \n     and\n       (13) on January 20, 2001, President Bush stated ``In the \n     quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent \n     poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise. Where there is \n     suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not \n     strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities. \n     And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless. And I can \n     pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded \n     traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the \n     other side.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States has a moral obligation to improve the \n     lives of the 36,950,000 Americans living in poverty and the \n     15,928,000 of those who live in extreme poverty;\n       (2) the United States has a moral obligation to reduce the \n     enormous gap between the rich and the poor; and\n       (3) the President should immediately present to Congress a \n     comprehensive plan to eradicate child poverty and reduce the \n     gap between the rich and the poor by 2017.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating Senator \nKennedy for his strong leadership on the need to raise the minimum \nwage--a minimum wage that has not been raised for 10 years.\n  Let me also congratulate my colleague from Ohio, the current \nPresiding Officer, for his fine remarks, which I certainly concur with.\n  The United States of America is the richest country in the history of \nthe world. Unfortunately, despite our great wealth, nearly 13 percent \nof our citizens are living in poverty, and we have today the highest \nrate of childhood poverty of any major country in the industrialized \nworld. In my opinion, we have a moral responsibility to end childhood \npoverty in America.\n  Therefore, the amendment I am offering today simply expresses the \nsense of the Senate that, No. 1, we have a moral obligation to improve \nthe lives of nearly 37 million Americans living in poverty, including \nnearly 13 million children; No. 2, we have to address the reality that \nin the United States today we have, by far, the most unfair \ndistribution of wealth and income of any major industrialized country, \nand that we have a moral obligation to reduce that growing gap between \nthe rich and the poor; No. 3, and most important, this amendment calls \nupon the President to submit a plan to Congress which eradicates \nchildhood poverty over the next decade and reduces the growing gap \nbetween the rich and the poor.\n  As a nation, we are often very proud of our accomplishments. How \noften do we hear people say, ``U.S.A., No. 1''? I share that sentiment. \nCertainly, in so many areas our country is leading and has led the rest \nof the world, and we are all very proud of that.\n  Unfortunately, in terms of childhood poverty, within the \nindustrialized world, we are also No. 1. We are No. 1 in having the \nhighest rate of childhood poverty among any major country in the world, \nand that is not a No. 1 of which we should be proud.\n  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the childhood poverty rate in \nthe United States today is nearly 18 percent. According to data from \nthe Luxembourg Income Study Group, the childhood poverty rate in the \nUnited States is even higher, almost 22 percent.\n  Well, let's take a look at what childhood poverty rates are in other \nmajor countries, in many of the countries that we compete against \neconomically. In Germany, the childhood poverty rate is 9 percent. In \nFrance, it is 7.9 percent. In Austria, it is 6.7 percent. In Sweden, it \nis 4.2 percent. In Norway, it is 3.4 percent. In Finland, the childhood \npoverty rate is only 2.8 percent--2.8 percent in Finland, over 18 \npercent in the United States of America. There is something wrong with \nthat equation.\n  Have other countries succeeded when they put their minds to reducing \nchildhood poverty rates? The answer is yes.\n  In 1999, the British Government--our good friends in the United \nKingdom--made a commitment to address childhood poverty. Six years \nlater, child poverty in the United Kingdom had been cut by 20 percent. \nSimilar progress, as I understand it, has been made in Ireland.\n  Unfortunately, at the same time that Britain was taking important \nsteps to reduce childhood poverty, in the United States childhood \npoverty increased by about 12 percent. The situation is bad, and we are \nmoving in the wrong direction.\n  When we hear our fellow Senators come to the floor and say the United \nStates is the greatest country on Earth, I share that sentiment. But I \ndo not share the sentiment that the greatest country on Earth should \nhave, by far, the highest rate of childhood poverty in the \nindustrialized world, and that rate is growing higher and higher. We \nhave to address that issue. We cannot sweep it under the carpet.\n  While we continue to have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and \nwhile over 5 million more Americans have slipped into poverty since \nGeorge W. Bush has been President, there is another issue that this \nSenate has to address, and that is the growing oligarchic nature of our \nsociety. It is not talked about too much, but I think we should place \nit on the table.\n  Today, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans own more wealth than the \nbottom 90 percent, and the CEOs of our largest corporations now earn \nover 800\n\n[[Page S1156]]\n\ntimes what a minimum wage worker earns. Today in America the wealthiest \n13,000 families who constitute one one-hundreeth of 1 percent of the \npopulation receive almost as much income as the bottom 20 million \nAmerican families in the United States; one one-hundreth of 1 percent \nreceive almost as much income as the bottom 20 million American \nfamilies. That, in my view, is not what America is supposed to be.\n  Mr. BYRD. Here here.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, working with the President of the United \nStates, working in a bipartisan manner, we have to come up with ideas, \nplace them on the table, and end the disgrace of having the highest \nrate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. Other countries \nare making progress; we can do the same.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, at the same time, we have to reverse this \ntrend by which fewer and fewer people own more and more wealth, while \nmore and more people have less; while poverty increases and while the \nmiddle class shrinks.\n  The true greatness of a country does not lie in the number of \nmillionaires and billionaires that it has; rather, a great nation is \none in which justice, equality, and dignity prevail.\n  I close with a quote that none other than President George W. Bush \nmade on January 20, 2001. I quote from President Bush:\n\n       In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, \n     persistent poverty is unworthy of our Nation's promise. Where \n     there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not \n     strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities. \n     And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless. And I can \n     pledge our Nation to a goal: When we see that wounded \n     traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the \n     other side.\n\n  George W. Bush.\n  The President was right to make that pledge, but since he made that \nstatement, we all know that over 5 million more Americans have slipped \ninto poverty, including over 1 million children.\n  Let us turn that pledge to reality. We can begin to do that by \nraising the minimum wage, and we can begin to do that by coming up with \na plan, with a program, with legislation which eliminates childhood \npoverty in America and lowers the gap between the rich and the poor.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Amen. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 203 to Amendment No. 100\n\n       (Purpose: To enable employees to use employee option time)\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to this \nlegislation which is extraordinarily relevant to the legislation. It is \ncalled the employee option time amendment. It basically gives people \nwho work, especially working mothers, the opportunity to adjust their \nwork schedule so they can do things they need to do for their family by \nallowing them to move the work schedule around so that if they have an \nissue where one of their children may have to go in the hospital or \nneeds attention or a child has a soccer tournament or maybe there is a \nrecital or maybe there is a family event they want to go to, a wedding, \nor they want to take a 3-day weekend to enjoy some event, such as a \nNASCAR race or something they need to get to, this amendment allows \nthat working mother and that working family, or any worker for that \nmatter, the opportunity to have that chance.\n  In the past, it has been called flextime. We changed the title of it \nprimarily because we changed the language to make it absolutely clear \nthat this opportunity to move your work hours around is totally at the \ndiscretion of the employee, that the employer cannot force the employee \nto do this, the employer cannot require the employee to do this but, \nrather, the employee has the option of choosing to do this in a manner \nwhich they think is appropriate to their lifestyle.\n  This is not a radical idea. It is not some conservative idea. It is \njust a basic idea of giving fairness and options to working people but \npeople who are working a 40-hour week, especially to working single \nparents or parents generally.\n  It is so unradical and so reasonable that Federal employees--Federal \nemployees--have actually had this right to move their schedule around \nsince 1978. But every time we have tried to give it to the rest of the \nfolks who work in this country, it has been blocked. It has been \nblocked because some people felt it was inappropriate from a collective \nbargaining standpoint or they felt it would affect overtime or they \nfelt the employee would be at a disadvantage relative to the employer.\n  What we have done in this amendment is make it clear that none of \nthose things could happen. This doesn't affect collective bargaining \nagreements. Overtime cannot be affected. If a person works more hours \nin a period, if a person exceeds the hours they are allowed to work \nwithout getting overtime, overtime must be paid.\n  As I said earlier, the decision as to whether an employee pursues \nthis course of action, of choosing to move their hours around, is left \nwith the employee.\n  The way it works technically is like this. This is the way it works \nat the Federal level with Federal employees, and this is the way it \nwould work in this amendment when it is applied to the general \npopulation, especially people working 40-hour weeks.\n  If you as a working mother, for example, know you have an event \ncoming up for which you are going to need to take time off, for \nexample, as I said earlier, such as your child has to go into the \nhospital for an operation--hopefully not, but if that is the case--or \nthere is a big event in your family life, such as a recital or major \nathletic event, you want to know there are going to be 3 days you need \nfor a wedding or for something that is significant, you can adjust your \nschedule so that one week you work up to 50 hours and in the next week \nyou only have to work 30 hours or anything in between. You can work 45 \nhours in one week and 35 hours in the following week, whatever works \nrelative to your schedule and your time.\n  One can see the advantage of this, especially for people who have \nfamilies and so much going on in their life that they do need to have \nmore flexibility in their capacity to structure their hours.\n  Today they can't do that. Today an employee simply can't do that \nunless they are a Federal employee. If they are a Federal employee, \nthey can do that.\n  This amendment, which we have taken up before in a different form, \naccomplishes the goal of giving parents especially, but all working \npeople who work a 40-hour week, more capacity to make that schedule fit \ntheir lifestyle rather than having an arbitrary 40-hour work week \nschedule.\n  The changes, as I have mentioned, which we made in this amendment so \nthat it addresses the concerns which have been expressed on this floor \nbefore when we brought forth this idea--and this idea received a \nmajority at least once--are, as I mentioned, to make it very clear, \nvoluntary.\n  On page 2 of the amendment, it states no employee may be required to \nparticipate in such a plan.\n  On page 3 (2)(ii) states that the program may be carried out only if \nthe agreement was entered into knowingly and voluntarily by such \nemployee and was not a condition of employment.\n\n  On page 4, it states in subsection (b) that if such an employee has \naffirmed in writing, in a written statement that is made, kept, and \npreserved, that the employee has voluntarily chosen to participate in \nthe program.\n  There are significant penalties in this bill for an employer who \nviolates that voluntary aspect of an employee making a choice to go \nforward. So we have addressed that concern.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we make it very clear that in no way does \nthis abrogate the obligation to pay overtime if somebody exceeds the 80 \nhours in that 2-week period. So if you work 81 hours, you get overtime, \njust as you would if you were under the usual agreement of 40 hours a \nweek.\n  In addition, it makes it very clear this in no way abrogates any \ncollective bargaining agreements. Most of the resistance of this \namendment has come from the leadership of organized labor which, for \nsome reason I don't understand, quite honestly, views this as some sort \nof a threat or potential threat to the collective bargaining\n\n[[Page S1157]]\n\nprocess. It is not. We make it clear it is not.\n  This is simply an attempt to put all Americans on the same footing as \nall Federal employees by giving them flextime. We call it employee \noption time to make it absolutely clear it is the employee who has the \nchoice.\n  The amendment in the past was linked also--and this is another reason \nit was resisted--to something called comptime. Comptime is something \nmore controversial, I admit to that. Comptime is not in this amendment. \nComptime isn't going to be offered as an amendment, I don't believe.\n  Rather, we are sticking purely with what has traditionally been known \nas flextime and what has been given to Federal employees for over 20 \nyears, almost 30 years.\n  It is a very reasoned approach. When one thinks about it, yes, the \nminimum wage is going to help some people, but as a practical matter, \nthis idea of giving people more capacity to manage their schedule is \ngoing to have a much greater impact on the quality of life of people \nthan raising the minimum wage. Literally millions of people are going \nto have this authority and find it will increase their quality of life.\n  Most of the people who will receive this new opportunity to adjust \ntheir schedule to fit what their family needs are not making minimum \nwage. They may be wage earners and they may be hourly paid, but they \nare certainly not making minimum wage. So this is going to benefit \nliterally millions of people beyond the minimum wage earners, and it is \nespecially, as I mentioned, going to benefit those people who have \nfamilies, and especially benefit those people who are single parents \ntrying to raise families and being in the workplace at the same time, \nwhich is one of the most difficult things anybody does in our country. \nThis gives them more flexibility to manage their schedule so they can \ndo things that are important to their families.\n  It is a reasonable amendment. It is so reasonable, as I have \nmentioned, that the Federal employees have accepted it. It has been \naccepted by the Federal employees.\n  I ask that the amendment be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself, \n     Mr. Enzi, Mr. Sununu, and Mr. Isakson, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 203 to amendment No. 100.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nAlexander be added as cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the flexible time proposals we are debating \ntoday could have a monumental impact on the lives of thousands of \nworking men, women and families in America. There are some fortunate \nAmericans, including most State and Federal workers, who already have \nthe right to flexible time scheduling. In fact, according to a national \nstudy, some 43 percent of all U.S. workers have this right, and they \nlove to use it. Seventy-nine percent of the women who have to use it, \nand 68 percent of the men who have to use it, Study on the Changing \nWorkforce, Families and Work Institute)\n  But the majority of Americans do not have access to flexible time \nscheduling, and they deserve it, too. It could help the 67 percent of \nAmericans who say they don't have enough time with their children and \nthe 63 percent of Americans who say they don't have enough time with \ntheir spouses. At the very least, it would remove one of the barriers \nfor achieving a work-life balance.\n  So who are the people who are prohibited access to this type of \nbenefit? Well, it isn't any Member of this Senate. Salaried employees \nare not penalized for flexible work arrangements. Employers don't have \nto increase pay for these employees if they work more in one week and \nless in another. It isn't government employees, either. Flexible work \narrangements have been available in the Federal Government for almost \nthree decades.\n  In fact, this program has been so successful with government \nemployees that in 1994 President Clinton issued an Executive order \nextending it to parts of the Federal Government that had not yet had \nthe benefits of the program. President Clinton then stated, the ``Broad \nuse of flexible arrangements to enable Federal employees to better \nbalance their work and family responsibilities can increase employee \neffectiveness and job satisfaction while decreasing turnover rates and \nabsenteeism.\n  I couldn't agree more, but now we need to go further and extend this \nprivilege to private sector workers. It is long past time to give \nemployees the choice--the same choice as Federal workers. There is no \nreason that government employees need greater flexibility in meeting \nand balancing the demands of work and family than private sector \nemployees.\n  There are two proposals under consideration today. Senator Gregg has \noffered an employee option time amendment. This would give employees \nthe option of ``flexing'' their schedules over a 2-week period. \nBasically, hourly employees who wish to could voluntarily have their \nwork hours calculated on a biweekly rather than a weekly basis. This \nway a working mother could work 50 hours in one week and 30 hours in \nthe next week, while her husband worked an opposite schedule and their \nchildren enjoyed an extra 10 hours a week with a parent. If such an \narrangement were made and agreed to by both the employee and the \nemployer, the employee would still be entitled to overtime for any \nhours beyond that agreement. For example, if an employee was asked to \nwork 32 hours in a week that was scheduled to be a 30-hour week, the \nemployee would be paid overtime for the additional 2 hours.\n  I have to emphasize again, because I know my friends on the other \nside of the aisle don't always understand this, that the flexible time \narrangement is entirely voluntary. In fact, the Gregg amendment \nrequires written consent from the employee, and only employees with at \nleast a year's tenure would be eligible. No employee could be pressured \nto enter into one of these agreements. Such coercion is specifically \nprohibited and punishable with monetary penalties.\n  The second amendment which has been offered to this bill is a little \ndifferent approach. Senator DeMint's amendment addresses the disparity \nbetween government and private employees that has existed since 1978. \nIt essentially says government employees cannot exercise this benefit \nuntil private employees have the same right. I hope we will pass the \nGregg amendment today and the DeMint will not be necessary. There is no \nreason this shouldn't be the case.\n  There is a long history of support for flextime on both sides of the \naisle. I hope my friends won't mind if I remind them of a little of \nthis history. Although Democrats may now be attacking flextime \nproposals and calling it a ``wage cut'', some seem to be forgetting \nthat flextime is not a new issue but one with a long, bipartisan \nhistory.\n  In the early 1980s Senator Stevens led the effort to secure Federal \nworker access to compensatory time off and flextime. In 1985 former \nSenator Nickles shepherded a bill through the Senate that extended \nthese positive benefits to State and local employees.\n  These Senators did not foist an unpopular program onto unsuspecting \nworkers over the objections of Democrats. Both of those laws passed the \nSenate with overwhelming, bipartisan support. Senator Kennedy voted to \nensure that Federal employees would have access to flextime to have the \nscheduling options necessary to balance work and family life.\n  Senator Kennedy, along with 11 other Democrats, cosponsored the \nNickles bill to extend flextime and comp time to State and local \nemployees. Flextime was not a pay cut for State and local workers when \nSenator Kennedy and other Democrats endorsed it in 1982 and 1985. And \nit is not a pay cut for private sector employees now.\n  We are coming together--Republicans and Democrats--to raise the \nminimum wage in this bill, and to do it with fairness for the employers \nwho will be subject to this mandate. Let us\n\n[[Page S1158]]\n\nalso come together to give fairness to the employees who have been left \nout in the cold for 28 years. Let's give private employees the same \nright to arrange flexible work schedules as government employees. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Gregg amendment and, if it becomes \nnecessary, the DeMint amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMissouri is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise today to address a national \ncrisis--health care. Over the past 6 years, the number of uninsured in \nthis country has increased by 6 million people. Premiums have increased \nby 87 percent, compared to a 20-percent increase in wages. Our most \nvulnerable are being cut from the health care rolls. More and more are \nin fear that their existing coverage is inadequate and it would \nprobably leave them bankrupt if, God forbid, someone in their family \nfell seriously ill or was injured. In other words, we are in pretty bad \nshape when it comes to health care in this country.\n  Needless to say, I was pleased President Bush finally acknowledged \nour worsening health care crisis during his State of the Union Address \non Tuesday. While I was pleased with the acknowledgment, I was sorely \ndisappointed with the plan he laid out.\n  In a nutshell, the President's plan would essentially further the tax \nburden on the middle class, hurt employees and the businesses of those \nwho offer benefits, siphon funding from community-based health centers, \nand still leave 44 million Americans out in the cold when it comes to \nhealth care coverage.\n  On Tuesday, he presented this plan to the country. Today he is \nvisiting my State, the great State of Missouri, to peddle his program, \nattempting to sell it to the heartland.\n  Although we will be a polite audience, the show-me State got its name \nfor a reason. In Missouri, our Medicaid rolls were slashed as a result \nof budget decisions made on the State level, leaving nearly 100,000 \nadditional Missourians without any health care coverage. Also in \nMissouri, over 25,000 children have lost their health care because of \ncuts to our children's insurance program. In Missouri, we now have over \n600,000 citizens who have no health care coverage at all.\n  Initially I had high hopes that the President might offer a plan that \nwould help the millions of Americans just like these Missourians who do \nnot have any health care. I was certainly looking for the President to \nshow me something a little different on Tuesday. I had hoped he might \nlook to the successful reforms occurring in other States, such as those \nin Massachusetts and Vermont that expand access to care through risk \npooling or the optimistic proposals that have been presented in \nCalifornia and Pennsylvania, to enhance State programs by creating \nsimilar pooling mechanisms. These plans focus on ways to make health \ncare more affordable for every participant and increase accessibility \nfor those who are uninsured or underinsured, which is often just as \nrisky. These plans utilize options such as insurance risk pooling so \nthat large groups of people can use their numbers as leverage to bring \ndown the rates for everyone and protect those with existing conditions. \nAs many of us who have family members suffering from high blood \npressure, asthma, or even migraines know, these individuals may make \ntheir health care plan more susceptible to higher premiums or denials \nfor coverage altogether.\n  Under the President's plan, folks can't work together for better \nrates or protect higher risk patients from denial. They are left to \nfend for themselves. Providers will take the low-risk participants, \nlike skimming the cream off the top, and the rest are on their own as \nindividuals in a very difficult insurance market.\n  To make matters worse, if an individual currently has a high premium \nbecause of a family member's health condition, because they are older \nor because they have simply just opted for the most comprehensive \ncoverage, the President's plan would only allow for a certain \ndeduction, leaving them to foot the bill for a new tax increase. Let me \nsay that again--a new tax increase that is not covered.\n  Let me make this very simple and very clear. The President's plan for \nhealth care embraces a tax increase for 30 million Americans. He will \nraise taxes on 30 million Americans while only adding 3 million \nAmericans to the health care rolls. This is not a good bargain for the \nAmerican people. It does nothing for the working poor. This plan is \nbased on the idea of income tax deductibility. Obviously, if you are \nworking poor, your income tax deductions are not meaningful to you. You \ndon't have mortgage deductions. You don't have other deductions. You \ndon't have the kind of income for which those deductions are even \nhelpful. So this plan will increase taxes on 30 million Americans and \nwill do nothing for the working poor who are uninsured in such large \nnumbers.\n  We may know that the President wants to tax our health care for the \nfirst time, but he is masking that by telling the American people, like \nthose in Missouri today, that he is offering a tax deduction. This tax \ndeduction, of course, will end up favoring the most wealthy, while \nthose at the bottom or the middle will not benefit as much. For \nexample, a tax deduction of $15,000 as proposed in the President's plan \nwould be worth over $5,000 for a family taxed at the higher bracket of \n35 percent, the high-income earners of America, but for those in the \n10-percent tax bracket, the poorer Americans, that deduction would only \nbe worth $1,500.\n  Furthermore, employers who offer comprehensive health care would be \nencouraged to shift the responsibility to their employees. Even for \nemployers who offer an increase in wages to compensate for the change, \nthe individual market plans are more likely to cost more, be less \ncomprehensive, and provide a greater risk of high premiums or denial of \ncoverage for those who have existing conditions.\n  What may seem like a bargain today would not be a bargain in 10 \nyears. In fact, all you have to do is look at the numbers in the \nPresident's plan. It will cost our Treasury money in the beginning, but \nit is estimated that 10 years from now there will be no cost. All you \nhave to do is look at that to realize that this is not a plan which \nover the long run will bring stability to our health care system, \naccessibility to our health care system, or bring down health care \ncosts.\n  As you can tell, I do not agree with forcing the middle class to \nshoulder another tax hike. With a minimum wage that has not increased \nin over a decade, these are the same people who are trying to afford to \nsend their kids to college with ever-spiraling tuition costs, to fill \ntheir cars with gas and put food on the table. Wall Street might be \nseeing a boost in the economy, but these folks on Main Street have not \nseen it, and they need a break.\n  That is where I come down on this plan. Instead of asking the middle \nclass to bear another cost to their pocketbooks, we ought to look at \nthose big tax breaks to America's most wealthy. Let's look at these \ndifferent options. Let's use the President's plan as an opportunity to \nhave a discussion about the severity of the problems in the system and \nwhat we need to do to make it better. Let's ask the tough questions and \nexamine what is out there. Let's look at why is it that the United \nStates spends 16 percent of our income on health care but other wealthy \ncountries do not spend more than 11 percent; why is it that we spend 34 \npercent of our health care dollars on administrative costs while other \ncountries are only spending 19 percent; and why is it that American \nhealth insurance companies are insuring 4 percent fewer people in \nAmerica between 2001 and 2005, yet they have added 32 percent more \npeople to their payroll. Think about that for a minute. The health \ninsurance companies are insuring 4 percent fewer people in their health \ninsurance plans between 2001 and 2005, but in that same time they added \n32 percent more people to their payroll. What are these additional \npeople doing if they are insuring fewer people? Could it be that they \nare hiring more people to help them figure out ways to avoid paying \nhealth insurance claims? Let's find out why an American automotive \ngiant passes on $1,500 in health care costs per car, while the Japanese \nautomaker Toyota only passes on $110.\n\n  Bottom line: Families are hurt by health care costs. The vulnerable \nare at risk due to high health care costs, and businesses are \nstruggling. Health\n\n[[Page S1159]]\n\ncare in this country has turned into a giant game of pass the buck. I, \nfor one, can say that I thank President Bush for bringing our worst \ndomestic nightmare out of the dark. But as my predecessor liked to say, \nthe buck needs to stop right here.\n  I look forward to the many hours of debate we will need to have take \nplace in order to get this right, and we cannot stop until we get \nthere. The American people deserve this. In the meantime, I say to \nPresident Bush in Missouri, you need to show us more than this.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar.) The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I direct a question to the chairman of the \nFinance Committee. Did he need to do some intervening business before I \nspeak?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should make \npermanent the tax incentives to make education more affordable and more \naccessible for American families and eliminate wasteful spending, such \nas spending on unnecessary tax loopholes, in order to fully offset the \n      cost of such incentives and avoid forcing taxpayers to pay \n           substantially more interest to foreign creditors)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PERMANENT TAX \n                   INCENTIVES TO MAKE EDUCATION MORE AFFORDABLE \n                   AND MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should make \n     permanent the tax incentives to make education more \n     affordable and more accessible for American families and \n     eliminate wasteful spending, such as spending on unnecessary \n     tax loopholes, in order to fully offset the cost of such \n     incentives and avoid forcing taxpayers to pay substantially \n     more interest to foreign creditors.\n\n                           Amendment No. 205\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. It is my understanding that under a previous order, I have \n10 minutes to speak. I will speak on the amendment that until just a \nmoment ago was pending, amendment No. 205, which is my amendment to \nthis minimum wage bill to extend provisions of the Finance Committee \nbill from March 31 of next year through the end of next year.\n  The committee decided in its wisdom--and I note that it was a \nunanimous vote out of the committee, a bipartisan vote--that there were \ncertain small business tax provisions that should be extended to help \nsmall business pay for the minimum wage increase we would be mandating \nby this bill. Most of the jobs are small business jobs that would be \naffected by the minimum wage. In fact, about 60 percent of those jobs \nare in the restaurant industry.\n  As a result, the Finance Committee took several provisions of \nexisting law and created a couple of new provisions that enable these \nsmall businesses to write off their leasehold improvements or their \nowner improvements either in a shorter period of time than they had \nbeen previously allowed under the code or, in the case of new \nimprovements, a 15-year period which would be consistent for all these \nentities, whether they be restaurants or leasehold improvements or \nother new construction. This makes sense under the Tax Code since one \nneeds to conform a new building that is built with leasehold \nimprovements. If you are talking about a restaurant, for example, what \nyou build in terms of new counters or new kitchen facilities is going \nto be the same for both. The writeoff period should be the same, a \nconsistent 15-year period in this case. Certainly the Presiding Officer \ncan appreciate the need to be able to make improvements to a restaurant \nkind of facility and be able to write those improvements off in a \nmeaningful time under the Tax Code.\n  This was not a matter of debate. The members of the Finance Committee \nagreed unanimously that this was good policy. But the policy was only \nextended through the end of March of next year. The reason was that the \ncommittee was committed to offsetting the cost--that is to say the loss \nof revenue to the Treasury--with some other way of raising revenue to \nequal that revenue which was lost. The so-called pay-for requirement, \nrequiring members of the committee to find a way to pay for the tax \nloss, inhibited my amendment which would have extended these provisions \nfor an additional 9 months through the end of the year.\n  We now have found ways to pay for this additional extension and to \nsimplify it. What my amendment does is to take these same provisions \nthat are in the Finance Committee bill and extend them, not just \nthrough the end of March of next year but through the end of December \nnext year. That obviously allows businesses to be able to plan better, \nand if they can plan better, they can help to add to their facilities, \ncreate new facilities, create new jobs. And, of course, what we ought \nto be doing to enable small businesses to pay a minimum wage increase \nis to be creating more business, more jobs earning more income so they \ncan afford to pay this minimum wage.\n  Another reason I offered the amendment was that there is an imbalance \nin the Finance Committee product. One provision out of the Finance \nCommittee actually was extended for a period of 5 years. This is the \nwork opportunity tax credit. This is mostly--in fact, one witness said \nabout 95 percent of the value of this work opportunity tax credit is \nenjoyed by big businesses because they can afford to hire the lawyers \nand accountants to figure out how to comply with the provision. So this \nwork opportunity tax credit--the value of that is mostly something that \nis enjoyed by the bigger businesses. That provision was extended 5 \nyears.\n  All of these provisions to help the small businesses were only \nextended through March of next year. We believed that was very much out \nof balance. My amendment doesn't impact this 5-year extension of the \nwork opportunity tax credit, but what it does do is at least it brings \nthese other tax benefits up to the end of next year rather than just \nthe end of March of next year. So we make it slightly more beneficial \nfor small businesses and therefore somewhat improve their ability to \npay for the minimum wage increase.\n  I would argue that something like we have done here, that is, a \ntemporary extension of a tax benefit, should not have to be ``paid \nfor'' with a permanent change in tax policy. That makes no sense. But \nthe chairman of the committee ruled my amendment would have been out of \norder without such a so-called pay-for, so I withdrew the amendment in \ncommittee and now have reoffered it with a pay-for. It is change in \npermanent tax policy.\n  At this moment, my staff is meeting with the staff of the committee \nchairman and ranking member on the committee to see if there is some \nway we can agree to pay for this modest extension with tax policy on \nwhich we can all agree and not have to have a debate about. If we can \ndo that, obviously that would be my preference, and perhaps we can have \na vote that can be accommodated here very quickly. If staff is not able \nto agree on what that pay-for is and we have to go forward with the one \nI offered, we certainly want to do that. We want to have that vote as \nsoon as possible this afternoon. I will briefly describe what it is. \nThere may be some slight error in the way I describe it because I will, \ninstead of reading it, explain it the way I understand it.\n  Currently, the Tax Code would allow a discrimination between certain \nkinds of--different people receiving free tuition at a university, for \nexample. If you work for a company and that company says: We will send \nyour child to school free, we will pick up the tuition, you have to pay \nthe tax on that benefit, it is a taxable benefit to you. Let's say the \ntuition cost is $10,000, and your company gives you the $10,000 to pay\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\nfor your child, though you have to pay the taxes on that. But if you \nare a university professor and your child wants to go to school, in \nmany cases, the school waives the tuition for your child. Right now, \nyou don't have to pay the tax on that. That is clearly discriminatory. \nThe Joint Tax Committee has recommended in a report that deals with the \nso-called tax gap several provisions or loopholes that need to be \nclosed. This is one of those so that the Tax Code would treat everybody \nthe same. If you have tuition waived at a school, for example, it \ndoesn't matter whether you are the principal of the school, a teacher, \nor you are an employee of another corporation that is paying for it; in \nany event, the tax treatment is the same: You would be taxed on that \nparticular benefit. That is a fairer treatment than the current code. \nAs I say, it was recommended by the Joint Tax Committee as part of this \ntax gap series of recommendations to enable the Internal Revenue \nService to collect taxes fairly and try to ensure that when the code is \nadministered, it treats all taxpayers the same.\n\n  As I said, if there is a concern about that and the majority would \nlike to work with us to try to find a different way to offset the cost \nof our modest provision, we would be delighted to work with them. I \nappreciate the willingness of the chairman of the committee to do \nexactly that.\n  So if I could summarize, in my own words, all my amendment does is to \ntake the provisions of the Finance Committee bill that passed out of \nthe committee unanimously, that extends for small businesses certain \ntax benefits through the end of March of next year and extend those \nthrough the end of next year, December 31 of next year. That is the \nsole effect of the amendment. I think it is something we can all agree \nis good policy and would help to pay for the minimum wage increase we \nare imposing on the small businesses of our country.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the minimum wage \nincrease would impose $4 billion in new costs on the private sector in \n2009 and $5.7 billion in 2010, with the increased costs extending at \nroughly $5 billion each year. Small businesses would incur the bulk of \nthese costs, with restaurants subject to 60 percent of those costs.\n  Therefore, it is responsible to combine the minimum wage increase \nwith tax provisions that will help these small businesses weather the \nfinancial blow of the increase. That's why I am introducing my \namendment to extend three tax incentives that are designed to encourage \nbusiness investment and job creation in areas where the impact of the \nminimum wage increase will be felt most.\n  There are three provisions. The first amends current law and is a 15-\nyear recovery period for leasehold improvements and restaurant \nrenovations. The second, new provision, is a 15-year recovery period \nfor new restaurant construction. The third, also new, is a 15-year \nrecovery period for retail improvements\n  The base bill extends current law by 3 months, through the first \nquarter of 2008. My amendment extends the time-period during which \nrenovations to leaseholds or restaurants must be completed through the \nend of 2008 will enable more businesses to plan renovations that will \nhelp them improve and expand their business operations.\n  Regarding my provision on restaurant construction, there is no policy \njustification for providing a 39-year depreciation recovery period for \nnew construction, but giving renovations the 15-year treatment. The \nfloor, walls, or restrooms installed in a new building are the same \nquality as full-scale renovations and will suffer the same wear and \ntear. Further, convenience stores--a direct competitor of quick service \nrestaurants--are allowed to use a 15-year depreciation schedule for all \nconstruction this treatment is permanent law for convenience stores. \nIdeally, all of the accelerated depreciation provisions we are \nconsidering should be permanent too. By allowing restaurateurs to \ndeduct the cost of renovations and new construction on a shorter \nschedule, many more restaurant owners will be in a position to grow \ntheir businesses and continue to create more jobs. By definition, \nencouraging more new restaurants to be built means more new restaurant \njobs. This is important, because the restaurant industry is uniquely \nimpacted by a minimum wage increase. Of the nearly 2 million workers \nearning the minimum wage, 60 percent work in the food service industry. \nFurther, the last time Congress increased the minimum wage, 146,000 \njobs were cut from restaurant industry payrolls, according to the \nindustry.\n  Regarding the provision on retail improvements, The Small Business \nand work Opportunity Act of 2007 provides 15-year recovery period for \nimprovements made to owner-occupied retail spaces, thus putting these \nestablishments on the same footing as the leasehold improvements \nthrough the first quarter of 2008. The Kyl amendment would extend it \nthrough the end of 2008. Again, extending this treatment through 2008 \nmakes it more likely businesses can take advantage of the incentive.\n  Some have asked questions about the offset for these provisions. \nAlthough I don't believe we need an offset, this one does the \nfollowing: It eliminates the present--law exclusion from gross income \nand wages--meaning income and payroll taxes for qualified tuition \nreductions under section 117(d) of the Tax Code. The proposal would be \neffective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006.\n  I don't question whether a university or prep school wants to provide \nfree tuition as an employment perk for a professor or chancellor. But \nit makes little sense that the rest of the taxpayers in this country \nhave to subsidize that free tuition. Senators must clearly understand, \nif a small business wanted to give its employees' children free tuition \nat the local college, amounts over $5,000 would be a taxable benefit. \nAnd that is the right tax policy. To allow a college to provide the \nsame benefit and have it competely tax-free is unfair. And again, this \namendment does not eliminate the free tuition benefit.\n  Finally, let me reiterate that if we are going to increase the \nminimum wage, it must be combined with responsible tax relief to ensure \nthat we maintain our strong and growing economy. Mr. President, the \nscale of this tax relief does not represent what we should be passing \ntoday. This is a modest proposal, and I urge my colleagues to approve \nit.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 207 to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside and that I be allowed to call up my \namendment No. 207.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 207 to amendment No. 100.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 207\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should \nrepeal the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits and eliminate \n wasteful spending, such as spending on unnecessary tax loopholes, in \n    order to fully offset the cost of such repeal and avoid forcing \n   taxpayers to pay substantially more interest to foreign creditors)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REPEAL OF 1993 INCOME \n                   TAX INCREASE ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should repeal \n     the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits and \n     eliminate wasteful spending, such as spending on unnecessary \n     tax loopholes, in order to fully offset the cost of such \n     repeal and avoid forcing taxpayers to pay substantially more \n     interest to foreign creditors.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 2:05 p.m. today be for the debate on the Baucus amendment No. 207 \nand the Bunning amendment No. 119 and that the time run concurrently on \nboth amendments, with the time equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Baucus and Bunning; that at 2:05 p.m., the Senate proceed to \nvote in relation to the Baucus amendment, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Bunning amendment; with 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided between the\n\n[[Page S1161]]\n\nvotes; with no second-degree amendment in order to either amendment \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support my \namendment No. 207 which was just reported. This is essentially a \nsubstitute amendment to the Bunning amendment No. 119.\n  My amendment is quite simple. It says that Congress should repeal the \n1993 tax on Social Security benefits and eliminate wasteful spending \nsuch as spending on unnecessary tax loopholes--and I might say there \nare many of those--in order to fully offset the cost of such repeal. My \nalternative also explains that if we do not fully offset the cost of \nrepeal, we will be paying substantially, among other things, more \ninterest to foreign creditors because we will be not paying for it, \nessentially--and so increasing the deficit, essentially.\n  This amendment of mine, the alternative, I think is the better \namendment. Why? Because we have to be concerned about fiscal \ndiscipline. Unlike the underlying small business tax package reported \nout by the Finance Committee, the Bunning amendment is not paid for. \nIndeed, to repeal this provision now, as Senator Bunning proposes, \nwould drain over $200 billion from the Treasury over the next 10 years.\n  Furthermore, the Bunning amendment would eliminate a dedicated source \nof revenue for Medicare. As my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle know, we recently set up a trigger to warn us when 45 percent of \nMedicare funding comes from general revenues and, of course, the \nBunning amendment would move us closer to that trigger point.\n  The dedicated funding source that would be eliminated by the Bunning \namendment helps pay for hospitals, nursing care, home care services for \nthe elderly, all paid for by Medicare. I think a drastic reduction in \nthat funding source, that is $200 billion worth, would impair the \nFederal Government's ability to pay for hospital and nursing home care \nunder Medicare.\n  Furthermore, a loss of revenue such as that in the Bunning amendment \nwill make it even more difficult for us because it fails to address \nlong-term solvency and, in fact, makes long-term solvency of Social \nSecurity more in peril, not less. Such a change as Senator Bunning \nproposes is not paid for and would do great harm to both Social \nSecurity and to Medicare.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to think carefully. There is an option \nto vote for the Baucus amendment and an option to vote on the Bunning \namendment. The first vote would be on the Baucus amendment. The Baucus \namendment is more in the nature of a sense of the Senate, and I think \nit is the better course because, clearly, if we are to reduce the taxes \nSenator Bunning proposes in his amendment, we have to do it \nthoughtfully and not in a way that is not paid for, in a way that \nthreatens and imperils not only the deficit but also Medicare and \nSocial Security.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague on the floor now, and I yield the \nfloor so my colleague can speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 119\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, we will be voting on two amendments \nshortly, both dealing with the 1993 tax placed on Social Security \nbenefits. First, let me point out I am pleased the other side \napparently agrees with me that these taxes need to be repealed. \nHowever, only one amendment which we will be voting on today actually \ndoes that, and that is my amendment.\n  My amendment, the Bunning amendment, would actually repeal the unfair \ntax on senior citizens and provide relief. The amendment proposed by my \ngood friend, Senator Baucus, would not actually do anything. It is \nsimply a sense of the Senate.\n  This issue is fairly simple. When the Social Security program was \ncreated, benefits were not taxed at all. However, since then, Congress \ntwice has added taxes on these benefits for supposedly wealthy seniors. \nIn 1993, a tax was placed on 85 percent of seniors' Social Security \nbenefits if their income was above $34,000, if they were single, or \n$44,000 for a couple. Those are wealthy seniors. These numbers aren't \nindexed to inflation. So what has happened is more and more senior \ncitizens are affected by them each year.\n  My amendment is fairly simple. It repeals the tax starting in 2008. \nSeniors would not have to pay this additional tax. The amendment for \nthe other side is the type of thing known in the real world as a cover-\nyour-backside amendment. It does not give America's senior citizens a \ntax cut. All it does is provide political cover. It is a sense of the \nSenate which says that Congress should repeal the 1993 tax. We all know \nthat a sense of the Senate amendment doesn't really mean anything. It \ncannot be enacted into law. Congress never has to consider the issue \nagain. But our seniors will still be paying this tax.\n  My amendment actually repeals the 35-percent increase that was put on \nseniors in 1993. I think this issue is important enough to act on \nimmediately. My amendment would do that. If my amendment were to become \nlaw, the seniors would see the tax decrease on January 1, 2008. It will \nhappen instead of playing political games. The sense of the Senate \namendment basically thumbs its nose at American seniors. If it passes, \nwe are saying that although we agree the 1993 tax should be repealed, \nwe aren't going to do anything about it. A vote for the Bunning \namendment is a vote for a tax decrease on America's working seniors, on \nJanuary 1, 2008; that is the date, no ifs, ands or buts about it.\n  As for paying for the amendment, the amendment is paid for. It is \npaid for exactly like a lot of other things we pay for in this body: \nout of general fund dollars. We fund the Medicare Part A system \ngenerally out of general fund dollars. Our good friend from Montana has \nsuggested there is a trigger mechanism, when we get close to a certain \nfigure, on paying for Medicare Part A out of general fund dollars, and \nthat is true. But the fact is, over a 10-year period, at about $20 \nbillion a year, our senior citizens will have relief from this \nunbelievable 35 percent increase on seniors that we put on them in \n1993. I think it is about time we stop fooling with it and actually do \nthe job and repeal the tax of 1993. I would like to see that done \ntoday.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Cardin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me take us back to 1993 because I had \nthe opportunity, in 1993, to serve with Senator Bunning in the other \nbody, and we were both on the Ways and Means Committee in which this \nlegislation originally was considered.\n  The tax on Social Security was increased for two reasons. It was done \nbecause we wanted to be fiscally responsible and have adequate revenues \nto pay our bills. But it was done for a second reason, and that is to \nshore up the Social Security and Medicare trust funds so there would be \nadequate money in the funds to pay for benefits. We wanted to be \nresponsible. But there was another reason as well. There was another \nrationale as to why the tax was increased to that rate, and that is to \nmake it more comparable to the tax treatment of private pensions, as to \nthe amount of money the individual has already paid taxes on and that \nwhich the individual has not paid taxes on. So there was rationale for \nwhat was done in 1993. I wish to make sure that is clear in the record.\n  But the reason I oppose my friend's amendment, Senator Bunning's \namendment, is for three basic reasons. First, this amendment will add \n$200 billion more to our national debt if it were passed. It would \nincrease our deficit by that amount of money, and all of us are \ninterested in balancing the Federal budget and moving toward balancing \nit, not making the gap wider. We talk about fiscal responsibility, we \ntalk about pay-go, we talk about other rules. Well, let's start with \nthe amendments we are considering.\n  The second reason is I think we have to be concerned about taking our \ngeneral funds and putting them into the Medicare trust fund. I think \nthat is an issue we should be very concerned about. For the sake of our \nMedicare system, Medicare Part A is financed\n\n[[Page S1162]]\n\nthrough our payroll tax and through the tax on the extra 35 percent. \nThat is dedicated funding sources our seniors can depend upon to be \nthere for their Medicare system. The Bunning amendment takes some of \nthat money out and says: We will use our general funds to pay for it. I \nsay to my colleagues, seniors are going to be a lot safer by knowing we \nhave a dedicated revenue source that goes into Medicare rather than \nrelying on the transfer of funds into the Medicare system.\n  So for the sake of our seniors and the Medicare system and for fiscal \nresponsibility, we should defeat the Bunning amendment. All of us want \nto provide sensible tax policies for our constituents, but let's do it \nin an orderly way.\n  This is interesting: I didn't think I would ever say this, but in the \nConstitution, tax bills are supposed to originate in the other body, \nand we are not following that order today by considering a tax issue on \nthe minimum wage bill. We would have been better off to keep this bill \nlimited to the minimum wage and consider tax issues when we \nlegitimately have that issue before this body.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Bunning amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUNNING. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BUNNING. First of all, as my good colleague with whom I spent 12 \nyears, 8 of which were spent on the Ways and Means Committee--as my \ncolleague knows, the House always has the opportunity to blue-slip the \nbill if they do not like it because it has tax provisions added that \noriginated in the Senate. They have a chance to blue-slip if they don't \nlike the provisions. So we will send it to the House and see what they \ndo with it. So that argument is not sound basically.\n  If we want to balance the Federal budget, I suggest we not do it on \nthe backs of our senior citizens. That is what my good colleague from \nMaryland is asking Members to do. I am asking that our seniors, our \nmost vulnerable people in society, those who are so wealthy at $33,000 \nworth of income, who have to pay and get their Medicare furnished to \nthem by the Federal Government, I ask that they not be asked to burden \nanother 35 percent increase, which they have been asked to do since \n1993. I don't think it is fair to ask our senior citizens to carry that \nburden when the younger Americans, who pay the bulk of our taxes, are \nthose who should be asked to pay the burden.\n  One thing I want to make sure Members understand when they vote on \nthis amendment is, never in the history of this tax has one penny of it \never gone into the Social Security system--not one penny--since 1993. \nIt has all been dedicated to Medicare Part A. It has only been \ndedicated to Medicare Part A because it was sinking. Then we raised the \ncap to allow uncapped provisions to fund Medicare Part A since 1993. So \nwhere we capped Social Security benefits at a certain level, Medicare \nPart A and Medicare taxes have been uncapped. If you make $5 million a \nyear, you pay a portion of that in a tax to the Medicare system.\n  Let's be honest. My amendment is the only real amendment that repeals \nthe 1993 tax on the Social Security benefits that senior citizens \nreceive each month, at the end of the month or the first of the month. \nThis is the only time we will get a chance to vote on this issue. Maybe \nwe will get another tax bill before the Senate this year. I guarantee \nif this goes down, we will revisit this again in a later bill; it is \nthat important.\n  Our seniors are struggling to pay their bills, as is everyone else in \nAmerica. A tax reduction for them, 35 percent on their Social Security \nbenefits--if they saved any money, we are going to penalize them if \nthey have saved a little bit for retirement. That makes no sense at all \nwhen we encourage savings every day. Now we are going to penalize them \nwith their Social Security benefits because they have an income of \n$34,000 or $44,000?\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Two minutes of debate equally divided on the \nBunning amendment.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Well, Mr. President, we just passed a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment that does nothing to reduce the tax on our senior \ncitizens. Our good friends always say they want to only tax \nmillionaires, but it always ends up the same way, with higher taxes on \nmillions--millions of workers, millions of families, millions of small \nbusinesspeople, and now, here again, millions of our senior citizens.\n  If you actually want to reduce the tax, you must vote for the Bunning \namendment because that is the only amendment that actually removes the \n35-percent increase we put on our senior citizens in 1993. So I urge a \n``yes'' vote on the Bunning amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I oppose the Bunning amendment. It is a \nperfect example of why we do things in committee; namely, here we are \non the Senate floor. This is an amendment that raises the budget \ndeficit by $200 billion. It has never been discussed. We haven't taken \nit up in the Finance Committee. That is not a good way to legislate.\n  Second, it has the adverse consequence of increasing the deficit by \n$200 billion. That is not a good thing to do, with all the \nramifications that an increase of $200 billion in the deficit will \nhave. I strongly oppose the amendment.\n  Remember, the way to work legislation, generally, is through \ncommittees, as much as we possibly can. That way we will get a better \nproduct. My goal in the Finance Committee is to work as a committee. If \nwe work as a committee, we are more likely to get better legislation \nrather than ad hoc legislation out here on the floor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\n  I urge opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 505(a) of H. Con. Res. 95, the concurrent resolution \non the budget for fiscal year 2004.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable provisions \nof the Budget Act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, quickly, for the benefit of my fellow \nSenators, we are trying to get as much done as possible. I appreciate \nthe cooperation we have had. Usually the problem managers have is \ngetting people to offer amendments. We have many amendments that have \nbeen offered. We need to get votes on them. Some are: Senator Smith's \non education tax incentives, which I think we will have in a moment; \nVitter's on paperwork violations; Kyl's on extended depreciation \nprovisions; Sessions' on Federal contract torts; Burr's on more \nflextime; DeMint's on involuntary donation collections, and an \namendment regarding American Samoa. A lot of them are ready to go. If \nwe lock in limited debate time and get votes, it will be helpful. I \nhope we move forward on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate. I am \ncurious and somewhat disappointed that we have not been able to move to \na conclusion. This is, after all, a vote on the minimum wage. It has \nbeen nearly 10 long years since the minimum wage has been increased, \nand my hope is that we have a number of amendments, debate, and be able \nto move this legislation forward. It now seems obvious to me this is \nnot a priority for some.\n  In 1916, a man named James Fyler died of lead poisoning. That is a \ndifferent way of saying he was shot 54 times. He was shot 54 times \nbecause he believed people who went underground in this country to mine \nfor coal should be paid a fair wage and work in a safe workplace. He \nlost his life for that. We fought for a century for the rights of \nworkers in this country--for the right to organize, to work in a safe \nworkplace, for child labor laws--a whole series of things that have \nmade life better for workers. Some are at the bottom rung of the \neconomic ladder.\n  Some in this Chamber have said those are just teenagers. That is not \ntrue. Some teenagers certainly do work at the minimum wage. But well \nover 70 percent of those working at minimum wage are adults; 60 percent \nof them are women, and for one-third of them, it is the sole income for \ntheir families. Many are working two and three jobs trying to make ends \nmeet. They make the beds in the hotels and motels. They work at the \ncounter of the convenience store when you stop to get gas, or get some \ncandy or something at the convenience store. They are the people we see \nevery day. They are working at the minimum wage that has been the same \nfor 10 long years.\n  I said this morning that it is puzzling to me how quickly and easily \nlegislation moves through this Chamber when it supports the big \ninterests. If it is a $104 billion benefit to allow big companies to \nrepatriate income they have made abroad by, in many cases, moving their \njobs abroad and being able to bring their income back and pay a 5\\1/4\\ \npercent income rate--yes, this Congress did that. We said bring that \nincome back and you get to pay a 5\\1/4\\ percent income tax rate. How \nmany Americans would like to pay 5\\1/4\\ percent on their income taxes? \nNobody gets to do that. Some of the biggest enterprises in this \ncountry--names everybody would recognize--were told by this Congress a \ncouple years ago that you can bring all that money back and pay 5\\1/4\\ \npercent income taxes. Yes, you moved your jobs overseas and decided to \nget rid of your American workers, close your American plants, and hire \nforeign workers; but when you bring your income back, we will tax you \nat just 5\\1/4\\ percent.\n  What a deal, bargain basement tax rates. That went through the \nCongress like greased lightning. Do you think anybody was blocking \nthat? Well, Fritz Hollings, who used to sit back here, was trying to, \nand I was. The fact is it moved through here as quick as anything you \nhave ever seen because it represented the big interests. Now all of a \nsudden people who work at the minimum wage have their issue on the \nfloor of the Senate. Is the hallway clogged with people demanding a \nvote on the minimum wage out there? Is anybody in the hallway in the \nfront of this building representing people who work on the minimum \nwage? No, I am afraid not. Is this Congress moving as quickly on behalf \nof the little guy as it is for the big guy? I am afraid that is not the \ncase.\n  I mentioned this morning the lyrics in Bob Wills' and the Texas \nPlayboys' song some 70 years ago. It plays out all the time, yes, here \nin the Chamber of the Senate: ``The little guy picks the cotton and the \nbig guy gets the money; the little bee sucks the blossom and the big \nbee gets the honey.''\n  One wonders whether on this issue, as simple as it is, if maybe we \ncan get to a vote, for Members of the Senate to stand up and answer the \nquestion: Whose side are you on? Maybe we can get enough to stand up to \nsay I am on the side of the people who are working for a living, \nworking hard, working two and three jobs at minimum wage, without an \nadjustment to that minimum wage in nearly 10 years, during which time \nthe value of the purchasing power of that minimum wage has dramatically \neroded. One wonders whether we can get a majority of the Senate, or 60 \nSenators, to stand up and say let's do this. It could not be done that \nway, so it was brought to the floor with tax breaks for business.\n\n  Look, I am a big supporter of big business. They represent an engine \nof opportunity for this country and create jobs. I support businesses. \nAlmost all of the things in this bill, such as expensing--I have been \ninvolved, as have other colleagues, in trying to provide more expensing \nopportunities for businesses. I have voted for that many times, and \nwill again. But it doesn't belong on this bill. As a price, apparently, \nfor bringing this bill to the floor, it has to have tax breaks for \nbusinesses. Even with that, we cannot get it passed; even with that, we \nare sitting here day after day waiting to see whether the Senate will \ndecide to increase the minimum wage for those\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\nfolks working at the bottom of the economic ladder.\n  Well, Mr. President, it is an interesting thing to watch--this \nprocess of legislating. Everybody talks about watching sausage being \nmade and watching legislative processes in work, and I understand it is \ndifficult, not easy. I understand these issues are, in many cases, \ncontroversial. But this ought to be the first baby step in the \ndirection of fairness for these workers. We, after all, live in a time \nnow of what is called the ``global economy,'' where there is downward \npressure on income for American workers.\n  Former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Alan Blinder said, \nwith respect to the pressure on American workers, that there are 42 \nmillion to 56 million American jobs that are tradeable and, therefore, \noutsourceable. We have lost 3 million jobs to overseas factories, where \nyou can hire somebody for 33 cents an hour, and he said there are 42 \nmillion to 56 million more. This is not somebody who is radical. This \nis a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. He said not all \nof those jobs will leave our country, but those that remain will have \ndownward pressure on income because they are competing with people in \nChina, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, who work for 30 cents or 40 cents an \nhour.\n  There are 250 million workers who are kids age 5 to 14. Our workers \nare told to compete with that. You cannot. There is downward pressure \non income of people in this country.\n  This bill deals with one part of that--the workers at the bottom of \nthe economic ladder, those who get up in the morning and are trying to \nget their kids ready for school, and trying to figure out how to put \ngas in the tank of the car to drive to work; and they work 8 hours and \nthey earn a little over $40. I said this morning, what about a maximum \nwage? We have trouble getting a minimum wage through the Congress. \nGeorge Will, that columnist who writes in the Washington Post, says the \nminimum wage ought to be zero. Of course, it never would affect him, so \nit is easy for him to write that it ought to be zero. He would like to \ntake us back, I assume, just as we had great debate when the Fair Labor \nStandards Act was created and people said that is socialism, but it was \nstanding up for workers, requiring employers to keep track of hours of \nwork, overtime, and provide basic protections for workers. So some \npeople think the minimum wage ought to be zero.\n  Well, what about a maximum wage? I am not suggesting there ought to \nbe a maximum wage, but has anybody come to the floor to express outrage \nwhen you read that the CEO leaving Exxon Corporation was making \n$150,000 a day? Yes, that is right--a wage or income of a CEO of a \ncorporation was $150,000 a day. Think of that. Did anybody come and \ncomplain about that? No, we just have columnists and colleagues \ncomplaining about somebody who might earn a few bucks an hour. Sixty \npercent of them are women, as I said, with children; 6 million children \nlive in families supported by the minimum wage. So the question, I \nguess, that I ask at the moment is not whether we support small \nbusiness--I certainly do, and I will in the rest of this Congress \nsupport the kinds of things that will be helpful to small businesses, \nwhich are engines of growth and opportunity. That is not the question. \nThe question is, are we going to increase the minimum wage at this \npoint? It appears there is this unbelievable snail's pace in the \nSenate. Glaciers move faster than this Chamber sometimes. Nobody ever \naccused the Senate of speeding, but this is something quite different. \nI am hoping that very soon--I know the folks who have been managing \nthis bill join this hope--we can decide we have had enough amendments \nabout things that have nothing to do with anything about the workers at \nthe bottom of the ladder. And maybe we can get a vote to say as a \nChamber, as the House has done without extraneous matters attached to \nit, that we stand for workers who have been working at the bottom of \nthe economic ladder and have not had an adjustment in 10 years; that we \nstand for them and believe it is important to have this adjustment. We \nbelieve it will be good for our country. I hope that happens sooner \nrather than later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 113\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with respect \nto amendment No. 113.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is pending.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 204 to Amendment No. 113\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Warner, Senator \nSmith, and myself, I call up a second-degree amendment, amendment No. \n204, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself and Mr. \n     Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 204 to amendment No. \n     113.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently \nextend and increase the above-the-line deduction for teacher classroom \nsupplies and to expand such deduction to include qualified professional \n                         development expenses)\n\n       On page 2 of the amendment, strike lines 1 through 7, and \n     insert the following:\n       (b) Expansion of Above-the-Line Deduction for Certain \n     Expenses of Elementary and Secondary School Teachers.--\n       (1) In general.--Subparagraph (D) of section 62(a)(2) \n     (relating to certain trade and business deductions of \n     employees) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(D) Certain expenses of elementary and secondary school \n     teachers.--The deductions allowed by section 162 which \n     consist of expenses, not in excess of $400, paid or incurred \n     by an eligible educator--\n       ``(i) by reason of the participation of the educator in \n     professional development courses related to the curriculum \n     and academic subjects in which the educator provides \n     instruction or to the students for which the educator \n     provides instruction, and\n       ``(ii) in connection with books, supplies (other than \n     nonathletic supplies for courses of instruction in health or \n     physical education), computer equipment (including related \n     software and services) and other equipment, and supplementary \n     materials used by the eligible educator in the classroom.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2006.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the second-degree amendment that Senators \nWarner, Smith, and I are offering increases a deduction for \nschoolteachers and other educators that is in current law. Our \namendment would increase this deduction to $400 and make it permanent. \nThis tax deduction is available to schoolteachers and other educators \nwho incur out-of-pocket expenses in order to purchase classroom \nsupplies for their students. It would also allow this above-the-line \ntax deduction for expenses related to professional development.\n  This amendment builds on a $250 tax deduction in current law that \nSenator Warner and I authored in 2001. It became law that year as part \nof the tax relief package. The tax relief provided by that act to \nschoolteachers and other educators was later extended through the end \nof this year, but we need to act to extend it further, and I suggest \nthere is no reason we shouldn't just go ahead and make it permanent. \nTeachers who buy classroom supplies in order to improve the educational \nexperience for their students deserve more than just our gratitude. \nThey deserve this modest tax incentive to thank them for their hard \nwork.\n  So often, teachers in my State and throughout the country spend their \nown money to improve the classroom experience of their students. Many \nof us are familiar with the survey of the National Education \nAssociation that found that teachers spend on average $443 a year on \nclassroom supplies. Other surveys show they are spending even more than \nthat. In fact, the National School Supply and Equipment Association has \nfound that educators spend an average of $826 to supplement classroom \nsupplies, plus $926 for instructional materials on top of that--in \nother words, a total of $1,700 out of their own pockets.\n  In most States, including mine, teachers are very modestly paid for \ntheir jobs, and I think it is so impressive that despite challenging \njobs and modest salaries, teachers are willing to dig deep into their \nown pockets to enrich the classroom experience because they care so \ndeeply for their students.\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\nIndeed, I have spoken with dozens of teachers in Maine who tell me they \nroutinely spend far in excess of the $250 deduction limit that is in \ncurrent law. I have made a practice of visiting schools all over Maine. \nIn fact, I have visited more than 160 schools in my State. At virtually \nevery school I visit, I find teachers who are spending their own money \nto benefit their students. Year after year, these teachers spend \nhundreds of dollars on books, bulletin boards, computer software, \nconstruction paper, stamps, ink pads--everything one can think of. Let \nme just give a couple of examples. For example, Anita Hopkins and Kathi \nToothaker, who are elementary school teachers in Augusta, ME, purchased \nbooks for their students to have a classroom library, as well as \nworkbooks and sight cards. They also purchased special prizes for \npositive reinforcement for their students. Mrs. Hopkins estimates that \nshe spends between $800 and $1,000 of her own money on extra materials \nto make learning more fun and to create a stimulating classroom \nenvironment.\n  I have proposed that we also expand the uses for this tax deduction. \nWe should make it available for teachers who incur expenses for \nprofessional development. We hear a lot of discussion when the \nprovisions of No Child Left Behind are debated about the need for \nhighly qualified teachers. One of the best ways for teachers to improve \ntheir qualifications is through professional development. Yet in towns \nin my State--and I suspect throughout the country--school budgets are \noften very tight and money for professional development is either very \nsmall or nonexistent. So what I think we should do is to allow this tax \ndeduction to also apply when a teacher takes a course or attends a \nworkshop and has to pay for it out of his or her own pocket.\n  In my view, it is the students who are the ultimate beneficiaries \nwhen teachers receive professional development to sharpen their skills \nor to teach them a new approach to presenting material to their \nstudents. Studies consistently have shown that other than involved \nparents, the single greatest determinant of classroom success is the \npresence of a well-qualified teacher, and educators themselves \nunderstand just how important professional development is to their \nability to make a positive impact in the classroom.\n  The teacher tax relief we have made available since 2001 is certainly \na positive step, and I was very proud, along with Senator Warner, to \nhave authored that law. This amendment would increase that deduction \nfrom $250 to $400, reflecting more accurately what teachers really do \nspend, and it would also make it permanent.\n  The National Education Association, the NEA, has endorsed this \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the NEA's letter be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, this amendment is a small but \nappropriate means of recognizing the many sacrifices our teachers make \nevery day to benefit the children of America.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon for working with me on this \namendment. It is my understanding that it is acceptable to him. It \nbuilds on the many positive provisions he has in his amendment. He is a \ncosponsor of the amendment. He has been a real leader on educational \nissues.\n  Shortly, I am going to ask that the amendment be adopted.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2007.\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     Senator John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Warner: On behalf of the National \n     Education Association's (NEA) 3.2 million members, we would \n     like to express our strong support for your legislation that \n     would increase, expand, and make permanent the tax deduction \n     for educators' out-of-pocket classroom supply expenses. We \n     thank you for your continued leadership and advocacy on this \n     important issue.\n       As you know, the educator tax deduction helps recognize the \n     financial sacrifices made by teachers and paraprofessionals, \n     who often reach into their own pockets to purchase classroom \n     supplies such as books, pencils, paper, and art supplies. \n     Studies show that teachers are spending more of their own \n     funds each year to supply their classrooms, including \n     purchasing essential items such as pencils, glue, scissors, \n     and facial tissues. For example, NEA's 2003 report Status of \n     the American Public School Teacher, 2000-2001 found that \n     teachers spent an average of $443 a year on classroom \n     supplies. More recently, the National School Supply and \n     Equipment Association found that in 2005-2006, educators \n     spent out of their own pockets an average of $826.00 for \n     supplies and an additional $926 for instructional materials, \n     for a total of $1,752.\n       By increasing the current deduction and making it \n     permanent, your legislation will make a real difference for \n     many educators, who often must sacrifice other personal needs \n     in order to pay for classroom supplies.\n       NEA also strongly supports your proposal to extend the tax \n     deduction to cover out-of-pocket professional development \n     expenses. Teacher quality is the single most critical factor \n     in maximizing student achievement. Ongoing professional \n     development is essential to ensure that educators stay up-to-\n     date on the skills and knowledge necessary to prepare \n     students for the challenges of the 21st century. Your bill \n     will make a critical difference in helping educators access \n     quality training.\n       We thank you again for your work on this important \n     legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you \n     to support our nation's educators.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diane Shust,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n     Randall Moody,\n       Manager of Federal Policy and Politics.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support, once again, of \nAmerica's teachers by joining with Senator Collins in introducing an \namendment regarding the Teacher Tax Relief Act.\n  Senator Collins and I have worked closely for some time now in \nsupport of legislation to provide our teachers with tax relief in \nrecognition of the many out-of-pocket expenses they incur as part of \ntheir profession. In the 107th Congress, we were successful in \nproviding much needed tax relief for our Nations teachers with passage \nof H.R. 3090, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.\n  This legislation, which was signed into law by President Bush, \nincluded the Collins/Warner Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001 provisions \nthat provided a $250 above the line deduction for educators who incur \nout-of-pocket expenses for supplies they bring into the classroom to \nbetter the education of their students. These important provisions \nprovided almost half a billion dollars worth of tax relief to teachers \nall across America in 2002 and 2003.\n  In the 108th Congress, we were able to successfully extend the \nprovisions of the Teacher Tax Relief Act for 2004 and 2005. In the \n109th Congress we were able to successfully extend the provisions for \n2006 and 2007.\n  While these provisions will provide substantial relief to America's \nteachers, our work is not yet complete.\n  It is now estimated that the average teacher spends $826 out of their \nown pocket each year on classroom materials--materials such as pens, \npencils and books. First-year teachers spend even more.\n  Why do they do this? Simply because school budgets are not adequate \nto meet the costs of education. Our teachers dip into their own pocket \nto better the education of America's youth.\n  Moreover, in addition to spending substantial money on classroom \nsupplies, many teachers spend even more money out of their own pocket \non professional development. Such expenses include tuition, fees, \nbooks, and supplies associated with courses that help our teachers \nbecome even better instructors.\n  The fact is that these out-of-pocket costs place lasting financial \nburdens on our teachers. This is one reason our teachers are leaving \nthe profession. Little wonder that our country is in the midst of a \nteacher shortage.\n  Without a doubt the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001 took a step \nforward in helping to alleviate the Nation's teaching shortage by \nproviding a $250 above the line deduction for classroom expenses.\n  However, it is clear that our teachers are spending much more than \n$250 a year out of their own pocket to better the education of our \nchildren. Accordingly, Senator Collins and I have joined together to \ntake another step forward by introducing this amendment.\n  This amendment will build upon current law in three ways. The \namendment will:\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n\n  (1) Increase the above-the-line deduction, as President Bush has \ncalled for, from $250 allowed under current law to $400;\n  (2) Allow educators to include professional development costs within \nthat $400 deduction. Under current law, up to $250 is deductible but \nonly for classroom expenses; and\n  (3) Make the teacher tax relief provisions in the law permanent. \nCurrent law sunsets the Collins/Warner provisions after 2007.\n  I will ask to have printed in the Record at the end of my statement a \nletter from the National Education Association endorsing the Collins-\nWarner amendment, and also a letter from the Virginia Education \nAssociation endorsing the Collins-Warner amendment.\n  Mr. President, our teachers have made a personal commitment to \neducate the next generation and to strengthen America. And, in my view, \nthe Federal Government should recognize the many sacrifices our \nteachers make in their career.\n  This teacher tax relief amendment is another step forward in \nproviding our educators with the recognition they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned \nmaterials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2007.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Education \n     Association's (NEA) 3.2 million members, we urge your support \n     for an amendment to be offered by Senators Collins (R-ME) and \n     Warner (R-VA) to the minimum wage bill that would make \n     permanent the tax deduction for educators' out-of-pocket \n     classroom supply expenses. Votes associated with this issue \n     may be included in the NEA Legislative Report Card for the \n     110th Congress.\n       The educator tax deduction helps recognize the financial \n     sacrifices made by teachers and paraprofessionals, who often \n     reach into their own pockets to purchase classroom supplies. \n     Studies show that teachers are spending more of their own \n     funds each year to supply their classrooms, including \n     purchasing essential items such as pencils, glue, scissors, \n     and facial tissues. For example, the National School Supply \n     and Equipment Association found that in 2005-2006, educators \n     spent out of their own pockets an average of $826.00 for \n     supplies and an additional $926 for instructional materials, \n     for a total of $1,752.\n       The current deduction was extended at the end of 2006, but \n     will expire again at the end of this year absent additional \n     congressional action. Making the deduction permanent will \n     acknowledge the sacrifices made by those who have dedicated \n     their lives to educating our children and will alleviate the \n     uncertainty they face as they wait each year to see if the \n     deduction will be extended.\n       We urge your support for this important amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diane Shust,\n       Director of Government Relations;\n     Randall Moody,\n       Manager of Federal Policy and Politics.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Virginia Education Association,\n\n                             Richmond, Virginia, January 25, 2007.\n     Hon. John William Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: On behalf of the Virginia Education \n     Association's (VEA) 62,000 members. I thank you for offering \n     an amendment to the minimum wage bill that would make \n     permanent the tax deduction for educators' out-of-pocket \n     classroom supply expenses.\n       In Virginia we are fighting to improve the salaries of \n     teachers and other education support professionals to bring \n     them to the national average, so it iswonderfuI that you \n     recognize the financial sacrifices they make when purchasing \n     classroom supplies such as pencils, glue, scissors, and \n     facial tissues. The National School Supply and Equipment \n     Association found that in 2005-2006, educators spent out of \n     their own pockets an average of $826.00 for supplies and an \n     additional $926 for instructional materials, for a total of \n     $1,752.\n       Your amendment acknowledges these sacrifices made by those \n     who have dedicated their lives to educating our children.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Princess Moss,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                   Virginia Education Association.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I thank Senator Collins. Her amendment is \nimportant. She has been working on this issue since 2001. It does have \na very real impact. I certainly support her adding it to my amendment. \nIt is an important contribution to education, specifically to those who \nare educators.\n  I will make a few remarks, but I do wish to point out that my friend \nfrom North Dakota was talking about the repatriation bill that he said \nwas not for little folks, I suppose, or however he termed it. That bill \nthat was passed, by my last count, has resulted in repatriations of \n$290 billion. These dollars have benefitted our economy and created new \njobs.\n  One of the reasons we have such low unemployment in this country \ntoday is because of that bill. It affects regular folks, working folks, \nand, yes, it does involve multinational companies, but these are \nAmerican companies which do business all over the world. Some of them \nare in my State, like Nike. Some may even be from North Dakota.\n  What we do relative to the Tax Code has real consequences. People \nrespond to incentives. What that bill represents is truly $290 billion \ncan either come back into our economy or it is $290 billion that will \nnever come back into this economy. I am proud of that legislation \nbecause it has helped working people.\n  If the Senator wanted something that will help those--let's term it \n``those of average income''--those working Americans who would like a \nbreak under the Tax Code, we did that in the Bush tax cuts, and I am \ntrying today, with this amendment, with Senator Collins' help, to \nextend these tax cuts as they relate to education. It is hard to see \nhow anybody could be against it, and I don't suppose there are many in \nthis Chamber who truly are. Some will question the timing of bringing \nit up now but, frankly, I have learned in 10 years around this place \nthat if you want something to move, you better hook it on to any train \nthat is moving.\n  Yes, I want to vote to raise the minimum wage, but I also want to put \non provisions to help the folks we are trying to help, without hurting \nsmall employers, but people who are on minimum wage, particularly moms \nand dads who are trying to save for education.\n  There are three provisions, in addition to the fourth Senator Collins \nadded to this bill, that I want to highlight. First is the deduction \nfor qualified tuition and related expenses.\n  Americans can currently deduct up to $4,000 for higher education \nexpenses, depending on their income level. In 2004, over 4.5 million \nAmerican students and families benefited from this deduction, including \nalmost 65,000 Oregonians, of which I am proud. I am glad we cut this \ntax. I am glad this deduction is in there. But it is about to expire. \nSo the sooner we extend it, make it permanent, as this amendment \nproposes to do, the better off American families will be for planning. \nWe are not talking about the rich here; we are talking about folks who \nare trying to make education more affordable, more accessible, and \nthese are the tools of the Tax Code that enable us to do it.\n  The second provision addresses the exclusion for employer-provided \neducational assistance. This tax benefit allows employees to exclude \nfrom their gross income up to $5,250 a year of educational assistance \nprovided by their employers. We are not talking about employers; we are \ntalking about the employees who get to exclude it from their gross \nincome. This helps the very people we are also trying to help with an \nincrease in the minimum wage. It is a very popular employee benefit.\n  Third, this amendment proposes to extend certain enhancements to the \nCoverdell education savings account. This is an important tool for \nAmericans who want to save for future education expenses. Paul \nCoverdell was a beloved colleague of ours. I miss him. He was \npassionate on education. I am proud his name is attached to these \nsavings accounts.\n  The 2001 Tax Act made a number of reforms to enhance these Coverdell \naccounts. For example, it increased the annual contribution limit to \n$2,000 from $500 and expanded the definition of ``qualified expenses'' \nto include elementary and secondary schools. However, like the \nexclusion for employer-provided educational assistance, these \nenhancements expire soon. This amendment would make these improvements \npermanent.\n  Education tax breaks are extremely important to all Americans but \nparticularly working Americans. In fact, I think we would be hard \npressed to find a student, parent, or teacher who does not support \nthese provisions.\n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to strengthen the education system of America \nand make these provisions permanent. That is the whole point of this \namendment. If we do not succeed, I look forward to working with my \nchairman on the Finance Committee on another vehicle to make this \nhappen. I know of his good will. I appreciate him and look forward to \nworking with him on the committee on which we both sit to make sure, if \nthis does not happen now, that it will happen soon. We are talking \nabout real people and, with this amendment, real dollars that will make \na real difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 204\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsecond-degree amendment, No. 204, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 204) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent there be 40 \nminutes of debate to run concurrently on the Baucus amendment No. 206 \nand the Smith amendment No. 113, the time controlled as follows: 30 \nminutes under the control of Senator Baucus or his designee, 10 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Smith; that no further second-degree \namendment be in order to either amendment; that there be 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided between the votes; that upon the use or yielding \nback of the time, the Senate vote in relation to the Baucus amendment \nto be followed by a vote in relation to the Smith amendment, as \namended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I will speak for a few minutes. Clearly \neducation is one of our country's highest priorities. I don't think \nthere is anybody in this body or in the other body on the other side of \nthis Capitol who will disagree with that statement. It is certainly one \nof the most important, if not the most important. The pending Smith \namendment, however, is not the right way to address this issue.\n  First, the Senator did not offer his amendment in the committee of \njurisdiction. There have not been hearings on this amendment. The \ncommittee has not had a chance to work on the amendment, and it shows. \nFirst, the amendment is not paid for. It would increase the deficit by \n$35 billion over 10 years. No. 2, it leaves in place overly complex tax \nprovisions. It needs simplification. We clearly need to consolidate the \nmyriad different education credits and deductions with which the people \nin the country are faced and have an almost impossible time trying to \nfigure out. This amendment does not do the job.\n  It also includes controversial provisions such as the Coverdell tax \ncuts for K-12 education, provisions I personally favor but I know many \nMembers of this body have deep public policy concerns with. We need to \nfocus on education. As chairman of the Committee on Finance, I pledge \nthat this committee will work aggressively to develop a comprehensive \neducation package that includes simplification of all the myriad \ncurrent tax provisions and hopefully will be much more effective--do \nwhat it is supposed to do--and will also address the various needs of \nvarious people in our society, especially low-income people who have a \nhard time getting to college or getting into a voc-ed school, a \ncommunity college, a tribal community college, or whatnot.\n  We in America are in sixth place in a competitive index in the world \nand most of that is due to a lower standing in higher education, \nclearly behind Nordic countries and Singapore. To compete in a global \neconomy, we need to focus to improve our educational system. It is my \ngoal, if I have anything to do with it, in 3 or 4 or 5 years it will be \nknown in the world that it is in America where the action is, it is in \nAmerica where they are starting to get it right, they are starting to \naddress and to figure out ways to make sure their kids--and a little \nolder kids--are very well educated; where we Americans are so proud of \nwhat we are doing and other countries will recognize what we are doing.\n  It will take work to get there, but that should be the goal, and I am \ndoing what I can to help us get there. We know about the increase in \ncollege tuition and all the problems that is causing. My State of \nMontana has an especially difficult time. More than two-thirds of the \nstudents in my State receive grant aid. Frankly, that is a nationwide \nfigure. In my State it is even higher; it is 80 percent. We need \neducation assistance. Mr. President, 14,000 individuals from my State \nclaim more than $35 million in tuition fee deductions; nationwide, more \nthan 4.5 million people together claimed about $10 billion in tuition \nfee deductions. Again, simplify, target them, make it work so we are \ndoing what we should be doing.\n  Let me talk for a few minutes about how complicated these education \nprovisions are. First, we have the HOPE scholarships and the Lifetime \nLearning credits.\n\n  I might say to my colleagues, there are nine other types of tax \nbenefits for education. Here they all are. I am sure everybody knows \nall about these and I am sure everybody understands them completely. \nFirst, the student loan interest deduction; next, tax-free treatment of \ncanceled student loans; tax-free student loan repayment assistance; \nCoverdell education savings accounts featuring tax-free earnings; \nqualified tuition programs which also feature tax-free earnings; \npenalty-free early distributions from any type of retirement account \narrangement for education costs; allowing families to cash in savings \nbonds for education costs without having to pay tax on the interest on \nthose; tax-free educational benefits for employers; business deductions \nfor work-related education. We have over 11 that I can count, and I \ndon't think anybody knows them, not one person--maybe one person. Not \nvery many people. If we have a hard time in this body understanding \nthose, think of the poor students. Think of the families. Think of the \npeople trying to make some sense out of all this.\n  To some degree, voters in November were saying to us in Washington \nand around the country: People in Washington aren't listening to us. We \nhave problems. They are not listening to us. Congress is a bit \ndysfunctional. What are they doing about education? We all know the \nneed. What are they doing?\n  My goal in the committee, working very closely with Senator Kennedy \nof the HELP Committee, is, together with their authorizing legislation \nand our tax legislation, to get the ball rolling so we are focusing on \neducation. It is so important to me.\n  We also, I might say, need to focus on the neediest. Current tax \ncredits and deductions don't help the neediest. They don't have any \nincome to pay income tax on. It is not targeted, all these lifetime \nscholarships and HOPE scholarships, and so forth. We had a great \nhearing in the Committee on Finance. Maybe while we consolidate and \nsimplify--a very strong recommendation, I might say, by all those who \nappeared before us, is combined Pell grants. So many students get their \naid through Pell grants. That is certainly true in community colleges, \nit is true in tribal colleges. Those are lower income students. It is \nPell grants that they need and we need to boost Pell grant levels even \nhigher.\n  Also, working with Pell grants, make a simplified tax credit--maybe \nrefundable. Lower income people need the money upfront. It doesn't make \nany difference to have it later on, a year later when they are figuring \nout tax returns. It has to be upfront. That is another recommendation \ngiven by a very impressive, persuasive witness before our committee a \nshort time ago.\n  We also need to think about covering not only tuition but also other \neducation expenses. What about books, room and board, and so forth? The \ncurrent major provisions cover tuition, tuition only. I think it is \ntrue that some of this has to be increased. Which ones, that is the \nquestion.\n  Frankly, as we are talking about helping teachers with greater \ndeductions, my view is: Find a way to give teachers greater pay. That \nis the real solution here, rather than saying you have to get a \ndeduction so you can help pay for your students' expenses. We need to \nget teachers better pay. Even though we don't have primary \njurisdiction, we are certainly creative around\n\n[[Page S1168]]\n\nhere. We can figure out a way here in the Congress to help States pay \nbetter salaries to teachers so we get even better people teaching \nschool than we have now. We have good teachers, but we need to also \nmake sure they have the pay they need.\n  The underlying minimum wage bill is paid for. This amendment is not \npaid for. The underlying total small business package is $8.3 billion \nand we pay for it. This is a $35 billion package, four or five times \nthat, but it is not paid for. It was not discussed in committee. \nSlapdash here on the floor. That is not the way to do legislation. As I \nsaid many times, and I keep saying it because I believe it, in the \nCommittee on Finance we are going to work as a committee because that \nis the best way to legislate. That means working with Democrats and \nwith Republicans in a give and take to get a committee product. I \npledge to my colleagues we are going to work mightily to get a very \ngood education product from our committee in conjunction with the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, so the right hand knows what \nthe left hand is doing.\n  I do believe the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. With the \ntwo of us working together in cooperation from both sides of the \naisle--and Senator Enzi, I am quite certain, has the same views--we are \ngoing to do something about education here. I fully believe that will \nhappen.\n  Now I yield 10 minutes to the senior Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Montana and \ncertainly my colleagues from Maine and from Oregon for their very \nintense interest on this very important issue. I come to the floor \ntoday to discuss and visit about what I also think is an enormously \nimportant priority for us here in the Senate, and that is education. I \nwant to voice my support for action during the 110th Congress. I come \nto the floor not only as a Senator from the great State of Arkansas, \nbut also as a mother. I come to the floor with twin boys in the fifth \ngrade, having completed a fifth grade chemistry test this week along \nwith a chemistry experiment, a unit test on ancient Egypt, and all the \nwhile talking with our students and teachers, and realizing all of the \nmany challenges they face in making sure our children get the kind of \neducation they need to be an active and productive part of the 21st \ncentury.\n  I see what not just our teachers are up against but our families as \nwell, and noticing as my husband left, not only on top of the question \nof what's for dinner and did you pick up my cleaning, but also he \nasked: Did you take part of that Christmas bonus and put it into the \nchildren's college account? I know that working families all across \nthis country, much like mine and yours and others here, are realizing \nthe critical role that education plays, not just in our families but in \nthe success of this great country, and what it means to all of the \ndifferent issues we face.\n  Promoting education is an essential element of many of the efforts to \nprepare our workforce to meet the demands of today's increasingly \ncompetitive global marketplace. But it is also the key that will unlock \nthe doors to solving so many of our challenges. Making sure our \nchildren are equipped with the knowledge and the skill and the tools is \ngoing to make the difference between whether we do reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil and move to renewable fuels. It is the key to \nwhether we are able to move forward in so many different scientific \narenas and, looking at health care, are able to provide the kind of \nhealth care we need in this country, the expertise and the research \nthat is necessary there--all of these challenges we face hinge on the \njob we do on education.\n  I have no doubt in my mind that Chairman Baucus, along with Senator \nGrassley, working together in the Finance Committee, have every \nintention of making sure we do our level best in this session of \nCongress to address these issues through the incentives the Tax Code \ncan provide us to encourage and reinforce our education system--both \nfor our families as well as our educators--to do the right thing on \nbehalf of our children and our country.\n  I look forward to working with them.\n  I have enjoyed the opportunity to work with my colleagues, with \nChairman Baucus and Senator Grassley and my friend from Oregon, Senator \nSmith, and Senator Collins, who have long histories of passion on this \nissue. We look for ways to use the Tax Code as a tool to help more of \nour children have that opportunity to receive quality education. Last \nCongress, we together introduced the Educational Opportunity Act of \n2006 so that existing education tax incentives are a more viable tool \nfor our students and their families and educators, particularly in our \nrural communities. Already this year, as Chairman Baucus mentioned, the \nFinance Committee has had some very productive hearings, good \nconversations about what is important, what works, what doesn't; how do \nwe get it out there to the people who need it the most in order to make \nsure the people of this country have the opportunity to give back to \nthis great land. So I commend Senator Smith and Senator Collins on \ntheir efforts, and I wish to continue the dedication on this issue in \nworking with them.\n  Unfortunately, I agree with Senator Baucus: This is not the place to \ndo this. We have many things to achieve in this 110th Congress, and the \nonly way we will achieve them is if we take our time and make sure we, \nstep-by-step, make the necessary moves that need to be made to \naccomplish all we have to do. I ran in the other day with a grocery \nsack that I had overfilled in an attempt to hurry and get to where I \nneeded to be to do one more thing and it broke and everything went \neverywhere. It was awful, an awful experience because I knew it was my \nown fault. I had rushed and tried to put too much into one sack so that \neverything else fell apart.\n  Under the wise leadership of Chairman Baucus, we have worked hard to \nmake sure we craft a proposal on small business tax relief that will be \nproductive, that will be the one step in this direction we need to take \nin a way that will be productive, but it won't overload, so that we \ndon't get anything accomplished.\n  So I plead with my colleagues. Looking at what Chairman Baucus and \nRanking Member Grassley have done, with significant input and \nconsideration by the entire Finance Committee, they have put together a \nvery good package of small business tax relief to supplement the \nminimum wage, which we all agree is extremely overdue. The comments of \nmy colleague from North Dakota couldn't have been more appropriate; the \nfact that we are trying now, having not been able to move a simple \nminimum wage, to do what we can do and to do it in a practical and \nmoderate way.\n  The package is a balanced one. It includes provisions that are \nsupported on both sides of the aisle, such as small business expensing, \nthe Work Opportunity Tax Credit, and the S corporation reforms.\n  The package is a responsible one. Compared to tax packages we have \nconsidered in the recent past, this one is much smaller, with a price \ntag of $8 billion, and not to mention it is completely paid for. When \nwe take things one step at a time, we can act responsibly in paying for \nthem. There is one thing we hear from our constituents, and that is: \nPlease, please recognize the debt you are creating in this country has \nas much of an impact on our children as educating them does because \nthey are going to be the ones left holding the bag.\n  Finally, the package is targeted. When we began putting it together, \nthere were a lot of us on the committee who had priorities we wanted to \naddress. Senator Snowe and I care deeply about doing something on small \nbusiness health care, as does Senator Stabenow, who has mentioned it \nmany times as well. Senator Bingaman filed an amendment to expand the \nHOPE scholarship credit. Of course, there were many others. We all have \nour priorities, and we are all eager to address them. But if we take \nour time, if we move step-by-step and do it correctly, we will get to \nall of those issues. Under the leadership of Senator Baucus, he has \npledged to us to work diligently in the Finance Committee to be able to \naddress these issues.\n  In response, we were asked, having come to the chairman about all of \nthese issues, not to jump the gun but to focus on the bill at hand and \nto provide the committee and the larger body\n\n[[Page S1169]]\n\nthe opportunity to take a more thorough look in regular order, so that \nwe can reach consensus and make progress on those important issues, as \nwe have with the small business tax relief.\n  In the coming year, I know the HELP Committee will be extremely busy \nas they focus on the reauthorizing of No Child Left Behind. As they \nwork on improving and extending our education policy from their end, I \nknow that we on the Finance Committee will be doing the same with our \ntax policy. Chairman Baucus, through the Chair, I would like to have \nhis reassurance--which I don't need, but I want the rest of the body to \nknow--if he could clarify for us that, yes, the Finance Committee will, \nindeed, be taking up all of these many issues, but certainly these \neducation issues that rest heavily on many of our minds, and that it is \nhis intention to move on an education tax package, along with such \nother reauthorizations. I know the chairman has given me his word, and \nI know he wants to encourage others as well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas and I be allowed to have a dialog without Senators losing \nthe right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would say to my good friend from Arkansas that I very \nmuch want to reassure her. She is such a tremendous member of our \ncommittee and such an able Senator from her State, and I know her State \nis very proud of her. But the answer is definitely totally 100 percent \nyes. Education is one of my passions. It is so important. It means so \nmuch to me, and I know it does for all of us. I love going to schools \nand seeing the teaching in schools. It is one of the best parts of this \njob.\n  I also wish to make sure that our kids and grandkids have the same \nquality of life, the same standard of living that we have been able to \nenjoy, and that means, given the global competition we face from other \ncountries such as China and India, and so forth, we need the best, and \nwe are going to have the best.\n  So I say to my good friend, in the Committee on Finance, Senator \nGrassley and I are a very close team on the committee and we are going \nto move aggressively on ways to boost the availability and to help \npeople get the very best education, in conjunction with Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Enzi, when No Child Left Behind is brought up, and other \nauthorizing legislation on education comes up, so that we can do \nsomething that makes us all on both sides of the aisle proud to address \neducation.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, reclaiming my time, I thank the \nchairman for that because I do think it is important. I have every \nconfidence the chairman will do that. I know he will. He has told me \nthat and he has told many others. I wanted the rest of the Senators to \nknow he truly has a commitment, in terms of recognizing that we on the \nFinance Committee have a unique opportunity to help provide America's \nworking families with the incentives they need and the tools they need \nto invest in their children. I know he believes in that passionately, \nand I am so pleased he will be working with us on that, and I know he \nwill. It is obviously an extremely important issue to our friend, the \nSenator from Oregon, and to the Senator from Maine. It is important to \nme as a parent, as an Arkansan, and I think it is important to every \none of our constituents that we are desperately trying to ensure that \ntheir children are given the tools to succeed in life.\n  My mother used to always say that if you want to do something nice \nfor me, do something wonderful for my children. That is what we are \nhere to say today. So after all, there should be no higher priority \nthan providing our children the opportunity to succeed, and I look \nforward to working with the Finance Committee to do that.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, could I ask the time allotment on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 30 seconds, and the \nSenator from Wyoming has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't see the Senator from Oregon on the floor. I don't \nknow if other Senators wish to speak on the pending amendment. I don't \nsee other Senators on the floor. I would ask my good friend for a \nlittle bit of assistance in this matter.\n  Mr. ENZI. It is my understanding they do not wish to speak. I would \nlike to reserve the time until I hear some of the other comments. I \nhave nothing to say at the moment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we have two votes coming up shortly, and \nI would like to speak to a couple of points on my amendment. \nEssentially, my amendment is a sense of the Senate that we will, and \nmust, work under the provisions we have been discussing in the last few \nminutes. It says we believe the taxpayers play such an important role \nmaking education more affordable, and it also says we should pay for \nit. That is something I must say, and I will say, as my good friend \nfrom Minnesota as well as other Senators have said, that there are a \nlot of ways to find the so-called pay-fors we should find, the so-\ncalled pay-fors, in closing tax loopholes. There is a lot of \nconstructive talk--in fact, I initiated a lot of it--about the tax gap, \nabout $350 billion of income taxes owed to the Government--owed but not \ncollected--$350 billion every year owed but not collected--without \nraising any taxes, without passing any legislation that increases \ntaxes. That is $350 billion that should be collected, and we are not \ncollecting it. I am not saying we could get it all, but I am saying we \nshould get a lot of it. Part of that is payroll taxes that is not \ncollected. The estimates are $50 billion, $60 billion in payroll taxes \nthat are not being collected. Well, adding $30 billion, $40 billion a \nyear to the Social Security trust fund wouldn't hurt. Adding a few \nbillion dollars to the hospital insurance Part A trust fund wouldn't \nhurt. We have to work hard to find that.\n  My point is we can find the so-called pay-fors when we do the things \nwe need to do. So this is not some big pipe dream: Sure, we are going \nto talk about this stuff. I am saying we are going to enact the kinds \nof provisions we are talking about. It could be up to $35 billion, \nwhich is the amount contained in this amendment but which is not paid \nfor. As I mentioned, it is under the alternative amendment, that is the \namendment offered by the Senator from Oregon, which doesn't address the \ncomplexity, it doesn't address a lot of real problems.\n  I said, perhaps a bit unfairly, it is a slapdash amendment on the \nfloor, but it is true it is an amendment of first impression. This is \nthe first we have seen it. It never came up in the committee. I am \ntrying, in a small way in this Congress, to try to anticipate subjects \nthat are going to come up on the floor, anticipate major amendments \nthat are going to come up on the floor, in the committee of \njurisdiction, the Committee on Finance, and have hearings on them. \nLet's get experts to come and tell us about them so we can modify them \nand make them work, rather than seeing them for the first time on the \nfloor and wondering what in the heck this is and what it is all about.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to support the sense of the Senate \namendment which I am offering. I think it is the right way to get at \nthe problem. As I have said many times, I pledge to my colleagues that \nwe on the Finance Committee are going to dig into this. We are going to \nfind ways to make sure we have the best education tax provisions we can \npossibly get. Therefore, I urge a positive vote on my amendment. After \nthat, I encourage Senators to vote against the Smith amendment. He \nmeans well, he is a good guy, but there is a time and place for \neverything. This is not the time and place for the Smith amendment. \nThere will be a time and place later on this year for those subjects \nand the able Senator from Oregon is a member of the committee and I \nknow we are going to hear from him on his amendments and he will be \nright. These provisions we can address and will address.\n  So I am prepared to yield back my time. I know the Senator from \nMassachusetts was seeking time to speak, but apparently he no longer \nis.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, before the Senator yields back his time, I \nneed to say that Senator Smith is on his way to the floor to make a \ncouple more comments.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, to be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I think everything that could be said and \nshould be said has been said. I ask for the yeas and nays if they have \nnot already been asked for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been requested.\n  Mr. SMITH. I request the yeas and nays on the Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 206\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nBaucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, we yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 206.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. \nInouye), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Menendez), and the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nDelaware (Mr. Biden), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), and the \nSenator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) would each vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT.

Madam President and colleagues, we have just voted for a \nsense of the Senate unanimously to do what the next amendment says we \nshould do. And we should do it today. My mother used to always say: \nSon, never put off until tomorrow what you can do today.\n  I say we should do today the following things with this next vote: \nmake permanent the deduction for qualified tuition expenses; make \npermanent the employee exclusion from gross income of employer-provided \neducation assistance; make permanent the enhancements to the Coverdell \neducation savings accounts.\n  Do it today. That helps working folks and families struggling to pay \nfor education. Let's not put off until later what we can do right now. \nI urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, while I appreciate my colleague from \nOregon and his commitment to education, this is not an omnibus tax \nbill; it is long overdue legislation to increase the minimum wage. It \nis not an opportunity for Members to present their tax cut wish list. \nIt is Congress's opportunity to finally right the wrong of denying \nmillions of hard working minimum wage workers a raise for 10 years.\n  Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues filed more than 25 \namendments proposing new or expanded tax cuts. Many of them would cost \nbillions of dollars. None of them are paid for.\n  This amendment would extend several tax benefits for education that I \nstrongly support, but it should be paid for. It would cost $35 billion \nover the next decade. That cost should be offset by the elimination of \nunjustified corporate tax loopholes that are currently draining the \nTreasury.\n  I also can not support his amendment because it seeks to make \npermanent tax benefits that I believe represent misplaced priorities. \nThe amendment would extend the Coverdell education savings account \nprovision, which provides benefits to families with children in private \nelementary and secondary schools, while doing nothing to improve our \nNation's public school system.\n  And this amendment does nothing for working families who do not have \nenough assets and savings to participate in the Coverdell scheme.\n  As the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service notes:\n\n     the main outcome of extending the [Coverdell accounts] to pay \n     for K-12 education expenses may be to slightly subsidize \n     higher income families who might have sent their children to \n     private school anyway.\n\n  While Coverdell accounts might help richer families send their \nchildren to private school, it does nothing to address what parents are \ncalling for to improve public schools.\n  The Coverdell bill does not: put qualified teachers in the classroom; \nreduce class sizes; modernize or repair school buildings; provide \nadditional afterschool opportunities; or hold schools accountable for \nimproved student achievement.\n  At a time when we are asking our schools to do more under the No \nChild Left Behind, while failing to live up to our funding commitments, \nwe should not divert billions of tax dollars to support private \nschools. This year over half of the school districts in America will \nsee their title I funding cut. Funding for the No Child Left Behind Act \nhas fallen over $55 billion short of the amount promised 5 years ago.\n  We are over $8 billion under the amount promised to ensure equal \neducation opportunities to disabled students just 2 years ago when we \nreauthorized the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  Reversing these shortfalls should be our priority in this Congress, \nnot making permanent a tax benefit that promotes private schools over \npublic schools.\n  I do strongly support the extension of the deduction for qualified \ntuition and related expenses for higher education, which is set to \nexpire at the end of 2007. This deduction allows middle-income \nAmericans to take a deduction for higher education expenses of up to \n$4,000. The IRS estimates that nearly 4.7 million students and families \nin the U.S. took advantage of the deduction in 2004.\n  I look forward to working on this proposal as we move forward with \nthe debate on college affordability and higher education in the coming \nweeks.\n  We must prioritize making college more affordable.\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\n  The cost of college has more than tripled in the last 20 years. Each \nyear, 400,000 students who are qualified to attend a 4-year college \nfind themselves shut out because of cost factors.\n  As a result, students and families are pinching pennies more than \never to pay for higher education and more students and families are \ntaking out loans to finance higher education.\n  We must provide them relief with a comprehensive strategy that starts \nwith a substantial increase in the Pell grant. As the cost of even \npublic college tuition and fees has climbed by an unacceptable 46 \npercent since 2001, the maximum Pell grant has not increased even a \npenny. This Congress should quickly act to remedy this.\n  We also should reform the student loan programs and use the savings \nto increase student aid. Senator Smith has joined me in introducing the \nSTAR Act, which provides incentives for schools to participate in the \ncheaper federal student loan program and uses savings to increase need-\nbased aid generating over $13 billion over 10 years in need-based aid \nat no additional cost.\n  Finally, Congress should make college loan payments more affordable \nby reducing interest rates and capping monthly loan payments.\n  I plan to address these issues in our committee very soon and I would \nwelcome Senator Smith's contributions to that legislation and that \ndebate.\n  I also look forward to working with him, Senator Baucus and other \nmembers of the Finance Committee as they develop a responsible tax \npackage that helps middle class and low-income families afford to send \ntheir children to college.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the admonition and good \ncounsel of my good friend from Oregon. My mother used to say: If you \ncan do it, do it now. My mother used to also say: If you are going to \ndo it now, do it right the first time. This is not doing it right the \nfirst time.\n  We rejected, about an hour ago, a similar amendment; that is, an \namendment that was not offered in committee. I do not mean to be \npejorative, but it is sort of a slapdash amendment, thought up, not \nconsidered in committee.\n  This amendment is just too complex. It causes a big increase in the \nbudget deficit. It is not paid for. I have a whole list of reasons why \nwe should not adopt this amendment. Essentially, we will get to these \nissues in committee, and that will be the right time and place to deal \nwith these issues.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 505(a) of H. Con. Res. 95, the concurrent resolution \non the budget for fiscal year 2004.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable portion of \nthe Budget Act and urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the \nSenator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from New York \n(Mr. Schumer) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Bond), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn), the \nSenator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens), and the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. \nThomas).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 43, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 30 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Bond\n     Coburn\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Schumer\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 43, the nays are \n50. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think we had an agreement to speak. I \nask unanimous consent, if the floor managers agree, to commence my time \nat 4:45. A number of Senators have amendments they want to offer during \nthat period of time between now and 4:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nunderstand we are working out a time agreement. I would like to try to \nsee what the time is. I have heard we then want to vote--some have said \nwe are going to vote at 5:15. I don't understand what the time \nagreement is. I want to cooperate, and will, with the Senator. If we \ncan withhold for a minute or two so that we can get the time agreement, \nif others want to speak, I certainly won't object to it. I understand \nwe had an agreement, but I am not sure of the particulars yet and what \nit all means.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understood that an agreement had been reached to vote \nat 5:15. We had agreed to 30 minutes equally divided. I left a few \nminutes for some others who want to speak. That was my suggestion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see other Senators. If they want to \nintroduce amendments for a minute or two until we get this straightened \nout, if that is their purpose, that is fine. I have no objection to \nthat while we are trying to work this through.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alabama withdraw his \nrequest?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask the chairman that the 10 minutes be \ndivided between Senators Burr, Chambliss, and Allard.\n  Mr. ALLARD. If the Senator from Wyoming will yield, I need more than \na few minutes. I need probably about 7 minutes. Maybe if I can get 7 \nminutes after the vote, that would be all right.\n  Mr. ENZI. So the unanimous consent request is to divide the 10 \nminutes, or the time until 4:45, between Senators Burr and Chambliss, \nand after the vote, 7 minutes for Senator Allard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield for a question, can we add \nthat I be allowed up to 15 minutes before the vote at 5:15, or \nthereabouts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have tried to be accommodating, and I \nhave heard that people want to vote at 5:15 and 5:30. I want to make \nsure that we are going to get a fair share of the time. I will have to \nobject until we have an agreement. I think we are going to get the \nagreement. What has been outlined on the floor is not what the \nagreement is going to say. If we have an agreement in terms of time, I \nthink we ought to follow that. If there is going to be objection, that \nis fine. I will be around here. They told me there were Members who \nwanted to vote by 5:30 because of traveling. I want to accommodate \nthat, and I want to make sure we divide the time between now and 5:30.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand Senator Kennedy's concern. \nAll I am asking for is 10, 15 minutes before we vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, whenever we are going to vote, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Alabama have 15 minutes prior \nto that time. We will try to work out the time\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\nbefore that with the floor staff. But we have that locked in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending \namendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 195 to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 195.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Burr], for himself, \n     Mr. DeMint and Mr. Coburn, proposes an amendment numbered \n     195.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for an exemption to a minimum wage increase for \n  certain employers who contribute to their employees health benefit \n                               expenses)\n\n       At the end of section 102, add the following:\n       (c) Exception in the Case of Provision of Health \n     Benefits.--Notwithstanding the amendment made by subsection \n     (a), an employer to which such amendment applies shall have \n     the option to--\n       (1) increase the minimum wage paid to employees as required \n     under such amendment; or\n       (2) provide such employees with health care benefits that \n     are equal (in terms of the monetary amount expended by the \n     employer for such benefits) to the monetary amount by which \n     the minimum wage is to be increased pursuant to such \n     amendment.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to commend my \ncolleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi. There is no question that \nwe need to do something on minimum wage. What I am trying to do is \nrealize that, as we do this, we do it in the wisest way we possibly \ncan.\n  My simple amendment is very brief. It allows employers, with the \nincrease we are making in minimum wage, to supply that equal dollar \namount in health care benefits. Think about that. It would be the \noption of the employer to invest the $2.10 in the health care benefits \nof his or her employee. Some will probably suggest that is not enough.\n  If you look at the national average today for 100 percent of an \nindividual's premium, the national average, based on the Kaiser \nFoundation, is $4,248. Well, based upon the amount we are proposing to \nraise the minimum wage, that leaves $120 to spare after we have paid \n100 percent of that individual's health care. Stretch it a little bit \nfurther and apply it to a family, and that $4,368 that we are going to \nincrease their wages by would provide almost 50 percent of the premium \nof a family plan.\n  You know, we talk about extending health care to all Americans, about \nthe need to provide the resources for people to have affordable and \naccessible health care. Well, here is a way to do it. Let's allow those \nemployers to have a benefit package that they extend to minimum wage \nworkers for the first time so those who are most at risk might have the \nopportunity to be supplied health care by their employer, negotiated at \nthe group rate.\n  Some might think that all Americans don't have a dog in this fight. I \nsay they do. For every American we can put under the umbrella of \ncoverage, we have reduced the cost shift in health care to where \ninsurance premiums for the average person today will not continue to go \nup at the rate it is today. My hope is that even if it is incremental, \nwe can bring more Americans under the umbrella of coverage.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will see the great benefit we are \ntalking about now, money designated to increase the wages of \nindividuals, and we will at least allow employers the option to give \nthem that benefit in health care. I think it is a very reasonable \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 118 to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 118.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss] for himself, Mr. \n     Isakson, Mr. Burr and Mrs. Dole, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 118.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide minimum wage rates for agricultural workers)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. __. WAGES FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS.\n\n       Section (6)(a)(5) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n     (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(5)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(5) if such employee is employed in agriculture, or is \n     employed to provide agriculture labor or services pursuant to \n     section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1188), not less than the greater of--\n       ``(A) the minimum wage rate in effect under paragraph (1) \n     after December 31, 1977; or\n       ``(B) the prevailing wage established by the Occupational \n     Employment Statistics program, or other wage survey, \n     conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the county of \n     intended employment, for entry level workers who are employed \n     in agriculture in the area of work to be performed.''.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the support of \nSenator Burr and Senator Isakson on this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dole be added as a cosponsor of \nmy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this amendment is an attempt to remedy \na wage issue that is a tremendous burden for some of our Nation's \nagricultural employers. There are about 1 million agricultural workers \nin the country today, and roughly half of them are illegal workers.\n  As we expand the Border Patrol's presence on the border and the \nefforts of our men and women on the Border Patrol become more \nsuccessful, farmers and ranchers who have historically relied on an \nillegal workforce have started to feel the squeeze, and they should. A \nlabor shortage has resulted in a number of areas. This labor shortage \noccurs because agriculture is a traditional gateway of illegal \nimmigration into the United States.\n  Many illegal immigrants come to the United States, work for a while \non a farm, and, as they integrate into our society, they find different \njobs, such as those in hospitality or construction. Therefore, the \nillegal agricultural workforce has continuously relied upon new workers \ncrossing the border illegally and starting out on the farm.\n  As a result of these events, a number of Senators and advocacy groups \nhave argued for a greater urgency in immigration reform in the \nagricultural sector.\n  I have spoken with farmers and ranchers all across America advocating \nimmigration reform, and I always ask them: Do you use the H-2A program? \nThis is the legal temporary worker program in law today that allows for \nan unlimited number of temporary agricultural workers to come to the \nUnited States and work and then return to their home country and return \nagain and again as needed.\n  The primary response to my question is, they don't use the existing \nprogram, that it is too costly, and it is too bureaucratic. There are \nseveral other issues they have with the H-2A program that I attempted \nto remedy in the context of the immigration debate last year, and I \nwill continue to work on those efforts when the Senate takes up the \nissue of immigration reform this Congress.\n  However, the largest prohibitive cost of using the H-2A program is \nits mandated artificially inflated wages. If we are truly looking for \nways to make sure our agricultural workforce is legal, then addressing \nthis and obtaining legal agricultural workers is something that should \nbe fixed on this legislation.\n  If the Senate passes this amendment, we will see an immediate \nincrease in the number of legal workers on our Nation's farms and fewer \ncrop losses resulting from the lack of labor. The high cost of the H-2A \nprogram increases every year, and it will increase\n\n[[Page S1173]]\n\neven more with the passage of the minimum wage legislation we are \nconsidering today.\n  Agricultural employers who utilize the legal program are mandated to \npay the adverse effect wage rate to all their workers, in addition to \nproviding free housing, paying all visa and consular fees, and paying \nfor the transportation and meal costs of those workers traveling to \ntheir farms.\n  Historically, approval for an employer to use nonimmigrant temporary \nworkers was predicated on the following conditions being met: First, no \nU.S. workers were available to fill the specific job, and, second, that \nwages for that occupation would not be depressed by the hiring of \nforeign workers.\n  The imposition of a prevailing wage requirement as determined by the \nU.S. Department of Labor approved surveys in each State for specific \noccupations generally filled by temporary nonimmigrant workers would \nensure three things:\n  First, that available U.S. workers would not be discouraged from \napplying for a job because it paid lower than usual local wages; \nsecond, all workers, both foreign and domestic, would be paid a wage \nthat was competitive in the local area, thus avoiding depressing wages \nfor that occupation; and third, that the use of foreign workers would \nnot be more financially attractive to employers than employing U.S. \nworkers.\n  Prevailing wages are determined by the U.S. Department of Labor \nthrough its State partners, using a methodology that is designed to \ncapture a fair wage that reflects the local standards peculiar to a \nparticular occupation.\n  At the present time, prevailing wages are required for H-1B, H-2B, \nand permanent work-related visas. However, employers of H-2A workers, \ntemporary nonimmigrant agricultural workers, are required to pay a \ndifferent wage rate called the adverse effect wage rate. Unlike \nprevailing wages which are established for a local area for specific \njobs and determined by the level of experience, skill, and education \nwhich those jobs require, the adverse effect wage rate is an average of \nall wages, including incentive pay, bonuses, and seniority, for all \nfarm jobs in a multi-State region.\n  Additionally, the adverse effect wage rate is not determined by the \nU.S. Department of Labor, the agency charged with determining wages for \nall other industries and occupations. Rather, the U.S. Department of \nLabor has chosen to use a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture. Officials in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National \nAgricultural Statistics Service readily admit that the wage survey used \nfor the adverse effect wage rate was never designed to set specific \nwages, only to describe them in general. Therefore, the National \nAgricultural Statistics Service's survey creates an artificial, multi-\nState wage floor, one that significantly increases annually, regardless \nof the economy, the agricultural market and competitive factors within \na product line or local area.\n  For instance, while the minimum wage remained constant for entry-\nlevel jobs for the 10-year period starting in 1997 until today, the \naverage adverse effect wage rate has increased 40 percent over that \nsame period. As the National Council of Agricultural Employers noted in \nan alert to their membership:\n\n       The increase in the Federal minimum wage is likely to \n     result in a larger than normal increase in the adverse effect \n     wage rate for several years after the new minimum wage \n     becomes effective as the upward adjustment in the wage rates \n     works its way through the agricultural industry.\n\n  This is because the adverse effect wage rate is set at the average \nfield and livestock worker hourly earnings, and upward adjustment in \nwages at the lower end of the agricultural wage distribution resulting \nin the increase from the minimum wage will, of course, raise the \naverage hourly earnings for agricultural workers, generally.\n  Furthermore, the lower wage jobs that disappear as a result of the \nincrease in the minimum wage will no longer be part of the average, \nforcing the adverse effect wage rate up even higher. Increased wages in \nagriculture will only hasten the movement of agricultural production to \nforeign soils.\n  Maybe the reason we have upward of 500,000 illegal foreign workers in \nagriculture today is because of the prohibitively high cost of using \nthe legal H-2A program or maybe it is because we don't pay Americans \nwho work on our farms and ranches enough.\n  While we guarantee a minimum of the adverse effect wage rate to \ntemporary foreign workers, U.S. workers in agriculture are guaranteed \nonly a minimum wage. So in my home State of Georgia, a temporary H-2A \nworker today is guaranteed $8.37 an hour, while an American worker is \nguaranteed only $5.15 an hour.\n  My amendment is very simple, and it attempts to remedy the two \npossible causes of the lack of legal workers on our Nation's farms and \nranches. This amendment changes the Fair Labor Standards Act to ensure \nthat all farm workers, regardless of whether they are temporary foreign \nworkers or U.S. citizens, be paid a prevailing wage. Adoption of this \namendment will attract more legal workers to agricultural employment by \nallowing more farmers to access the Legal Temporary Worker Program and \nby guaranteeing U.S. workers higher wages on our Nation's farms.\n  Prevailing wages reflect geographic location, occupation, and skill \nlevel. The use of prevailing wages will improve competition within the \nUnited States without negatively affecting workers and will keep \nagricultural jobs at home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 167 to Amendment No. 118\n\n  (Purpose: To improve agricultural job opportunities, benefits, and \n               security for aliens in the United States)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Feinstein, I call up \namendment No. 167, a second-degree amendment to amendment No. 118.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for Mrs. \n     Feinstein, for herself and Mr. Craig, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 167 to amendment No. 118.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween 4:50 p.m. and 5:40 p.m. be equally divided and controlled by \nSenators Kennedy and Sessions for debate with respect to the Sessions \namendment No. 148, with no second-degree amendment in order prior to \nthe vote at 5:40 p.m., and that the Senate proceed to vote in relation \nto the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the time is divided. Does the Senator \nfrom Alabama want to make a brief opening comment; otherwise, I will \nspeak.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would be pleased to make opening \ncomments. I guess the time of 5:40 p.m. was selected by the leadership \nor something.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Or something.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. One of my goals was to hurry up so we could vote at \n5:15 p.m. Now they decided they wanted to vote at 5:40. It is not my \nfault, I say to my colleagues. I did reduce the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator call up his amendment.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 148 to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that amendment No. 148 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself, Mr. \n     Inhofe, and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 148 \n     to amendment No. 100.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit employers who unlawfully employ aliens from \n                    receiving government contracts)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Section 274A(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1324a(e)) is amended\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\n     by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(10) Prohibition on award of government contracts, \n     grants, and agreements.--\n       ``(A) Employers with no contracts, grants, or agreements.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Subject to clause (iii) and subparagraph \n     (C), if an employer who does not hold a Federal contract, \n     grant, or cooperative agreement is determined to have \n     violated this section, the employer shall be debarred from \n     the receipt of a Federal contract, grant, or cooperative \n     agreement for a period of 7 years.\n       ``(ii) Placement on excluded list.--The Secretary of \n     Homeland Security or the Attorney General shall advise the \n     Administrator of General Services of the debarment of an \n     employer under clause (i) and the Administrator of General \n     Services shall list the employer on the List of Parties \n     Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs \n     for a period of 7 years.\n       ``(iii) Waiver.--\n\n       ``(I) Authority.--The Administrator of General Services, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the \n     Attorney General, may waive operation of clause (i) or may \n     limit the duration or scope of a debarment under clause (i) \n     if such waiver or limitation is necessary to national defense \n     or in the interest of national security.\n       ``(II) Notification to congress.--If the Administrator \n     grants a waiver or limitation described in subclause (I), the \n     Administrator shall submit to each member of the Committee on \n     the Judiciary of the Senate and of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the House of Representatives immediate notice of \n     such waiver or limitation.\n       ``(III) Prohibition on judicial review.--The decision of \n     whether to debar or take alternative action under this clause \n     shall not be judicially reviewed.\n\n       ``(B) Employers with contracts, grants, or agreements.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Subject to clause (iii) and subclause \n     (C), an employer who holds a Federal contract, grant, or \n     cooperative agreement and is determined to have violated this \n     section shall be debarred from the receipt of new Federal \n     contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements for a period of \n     10 years.\n       ``(ii) Notice to agencies.--Prior to debarring the employer \n     under clause (i), the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \n     cooperation with the Administrator of General Services, shall \n     advise any agency or department holding a contract, grant, or \n     cooperative agreement with the employer of the Government's \n     intention to debar the employer from the receipt of new \n     Federal contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements for a \n     period of 10 years.\n       ``(iii) Waiver.--\n\n       ``(I) Authority.--After consideration of the views of any \n     agency or department that holds a contract, grant, or \n     cooperative agreement with the employer, the Administrator of \n     General Services, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security and the Attorney General, may waive \n     operation of clause (i) or may limit the duration or scope of \n     the debarment under clause (i) if such waiver or limitation \n     is necessary to the national defense or in the interest of \n     national security.\n       ``(II) Notification to congress.--If the Administrator \n     grants a waiver or limitation described in subclause (I), the \n     Administrator shall submit to each member of the Committee on \n     the Judiciary of the Senate and of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the House of Representatives immediate notice of \n     such waiver or limitation.\n       ``(III) Prohibition on judicial review.--The decision of \n     whether to debar or take alternate action under this clause \n     shall not be judicially reviewed.\n\n       ``(C) Exemption from penalty for employers participating in \n     the basic pilot program.--In the case of imposition on an \n     employer of a debarment from the receipt of a Federal \n     contract, grant, or cooperative agreement under subparagraph \n     (A) or (B), that penalty shall be waived if the employer \n     establishes that the employer was voluntarily participating \n     in the basic pilot program under section 403(a) of the \n     Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \n     of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1324a note) at the time of the violations \n     of this section that resulted in the debarment.''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the whole purpose of the Minimum Wage \nAct is to increase the wages of working Americans, particularly low-\nskilled workers who are paid minimum wage-level salaries and who are \nhaving a difficult time. That is a noble goal because I don't think \ntheir salaries have gone up as much as we would like.\n  One of the reasons, as I discussed earlier and will discuss again \nbefore this debate concludes, that those salaries have lagged behind is \nbecause of a large influx of illegal immigrant labor. That is \nindisputable, and it has not been discussed much. People apparently \ndon't want to talk about it. We are going to talk about it.\n  We, also, have with regard to Government employees and Government \ncontractors, a significant loophole we ought to fix that involves \nnational security, as well as competition for American workers, and \nthat is the purpose of this amendment No. 148, which I note has been \ncosponsored by Senator Grassley and Senator Coburn.\n  This amendment would focus only on contractors who do work for the \nFederal Government. Unfortunately, I have not been able to get an \nagreement to have a vote on raising the penalties for other businesses \nin America from $250 as a fine for hiring illegals as I would have on \namendment No. 142. That has been objected to by the Democratic \nleadership. I think we ought to vote on that amendment. It is a bigger \nissue, but at this point, we will be able to proceed to a vote on \namendment No. 148.\n  Employment verification is the responsibility of an employer when \nsomeone is hired. It exists in paper form and was mandated in 1986 as \npart of that 1986 amnesty, in which 3 million people were legalized. We \npromised not to allow this kind of problem to happen again, and we set \nup a system that was supposed to work to verify the citizenship of \npeople or their legality when they came to work.\n  Employers under the 1986 act must identify work authorization \ndocuments from each new person they hire, fill out form I-9 with an \nattestation and retain the I-9s in case the Department of Homeland \nSecurity wishes to look at them. That is what they are required to do.\n  Unfortunately, anything that looks good they often accept and some of \nthem argue they have to accept. They don't look behind these documents, \nand there is no real verification. Many are totally bogus and \nfraudulent. Thousands and tens of thousands of documents are submitted \nwith Social Security numbers that are all zeros. I think it was 50,000 \nSocial Security numbers in this country that were all zeros. How bogus \nis that?\n  So an alternative to the paper I-9 system that has not been working, \nan Electronic Employment Verification System, was created in a pilot. \nIt is used voluntarily by about 13,000 employers throughout this \ncountry to verify work authorization when hiring new employees.\n  The amendment before us today would prohibit contractors for the \nGovernment that get caught hiring illegal aliens from obtaining a new \nGovernment contract for up to 7 years or 10 years, depending on whether \nthey currently have a contract with the Government.\n  We voted for this concept in the immigration bill previously, but a \nwaiver from this debarment from contract work--and that is a \nsubstantial penalty for some of these companies--would be available for \nnational defense and national security purposes.\n  Contractors, in addition, would be protected from this debarment, \nthis ban, if they are using the EEVS system, or the Basic Pilot Program \nto verify the legality of the employers. It is used by the Senate, it \nis used by the House, it is used by every Government agency, and it is \nused by 13,000 businesses throughout this country.\n  All one has to do, basically, is your administrative officer or \nappropriate staff person goes online and checks the Social Security \nnumber or documents of the employee to verify their legality, and if \nthey come up legal, they are able to hire them. The same would be true \nfor these contractors who do contract work for the Federal Government. \nIf they don't do that and they hire people who are illegal, then they \ncould suffer the consequences. It would require them to do that. I \nthink it only makes good sense.\n  Most economists do not dispute the contention that illegal work by \nillegal workers lowers the overall wage rate for particular industries, \nespecially unskilled workers. Since the minimum wage is intended to \nraise the wage levels of these mostly unskilled workers, it is \nappropriate for us to consider the wages of Americans if contractors \ncan easily obtain illegal labor from illegal immigrants and there would \nbe fewer Americans hired to these jobs, and it would depress the wages, \nI submit, in reality and in theory.\n  Mr. President, I ask that I be notified when 9 minutes is up.\n  Many scholars and policymakers, including the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, Department of Homeland Security, the Heritage Foundation, on \neither side of the debate have advocated for some form of advanced \nmandatory employment verification system as one of the main tools \nnecessary to prevent\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\nanother surge of illegal immigration and to protect employers from \nliability, or being held accountable, for inadvertently hiring illegal \nworkers. There have been a lot of problems with that, I will admit it. \nIt is time for us to give clear direction to the employers and a clear \nsystem that will work. This amendment takes the first step. We \nencourage but not require the contractors to use an EEVS system, by \nproviding them with protection from any liability if they use it.\n  If anyone should be following the system, any businesses should be, \nit ought to be businesses doing work for the U.S. taxpayers, spending \nmoney that belongs to the U.S. taxpayers.\n  Large numbers of illegal workers are being hired in America today. We \nknow that. The vast majority of businesses carefully follow the law, \nbut many of them, unfortunately, do not. Some are even contractors who \nare working on sensitive Government contracts.\n  Let me tell you, we have a problem. I will share some information \nabout it. It impacts jobs, the economy, and our national security.\n  The Associated Press reported last Friday, January 19, that nearly 40 \nillegal immigrants hired by contractors working on 3 military bases in \nGeorgia, Virginia, and Nevada, were arrested last week by the ICE \nAgency, the immigration enforcement group. Twenty-four of the illegal \nimmigrant workers were arrested while trying to enter Fort Benning, GA, \nto do construction at the military base. According to the ICE, the \nillegal immigrants worked for different subcontractors.\n  My 9 minutes is up. I will try to finish in a couple of minutes, a \nvery few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. According to ICE, the illegal immigrants work for \ndifferent subcontractors who are not facing any charges from the \nGovernment. Unfortunately, that is not a new problem. In October of \n2005, seven illegal aliens were arrested for working at the U.S. Air \nForce base in Idaho. They were employed by a subcontractor.\n  Also, last October, 2006, three illegal workers were working at Fort \nBragg and they were arrested.\n  In 2005 alone, ICE arrested 6 illegal aliens working at Homestead Air \nReserve Base in Florida, 48 illegal aliens working at the Seymour \nJohnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, 9 illegal aliens performing \ncontract work at a facility that refits Navy aircraft in North \nCarolina, 18 working for a San Diego company that performed maintenance \non U.S. Navy vessels.\n  According to an Empire Journal article, a huge problem is that \nemployers can participate in a voluntary program to verify employee \nwork eligibility, but they suffer no penalty for failing to check the \nvalidity of the Social Security numbers.\n  The article concluded:\n\n       A weak law allows the employer to see the document and if \n     the document looks genuine to the employer, the employer \n     cannot be held responsible for hiring the illegal immigrant.\n\n  It is astounding how widespread this problem is. In a report by ICE \nin 2005, a company contracted by the Navy to paint ships was found to \nemploy 86 illegals who had security passes giving them access to the \nentire Navy base in San Diego.\n  In 2004, 41 suspected illegal aliens were apprehended while working \nfor a Department of Defense contractor that was providing Boeing with \nanti-missile systems and radar--top security type equipment.\n  Also, in 2004, seven foreign nationals were arrested for working \nillegally at the Fort Polk Joint Readiness Training Center in \nLouisiana. They were ``role players'' in combat exercises to prepare \nsoldiers for combat in Iraq.\n  In one alarming incident, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was \ncaught allowing illegal aliens to obtain bogus documentation by using \nfake Social Security numbers to work as contract painters in nuclear \nfacilities.\n  Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, stated:\n\n       Commission regulations are supposed to ensure that \n     individuals who are able to access nuclear facilities are \n     subject to appropriate background and security checks but \n     they clearly did not work in this case.\n\n  This amendment would fix key weaknesses in the employer verification \nsystem, provide a defense to companies that follow the rules and act in \ngood faith, and debar companies that violate the rule.\n  We will not tolerate that, with taxpayers' money on taxpayers' \ncontracts.\n  We want to help people in this country get higher wages. I have \ntalked about that for some time. We need to consider and take the \nadvice, I believe, of Dr. Barry Chiswick, head of the Department of \nEconomics at the University of Illinois in Chicago, when he testified \nbefore the Senate committee last spring. He said:\n\n       The large increase in low-skilled immigration . . . has had \n     the effect of decreasing the wages and employment \n     opportunities of low-skilled workers who are currently \n     residing in the United States.\n       Over the past two decades . . . [t]he real earnings of low-\n     skilled workers has either stagnated or decreased somewhat.\n\n  This is Dr. Chiswick. He goes on to say:\n\n       We . . . need to . . . provide greater assistance to low-\n     skilled Americans in their quest for better jobs and higher \n     wages. [O]ne of the ways we can help them in this regard is \n     by reducing the very substantial competition they are facing \n     from this very large and uncontrolled low-skilled immigration \n     that is the result of both our legal immigration system and \n     the absence of enforcement of immigration law.\n\n  Professor Harry Holzer, Associate Dean and Professor of Public Policy \nat Georgetown, said this before the Judiciary Committee last spring. He \nbelieves American workers do want jobs currently held by illegal \nlaborers and he believes that absent illegal immigrant competition, \nemployers would raise wages and improve working conditions to attract \nAmerican workers.\n  Absolutely that will happen. This is what the Associate Dean and \nProfessor of Public Policy in Georgetown said:\n\n       I believe that when immigrants are illegal, they do more to \n     undercut the wages of native born workers because the playing \n     field isn't level and the employers don't have to pay them \n     market wages . . . [T]here are jobs in industries like \n     construction I think are more appealing to native-born \n     workers and many native-born low-income men might be \n     interested in more of those jobs. . . . Absent the \n     immigrants, the employer might need to raise those wages and \n     improve those conditions of work to entice native-born \n     workers into those jobs.\n\n  As we consider this, let's also consider the relevance of unfair \ncompetition to low-skilled workers. Let's let their wages go up in this \ntime of unprecedented prosperity and GDP growth and profits. Let's let \nthe workers' salaries go up. One way to do that is eliminate this \ncompetition from large numbers of illegal workers.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 24 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to let me know when there \nis 5 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is now 10 after 5 on the fifth day \nthat the Senate has been considering raising the minimum wage from \n$5.15 to $7.25 over a 2-year period. We have not, as we have heard in \nthe course of this debate, raised it in the last 10 years. This is just \ngoing to restore the purchasing power of those on the lower rungs of \nthe economic ladder to what it was 10 years ago. It won't even give \nthem an increase, simply restore the purchasing power.\n  Five days we have been debating a rather simple concept that everyone \nin this institution knows and has voted on a number of times--whether \nit is over here in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. For \n10 years, Republican leadership has refused to let us get a vote on \nincreasing the minimum wage. Let's have no mistake about it--10 years, \nthe Republican leadership has basically refused to let us get it, even \nthough a majority of the Members in this body, a handful of those \nRepublican Members, have favored an increase in the minimum wage. But \nwe have been unable to get to the numbers sufficient to break the \neffective filibuster and deny us the opportunity to vote.\n  These individuals, individuals who have been receiving the minimum \nwage, and their families and their allies and their supporters and the \nworkers of this country, the trade union movement, the AFL/CIO, the \nchurch\n\n[[Page S1176]]\n\ngroups, those who represent the great faiths of this country and \nothers, particularly Democrats and some conscientious Republicans, have \nsaid this is wrong and we will try to do something about it. They have, \nover the period of time, raised the initiatives in some States. In six \ndifferent States where this issue was on the ballot, they indicated \nthey wanted the increase in the minimum wage. States have raised the \nminimum wage. But we have still not had this institution, the Senate, \ngo on record and say to working families in this country that they \nought to get a raise.\n  Mr. President, $276 billion in tax breaks for corporations, $36 \nbillion in tax breaks for small businesses, increase in productivity of \n29 percent over the last 10 years, but do you think there is any \nincrease in the minimum wage? No. Five days on the floor of the Senate \nwe have considered immigration issues, as we have now. We have \nconsidered Social Security issues. We have considered health issues. We \nare considering education issues. We are considering additional kinds \nof tax breaks for wealthy corporations. But do we hear from the other \nside a willingness, as this side is willing at this moment, at 12 after \n5 today, on Thursday? I speak for all of our Democratic Members and say \nwe are prepared to vote now, now, in 10 minutes, 15 minutes on this \nissue.\n  But no, as we have been for the last five days--no, no, we have other \namendments, Senator. We have other amendments to offer.\n  We have now had amendments that have been worth over $200 billion. We \nhave had amendments on education of $35 billion. We have had health \nsavings amendments that will benefit those of average income of \n$133,000 costing $8 billion. We have had those kinds of amendments and \nwe are looking at the Kyl amendment at $3 billion, but we still cannot \nget $2.10 over 2 years.\n  What is the price, we ask the other side? What is the price you want \nfrom these working men and women? What cost? How much more do we have \nto give to the private sector and to business? How many billion dollars \nmore are you asking, are you requiring? When does the greed stop, we \nask the other side. That is the question and that is the issue, make no \nmistake about it. They have on the Republican side 70 more amendments--\n70 more amendments. We have none. We are prepared to vote now. Seventy \nmore amendments. Oh, yes. We want an increase in the minimum wage, we \nwant this, we want that, but silence over there, or let's have some \nother kinds of amendments that have virtually nothing to do with this. \nDo you have such disdain for hard-working Americans that you want to \npile all your amendments on this? Why don't you just hold your \namendments for other pieces of legislation? Why this volume of \namendments on just the issue to try to raise the minimum wage? What is \nit about it that drives you Republicans crazy? What is it? Something. \nSomething. Are you going to require us to have a cloture vote next \nweek? I can see it already: Amendments that have already been filed \nthat are going to be related in case we do get cloture to delay this \neven further.\n\n  What is the price workers have to pay to get an increase? What is it \nabout working men and women that you find so offensive that you won't \npermit even a vote, denying the Senate of the United States the \nopportunity to express ourselves? We don't want to hear any more from \nthat side for the rest of this session about permitting or not \npermitting votes in here when you are denying on the most simple \nconcept: an increase in the minimum wage. We don't want to hear any \nmore about that. This is filibuster by delay and amendments. I have \nbeen around here long enough to know it when I see it and smell it. \nThat is what it looks like, that is what it is, make no mistake about \nit. Make no mistake about it. And it just puzzles me. It really does.\n  I don't know why it is so offensive to the other side. It certainly \nisn't the economic issues. We haven't heard those debated. We brought \nup the various charts about what has happened in States which have \nraised the minimum wage and how they have done better economically than \nStates that have not raised it. We have shown where small businesses \nhave done better in States where they have raised the minimum wage. We \nhave also shown what has happened when we have an increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  We show the increased poverty. There is a long story in the New York \nTimes today:\n\n       Childhood Poverty Is Found To Portend High Adult Costs. \n     Children who grow up poor cost the economy $500 billion a \n     year because they are less productive, earn less money, \n     commit more crimes, have more health-related expenses, \n     according to a study released on Wednesday.\n\n  The study goes on. Here it is in the newspaper today, just what we \nhave been talking about--the United States with the highest poverty \nrate for children of any industrial nation in the world.\n  What has happened? The British raise their minimum wage, and they get \ntwo million children out of poverty. The Irish go to $10.80 an hour and \nreduce the poverty for children by 40 percent. You raise the minimum \nwage, and you get children out of poverty. Oh, no, no. ``Child Poverty \nIs Found To Portend High Adult Costs.'' What more information do we \nhave to provide to the other side? What more do we have to do? What \nmore do we have to do?\n  Well, hopefully the American people are going to understand about who \nis delaying, who is opposing, who is using every kind of parliamentary \ntactic known to every possible Parliamentarian to delay action on the \nincrease in the minimum wage. It lies right at the feet of the \nRepublican leadership--right at the feet of the Republican leadership. \nMake no mistake about it. Make no mistake about it. An amendment here, \nan amendment there, an amendment on Social Security, an amendment on \nimmigration, and the chortling and the laughing as they go on about \ntheir business. Well, for those millions of Americans who are headed \nhome tonight, after having worked long and hard, to face their children \nand hoping that at least, after the House of Representatives voted, \nwith 80 Republicans who voted for an increase in the minimum wage, \ncertainly the Senate of the United States isn't going to fail us, what \ndo we tell them after 5 days? And $200 billion dollars more in tax cuts \nhere, $35 billion more in tax cuts there, $8 billion more in tax cuts \nfor HSAs. How many more billions of dollars do we have to give you, Mr. \nRepublican? How many more dollars do we have to give you to get an \nincrease in the minimum wage? It is shocking. It is disgraceful. But \nhopefully working families across this country are going to see it for \nwhat it is.\n  We have an amendment that I will just say a word about at this time, \nbut before I do, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator has 12 minutes 40 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would ask that the Chair tell me when I have 3 \nminutes.\n\n\n                                Iraq War\n\n  I want to take the time--since I have been listening patiently here, \nour colleagues are going to listen to me read a rather dramatic article \nin the New York Times today, page A-10:\n\n       In the battle for Baghdad, Haifa Street has changed hands \n     so often that it has taken on the feel of a no man's land, \n     the deadly space between opposing trenches. On Wednesday, as \n     American and Iraqi troops poured in, the street showed why it \n     is such a sensitive gauge of an urban conflict marked by \n     front lines that melt into confusion, enemies with no clear \n     identity and allies who disappear or do not show up at all.\n       In a miniature version of the troop increase that the \n     United States hopes will secure the city, American soldiers \n     and armored vehicles raced onto Haifa Street before dawn to \n     dislodge Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias who have been \n     battling for a stretch of ragged slums and mostly abandoned \n     high rises. But as the sun rose, many of the Iraqi Army units \n     who were supposed to do the actual searches of the buildings \n     did not arrive on time, forcing the Americans to start the \n     job on their own.\n       When the Iraqi units finally did show up, it was with the \n     air of a class outing, cheering and laughing as the Americans \n     blew locks off doors with shotguns. As the morning wore on \n     and the troops came under fire from all directions, another \n     apparent flaw in this strategy became clear as empty \n     apartments became lairs for gunmen who flitted from window to \n     window and killed at least one American soldier, with a shot \n     to the head.\n       Whether the gunfire was coming from Sunni or Shiite \n     insurgents or militia fighters or some of the Iraqi soldiers \n     who had disappeared into the Gotham-like cityscape, no one \n     could say.\n       ``Who the hell is shooting at us?'' shouted Sgt. First \n     Class Marc Biletski, whose platoon was jammed into a small \n     room off an\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\n     alley that was being swept by a sniper's bullets. ``Who's \n     shooting at us? Do we know who they are?''\n       Just before the platoon tossed smoke bombs and sprinted \n     through the alley to a more secure position, Sergeant \n     Biletski had a moment to reflect on this spot, which the \n     United States has now fought to regain from a mysterious \n     enemy at least three times in the past two years.\n       ``This place is a failure,'' Sergeant Biletski said. \n     ``Every time we come here, we have to come back.''\n       He paused, then said, ``Well, maybe not a total failure,'' \n     since American troops have smashed opposition on Haifa Street \n     each time they have come in.\n       With that, Sergeant Biletski ran through the billowing \n     yellow smoke and took up a new position.\n       The Haifa Street operation, involving Bradley Fighting \n     Vehicles as well as the highly mobile Stryker vehicles, is \n     likely to cause plenty of reflection by the commanders in \n     charge of the Baghdad buildup of more than 20,000 troops. \n     Just how those extra troops will be used is not yet known, \n     but it is likely to mirror at least broadly the Haifa Street \n     strategy of working with Iraqi forces to take on unruly \n     groups from both sides of the Sunni-Shiite sectarian divide.\n       The commander of the operation, Lt. Col. Avanulas Smiley of \n     the Third Stryker Brigade Combat Team, Second Infantry \n     Division, said his forces were not interested in whether \n     opposition came from bullets fired by Sunnis or by Shiites. \n     He conceded that the cost of letting the Iraqi forces learn \n     on the job was to add to the risk involved in the operation.\n       ``This was an Iraqi-led effort and with that come \n     challenges and risks,'' Colonel Smiley said. ``It can be \n     organized chaos.''\n       The American units in the operation began moving up Haifa \n     Street from the south by 2 a.m. on Wednesday. A platoon of B \n     Company in the Stryker Brigade secured the roof of a high \n     rise, where an Eminen poster was stuck on the wall of what \n     appeared to be an Iraqi teenager's room on the top floor. But \n     in a pattern that would be repeated again and again in a \n     series of buildings, there was no one in the apartment.\n       Many of the Iraqi units that showed up late never seemed to \n     take the task seriously, searching haphazardly, breaking \n     dishes and rifling through personal CD collections in the \n     apartments. Eventually the Americans realized that the Iraqis \n     were searching no more than half of the apartments; at one \n     point the Iraqis completely disappeared, leaving the American \n     unit working with them flabbergasted.\n       ``Where did they go?'' yelled Sgt. Jeri A. Gillett. Another \n     soldier suggested, ``I say we just let them go and we do this \n     ourselves.''\n       Then the gunfire began. It would come from high rises \n     across the street, from behind trash piles and sandbags in \n     alleys and from so many other directions that the soldiers \n     began to worry that the Iraqi soldiers were firing at them. \n     Mortars started dropping from across the Tigris River, to the \n     east, in the direction of a Shiite slum.\n       The only thing that was clear was that no one knew who the \n     enemy was. ``The thing is, we wear uniforms--they don't,'' \n     said Specialist Terry Wilson.\n       At one point the Americans were forced to jog alongside the \n     Strykers on Haifa Street, sheltering themselves as best they \n     could from the gunfire. The Americans finally found the \n     Iraqis and ended up accompanying them into an extremely \n     dangerous and exposed warren of low-slung hovels behind the \n     high rises as gunfire rained down.\n       American officers tried to persuade the Iraqi soldiers to \n     leave the slum area for better cover, but the Iraqis refused \n     to risk crossing a lane that was being raked by machine-gun \n     fire. ``It's their show,'' said Lt. David Stroud, adding that \n     the Americans have orders to defer to the Iraqis in cases \n     like this.\n       In this surreal setting, about 20 American soldiers were \n     forced at one point to pull themselves one by one up a canted \n     tin roof by a dangling rubber hose and then shimmy along a \n     ledge to another hut. The soldiers were stunned when a small \n     child suddenly walked out of a darkened doorway and an old \n     man started wheezing and crying somewhere inside.\n       Ultimately the group made it back to the high rises and \n     escaped the sniper in the alley by throwing out the smoke \n     bombs and sprinting to safety. Even though two Iraqis were \n     struck by gunfire, many of the rest could not stop shouting \n     and guffawing with amusement as they ran through the smoke.\n       One Iraqi soldier in the alley pointed his rifle at an \n     American reporter and pulled the trigger. There was only a \n     click: the weapon had no ammunition. The soldier laughed at \n     his joke.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes \n50 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this report in the New York Times is the \nreason our people are becoming angrier by the day as the war rages on. \nThey expect Congress to be an effective restraint on the President and \nhis misuse of the war power. Opposition to the escalation of the Iraq \nwar is becoming louder. How much clearer does the opposition have to be \nbefore the President finally listens and responds to the voices of the \nAmerican people, the generals, and a bipartisan majority of Congress?\n  General Abizaid doesn't support this escalation. He told the Senate \nArmed Services Committee:\n\n       More American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, \n     from taking more responsibility for their own future.\n\n  GEN James Conway, Commandant of the Marine Corps, doesn't support it. \nHe said:\n\n       We do not believe just adding numbers for the sake of \n     adding numbers--just thickening the mix--is necessarily the \n     way to go.\n\n  Secretary Powell said that he is not ``persuaded that another surge \nof troops in Baghdad for the purpose of suppressing this communitarian \nviolence, this civil war, will work.''\n  GEN Barry McCaffrey, former Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, \nthinks it won't work. He said:\n\n       Putting another 20,000 to 30,000 troops, particularly in \n     urban combat in a city of 7 million Arabs of Baghdad, is a \n     fool's errand. It is sticking your finger in the water. When \n     you pull your finger out, its presence will not have made a \n     difference.\n\n  General Hoar, former head of CENTCOM, told the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee last week:\n\n       The addition of 21,000 troops is too little and too late. \n     This is still not enough to quell the violence, and without \n     major changes in the command and control of forces within \n     Baghdad, the current set-up for shared control is \n     unsatisfactory.\n\n  Passage of the bipartisan resolution approved yesterday by the \nForeign Relations Committee is an important statement about the need \nfor a different course in Iraq, and I will support it. But we cannot \nstop there, especially if the President continues to unilaterally \nimpose his failing policy on an America that has already rejected it. \nCongress has a constitutional duty to stop the President from sending \nmore of our sons and daughters into this civil war. That is why I have \nintroduced legislation that would require the President to get the \nauthority he needs from Congress before moving forward with a further \nescalation in Iraq, and I intend to seek a vote on it.\n  This is a debate about what is best for our troops and our national \nsecurity. Our forces have served with great valor. They have done \neverything they have been asked to do. They have served in Iraq for \nlonger than 4 years, longer than World War II. They have done \neverything they have been asked to do. They have won every battle they \nhave been in, and they have served with great courage and great valor. \nWe owe them. We owe their bravery, their courage, their dedication, and \ntheir commitment to the United States of America a better and fairer \npolicy that will bring them safely home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on the matter directly before the Senate, \nthe Sessions amendment, the amendment bars employers from receiving \nGovernment contracts if they have violated the immigration laws that \nprohibit the hiring of illegal workers. There is no judicial review, \nbut the Attorney General can waive the prohibition or limit the scope \nif it is necessary to the national defense or in the interests of \nnational security. An exemption from the penalty is provided to \nemployers participating in the basic pilot program, the current \nemployer verification system.\n  This amendment bars employers from receiving Government contracts if \nthey violate the immigration laws that prohibit the hiring of illegal \nworkers. I am surprised that is not already the law. We certainly \nshould bar them from receiving lucrative Government contracts and, \ntherefore, I will support this amendment.\n  I do have concerns, however, about continuing to pass piecemeal \nenforcement-only measures without enacting a comprehensive reform \nprogram, and I would express reservations about others.\n  We will have the opportunity in the Senate Judiciary Committee, of \nwhich I happen to be the chairman of the immigration subcommittee at \nthis time, to consider the immigration bill. We welcome the full \nopportunity to debate and discuss those issues in the subcommittee, the \nfull committee, and in the Senate. I will support this amendment and \nwithhold the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S1178]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we want higher wages for American \nworkers. This is important. I would like to see them receive $15, $20, \n$30 an hour, not $7 an hour. I would like to create economic forces to \nwork so the average worker can benefit from that without some sort of \nGovernment wage control. I have voted for minimum wage increases.\n  We are going to move this bill forward, as I understand it, with a \npackage of relief provisions for small businesses, and it will be \npassed. But we are not through yet with some relevant, important \namendments. Is that what my colleagues object to? They certainly did \nnot object to it when the Republicans were moving bills through the \nSenate last year or the year before. Senator Kennedy can file a stack \nof amendments 2 feet thick if he desires. There is nothing wrong with \noffering some amendments, and we will move forward.\n  I will say a couple of things about it. We had amendments in the \nSenate almost every year in recent years--3, 4, 5 years--that would \nhave raised the minimum wage and would have provided relief for small \nbusiness. But the Democratic leadership, to make a political point, \npreferred not to have that and blocked that provision, voting only for \ntheir pure increase of the minimum wage.\n  So we are at this standoff that I think is particularly silly in \nlight of the fact now that the bill we are about to pass, and I suggest \nwill pass, is going to have the same small business relief provisions \nin it that could have been passed last time, last year, or before.\n  I don't appreciate the suggestion that we are here to protect \ncorrupt, greedy, business people. My amendment targets greedy \ncontractors, contractors who go out with Federal taxpayer money, hire \npeople here illegally instead of hiring Americans to do work for the \nU.S. taxpayers. Let's crack down on them. I am glad the Senator \nsupports that. However, I am disappointed that his leadership opposed a \nfar more significant amendment that would have raised the minuscule \n$250 fine on big, greedy businesses that hire illegal workers. Why \nwould they object to that when, in hiring those numbers by the tens or \nhundreds of thousands, we pull down the wages of American citizens? Why \nwould we do that? Who is greedy now? What is wrong with creating a \nlawful system? Why don't we take care of our American workers?\n  Just in the last week there was an article on the front page of the \nWall Street Journal about a chicken plant in Georgia. They raided that \nplant and nearly three-fourths of the workers disappeared. Some were \narrested for being there illegally. The company went out and ran ads in \nthe paper to say they were having new wage increases at the chicken \nplant. They were paying more than $1 an hour more. They sent buses to \nnearby towns to see if people wanted free rides to work. They provided \ndormitories for those who wanted to stay in the dormitory. They went \nthrough unemployment agencies in Georgia. They have already hired 200 \nworkers, mostly African-American citizens, for those jobs. Another 200 \napplications were pending. Don't tell me that if we have a lawful \nsystem of immigration it won't improve significantly the wages of \nAmerican workers.\n  I suggest my colleague from Massachusetts introduce himself to \nProfessor Borjas at Harvard who has written a book on it. He says it \nhas brought down the wages of low-income workers by as much as 8 \npercent, which is $100 per month, or $1,200 per year.\n  I submit these amendments are not irrelevant to our discussion. I \nnote that small businesses do not all get rich. I met the nicest young \nman who opened a restaurant in Mobile, AL. He was working 90-hour weeks \nfor months. He didn't know whether he was going to make it. He was not \nmaking a minimum wage, not in the weeks he started his business. He \nturned it around. Now he works 70-hour weeks and his business seems to \nbe doing well. I hope he makes a lot of money. But he has some \nlegitimate concerns for those small businesses to help him be \nsuccessful. If he failed, a lot of people would not have had jobs.\n  We are coming to the conclusion of the time in which we will vote. \nThis is a good amendment. We ought not have corporations or businesses \ngetting Government contracts and going out and hiring people who are \nillegal to make an extra buck. It is not right. We have a system in \nplace that should be in place for every business in America. It is a \nsystem that we in the Senate follow, the House of Representatives \nfollows, and every Government agency in America follows. But you can \nhire somebody; you go online and you verify their employment legality. \nIt works very well. If the employer does that, they will not be subject \nto penalty under this act.\n  We need to take some real steps in that regard. I believe we can do \nso. We will need to do more of it if we want to protect our workers. \nOne way not to protect the salaries of workers would be to pass the \nbill that was before the Senate that came out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee last year, the Kennedy-McCain bill, that would have added as \nmany as five times the number of people into this country legally as \ncurrently are allowed. As it finally left the Senate, it would have \nincreased by three times the number of people legally in this country. \nThat would have a devastating impact on low-income workers in America. \nWe cannot assimilate that many people that rapidly.\n\n  When we talk about comprehensive reform, let's talk about that. Let's \nsee if we can't do it. Let's do it in a way that protects the \nlivelihoods of the least in our Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent following the \nvote with respect to Sessions amendment No. 148, the Senate resume \nconsideration of Kyl amendment No. 205; there be 10 minutes equally \ndivided between Senator Kyl and Senator Baucus prior to a vote in \nrelation to the amendment, with no second-degree amendment in order \nprior to the vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have an \namendment I have been waiting for some time to try and bring up. I have \na commitment from 6 o'clock to about 6:45.\n  My inquiry is, do the managers of this amendment plan on being around \nhere later this evening so I can have an opportunity to offer that \namendment or can I have an opportunity Friday when we come in to bring \nup my amendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is my understanding we are going to be on this bill \nas far as the eye can see. That is part of my problem on it.\n  Is the Senator's amendment at the desk?\n  Mr. ALLARD. It is at the desk. I am willing to do it tomorrow morning \nif I could just get some time set aside.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have this request at this particular time. We would be \nglad to look at the amendment. I am not familiar with the amendment \nright now. There are a number of others who have asked to be heard. I \nhave been here all day, as well. We are trying to process these \namendments. We have other amendments, but we will do the best we can. I \nplan on being around tomorrow. I don't know if we will be on this bill. \nWe are having the debate on General Patraeus tomorrow. I plan to be \nhere Monday. I plan to be here Tuesday.\n  Mr. ALLARD. As long as I have an opportunity to bring up my \namendment, I would like that opportunity at some point.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator can call it up after the vote. There is no \nproblem. Whether we will dispose of it is a different issue.\n  Mr. ALLARD. With the hope that we could at least get it in the queue?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Certainly.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from Massachusetts?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the hour has arrived and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S1179]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There are now 10 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to the Kyl amendment No. 205. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in 10 minutes we will have a vote on an \namendment which I offered earlier that merely extends the small \nbusiness Tax Code provisions that came out of the Finance Committee, \nwhich were adopted unanimously, from March 31 of next year through \nDecember 31. Everybody recognized that if we could afford to do it, we \nwanted to extend them as long as we could, but the funds were there \nsimply to extend it through March 31. No small business can plan on \nthat short of a timeframe. So I think everybody would agree it is good \npolicy.\n  In the committee, we agreed it was important to extend these \nbenefits. These are primarily the writeoff periods for small business \nleasehold improvements, restaurants, and so on. Restaurants are about \n60 percent of the people who will be receiving the benefits of the \nminimum wage increase and, therefore, these tax benefits clearly are \nimportant to them.\n  It is totally paid for. I hope my colleagues will be willing to \nextend these provisions from March 31 of next year through December 31 \nof next year.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield to Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am committed to the core package that \nwe have a bipartisan agreement for, but within the committee we have \nhad an understanding that if there is an add-on and if it is revenue \nneutral, they would be considered. So we are improving this package, \nthe small business portions of it that nobody has any dispute ought to \nbe done. There is some dispute over the offset. I wish to concentrate \non that offset. It is fully offset. It comes from a proposal that comes \nfrom the Joint Committee on Taxation, not from the Republican side or \nthe Democratic side but a nonpartisan side, that there is an inequity \nin provisions for payment. For instance, if you work for Principal \nFinancial in Des Moines and they pay for your college, it is going to \nbe taxed, but if you work for a university and you send your kids to \ncollege, it is tax free. So Joint Tax sees that as an inequity. We use \nthat as a good offset. It is a good offset. I believe Senator Kyl has \nworked hard to develop an amendment that will make the small business \ndepreciation much better and more meaningful. I hope Members will \nsupport Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have the highest regard for the Senator \nfrom Arizona, as well as my very good friend from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley. They neglected to tell you about the pay-for. First of all, \nthis amendment is moving in the right direction to extend the leasehold \nimprovement. However, in the committee, we tried to get a balanced \npackage that also extends provisions for WOTC and other provisions to \nget it balanced. This amendment addresses one side of the equation. It \nis not balanced because it doesn't extend for the other side of the \nequation, which is the work opportunity tax credit. The primary problem \nI have with this amendment is the pay-for.\n  Essentially this amendment, offered by the Senator from Arizona, \nprevents, to a large degree, parents trying to get a good education for \ntheir kids. These are parents who work for various educational \ninstitutions. It could be kindergarten, high school. It could be a \ncollege. Under current law, a lot of people--janitors, cafeteria \nworkers--take a cut in pay to work for institutions, knowing they will \nget a break in their tuition. This amendment takes that away. This \namendment takes away a tax break for that person who has been working \n8, 10, 15 years at an institution, knowing that his or her child, who \nmay be a junior or sophomore in college, is there to get a good \neducation. This amendment takes that incentive away. It cuts people off \nmidstream. Again, these are not the children of professors. They tend \nto be the children of people who work, the plumbers who work at college \nuniversities, and so forth.\n  This applies to all private education. It could be parochial, \nnonparochial. We all know examples of parents who sacrifice to get \ntheir kids through school. This amendment takes away that break that \nthose parents are now getting.\n  It is not a good thing. Earlier today, we were talking about ways to \nexpand tax credits and incentives for people so they can get an \neducation. This amendment takes away incentives for people to get a \ngood education. It is the wrong amendment. The pay-for is not correct. \nWe should, therefore, not agree to the amendment. At the appropriate \ntime, I will move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, please understand that one of the things my \nfriend from Montana said is not correct. We are not taking away the \n$5,000 benefit that exists for everybody who provides for tuition to be \ntax free. That remains. We are not touching that. All we are saying is \nthat it ought to be the same for the son or daughter of a college \nprofessor as the son or daughter of the manager of the pizza shop. The \nonly one who gets the tuition tax break that is tax free is the son or \ndaughter of the college professor. But if you work for a small business \nand your boss decides to send your child to school, pay the tuition for \nthat child, you could still get that tuition, but you have to pay the \ntax consequences of that; that is a taxable benefit. There should be no \ndifferentiation between working for a small business or a big business, \nfor that matter, or being the son or daughter of a college professor.\n  That is what the bipartisan Joint Tax Committee said. This is totally \nunfair. It is part of the closing of the tax gap because of the \nunfairness between one small group of our society and everybody else. \nAll this does is equalize the tax treatment of the employer providing \nthe tuition free for the student. That pays for what everyone \nrecognizes is a very important extension of the small business \nprovisions of the Finance Committee from March 31 of next year through \nDecember 31 of next year.\n  I urge Members to vote against the motion to table the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is not an omnibus tax bill, it is \nlong overdue legislation to increase the minimum wage. It is not an \nopportunity for Members to present their tax cut\n\n[[Page S1180]]\n\nwish list. It is Congress' opportunity to finally right the wrong of \ndenying millions of hard working minimum wage workers a raise for 10 \nyears.\n  Since the minimum wage was last increased 10 years ago, Congress has \npassed $276 billion dollars in corporate tax breaks. In addition, \nCongress has cut taxes for individuals by more than a trillion dollars, \nwith most of the benefits going to the wealthiest taxpayers.\n  Unfortunately, for some of our Republican colleagues, there never are \nenough tax breaks for the wealthy. They have filed more than twenty \nfive amendments proposing new or expanded tax cuts. Many of them would \ncost billions of dollars.\n  The Republicans are attempting to hold the minimum wage increase \nhostage to their insatiable desire for more and larger tax cuts. It is \na shameless strategy.\n  The Kyl amendment seeks to extend the period of time when businesses \ncan receive accelerated depreciation for leasehold restaurant and \nretail space improvements. The original amendment contained no offset. \nIt would have cost $3 billion dollars.\n  After being told by Democratic leaders that we would oppose any tax \nbreaks that weren't paid for, Senator Kyl changed his amendment to \ninclude an offset.\n  The problem is that the tax benefit he proposes to eliminate is much \nmore worthy than the tax break he is seeking to create. He is proposing \nto eliminate a long-standing tax provision that allows employees of \neducational institutions to receive free tuition for their children. He \nwants to tax that free tuition. This would be a huge tax increase for \nhundreds of thousands of families with very modest incomes. They are \nteachers, food service workers, and maintenance personnel at colleges \nand schools across America. Many of them have worked for years in jobs \nwith lower wages than they could have earned elsewhere in order to \nreceive these educational opportunities for their children. Right now \nmore than 150,000 students are attending college because of these \nbenefits.\n  More than one-fifth of all graduate students in our country receive \nemployer benefits from the schools they attend, including tuition \nreduction. Senator Kyl's amendment would make it more difficult for \nthese students to remain in school as well.\n  To change existing law and suddenly make that free tuition taxable \nwill mean that many of these people can not afford to take advantage of \nthe free tuition. That would be grossly unfair. It would be eliminating \na very legitimate pro-education tax benefit to fund yet another \nbusiness tax break for the same wealthy interests that have already \nreceived so much.\n  At a time when our Nation's competitiveness and the global economy \ndepends on our ability to continue producing high skilled workers, \nmaking it more difficult for students to obtain an education just \ndoesn't make sense.\n  Senator Kyl's amendment would have an ironic result. It would mean \nthat thousands of men and women, who toil at the most difficult jobs at \nour nation's colleges, will have no hope of seeing their children walk \nthrough those college gates themselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 1 minute 49 \nseconds. The Senator from Arizona has 4 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will be brief.\n  The argument by the Senator from Arizona is not apt. It is a false \nanalogy. Why? Because we are talking in the main about parents who \ncurrently are working, who are currently relying upon the current tax \nprovisions. We are not talking about those who may or may not be \nconsidering going to that institution. We are talking about those \ncurrently working there. This will be taken away from them. Some of \nthese people are working hard. They are taking a big cut in pay to work \nat an educational institution so their kids get educated. We are \nsaying: take it away. You have been working there.\n  We are leaving that family high and dry. I think it is the wrong \nthing to do.\n  There is a proper time to deal with these provisions. This is not the \ntime. It is a bad amendment anyway. Let's figure out ways to give \nbenefits for kids to go to school, not to take them away.\n  I yield back my time, move to table the amendment, and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I have introduced a couple of amendments. \nThe reason I have done so is because I think we need to take this \nopportunity to address more than just minimum wage.\n  My good friend from Massachusetts talked a lot about the working men \nand women of this country, but minimum wage does not address all the \nworking men and women in this country. We need to broaden this \nlegislation so we talk about those who are in business for themselves, \nthe small businesspeople. Many times the working men and women of this \ncountry, when they start their business, which I have had a wonderful \nopportunity to do, have to save their money because they have to count \non not making much money their first 2 or 3 years, if they make any at \nall. Then, after 3 years, maybe, if you do a good job and hit the \nmarket right, your business will survive. However, a lot of small \nbusinesspeople fail. So we need to understand, when we talk about the \nworking American men and women of this country, we need to make sure we \nhave legislation that is all inclusive. We need to keep all of them in \nmind when we work on this particular legislation. That is why so many \nof us believe this legislation needs to deal with more than just \nminimum wage. It needs to deal with some regulatory and tax relief for \nsmall businesspeople because they are working men and women in this \ncountry, also.\n  I also rise today to ask the Members of the Senate to support my \namendment, No. 169 to the pending minimum wage bill. It cuts at the \nheart of a rampant problem in this country; that is, identity theft. A \nresolution of this problem has the potential to help small business. On \nMonday, a bipartisan group of Senators and I met with Secretary \nChertoff on this issue. Secretary Chertoff explained that, under \ncurrent law, Government agencies are prevented from sharing information \nwith one another that, if shared, could expose cases of identity theft.\n\n  My amendment tears down the wall that prevents the sharing of \nexisting information among Government agencies. It permits the \nCommissioner of Social Security to share information with the Secretary \nof Homeland Security, where such information is likely to assist in \ndiscovering identity theft, Social Security number misuse or violations \nof immigration law. This is going to help small businesses such as \nconstruction businesses, farmers, ranchers, drywall businesses, \nhorticulture and landscape companies and many more.\n  Specifically, this amendment requires the Commissioner to inform the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, upon discovery of a Social Security \naccount number being used with multiple names, or where an individual \nhas more than one person reporting earnings for him or her during a \nsingle tax year. It seems logical that we would already be doing this, \nbut we are not.\n  In the meantime, identity theft is plaguing innocent victims all \nacross the country. We were reminded of the pervasiveness of this \nproblem by the recent raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement of \nsix Swift and Company meat-packing plants across the country on \nDecember 12, 2006. In total, agents apprehended 1,282 illegal alien \nworkers on administrative immigration violations. Of these, 65 have \nalso been charged with criminal violations related to identity theft or \nother violations.\n  Unfortunately, for the victims--that is the victims of identity \ntheft--by the time the identity theft is discovered, the damage has \nalready been done. Colorado is ranked fifth in the Nation for identity \ntheft, and the citizens of my State of Colorado are no stranger to \nidentity theft.\n  For instance, an 84-year-old Grand Junction woman was deemed \nineligible for Federal housing assistance because her Social Security \nnumber was being used at a variety of jobs in Denver, making her income \ntoo high to qualify because all these individuals had been using her \nI.D. number and it was coming in to Social Security, and when they \nchecked on her income, it was recorded much higher than what she was \nreceiving. If this had been discovered earlier, before she had applied \nfor her housing grants, there would have been fewer victims.\n  Another example is a 10-year-old child in Douglas County who had his \nidentity stolen. His Social Security number was being used at 17 \ndifferent jobs. Now, if this had been discovered earlier, again, we \nwould have had fewer victims.\n  Others get stuck with big tax bills for wages they never earned. \nClearly, theft is an issue that affects people of all ages and walks of \nlife, particularly those working for minimum wage who may struggle to \npay the cost of getting their identity back after it has been stolen. \nAgain, if these cases could have been discovered earlier, then there \nwould have been fewer victims.\n  Yet when the Social Security Administration has reason to believe \nthat a Social Security number is being used fraudulently, they are \nprevented from sharing it with the Department of Homeland Security. \nWithholding this information effectively enables thieves to continue to \nperpetrate the crime of identity theft against innocent victims.\n  Pilot programs such as what was being used at Swift and Company are \nmanaged through the Department of Homeland Security. What they say to\n\n[[Page S1182]]\n\nthe employer is: We will help you verify that the employee's social \nsecurity number is legitimate and it matches the name provided. \nHowever, Secretary Chertoff explained the limitations of the program. \nHe said, if two people are using the same Social Security number at the \nsame time, he can't get the information to recognize it. So when a \nnumber comes in to his agency when he is working with these pilot \nprograms, all he can assure is that the name goes with the Social \nSecurity number. But he can't get the information out of the Social \nSecurity Administration as to whether two people are using the same \nnumber.\n  In some cases, as in the child I mentioned, the same social security \nnumber is being used in as many as 17 different jobs at once. We have \nhad thousands of cases in Colorado where this has happened, where the \nvictim didn't realize that somebody else was using their Social \nSecurity number until they were contacted by the Internal Revenue \nService and told that they weren't reporting all their income, and they \ndiscovered that somebody else was using it at their place of \nemployment.\n  So by simply sharing this information, cases of identity theft could \nbe discovered much sooner. Victims of identity theft deserve to have \nthis information acted on, and my amendment enables this.\n  We have a choice. We can side with the victims or side with the \nthieves. I urge my colleagues to take the side of the victims and enact \nthis commonsense reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert for the Record an \narticle in the Rocky Mountain News entitled ``Owens Wants Action on ID \nTheft.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Rocky Mountain News, July 6, 2006]\n\n                     Owens Wants Action on ID Theft\n\n                           (By David Montero)\n\n       Gov. Bill Owens called upon the legislature Wednesday to \n     require employers to be more diligent when verifying the \n     validity of Social Security numbers of those they hire.\n       On the eve of the legislature's special session to address \n     illegal immigration, Owens rattled off a list of identity-\n     theft transgressions in Colorado and said the current $50 \n     fine levied against businesses who submit false Social \n     Security numbers isn't enough of a deterrent.\n       ``We're going to seek additional penalty from the \n     legislature so that we can actually make this more than a \n     cost of doing business,'' he said.\n       It costs the state more than $50 to levy the fine and \n     prosecute the businesses submitting invalid Social Security \n     numbers, he said.\n       Standing next to Rick Grice, executive director of the \n     Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, Owens said that \n     the numbers related to identity theft in the state are \n     startling.\n       According to Grice's statistics, one Social Security number \n     alone was reported by 57 different employers. Another Social \n     Security number was found to be on the rolls of 50 different \n     businesses.\n       During the first quarter of 2006, 368 Social Security \n     numbers were filed more than six times by 2,828 employers, \n     according to data combed over by Grice's department. Some \n     numbers were obviously phony.\n       ``The false numbers jumped off the pages of the reports by \n     showing such numbers as 333-33-3333 and 444-4--well, you get \n     the picture,'' Grice said.\n       Grice said he didn't know what kind of fine would be useful \n     as a deterrent to employers submitting false Social Security \n     numbers to the Labor Department, but that he suspects any new \n     penalty would begin with a warning to the employer to check \n     all workers' identification.\n       According to data provided by the governor's office, \n     Colorado ranked fifth in the nation in identity-theft cases \n     per 100,000 people.\n       Owens provided examples of identity theft victims--\n     including an 84-year-old woman in Grand Junction who was \n     deemed ineligible for federal housing assistance because her \n     Social Security number was being used in Denver at a variety \n     of jobs, making her income too high to qualify for the \n     housing.\n       He also said a 10-year-old boy in Douglas County had his \n     Social Security number used at 17 different jobs.\n       Owens, who recently signed legislation criminalizing \n     identity theft and authorizing the formation of the Identity \n     Theft Commission, suggested that employers use a federal \n     basic pilot program run by the Social Security Administration \n     and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, saying it is \n     a ``good first step,'' despite some flaws in the system.\n       Donnah Moody, vice president of government affairs at the \n     Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry, said that the \n     pilot program--designed for employers to verify the legality \n     of Social Security numbers--isn't ready yet.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I was unfortunately delayed from voting \non the DeMint amendment No. 158--rollcall vote No. 25.

Mr. President, there was an interview between Wolf \nBlitzer and the President of the United States that was aired this \nmorning on the news. Some of the statements that were made by the Vice \nPresident are very difficult to understand. When he was asked about \nIraq, Vice President Cheney said:\n\n       Bottom line is that we've had enormous successes and we \n     will continue to have enormous successes.\n\n  It is interesting that the Vice President would make this statement \nbarely a week after the President of the United States announced that \nwe are facing a slow failure in Iraq. The President sees a slow \nfailure; the Vice President sees enormous successes.\n  This is not the first time the Vice President has made statements \nwhich defy reality. We can all recall the statements made by him and \nmany others in the administration suggesting the presence of weapons of \nmass destruction, nuclear weapons, suggesting a connection somehow \nbetween Saddam Hussein and the tragedy of 9/11. It turns out that in \neach and every instance the Vice President was wrong.\n  We can also remember that in June of 2005 when we were facing one of \nthe bloodiest, deadliest periods in Iraq, Vice President Cheney said:\n\n       The level of activity that we see today from a military \n     standpoint, I think, will clearly decline. I think they're in \n     their last throes, if you will, of the insurgency.\n\n  Another quote from the Vice President which was not in touch with the \nreality of the war in Iraq.\n  We have had that from the beginning. Whether it was the Vice \nPresident's suggestion--this comes from March 16, 2003:\n\n       Now, I think things have gotten so bad inside Iraq, from \n     the standpoint of the Iraqi people, my belief is we will, in \n     fact, be greeted as liberators.\n\n  I will concede the Vice President later admitted he was wrong in \nmaking that statement.\n  The point I am making is this: If the current Secretary of Defense \nconcedes to our Armed Services Committee that we are not winning this \nwar, if the Baker-Hamilton bipartisan study group comes forward and \nsays the situation is grave and deteriorating, if the President says \nour continued course of action is a slow failure, one has to wonder \nwhere the Vice President is receiving his information.\n  Earlier this morning, I said that he was delusional when it came to \nthis issue. To be delusional is to be out of touch with reality. And I \nbelieve the Vice President has been out of touch with reality when he \nmakes comments such as that.\n  At the least, the American people expect an honest answer about the \nsituation in Iraq. I think what the President has said about a slow \nfailure is an honest appraisal. I think what the Secretary of Defense, \nMr. Gates, said about not winning this war is an honest appraisal. I \nthink the findings of the Baker-Hamilton bipartisan study group that \nthe situation is grave and deteriorating is an honest appraisal of \nreality.\n  This much I will say: The real success in Iraq, if we can point to \nit, is the fact that our brave men and women in uniform have done such \na remarkable job. They have faced extraordinary responsibilities and \nassignments. They came to Iraq, invaded it, deposed that dictator, \nfound him in a hole in the ground and brought him to trial, and\n\n[[Page S1183]]\n\ngave the Iraqi people a chance for free elections and a chance to write \ntheir own Constitution. Those successes which did occur were the result \nof great determination by our troops in uniform and many brave Iraqis \nwho stepped forward and risked their lives to move their nation \nforward.\n  But we all know the situation today. As of this morning, we have lost \n3,057 American soldiers. We know that over 23,000 have returned from \nIraq with injuries, almost 7,000 with serious injuries--amputations, \nblindness, serious burns, traumatic brain injury. Those are the \nrealities of what we face.\n  We also know that the situation on the ground in Iraq is very \ndifficult for most people to understand. When the Prime Minister of \nIraq, Mr. Maliki, says to the President: We don't need additional \ntroops, and the President says we are sending them anyway, when the \ngenerals in the field say that if America continues to send troops, the \nIraqis won't accept the responsibility of defending their country and \nthe administration says we are going to send troops anyway, I think \nthat is evidence that this administration's policy is not connected to \nthe reality of what is on the ground in Iraq. And certainly for the \nVice President to characterize that sad and tragic situation in Iraq \ntoday as an enormous success is not in touch with the reality of what \nour soldiers face and our country faces.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

SMATHERS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, on Monday I have the great \nprivilege of delivering the eulogy at the funeral for Senator George \nSmathers in whose office I had the privilege, as a college student, of \ninterning. As I greet each of our interns in our Senate offices as they \nrotate, I always tell them the story of being an intern, how it had a \nprofound influence on my life because that summer, interning for \nSenator Smathers, I met his son Bruce. Bruce and I then became college \nroommates. After law school and the military, Bruce introduced me to my \nwife, and I returned the favor and introduced Bruce to his wife. And \nhis son, little Bruce, is my godson. So over the years, I have had the \nprivilege of having my life intersecting with the Smathers family, so \nmuch so that when I came to the Senate, I requested that I have the \ndesk of George Smathers.\n  It is with that background that, indeed, it is a great honor for me \nthat the family has asked me to deliver the eulogy. It will be a great \nprivilege for me, next Monday, to recall the great life and times of \nthis great American and great Floridian. I will just mention a couple \nof things in his career. I will elaborate at greater length and will \nintroduce that eulogy into the Record of the Senate after I have given \nit.\n  I wish to mention that was a Senate which had giants with whom all of \nus in my generation grew up--Symington of Missouri and Johnson of Texas \nand Dirksen of Illinois and Mansfield of Montana and, from my State, \nSmathers and Holland.\n  Johnson really relied on Smathers--so much so that when there was a \nvacancy as the assistant majority leader, he asked Smathers to fill in \ntemporarily. And when Senator Johnson, the majority leader, ended up \nhaving his heart attack and was out of work for 7 months, George \nSmathers stood in as the acting majority leader. Upon Senator Johnson's \nreturn, he asked Senator Smathers to be his permanent assistant \nmajority leader. LBJ was not someone who was accustomed to having \nsomeone tell him no, but his friend from Florida told him that he \nshould not do it.\n  I will just mention one other fact. George Smathers, as a young \nCongressman, met Fidel Castro in 1948. Fidel Castro told him that he \nwas going to take over Cuba. That was 11 years before Castro ousted the \nhated dictator Batista. Smathers was always leery of Fidel Castro, and \nhe often warned people, before Castro took over and, in fact, after \nCastro was in. When so many in the world thought he got rid of the \nhated dictator Batista, Smathers said: Watch out, he is going to \nconsolidate power and he is going to become a problem. He was \nprophetic. That is exactly what happened.\n  That was the kind of leadership we had. It is the passing of an era. \nAmerica has lost one of her great leaders, and Florida has lost one of \nits great sons. It is my privilege to bring these remarks to the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders).

Mr. President, for a week now we have had this \nspeculation, the rumors, and then finally the deliberations in front of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee of a resolution disapproving the \nPresident's increase of the forces by 21,000 in Iraq. A resolution was \npassed out on a vote of something like 12 to 9 yesterday. It was \nbipartisan in the passing, but it was basically a partisan vote. Save \nfor one member of the minority on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, all of the minority voted against the resolution. But almost \nto a person, all of the members of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, both sides of the aisle, had expressed their \ndissatisfaction, individually in their statements in front of the \ncommittee, with the President's intention to increase the number of \ntroops, which is already underway, as we know, as we have been reading \nthe commentary in the press.\n  So we have that resolution. Then we have a resolution introduced by \nSenator Warner. This Senator from Florida looks at these two \nresolutions, and they are almost identical. So this Senator is one of \nseveral Senators who has cosponsored both resolutions. This Senator is \none of several Senators who has been trying to bring the two together \nto be folded into one, since it basically, in substance, is the same \nthing in both of them. Yet for one reason or another, that has not been \naccomplished.\n  Therefore, next week, we expect both of those resolutions to come in \nfront of the Senate. At this moment, it looks as if it will be the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee product that will then be amendable \nand I suppose with a substitute amendment. Then we go through all the \namendatory process. Now, that may be the way the Senate will work its \nwill, but it is not necessarily the way it could be done the easiest, \nif we could have great minds come together in a bipartisan way on two \nresolutions that virtually say the same thing.\n  I bring this up simply to say we get so wound around the axle and so \nworked up over the particular number of troops when, in fact, looking \nat the underlying conditions in the Middle East and in Iraq, where \nthere is so much at stake for our country: The oil and gas in that \nregion, the east-west trade routes that go through the area, all of the \ninternational capital investment that is in that region of the world, \nand all of the capital that is produced that flows out of that part of \nthe world--all of that instability in the region, brought about as a \nresult of instability in Iraq, is going to have a major global impact.\n  The former commander, the former combatant commander of the U.S. \nCentral Command, General Tony Zinni, a now retired 4-star Marine \ngeneral who served as the head of Central Command back under the \nClinton administration, has written extensively on this, and he points \nout that there is a complexity we have unleashed by going into Iraq \nthat is not only the Sunni-Shiite conflict but also the Arab-Persian \nconflict. General Zinni, in his upfront, blunt-talking way says:\n\n       There are three options in Iraq: Fix it, contain it, or \n     leave it.\n\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\n\n  And he doesn't feel, and this Senator doesn't feel, that we can take \nthe third option of picking up and leaving it because of the enormous \nconsequences. And if we can't fix it, we have to contain it, but then \nyou are going to have to own that containment and have a containment \nstrategy executed by the United States because the region can't do it \nfor itself. And containment, according to General Zinni, is very messy \nand is probably much tougher in the long run.\n  So perhaps as we discuss next week these two resolutions over the \nissue of 21,000 troops, let's remember that in the long run, for us to \nbe successful in stabilizing Iraq, we have to look to additional issues \nthat have to be solved, such as the economics there, the diplomacy, the \nsecurity--a lot of what the Iraq Study Commission has come forward with \nin their plan. And let's also understand that as we talk about what we \nwant to do to stabilize Iraq in getting the Iraqi security forces able \nto provide their own security, that getting them provided with guns and \nother equipment isn't going to provide the security that you need \nbecause, the Iraqi security forces need civil affairs and psychological \noperations and counterintelligence and intelligence forces. They are \ngoing to have to have civil affairs moving in behind their military \noperations in order to paint buildings and create infrastructure so \nthere will be something positive left behind.\n\n  Remember, the doctrine under Secretary Rumsfeld was ``clear, hold, \nand build.'' The problem was, they cleared an area, but they never held \nit. They never got around to the point of building. General Petraeus \nsaid yesterday in our committee we were going to go in and clear, hold, \nand then we have to be able to build. Whether we talk about 21,000 \ntroops or not, you cannot build in the midst of sectarian violence of \nShia, Sunnis, and the overall Arab-Persian conflict. Until we address \nthese issues, at the end of the day, Iraq is not going to be \nstabilized. In a destabilized society, a priority has to be in \nrebuilding institutions in social, economic, and political areas.\n  One of the things the United States may consider increasing its \nemphasis on, since we have so many agencies of government there all \ndoing their own thing, is an interagency coordinating mechanism to help \nbring everything together so, indeed, ``clear, hold, and build'' has an \nopportunity to be executed and then, hopefully, an opportunity to \nsucceed.\n  I wanted to offer some additional ideas, a lot of which have been \ninspired by General Zinni, someone who understands how to operate in \nthat part of the world as we debate next week the resolutions over \nwhether we would indicate our approval of the President's plan. Maybe \nwhen we debate that, we can debate the deficiencies of not only what \nhas been done in the past but what we have to do in the future in order \nto give that country an opportunity to stabilize.\n  I hope it is not too late. I must say, this Senator feels at times it \nis too late, particularly with these almost 1,500 years of sectarian \nviolence that occurred after the death of Mohammed in the 600s A.D., \nthat it was the rebellion started by his son-in-law that ultimately led \nto the Shiite sect which was born out of rebellion and wanting to get \nrevenge. We have seen that play out over centuries and centuries. \nAgain, we are seeing it play out now in Iraq. But we must be optimists \nand we must try, for the stakes are exceptionally high.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/25/senate-section/article/S1184-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1184-S1185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Judiciary Committee held its \nfirst business meeting of the year. I can now report to the Senate that \nwe have organized our subcommittees, including our creation of a new \nsubcommittee on Human Rights, named our subcommittee chairs and ranking \nmembers, adopted our committee rules and adopted our funding \nresolution. I thank our ranking member, Senator Specter, and all \nmembers of the committee for their cooperation.\n  We were delayed a few weeks by the failure of the Senate to pass \norganizing resolutions on January 4, when this session first began. The \nRepublican caucus had meetings over several days after we were in \nsession before finally agreeing on January 12 to S. Res. 27 and S. Res. \n28, the resolutions assigning Members to Senate committees.\n  The Judiciary Committee has traditionally met on Thursday. \nRegrettably, the delay in Senate organization meant that I could not \nnotice or convene a meeting of the committee the morning of January 11, \nas I had hoped. We devoted the intervening Thursday to our oversight \nhearing with the Attorney General. January 18 was the date the Attorney \nGeneral selected as most convenient for him, and we accommodated him in \nthat scheduling.\n  Today, I can report to the Senate, in accordance with Senate Rule \n26.3, that the Judiciary Committee has, again, designated Thursday \nmornings as our regular meeting days for the transaction of business. \nThe Judiciary Committee has also reported the authorization resolution \nrequired by Senate Rule 26.9. In addition, the Judiciary Committee \nadopted its rules. In accordance with Senate Rule 26.2, I ask that a \ncopy of the rules of the Senate Judiciary Committee be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Rules of Procedure\n\n            UNITED STATES SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n\n\n                      I.

BRINGING A MATTER TO A VOTE\n\n       The Chairman shall entertain a non-debatable motion to \n     bring a matter before the Committee to a vote. If there is \n     objection to bringing the matter to a vote without further \n     debate, a roll call vote of the Committee shall be taken, and \n     debate shall be terminated if the motion to bring the matter \n     to a vote without further debate passes with ten votes in the \n     affirmative, one of which must be cast by the minority.\n\n\n                             V. AMENDMENTS\n\n       1. Provided at least seven calendar days' notice of the \n     agenda is given, and the text of the proposed bill or \n     resolution has been made available at least seven calendar \n     days in advance, it shall not be in order for the Committee \n     to consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any \n     measure under consideration by the Committee unless such\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\n     amendment has been delivered to the office of the Committee \n     and circulated via e-mail to each of the offices by at least \n     5:00 PM the day prior to the scheduled start of the meeting.\n       2.

PROXY VOTING\n\n       When a recorded vote is taken in the Committee on any bill, \n     resolution, amendment, or any other question, a quorum being \n     present, Members who are unable to attend the meeting may \n     submit their votes by proxy, in writing or by telephone, or \n     through personal instructions. A proxy must be specific with \n     respect to the matters it addresses.\n\n\n                           VII. SUBCOMMITTEES\n\n       1. Any Member of the Committee may sit with any \n     Subcommittee during its hearings or any other meeting, but \n     shall not have the authority to vote on any matter before the \n     Subcommittee unless a Member of such Subcommittee.\n       2. Subcommittees shall be considered de novo whenever there \n     is a change in the Subcommittee chairmanship and seniority on \n     the particular Subcommittee shall not necessarily apply.\n       3.

He was \n25 years old.\n  Lieutenant Fritz was raised on his family's farm near Verdon, NE. \nFrom a young age, Lieutenant Fritz knew he wanted to be a leader. After \ngraduating from Dawson-Verdon High School in 2000, he followed through \non this goal. I had the honor of nominating Lieutenant Fritz to the \nU.S. Military Academy at West Point and he graduated from the Academy \nin 2005. His brother, Daniel Fritz, 22, followed in his footsteps and \nis currently in his third year at West Point.\n  Lieutenant Fritz was leading a unit of more than 30 soldiers in Iraq \nsince October. Lieutenant Fritz described his mission as a liaison \nbetween Iraqi police and the U.S. Army. He said the work was \nchallenging but rewarding. Thousands of brave Americans like Lieutenant \nFritz are currently serving in Iraq. We are proud of Lieutenant Fritz's \nservice to our country.\n  In addition to his brother, Lieutenant Fritz is survived by his \nparents Lyle and Noala and his younger brother Ethan.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring 1LT \nJacob Fritz.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/25/senate-section/article/S1185-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1185-S1186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ETHICS REFORM\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the lobbying and \nethics reform bill that the Senate has passed.\n  In the early 1990s, I along with several colleagues, including \nSenator William Cohen, embarked on a journey to enact meaningful \nlobbying and ethics reform. While we had been assured by colleagues \nthat this was a monumental and perhaps impossible undertaking, we \nnonetheless forged ahead. Decade after decade, Congress had tried to \nclose loopholes that had existed for almost 50 years, which kept \nlobbying activities in the dark.\n  In 1995, we finally succeeded in passing the Lobbying Disclosure Act. \nOur bill, for the first time, opened up the world of lobbying, and the \nbillions spent in it, to the light of day. That act required paid \nprofessional lobbyists to register and disclose whom they represent, \nhow much they are paid, and the issues on which they are lobbying.\n  As much as we knew that the Lobbying Disclosure Act was a real step \nforward, we knew that like all procedural reforms, it too would \neventually need updating. Inevitably, lawyers and lobbyists would find \nloopholes and create new methods to dance around the law's intent.\n  We have seen this dance prominently over the past few years. From \nsuper-lobbyist Jack Abramoff's attempts to peddle influence, to \nCongressman Duke Cunningham's abuse of the appropriations process, it \nis obvious that the time to close these loopholes has come.\n  The bill that the Senate just passed brings much needed reforms, many \nof which I sought in the original Lobbying Disclosure Act over a decade \nago. It goes after not only the real problems that have arisen over the \npast few years, but as the perception of corruption that is sometimes \nthe effect of too little disclosure and rules which are too weak.\n  One of the most important reforms in S. 1 is a strict curb on gifts \nby lobbyists to Members of Congress. These are perks that have no place \nin Government. The new rules in this bill will eliminate these gifts.\n  I am also pleased at the final outcome of the strong earmark reform \nprovisions in this bill. Too many earmarks are added in the dead of \nnight or buried in conference reports so dense that the average \nAmerican has no idea where their tax dollars are going. The language \ncan also be ambiguous to the point where we don't even know who is the \nintended beneficiary. This bill will require full and open disclosure \nof earmarks, which I hope will help to ensure the quality of the \nprojects which are funded.\n  Strong travel restrictions are also an essential component of this \nbill. The new rules will ensure that Members traveling on corporate \njets would have to reimburse at the charter rate, not as is now the \ncase merely at the level of a first class commercial ticket.\n  While I applaud passage of these strong reforms, I believe we needed \nto go even further. One of the most important provisions in this bill \nis one that I worked on with Senator Lieberman, which would have \nfinally closed the major loophole that exists under current law that \nallows lobbyists to conceal millions of dollars worth of expenditures \nspent in stimulating ``grassroots'' lobbying efforts, or what has been \ndescribed as ``astroturf'' lobbying.\n  Ten years ago, when we enacted the Lobbying Disclosure Act, it \nrequired paid lobbyists to disclose the amounts that they spend to try \nto influence Congress and the executive branch. However, under the LDA, \nlobbyists are not required to disclose how much they spend in efforts \nto persuade others to help them make their case. In the mid-1990s, the \nWall Street Journal estimated that major lobbying firms spent almost \nhalf a billion dollars every year for this purpose. The amounts have \nundoubtedly grown substantially since then. Yet these amounts still go \nundisclosed on the lobbying disclosure forms filed by those firms. The \ndisclosure provision in S. 1 was intended to close this loophole and \nrequire paid lobbyists to disclose all of their expenditures, instead \nof just some of them.\n  This provision would have had no impact at all on citizens who \ncontact their Government, regardless whether they decide to make those \ncontacts on their own initiative or at the suggestion of others. It \nwould have had no impact on religious organizations, unions, \nuniversities or other employers who suggest that their own members or \nemployees contact the Government. It was aimed at paid lobbyists who \nspend large sums of money to persuade others to contact the Government \nin support of a lobbying campaign that they are conducting on behalf of \na client. These paid lobbyists would have been required to disclose how \nmuch they are\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\nspending on such efforts. This disclosure, like lobbying disclosure in \ngeneral, would have helped inform the public of pressures being brought \nto bear on their representatives by paid interests.\n  Even though identical language was passed by Congress last year when \nwe considered a lobbying reform bill, it was stripped from the final \nversion of this legislation. I nonetheless look forward to examining \nthis issue in the future and hope to work with Chairman Lieberman in \nthe Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee this year to \nlook for solutions to this loophole.\n  I was pleased, however, that a provision I authored last year to \nrequire reporting by foreign lobbyists was included in the final passed \nbill. Foreign lobbyists file their disclosures under the Foreign Agents \nRegistry Act. The forms are difficult to find and almost as hard to \nunderstand. My provision will require a publicly accessible, electronic \ndatabase containing FARA disclosures in the same format that will be in \nplace for registrants under the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\n  A number of scandals over the past few years have shown us that \nethics and lobbying reform are vital. While this bill was not perfect, \nI believe it will go a long way to clean up corruption in Washington. \nThis bipartisan effort in the Senate proves that we are up to the task \nof addressing corruption and perceived corruption in Congress. I am \nhopeful that the House will soon consider its own lobbying reform \nlegislation and that we will have strong provisions signed into law.\n  But signing this legislation into law cannot be the end of our \nefforts. The 12 years since the passage of the Lobbying Disclosure Act \nhave shown the lengths to which some will go to find loopholes in the \nlaw to circumvent the reforms and undermine the safeguards that we have \nenacted. We must remain vigilant to protect the integrity of the \nlegislative process in the coming years and be prepared, if necessary, \nto revisit the issue with future legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/25/senate-section/article/S1186-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMBATING GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one effort that must not be overlooked in \nour fight to combat gun violence, is the work of local law enforcement \nagencies. Detroit's Joshua Project is but one example of the successful \nwork law enforcement agencies are doing all across the country. The \nJoshua Project began in 2004 as a collaborative effort between multiple \nlaw enforcement agencies, to curb gun violence in Detroit's \nSouthwestern 3rd Precinct.\n  The Joshua Project, modeled after programs in several other cities \nincluding Boston, Minneapolis, and Indianapolis, institutes a zero \ntolerance policy when a gang member commits any type of gun violence. \nAny gang member's use of a gun results in strict and sustained law \nenforcement attention for everyone in the gang. The project also seeks \nto deter gun violence by increased monitoring of probationers and \nparolees through the use of unscheduled home visits and mandatory call-\nin meetings. So far over 2,000 former offenders have been called in and \nnearly 3,000 home checks have been conducted. These measures give law \nenforcement officials the opportunity to proactively intervene in a \nhigh-risk offender's life before another crime is committed.\n  The implementation of the program relies on an innovative partnership \nbetween the Detroit Police Department, the Attorney General's Office \nand Michigan Department of Corrections, along with the assistance of \nthe State courts. Community involvement also plays a critical role in \noffering both ideas and solutions within the Joshua Project. Community \norganizations provide assistance, support and counseling to offenders.\n  Within the first 17 months after the Joshua Project was implemented, \nshootings in Detroit's 3rd precinct decreased almost 33 percent and gun \nrelated homicides dropped nearly 40 percent. As a result of this \nsuccess, Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, Attorney General Mike Cox, and \nGovernor Jennifer Granholm announced this past summer that the Joshua \nProject would be expanded to Detroit's 2nd precinct.\n  Mayor Kilpatrick said of this expansion:\n\n       We are most successful in our fight against crime when we \n     maximize the strengths of our law enforcement partners \n     throughout the country and state. Our partnership with the \n     Attorney General has reduced gun violence and has saved lives \n     in southwest Detroit. By expanding this program, we hope to \n     build upon our current successes and make the neighborhoods \n     of the second precinct as safe, if not safer, than we have in \n     the third precinct.\n\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all State and local \nlaw enforcement officials for their continued service and vital \ncontributions in ensuring the safety of our communities. I am hopeful \nthe 110th Congress will support their efforts by taking up and passing \nsensible gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/25/senate-section/article/S1186-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1186-S1187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ``BILL'' WOOLF\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to one of \nthe longest tenured members of my Senate staff, Mr. William ``Bill'' \nWoolf. Bill will retire from U.S. Senate employment at the end of \nJanuary, after 20 years of exceptional service to the citizens of this \ncountry and to the residents of the State of Alaska.\n  Bill was born in Washington State and studied at Washington State \nUniversity and the University of Alaska in Juneau. Growing up in the \ncountry, he developed an early and lasting love of the outdoors--\nboating, fishing, and hunting--even before moving to the Last Frontier \nin 1974.\n  He has served as my legislative assistant for fisheries, science, and \ntransportation issues since I entered the Senate in 2002. Prior to \nthat, he worked for the ``other Senator Murkowski'' for 15 years. While \nI love to catch and eat Alaska' salmon, halibut, crab, and pollock, \nBill truly knows not only the biology but also the economic intricacies \nof both sport and commercial fishing and game management issues. Over \nthe years, he has become an expert in wildlife and fishery biology and \nmanagement, dedicating himself to protecting and expanding fish and \ngame stocks not just in Alaska but nationwide.\n  Bill moves easily among scientists, government officials, fishermen, \nand business. He has gained a reputation as a dedicated and \nknowledgeable advocate for sound, scientific fishery and wildlife \nmanagement and quality resource development.\n  He has worked tirelessly to help perfect and protect the regional \nfishery management process, encompassed in the Magnuson-Stevens \nFisheries Conservation and Management Act. Despite never serving with a \nmember of the Commerce Committee, Bill has been influential in many of \nthe fisheries laws passed by this body, dealing with subjects as \ndiverse as reflagging of foreign processing ships, banning the use of \nlarge-scale driftnets on the high seas, improving safety and quality \ninspection techniques for fish products, allowing fishermen greater \ncontrol over secondary market pricing, providing for country of origin \nseafood labeling, and encouraging action to allow ``organic'' labeling.\n  He also worked with the State Department and others to implement \ninternational agreements on fisheries in the central Bering Sea and the \nSea of Okhotsk, protection of salmon in the North Pacific, successful \nnegotiations with Canada of the Pacific Salmon Treaty, and many others. \nHe is particularly proud of having drafted, presented, and worked with \nthe staff of U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright to achieve U.N. General \nAssembly approval for the very first international resolution to \ncontrol bycatch and waste in fisheries worldwide.\n  Bill, however, has not focused solely on fisheries. Over the years, \nhis range of issues has cut across many lines, involved many \ndisciplines, and a wide range of science, transportation, and other \nissues for the Alaska congressional delegation. Among his \naccomplishments were writing the first comprehensive law to control \nwastewater discharges from cruise ships in Alaska, advising the U.S. \nArctic Research Commission, representing Alaska's interests in staff \nnegotiations on the Water Resources Development Act, and working long \nhours and weekends to ensure that the Highway Reauthorization passed by \nthe 109th Congress would help bring Alaska's road system into the 21st \ncentury. He also helped organize and staffed a Senate Coast Guard \nCaucus for several years.\n  After the 2005 hurricanes devastated the gulf coast, he was the key \ninfluence\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\nbehind the successful formation of the Alaska Fishing Industry Relief \nMission. This nonprofit corporation moved important equipment all the \nway from Alaska to Louisiana and Mississippi--including both a 60-ton \ncapacity boat lift and a 30-ton per day ice making machine, both were \ncritically needed to get the gulf coast fishing industry back in play. \nThe formation of the caucus and mission are a lasting testament to \nBill's good judgment, hard work, and dedication to intelligently build \nthis Nation's ports and harbors infrastructure and to care for those \nwho depend on them.\n  I also want to mention that Bill started his career as a broadcaster, \ngeneral manager, news director, correspondent and producer for radio \nand television stations in Alaska, Washington, and Oregon. He also \nserved a stint as a Senate press secretary and communications' director \nfor the chairman of the Intelligence Committee during the first Persian \nGulf war. He understands how important it is for Congress to \ncommunicate its policies to the citizens of America and fully explain \nwhy we take the actions that we do.\n  While I am sorry to lose one of my staff leaders, I am happy that he \nwill be able to more fully enjoy some of his other interests: \nwoodworking, motorcycling, fishing, hunting, his collection of Alaskan \nand Asian art, and his beloved German shepherd dogs.\n  I will miss Bill's hard work, vast knowledge, good humor, and sound \njudgment. It has been a pleasure to have him on my staff. I wish him \nand his wife Karen the very best and know that Alaskans will benefit \nfor decades to come from his efforts to protect and enhance this Nation \nnatural and biological resources and the environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/25/senate-section/article/S1187-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF TADD FUJIKAWA\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish to give praise and \ncongratulations to Tadd Fujikawa, a 16-year-old sophomore from Moanalua \nHigh School, who on Friday, January 12, made golf history for the State \nof Hawaii. By shooting a 4-under-par 66 during the second round of the \nSony Open at the Waialae Country Club, Tadd became the youngest player \nin 50 years to make the cut at a PGA tour event.\n  Tadd demonstrated amazing skill and focus on the course. Despite \nstanding just five feet, one inch tall, his 285-yard drives and \naccurate iron play propelled him up the tournament leaderboard. In the \nend, he tied for 20th place, besting some of the world's premier \ngolfers.\n  Tadd's drive and competitive spirit may be a result of his early \nstruggles as a premature baby. At birth, Tadd weighed less than two \npounds and was given a 50 percent chance of survival. He didn't just \nsurvive, he flourished. Last year, at age 15, he became one of the \nyoungest players ever to compete in golf's national championship, the \nU.S. Open. Also impressive are Tadd's exploits in the sport of judo, \nwhere he has won four junior national titles.\n  I offer my most sincere congratulations, to Tadd Fujikawa, for his \nexceptional performance in the Sony Open. May he take away from this \nexperience the confidence to do great things, as he has already shown \nthe potential to achieve them. I wish Tadd the best in all that he \nchooses to undertake in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/25/senate-section/article/S1187-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1187-S1188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-445.

A bill to prohibit the sale by the Department of Defense of \nparts for F-14 fighter aircraft; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to light an important \nissue which threatens our national security and begs the attention of \nCongress. The legislation I propose today seeks to end the Iranian \ngovernment's acquisition of sensitive military equipment by blocking \nthe Pentagon's sale of F-14 fighter jet parts.\n  It is the sensitive job of the Department of Defense to demilitarize \nand auction off surplus military equipment. However, recent \ninvestigations and reports have uncovered a frightening trend regarding \nthe sale of F-14 ``Tomcat'' aircraft parts. U.S. customs agents have \ndiscovered F-14 parts being illegally shipped to Iran by brokers who \nbought F-14 surplus equipment from Department of Defense auctions.\n  Other than the United States, Iran is the only Nation to fly the F-\n14. The U.S. allowed Iran to buy 79 F-14s before its revolution in \n1979. Fortunately, most of Iran's F-14s are currently grounded for lack \nof parts.\n  We know that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons capability. We know \nthat the Department of State has identified Iran as the most active \nstate sponsor of terrorism. We know that the sale of spare parts for F-\n14s could make it more difficult to confront the nuclear weapons \ncapability of Iran. And yet F-14 parts are still being sold by the DoD.\n  Iran's F-14s, especially with the parts to get more of them airborne, \ngreatly strengthen its ground war potential, harming our national and \nglobal security. Our country should be doing everything possible to \ndeny the brutal regime in Tehran access to spare parts for their F-14 \nfleet.\n  The Department of Defense will tell you that it is already taking \naction to control the sale of F-14 parts. A few times a year they \nchange the restriction on the sale of F-14 parts. But history has shown \nus that these rules are not enough. The Department has been caught \nstill selling F-14 parts, even when its rules forbid it. It has sold F-\n14 parts to companies that have turned out to be fronts for the \nIranians. More recently, the DoD sold sensitive technology, including \nclassified F-14 parts to undercover GAO investigators.\n  My intention with this bill is to make it crystal clear to the \nDepartment of Defense that it may not sell any F-14 parts to anyone for \nany reason. There should be no chance for the parts to make their way \nto the Iranians.\n  Additionally, my bill would prohibit the export of any F-14 parts \nthat have already been sold. This prevents the parts from ending up in \nIran through even the most roundabout route.\n  I am not trying to reform the entire military surplus sales process. \nI am confident that the Armed Services Committee will continue its \ninvestigations and propose some much needed changes. My bill would \nsimply fix a very specific, but very important, problem: the sale of F-\n14 components that end up in the hands of Iran.\n  I urge the members of the Senate to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 387\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Arming Iran Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON SALE BY DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OF PARTS \n                   FOR F-14 FIGHTER AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense is responsible for \n     demilitarizing and auctioning off sensitive surplus United \n     States military equipment.\n       (2) F-14 ``Tomcat'' fighter aircraft have recently been \n     retired, and their parts are being made available by auction \n     in large quantities.\n       (3) Iran is the only country, besides the United States, \n     flying F-14 fighter aircraft and is purchasing surplus parts \n     for such aircraft from brokers.\n       (4) The Government Accountability Office has, as a result \n     of undercover investigative work, declared the acquisition of \n     the surplus United States military equipment, including parts \n     for F-14 fighter aircraft, to be disturbingly effortless.\n       (5) Upon the seizure of such sensitive surplus military \n     equipment being sold to Iran, United States customs agents \n     have discovered these same items, having been resold by the \n     Department of Defense, being brokered illegally to Iran \n     again.\n       (6) Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons capability, and the \n     Department of State has identified Iran as the most active \n     state sponsor of terrorism.\n       (7) Iran continues to provide funding, safe haven, \n     training, and weapons to known terrorist groups, including \n     Hizballah, HAMAS, the Palestine Islamic Jihad, and the \n     Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n       (8) The sale of spare parts for F-14 fighter aircraft could \n     make it more difficult to confront the nuclear weapons \n     capability of Iran and would strengthen the ground war \n     capability of Iran. To prevent these threats to regional and \n     global security, the sale of spare parts for F-14 fighter \n     aircraft should be prohibited.\n       (b) Prohibition on Sale by Department of Defense.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     and except as provided in paragraph (2), the Department of \n     Defense may not sell (whether directly or indirectly) any \n     parts for F-14 fighter aircraft, whether through the Defense \n     Reutilization and Marketing Service or through another agency \n     or element of the Department.\n       (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect \n     to the sale of parts for F-14 fighter aircraft to a museum or \n     similar organization located in the United States that is \n     involved in the preservation of F-14 fighter aircraft for \n     historical purposes.\n       (c) Prohibition on Export License.--No license for the \n     export of parts for F-14 fighter aircraft to a non-United \n     States person or entity may be issued by the United States \n     Government.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. \n        Cornyn):\n  S. 389. A bill to increase the number of Federal judgeships, in \naccordance with recommendations by the Judicial Conference, in \ndistricts that have an extraordinarily high immigration caseload; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DOMENICIl. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat authorizes the Federal judgeships recommended by the 2005 Judicial \nConference for our U.S. District Courts that are overloaded with \nimmigration cases.\n  It is imperative to equip our Federal agencies with the assets they \nneed to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws, including \ncourts which must adjudicate criminal immigration cases that appear on \ntheir dockets. This includes our U.S. District Courts, which must try \nrepeat immigration law violators who are charged with a felony in U.S. \nDistrict Court.\n  The legislation I am introducing today creates eleven new Federal \njudgeships recommended by the Judicial Conference for the four U.S. \nDistricts in which more than 50 percent of their criminal cases are \nimmigration cases. Each of these Districts shares a border Mexico.\n  In fiscal year 2004, the Western District of Texas had 5,599 criminal \ncase filings, 3,688 of those cases, or 65 percent, dealt with \nimmigration. The District Court of Arizona had 4,007 criminal filings, \nof which 2,404 cases, that's 59 percent, were immigration filings. The \nSouthern District of California had 2,206 immigration filings, 64 \npercent of the 3,400 total criminal filings. Lastly, the District of \nNew Mexico had 2,497 criminal filings, 60 percent, or 1,502 cases, were \nimmigration cases.\n  Based on these caseloads, we should already be giving these Districts \nnew judgeships. But to increase border security and immigration \nenforcement efforts, as we have over the past few years, without \nequipping these courts\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\nto handle the even larger immigration caseloads that they are expected \nto face would amount to willful negligence.\n  The New Mexico District Chief Judge, Martha Vazquez, wrote me a \nletter in May of 2006 about the situation her District faces. Judge \nVazquez wrote: ``As it is, the burden on Article III Judges in this \nDistrict is considerable. This District ranks first among all districts \nin criminal filings per judgeship: 405 criminal filings compared to the \nnational average of 87. As in all federal districts along the southwest \nborder, the majority of cases filed in this District relate to \nimmigration offenses under United States Code, Title 8 and drug \noffenses arising under Title 21. Immigration and drug cases account for \neighty-five percent of the caseload in the District of New Mexico. . . \n. In fiscal year 1997, there were 240 immigration felony filings in the \nDistrict of New Mexico. By fiscal year 2005, the number of immigration \nfelony filings increased to 1,826, which is an increase of 661 \npercent.''\n  The Albuquerque Tribune has also documented the burden on our \nSouthwest border District Courts. An April 17, 2006 article entitled \n``Judges See Ripple Effect of Policy on Immigration,'' stated: ``U.S. \nDistrict Chief Judge Martha Vazquez of Santa Fe oversees a court that \nfaces a rising caseload from illegal border crossings and related \ncrime. And help from Washington is by no means certain. . . . From \nSept. 30, 1999 to Sept. 30, 2004 (the end of the fiscal year), the \ncaseload in the New Mexico federal district court increased 57.5 \npercent, from 2,804 to 4,416. In the 2004 fiscal year alone, 2,126 \nfelony cases were heard, almost half of all cases in the entire 10th \nCircuit, which includes Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. \nMost typical immigration cases go before an immigration judge, and the \nsubjects are deported. But people deported once and caught crossing \nillegally again can be charged with a felony. And that brings the \ndefendant into federal district court. Those are the cases driving up \nNew Mexico's caseload . . . Some days as many as 90 defendants crowd \nthe courtroom in Las Cruces. . . . The same problems are afflicting \nfederal border courts in Arizona, California, and Texas.''\n  Similar problems were documented in the May 23, 2006 Reuters article \n``Bush Border Patrol Plan to Pressure Courts'' which said: ``President \nGeorge W. Bush's plan to send thousands of National Guard troops to the \nU.S.-Mexico border could spark a surge in immigration cases and U.S. \ncourts are ill prepared to handle them. . . . Even without the stepped-\nup security at the border, federal courts in southern California, \nArizona, New Mexico and Texas have been overburdened. Carelli [a \nspokesman for U.S. federal courts] said those five judicial districts, \nout of 94 nationwide, account for 34 percent of all criminal cases \nmoving through U.S. courts. . . . Most immigrants caught crossing \nillegally are ordered out of the country without prosecution. But that \nstill leaves a growing pile of cases involving illegals who are being \nprosecuted after being caught multiple times or those accused of other \ncrimes. Nationwide, each U.S. judge handles an average of 87 cases a \nyear. But along the southern border, even before Bush's plan moves \nforward, the average is around 300 per judge, Carelli said.''\n  Lastly, I recently heard first-hand about this problem from a Federal \njudge in New Mexico. He told me that he travels almost 200 miles to \nhear cases in Southern New Mexico. Many of the situations he sees \ninvolve mass arraignments because there are so many defendants in the \nsystem. He is not alone in this arrangement; other Federal judges drive \nalmost 300 miles to hear cases in the Southern part of my home State. \nThis is a dire situation that must be addressed.\n  The United States Congress must address the overwhelming immigration \ncaseload our southwestern border U.S. District Courts face. The bill I \nam introducing today does that by authorizing the nine permanent and \ntwo temporary judgeships recommended by the 2005 Judicial Conference \nfor the four U.S. Districts in which the immigration caseloads total \nmore than 50 percent of those Districts' total criminal caseload.\n  I ask unanimous consent that-the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 389\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADDITIONAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGESHIPS.\n\n       The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate, such additional district court judges \n     as are necessary to carry out the 2005 recommendations of the \n     Judicial Conference for district courts in which the criminal \n     immigration filings represented more than 50 percent of all \n     criminal filings for the 12-month period ending September 30, \n     2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 390. A bill to direct the exchange of certain land in Grand, San \nJuan, and Uintah Counties, Utah, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to reintroduce \nthe Utah Recreational Land Exchange Act of 2007, together with my \ncolleague Senator Hatch. This legislation will ensure the protection of \ncritical lands along the Colorado River corridor in southeastern Utah \nand will help provide important funding for Utah's school children.\n  In Utah, we treasure our children's education. A key component of our \neducation system is the 3.5 million acres of school trust lands \nscattered throughout the State. Upon Utah's admission to the Union in \n1896, these lands were dedicated to support public education. Revenue \nfrom the trust lands, whether from grazing, forestry, surface leasing, \nor mineral development, is placed in the State School Fund. This fund \nis a permanent, income-producing endowment created by Congress to fund \nUtah's public education. Unfortunately, the majority of these lands are \nsurrounded by public lands, making responsible management very \ndifficult. It is critical to both the State of Utah and the Bureau of \nLand Management that we consolidate their respective lands to ensure \nthat both public agencies are permitted to fulfill their mandates.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is yet another chapter in \nour State's long history of consolidating these State lands for the \nfinancial well-being of our education system. These efforts allow the \nFederal land management agencies to consolidate public lands in \nenvironmentally-sensitive areas that can then be reasonably managed. We \nsee this exchange as a win-win solution for the State of Utah and its \nschool children, as well as the Department of the Interior, the \ncaretaker of our public lands.\n  In 1998, Congress passed the first major Utah school trust land \nexchange which consolidated hundreds of thousands of acres. Again in \n2000, Congress enacted an exchange consolidating another 100,000 acres. \nI was proud to play a role in those efforts, and the bill we are \nintroducing today is yet another step in the long journey toward \nfulfilling the promise Congress made to Utah's school children in 1896.\n  Utah's School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration manages \nsome of the most spectacular lands in America, located along the \nColorado River in southeastern Utah. This legislation will ensure that \nplaces like Westwater Canyon of the Colorado River, the world famous \nKokopelli and Slickrock biking trails, some of the largest natural rock \narches in the United States, wilderness study areas, and viewsheds for \nArches National Park will be traded into Federal ownership and for the \nbenefit of future generations. At the same time, the school children of \nUtah will receive mineral and development lands that are not \nenvironmentally-sensitive, and where responsible development makes \nsense. This will be an equal value exchange, with approximately 40,000 \nacres exchanged on both sides, giving taxpayers and the school children \nof Utah a fair deal. Moreover, the legislation establishes a common-\nsense valuation process for resources that are often either overlooked \nor overvalued because of their highly-speculative nature.\n  This legislation represents a truly collaborative process that has \nincluded local governments, the State, the recreation and environmental \ncommunities, and other interested parties. We\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\nalso worked closely with the Department of the Interior on proper \nvaluation in the appraisal of the lands. In a hearing held before the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on May 24, 2006, the \nDepartment of the Interior expressed their support for the bill and \nsaid that this land exchange will resolve management issues, improve \npublic access, and facilitate greater resource protection. We look \nforward to working with the appropriate committees toward a successful \nresolution of this proposed exchange during this Congress.\n  I ask my colleagues to support our effort to fund the education of \nour children in Utah and to protect some of this nation's truly great \nland. I urge support of the Utah Recreational Land Exchange Act of \n2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 392. A bill to ensure payment of United States assessments for \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations for the 2005 through 2008 time \nperiod; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to ensure \nthat the United States does not fall further into debt at the United \nNations, and to pay the debt that we have accrued since January 1, \n2006.\n  For over a year, we have not been paying our full contribution to the \nU.N. for its peacekeeping operations--for missions in places like \nLebanon, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Kosovo--that \nadvance our national interests and spread the burden of keeping the \npeace among other nations. We are approximately $80 million in debt, \nand the number grows every month as new bills come in for peacekeeping \noperations.\n  Here is why.\n  In 1994, Congress passed a law limiting U.S. payments for U.N. \npeacekeeping at 25 percent after fiscal year 1995. The United Nations \ncontinued to bill the United States at 31 percent. As a result, a debt \naccrued--that is, the gap between the 25 percent allowed under U.S. \nlaw, and the 31 percent we were charged by the U.N.\n  In 1999, when Congress approved the ``Helms-Biden'' law, it \nauthorized the repayment of U.S. arrears to the U.N. conditioned on \ncertain reforms in the U.N. system. One of those reforms was a \nnegotiated reduction of the U.S. peacekeeping rate down to 25 percent. \nThrough negotiations in 2000, U.S. Ambassador Holbrooke succeeded in \nreducing the U.S. assessments for peacekeeping to just over 27 percent.\n  In 2001, Congress amended the Helms-Biden law to allow the arrears \npayments to be provided to the U.N., even though Ambassador Holbrooke \nhad not reached the target of 25 percent. But the original 1994 law \nlimiting our payments to 25 percent was never repealed.\n  In the past few years, Congress has amended the 1994 law on a \ntemporary basis by raising the 25 percent limitation to conform it to \nthe rate negotiated by Ambassador Holbrooke, but the most recent \ntemporary change in law expired on December 31, 2005.\n  Therefore, the law today is this: the United States may not pay more \nthan 25 percent for peacekeeping, even though the United Nations \nassesses the United States at a higher rate.\n  Mr. President this is a problem. At a time when our government \ncontinues to seek important reforms at the United Nations, it is a \nmistake for us to continue to fall short on our dues. Rather than \nencourage reform, it may give other countries an excuse to avoid it. \nHow can we, in good faith, fail to pay our bills while at the same time \npush the U.N. to get its financial house in order?\n  More important, U.N. peacekeeping operations advance America's \nnational security. If the U.N. didn't do them, we might have to do so. \nThe U.N. `blue helmets' are literally on the front lines in conflicts \nthat are the worst of the worst: protecting civilians, monitoring \ncease-fires, clearing mine fields, and disarming combatants. Right now, \nthe United States continues to seek support at the U.N. for a robust \nmission in Darfur. We have voted time and again in the Security \nCouncil, and rightfully so, to support these critical missions.\n  Through U.N. peacekeeping, the U.S. contributes to international \npeace and stability where we have critical foreign policy interests, \nwhile sharing the human, political and financial costs with other \nnations. We should not shortchange these operations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 393. A bill to transfer unspent funds for grants by the Office of \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services, the Office of Justice Programs, \nand the Office on Violence Against Women to the Edward Byrne Memorial \nJustice Assistance Grant Program; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nrestore critical funding to one of our Nation's most effective drug \nenforcement tools, the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant \nProgram. My bill, the Emergency Local Law Enforcement Byrne Assistance \nAct of 2007, will bring a desperately needed infusion of cash into this \ncritical local law enforcement assistance program.\n  The Byrne grant program provides funding for local drug task forces \nall over the country. These local drug task forces are critical to \ncreating regional cooperation and to fighting the manufacture, \ndistribution, and use of methamphetamine.\n  A survey by the Iowa Office of Drug Control Policy found that in \nfiscal year 2004 Byrne JAG dollars funded 4,316 police officers and \nprosecutors working on 764 drug enforcement task forces. The study also \nfound that Byrne JAG funding led to 221,000 arrests in 45 states, the \nseizure of 5.5 million grams of methamphetamine, and the breakup of \nalmost 9,000 methamphetamine labs.\n  Yet the program has suffered draconian cuts over the past 4 years. \nBetween 2003 and 2006 the President and the Attorney General have \nrefused to provide a single dollar for Byrne local law enforcement \nfunding. As a result, funding for the Byrne program has been slashed by \nalmost 60 percent from $1 billion dollars in 2003 to just $416 million \nin 2006.\n  I hear on a weekly basis from Sheriffs and other law enforcement \nofficials in Iowa how hard these cuts are hitting them. Over the past \nyear, Iowa has had to absorb a 42 percent cut in Byrne funding. That \ntranslates to less law enforcement officers and less regional \ncooperation in finding and stopping that meth that continues to flood \nthe State of Iowa. I recently heard from Story County Sheriff Paul \nFitzgerald that his agency alone will lose two drug task force agents \nthis year, a statistic that is being repeated in almost every county \nacross my State.\n  The anecdotal evidence from Iowa law enforcement is clearly reflected \nat the national level. The Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform \nCrime Reports recently found that violent crime in the United States \nincreased 2.5 percent in 2005, and an additional 3.7 percent in the \nfirst half of 2006, the largest increase in 15 years! The increase was \nmuch more severe in the meth plagued Midwest with violent crime up 5.7 \npercent in 2005.\n  You don't need a side by side chart to understand the connection \nbetween drastic reductions in federal funding for local law enforcement \nand rising crime rates!\n  At the same time, a recent report by the Department of Justice \nInspector General found that the Department of Justice has not been \ndoing a particularly effective job of administering the grants within \nits jurisdiction. The Inspector General found that just over $170 \nmillion expired grant funding is sitting at DOJ. Some of this funding \nis for grants that expired as long as five years ago!\n  My bill simply takes this unused money and puts it into the Byrne \ngrant program. Specifically, the legislation transfers all balances on \nCOPS and Office of Justice Program grants that have been expired for \nmore than 90 days and all Office of Violence Against Women grants that \nhave been expired for more than 2 years, to the Byrne JAG program for \nfiscal year 2007. These expired grant funds are currently sitting in \nDOJ coffers and cannot legally be used by the grantee, and the funds \nwould ultimately revert to the treasury. My bill instead puts the money \nto good use in offsetting some of the most drastic consequences of cuts \nto the Byrne program.\n  While reallocating these amounts to Byrne JAG will make only a dent \nin the massive budget cuts of recent years, the Emergency Local Law \nEnforcement Byrne Assistance Act of 2007 is an important first step and \nsends an immediate message to line officers\n\n[[Page S1193]]\n\noverwhelmed by the unstoppable flow of meth into our States that we are \ngoing to help.\n  I am hopeful that in this new Congress the President and the Congress \nwill more adequately fund crucial law enforcement programs like Byrne \nJAG. In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to join me in demonstrating \na commitment to local law enforcement and to our continuing fight \nagainst methamphetamine by coming together to quickly pass the \nEmergency Local Law Enforcement Byrne Assistance Act of 2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 393\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Local Law \n     Enforcement Byrne Assistance Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A report by the Inspector General of the Department of \n     Justice documents that the Office of Justice Programs, the \n     Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, and the \n     Office on Violence Against Women of the Department of Justice \n     have failed to close out and deobligate over $160,000,000 in \n     expired grant funds and that these funds have not been \n     redirected to other programs or returned to the Treasury.\n       (2) Between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2006, funding \n     for the formula grant program of the Edward Byrne Memorial \n     Justice Assistance Grant Program under subpart 1 of part E of \n     the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 \n     U.S.C. 3750 et seq.) has been reduced by over 50 percent, \n     from $900,000,000 to $416,000,000.\n       (3) According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     Uniform Crime Reports, violent crime in the United States \n     increased 2.5 percent in 2005, and an additional 3.7 percent \n     in the first half of 2006. In the Midwest, which continues to \n     struggle with a methamphetamine epidemic, violent crime \n     increased 5.7 percent between 2004 and 2005.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNSPENT GRANTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--All amounts described in subsection (b) \n     shall be transferred for use for grants under the formula \n     grant program of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \n     Grant Program under subpart 1 of part E of the Omnibus Crime \n     Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3750 et \n     seq.), to remain available until expended.\n       (b) Amounts Covered.--The amounts described in this \n     subsection are any unexpended amounts for--\n       (1) any covered grant administered by the Office of \n     Community Oriented Policing Services;\n       (2) any covered grant administered by the Office of Justice \n     Programs; and\n       (3) any covered grant administered by the Office on \n     Violence Against Women for which the grant expired not less \n     than 2 years before the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``covered \n     grant'' means a grant--\n       (1) that has expired but has not been closed out; or\n       (2)(A) that has expired and been closed out; and\n       (B) the remaining funds of which have not been deobligated.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Levin, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \n        Menendez):\n  S. 394. A bill to amend the Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter Act \nof 1958 to ensure the humane slaughter of nonambulatory livestock, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues, \nSenators Ted Stevens, R-AK, Carl Levin, D-MI, Susan Collins, R-ME, \nFrank Lautenberg, D-NJ, John Kerry, D-MA, Barbara Boxer, D-CA, Dianne \nFeinstein, D-CA, and Robert Menendez, D-NJ to introduce the Downed \nAnimal and Food Safety Protection Act of 2007, legislation intended to \nprotect people from the unnecessary spread of disease. This bill, which \nhas bipartisan support, would prohibit the use of nonambulatory animals \nfor human consumption.\n  Nonambulatory animals, also known as downed animals, are livestock \nsuch as cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or other equines \nthat are too sick to stand or walk unassisted. Many of these animals \nare dying from infectious diseases and present a significant pathway \nfor the spread of disease.\n  The safety of our Nation's food supply is of the utmost importance. \nWith the presence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, also known \nas mad-cow disease, and other strains of transmissible spongiform \nencephalopathies, TSE, which are related animal diseases found not only \nin nearby countries but also in the United States, it is important that \nwe take all measures necessary to ensure that our food is safe.\n  Currently, before slaughter, the United States Department of \nAgriculture's, USDA, Food Safety Inspection Service, FSIS, diverts \ndowner livestock only if they exhibit clinical signs associated with \nBSE. Routinely, BSE is not correctly distinguished from many other \ndiseases and conditions that show similar symptoms. The ante-mortem \ninspection that is currently used in the United States is very similar \nto the inspection process in Europe, which has proved to be inadequate \nfor detecting BSE. Consequently, if BSE were present in a U.S. downed \nanimal, it could currently be offered for slaughter. If the animal \nshowed no clinical signs of the disease, the animal would then pass an \nante-mortem inspection, making the diseased animal available for human \nconsumption. The BSE agent could then cross-contaminate the normally \nsafe muscle tissue during slaughter and processing. The disposal of \ndowner livestock would ensure that the BSE agent would not be recycled \nto contaminate otherwise safe meat.\n  There are other TSE diseases already known to us such as scrapie that \naffects sheep and goats, chronic wasting disease in deer and elk, and \nclassic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans, all of which are present \nin the United States. Because our knowledge of such diseases is \nlimited, the inclusion of horses, mules, swine, and other equine in \nthis act are a necessary precaution. This precautionary measure is \nneeded in order to ensure that the human population is not affected by \ndiseased livestock. The Food and Drug Administration, FDA, has already \ncreated regulations that prevent imports of all live cattle and other \nruminants and certain ruminant products from countries where BSE is \nknown to exist. In 1997, the FDA placed a prohibition on the use of all \nmammalian protein, with a few exceptions, in animal feed given to \ncattle and other ruminants. These regulations are a good start in \nprotecting us from the possible spread of BSE, however, they do not go \nfar enough, because they still allow the processing of downer cattle.\n  According to a study performed by the Harvard School of the Public \nHealth in conjunction with the USDA and surveillance data from European \ncountries, downer cattle are at high risk for BSE. According to the \nHarvard Study, the removal of nonambulatory cattle from the population \nintended for slaughter would reduce the probability of spreading BSE by \n82 percent. The USDA and the FDA have acknowledged that downed animals \nserve as a potential pathway for the spread of BSE. While both have \nentertained the idea of prohibiting the rendering of downed cattle, \nthey have taken no formal action. It is imperative that we, Congress, \nensure that downer livestock does not enter our food chain, and the \nbest way to accomplish this task is to codify the prohibition of downer \nlivestock from entering our food supply.\n  The Downed Animal Protection Act fills a gap in the current USDA and \nFDA regulations. The bill calls for the humane euthanization of \nnonambulatory livestock, both for interstate and foreign commerce. The \neuthanization of nonambulatory livestock would remove this high risk \npopulation from the portion of livestock reserved for our consumption. \nDue to the presence of other TSE diseases found throughout other \nspecies of livestock, all animals that fit under the definition of \nlivestock will be included in this bill.\n  The benefits of my bill are numerous, for both the public and the \nindustry. On the face of it, the bill will prevent needless suffering \nby humanely euthanizing nonambulatory animals. The removal of downed \nanimals from our products will insure that they are safer and of better \nquality. The reduction in the likelihood of disease would result in \nsafer working conditions for persons handling livestock. This added \nprotection against disease would help the flow of livestock and \nlivestock products in interstate and foreign commerce, making commerce \nin livestock more easily attainable.\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\n  Some individuals fear that this bill would place an excessive \nfinancial burden on the livestock industry. I want to remind my \ncolleagues that one single downed cow in Canada diagnosed with BSE in \n2003 shut down the world's third largest beef exporter. It is estimated \nthat the Canadian beef industry lost more than $1 billion when more \nthan 30 countries banned Canadian cattle and beef upon the discovery of \nBSE. As the Canadian cattle industry continues to recover from its \neconomic loss, it is prudent for the United States to be proactive in \npreventing BSE and other animal diseases from entering our food chain.\n  Today, the USDA has increased its efforts to test approximately ten \npercent of downed cattle per year for BSE. However, it is my \nunderstanding that the USDA is looking to revisit this issue. I do not \nbelieve that now is the time to lower our defenses. We must protect our \nlivestock industry and human health from diseases such as BSE. This \nbill reduces the threat of passing diseases from downed livestock to \nour food supply. It ensures downed animals will not be used for human \nconsumption. It also requires higher standards for food safety and \nprotects the human population from diseases and the livestock industry \nfrom economic distress.\n  American consumers should be able to rely on the Federal Government \nto ensure that meat and meat by-products are safe for human \nconsumption. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the measure be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 394\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \ncontrolled foreign corporations in tax havens as domestic corporations; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm joined by Senators Carl Levin of \nMichigan and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin in re-introducing \nlegislation that we believe will help the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) combat offshore tax haven abuses and ensure that U.S. \nmultinational companies pay the U.S. taxes that they rightfully owe.\n  Every year, tens of millions of taxpayers work through piles of \ncomplicated IRS instructions and complex forms to prepare and file \ntheir tax returns to fulfill their taxpaying responsibility. Some tax \nexperts have estimated that taxpayers spend over $100 billion and more \nthan 6 billion hours trying to comply with their Federal tax \nobligation.\n  That's why every American has a right to be angry when they hear \nrepeated press accounts of corporate taxpayers that are shirking their \ntax obligations by actively shifting their profits to foreign tax \nhavens or using other inappropriate tax avoidance techniques. The bill \nthat we are re-introducing today is a simple and straightforward way to \ntry to tackle the offshore tax haven problem. It is virtually identical \nto our bill in the 109th Congress, S. 779, but we have granted \npotentially impacted companies an extra year to comply with its \nprovisions.\n  We have known for many years that some very profitable U.S. \nmultinational businesses are using offshore tax havens to avoid paying \ntheir fair share of U.S. taxes. But in the face of these reports, the \nCongress and the administration have shown little interest in stopping \nthis hemorrhaging of tax revenues. In fact, a growing body of evidence \nsuggests that the tax haven problem is getting much worse and may be \ncosting the U.S. Treasury tens of billions of dollars every year.\n  Although the Congress did pass legislation a few years ago, which I \nsupported, that addresses a narrow problem of a couple dozen corporate \nexpatriates that reincorporated overseas, that legislation did nothing \nto deal with the problem of U.S. companies that are setting up tax \nhaven subsidiaries offshore to avoid their taxpaying responsibilities \nin this country.\n  Around the time of the debate on corporate inversions, a New York \nTimes article got it right when it suggested that ``instead of moving \nheadquarters offshore, many companies are simply placing patents on \ndrugs, ownership of corporate logos, techniques for manufacturing \nprocesses and other intangible assets in tax havens . . . The companies \nthen charge their subsidiaries in higher-tax locales, including the \nU.S., for the use of these intellectual properties. This allows the \ncompanies to take profits in these havens and pay far less in taxes.''\n  How pervasive is the tax haven subsidiary problem? A couple of years \nago, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the investigative arm \nof Congress, issued a report that Senator Levin and I requested that \ngives some insight to the potential magnitude of this tax avoidance \nactivity.\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\n  The GAO found that 59 out of the 100 largest publicly-traded Federal \ncontractors in 2001--with tens of billions of dollars of Federal \ncontracts in 2001-- had established hundreds of subsidiaries located in \noffshore tax havens. According to the GAO, Exxon-Mobil Corporation, the \n21st largest publicly traded Federal contractor in 2001, has some 11 \ntax-haven subsidiaries in the Bahamas. The same report revealed that \nthe Halliburton Company has 17 tax-haven subsidiaries, including 13 in \nthe Cayman Islands, a country that has never imposed a corporate income \ntax, as well as 2 in Liechtenstein and 2 in Panama. And the now \ninfamous Enron Corporation had 1,300 different foreign entities, \nincluding some 441 located in the Cayman Islands.\n\n  But the poster child for offshore tax haven abuses, in my opinion, is \na five-story building located in the Cayman Islands that thousands of \ncompanies call home. According to a very good investigative report \npublished by David Evans with Bloomberg News in the summer of 2004, \nthere is a building named the Ugland House in Grand Cayman that is used \nas the address of 12,748 companies.\n  In fact, nearly half of the money U.S. companies earned overseas is \naccounted for in tax havens like the Cayman Islands. A former Joint \nCommittee on Taxation economist released a study that looked at the \namount of profits that U.S. companies are shifting to offshore tax \nhavens. He found that U.S. multinational companies had moved hundreds \nof billions of dollars in profits to tax havens for years 1999-2002, \nthe latest years for which IRS data was available.\n  The legislation we are re-introducing today would help put a stop to \nthese tax avoidance schemes. Specifically, our legislation denies tax \nbenefits, namely tax deferral, to U.S. multinational companies that set \nup controlled foreign corporations in tax haven countries. This tracks \nthe same general approach in legislation passed by the Congress and \nenacted into law that was designed to curb the problem of corporate \ninversions. Our bill builds upon the good work of Senators Baucus and \nGrassley and other members of the Senate Finance Committee by extending \nsimilar tax policy changes to cover the case of U.S. companies and \ntheir tax haven subsidiaries.\n  Specifically, our legislation would treat U.S. controlled foreign \nsubsidiaries that are set up in tax haven countries--but are not \nengaged in a real and active business--as domestic companies for U.S. \ntax purposes. In other words, we would simply treat these companies as \nif they never left the United States, which is essentially the case in \nthese tax avoidance motivated transactions. The bill's list of specific \ntax haven countries subjected to the new rule is based upon the \nprevious work by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment. However, our legislation does give the Secretary of the \nTreasury the ability to add or remove a foreign country from this list \nin appropriate cases. We also give businesses plenty of time, two \nadditional years through December 31, 2008, to restructure their tax \nhaven operations if they so choose.\n  As mentioned, our legislation effectively ends the deferral tax \nbenefit for U.S. companies that shift income to offshore inactive tax \nhaven subsidiaries. This means, for example, that any efforts by a U.S. \ncompany to move profits to the subsidiary through transfer pricing \nschemes will not work because the income earned by the subsidiary would \nstill be immediately taxable by the United States. Likewise, any \nefforts to move otherwise active income earned by a U.S. company in a \nhigh-tax foreign country to a tax haven would cause the income to be \nimmediately taxable by the United States. Under this bill, companies \nthat try to move intangible assets--and the income they produce--to tax \nhavens would be unsuccessful because that income would still be \nimmediately taxable by the United States. The Joint Tax Committee says \nour legislation that will help close this tax shelter game will prevent \nthese companies from draining some $15 billion in revenues from the \nU.S. Treasury over the next decade.\n  Let me be very clear about one thing. This legislation will not \nadversely impact U.S. companies with controlled foreign subsidiaries \nthat are located in tax havens and doing legitimate and substantial \nbusiness. The legislation expressly exempts a U.S.-controlled foreign \nsubsidiary from its tax rule changes when all of its income is derived \nfrom the active conduct of a trade or business within a listed tax \nhaven country.\n  In 2002, then-IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told Congress that \n``nothing undermines confidence in the tax system more than the \nimpression that the average honest taxpayer has to pay his or her taxes \nwhile more wealthy or unscrupulous taxpayers are allowed to get away \nwith not paying.'' He is absolutely right. It's grossly unfair to ask \nour Main Street businesses to operate at a competitive disadvantage to \nlarge multinational businesses simply because our tax authorities are \nunable to grapple with the growing offshore tax avoidance problem. It \nis also outrageous that tens of millions of working families who pay \ntheir taxes on time every year are shouldering the tax burden of large \nprofitable U.S. multinational companies that use tax haven \nsubsidiaries.\n  In conclusion, it is my hope that the White House and Congress in a \nnew spirit of bipartisanship will help in our effort to get this needed \ntax law change enacted into law. I urge my colleagues to support this \neffort by cosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Thomas, \n        and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 398. Abill to amend the Indian Child Protection and Family \nViolence Prevention Act to identify and remove barriers to reducing \nchild abuse, to provide for examinations of certain children, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce with \nSenator McCain and other senators the Indian Child Protection and \nFamily, Violence Prevention Act Amendments of 2007. The bill we \nintroduce today is virtually identical to legislation which the Senate \nadopted last year to amend and reauthorize the Indian Child Protection \nand Family Violence Prevention Act of 1990. The primary goals of that \nAct were to reduce the incidence of child abuse, and mandate the \nreporting and tracking of child abuse in Indian Country.\n  The Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act \nAmendments would authorize a study to identify impediments to the \nreduction of child abuse in Indian Country, as well as require data \ncollection and annual reporting to Congress concerning child abuse in \nIndian Country; provide additional safeguards for the privacy of \ninformation about a child by local law enforcement and child protective \nservices; provide for more involvement by the FBI and the Attorney \nGeneral in documenting incidents of child abuse on Indian reservations; \nand authorize the Indian Health Service to use telemedicine in \nconnection with examinations of abused Indian children. The bill would \nalso authorize background investigations for employees and volunteers \nwho work with Indian children, amend the Major Crimes Act to \ncriminalize acts of child abuse and neglect in Indian Country, and \nauthorize several treatment programs for Indian children who have been \nvictimized.\n  I particularly appreciate that this reauthorization legislation \naddresses a related issue about which I have deep concern--the epidemic \nof youth suicide in many reservation communities. Indian Country has \nhigher rates of youth suicide, as well as of child abuse, than other \nAmerican population groups. Often, children who attempt suicide have \nbeen abused by a family or community member. This bill would authorize \nprofessionals trained in behavioral health, including suicide \nprevention and treatment, to be included on the staff of regional \nIndian Child Resource and Family Services Centers authorized under the \nAct.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will act quickly this session to \nauthorize the additional protections for Native American children that \nwould be provided by the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence \nPrevention Act Amendments of 2007. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\n                                 S. 398\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \ninclude podiatrists as physicians for purposes of covering physicians \nservices under the Medicaid program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce an important \nbill that will ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries in all states have \naccess to the services of top-quality podiatric physicians. Senator \nMikulski from Maryland is joining me in the effort again this year, and \nI appreciate her dedication to this issue.\n  Having healthy feet and ankles are critical to keeping individuals \nmobile, productive and in good long-term health. This is particularly \ntrue for individuals with diabetes.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, \nalmost 21 million Americans have diabetes, which amounts to about 7 \npercent of the total population. Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of \ndeath in this country. In 2005, 1.5 million Americans were diagnosed \nwith diabetes.\n  If not managed properly, diabetes can cause several severe health \nproblems, including eye disease or blindness, kidney disease and heart \ndisease. Too often, diabetes can lead to foot complications, including \nfoot ulcers and even amputations. In fact, the CDC estimates that \n82,000 people undergo an amputation of a leg, foot or toe each year \nbecause of complications with diabetes.\n  Proper care of the feet could prevent many of these amputations.\n  The bill we are introducing today recognizes the important role \npodiatrists can play identifying and correcting foot problems among \ndiabetics. The bill amends Medicaid's definition of ``physicians'' to \ninclude podiatric physicians. This will ensure that Medicaid \nbeneficiaries have access to foot care from those most qualified to \nprovide it.\n  Under Medicaid, podiatry is considered an optional benefit. However, \njust because it is optional, doesn't mean that podiatric services are \nnot needed, or that beneficiaries will not seek out other providers to \nperform these services. Instead, Medicaid beneficiaries will have to \nreceive foot care from other providers who may not be as well trained \nas a podiatrist in treating lower extremities.\n  Also, it is important to note that podiatrists are considered \nphysicians under the Medicare program, which allows seniors and \ndisabled individuals to receive appropriate care.\n  I urge my colleagues to give careful consideration to this important \nbill. It will help many Medicaid beneficiaries across the country have \naccess to podiatrists that they need.\n  Finally, I thank the Senator from Maryland for helping me reintroduce \nthis legislation today. I hope that by working together we can see this \nimportant change made.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Bunning to \nintroduce this important bill to make sure that Medicaid patients have \naccess to care provided by podiatrists.\n  This bill ensures that Medicaid patients across the country can get \nservices provided by podiatrists. This is a simple, common sense bill. \nThis legislation includes podiatric physicians in Medicaid's definition \nof physician. This means that the services of podiatrists will be \ncovered by Medicaid, just like they are in Medicare. Podiatrists are \nconsidered physicians under Medicare. They should be under Medicaid. \nMedicaid covers necessary foot and ankle care services. Medicaid should \nallow podiatrists who are trained specifically in foot and ankle care \nto provide these services and be reimbursed for them.\n  The services of podiatrists are considered optional under Medicaid. \nCurrently, most State Medicaid programs, including Maryland, recognize \nand reimburse podiatrists for providing foot and ankle care to their \nbeneficiaries. However, during times of tight budget States may choose \nto cut back on these optional services. There are now 7 States where \naccess to a podiatrist is limited or nearly impossible for someone who \nreceives Medicaid. Even though podiatrist services are considered \noptional, Medicaid patients need foot and ankle care. If podiatrists do \nnot provide the care, patients will see providers who may not be as \nwell trained in the care of the lower extremities as podiatrists. I \nwant to make sure the over 750,000 Medicaid patients in Maryland \ncontinue to have access to the services provided by over 400 \npodiatrists in Maryland.\n  Podiatrists receive special training on the foot, ankle, and lower \nleg. They play an important role in the recognition of systemic \ndiseases like diabetes, and in the recognition and treatment of \nperipheral neuropathy, a frequent cause of diabetic foot wounds that \ncan often lead to preventable lower extremity amputations. Nearly 21 \nmillion Americans are now living with diabetes, a 14 percent increase \nfrom the 18 million in 2003. Another 41 million have pre-diabetes, the \ncondition that indicates an increased risk for developing both type 2 \ndiabetes and cardiovascular disease. Both the CDC and the American \nDiabetes Association recommend that podiatric physicians be part of the \ncare term for people with diabetes.\n  Ensuring Medicaid patient access to podiatrists will save Medicaid \nfunds in the long term. According to the American Podiatric Medical \nAssociation, 75 percent of Americans will experience some type of foot \nhealth problem during their lives. Foot disease is the most common \ncomplication of diabetes leading to hospitalization. About 82,000 \npeople have diabetes-related leg, foot, or toe amputations each year. \nFoot care programs with regular examinations and patient education \ncould prevent up to 85 percent of these amputations. This alone could \nhave saved $1.3 billion in savings for Medicare and $386 million in \nsavings for Medicaid. Podiatrists are important providers of this care.\n  This bill will make sure that Medicaid patients across the country \nhave access to care provided by podiatrists. It has the support of the \nAmerican Podiatric Medical Association and gained broad bi-partisan \nsupport in both the House and Senate last Congress. 29 Senators co-\nsponsored S. 440, including nearly half the members of the Finance \nCommittee. The House companion bill, HR 699 had 210 co-cosponsors, \nincluding 68 percent of the committee with primary jurisdiction, Energy \nand Commerce. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SUNUNU (for himself, Mr. Gregg, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 400. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure that dependent \nstudents who take a medically necessary leave of absence do not lose \nhealth insurance coverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of Senator Gregg \nand Senator Clinton to introduce Michelle's Law. This bill mirrors the \nlaw the State of New Hampshire passed in June 2006. Michelle Morse was \na 20-year-old resident of Manchester, NH, and a full-time student at \nPlymouth State University when diagnosed with colon cancer in December \n2003. Michelle's doctors wanted her to take a medical leave of absence \nto undergo surgery and chemotherapy, but if she dropped out of school \nshe would no longer be covered as a dependent under her mother's plan \nbecause she would no longer be enrolled as a full-time student. The \nfamily had the option to obtain COBRA coverage but the Morses estimated \nthe increase in monthly premiums would have been too costly. Michelle's \nfamily decided she would remain in school full time, maintain coverage, \nand maintain her lifestyle as much as she could. So along with her \nhomework and books, Michelle would attend class carrying a portable \nchemotherapy pump attached to her hip. She refused to let cancer and \nthe aggressive chemotherapy treatment slow her down during the next 2 \nyears, even while student teaching at Bakersville Elementary School in \nManchester, and graduated from Plymouth State in\n\n[[Page S1199]]\n\nMay 2005. However, Michelle bravely lost her battle with cancer in \nNovember 2005.\n  Michelle's predicament prompted her mother AnnMarie to take this \nwoeful Catch-22 they experienced to the New Hampshire State \nLegislature. New Hampshire responded by passing Michelle's Law in June \n2006, allowing full-time students covered under State-regulated health \nplans a 1-year medical leave of absence while maintaining their \ndependency status. The bill we introduce today affords the same medical \nleave of absence to full-time students covered under health plans \ngoverned by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974--ERISA. \nMichelle's Law would allow full-time students and their families to \nfocus solely on treating an illness as opposed to concurrently being a \nfull-time patient and full-time student. While this bill creates an \nadditional mandate for ERISA plans, this provision would apply to less \nthan 1 percent of all college-aged students. Yet without this modest \nchange, the costs and hardships may be enormous. Also, this bill does \nnot trespass on any state's right to govern and regulate its own health \ninsurance business.\n  I thank AnnMarie Morse for her tireless efforts in making sure \nanother student does not get caught between a medical leave of absence \nrock and a hard place of insurance regulations. I also thank Senators \nGregg and Clinton for joining me today and I hope my colleagues in the \nSenate join us with their support and pass Michelle's Law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/25/senate-section/article/S1199-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 40--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE \n                           ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nIndian Affairs; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 43 which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 43) honoring the important \n     contributions to the Nation of the Academy of Music in \n     Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on its 150th anniversary.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to support \nlegislation with my distinguished colleague, Senator Casey, that will \nhonor the 150th Anniversary of the Academy of Music of Philadelphia, \nPA.\n  The Academy of Music has served as a venue for the performing arts, \nceremonial events, Presidential conventions and historical occasions \nsince its opening in 1857. The Academy is the oldest grand opera house \nin the United States still used for its original purpose, and was \ndesignated as a National Historic Landmark in 1963.\n  The Academy served as the main concert hall for the Philadelphia \nOrchestra for more than a century. The Orchestra purchased the Academy \nin 1957, and continues to perform there each year for the Academy's \nanniversary. Additionally, a host of legendary artists including Maria \nCallas, Joan Sutherland, George Gershwin, Anna Pavlova, Igor Stravinsky \nand Luciano Pavarotti have performed at this important venue.\n  The Academy of Music has also been the site of several significant \nand historic cultural events. Alexander Graham Bell conducted a \ndemonstration of the telephone in 1877, Leopold Stokowski and the \nPhiladelphia Orchestra performed the first ever concert in stereophonic \nsound there in 1933, and in 1939, the Philadelphia Orchestra recorded \nthe soundtrack to Walt Disney's classic film, Fantasia, at the Academy.\n  The Academy's history extends further than the opulent interior of \nthe main hall and the magnificent performances that have graced its \nstage. An elegant restaurant was constructed in the basement in 1857 \nfor opera-goers and arts patrons. During World War II, the restaurant \nwas converted into a canteen that hosted 2.5 million service men and \nwomen between the years of 1942 and 1945 who enjoyed performances by \nAbbott and Costello, Duke Ellington, Lynn Fontanne and Frank Sinatra.\n  The Academy of Music continues to be the Philadelphia area's primary \nvenue for the performing arts, hosting major Broadway productions, \noperatic performances and traveling dance and theater companies. It is \nwith great pleasure that Senator Casey and I present this resolution \nhonoring the Academy of Music's 150th Anniversary, and pay homage to an \ninstitution that has played a significant role in Philadelphia's \nvibrant arts community. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing \nthe Academy of Music.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
