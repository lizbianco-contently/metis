Mr. President, as we return from the August recess, we \nreturn to the same problems Congress left unresolved when we left in \nJuly.\n  As I traveled around the State of Texas, I continued to hear people \nexpress concerns not only about high energy prices but high food \nprices. They are concerned that Congress is not doing enough to deal \nwith this crisis. Frankly, I have to say that as I talked to \nRepublicans and Democrats and Independents in my State, it was hard to \nfind anybody who felt as though Congress is doing its job. That is \nright. I don't care whether they were Republican or Democrat or \nIndependent, there is a reason Congress has a historically low \ncongressional approval rating, according to most public opinion polls, \nand that is because people look at Congress and they see not a genuine \nattempt to roll up our sleeves and try to solve problems but too much \npartisanship, too much point-scoring, too much posturing for the \nupcoming election.\n  I don't know any Member of this Senate who actually ran for election \nand hoped to serve in this distinguished body who anticipated coming up \nhere and being stuck in the same old replay day after day, month after \nmonth, where Congress has essentially become dysfunctional in dealing \nwith the concerns of the American people. Rather, I think most of us \nhope to come up here and actually make a difference, actually get \nsomething done. I know there is concern that if something gets done,\n\n[[Page S8146]]\n\nsomebody is actually going to get credit for having solved a problem. I \nthink that is a risk we ought to take because if Democrats and \nRepublicans were actually working together to try to solve problems, I \nthink both sides would get credit and the American people would feel \nbetter about their elected officials and feel as though maybe Congress \nand Washington are somehow a little less disconnected from the rest of \nthe country.\n  For example, we know that when we left here in August, one of the \nthings we had hoped to do was to get a vote on more domestic drilling \nto be able to produce American energy rather than depend, as we do--\n$700 billion worth--on importing that energy from other sources. I am \nglad there have been some continuing discussions, and I am hopeful that \nultimately we will be able to actually do something--do something \nrelevant, do something responsive, do something significant to deal \nwith these high prices. We know there are several things we can do--\nyes, conservation is part of it, using less, but also producing more \nAmerican energy so we are less dependent on importing oil from \ndangerous and unfriendly regions of the world.\n  Now, it is interesting, because I think the majority of the American \npeople look at Congress and they don't necessarily distinguish between \nRepublicans and Democrats and who is in charge and who is not in \ncharge. I have to say congratulations to our Democratic friends who won \nthe majority in the Senate and in the House in the 2006 election. That \nis the good news. The bad news is the Democrats are actually in charge \nof setting the agenda. When Congress is stalemated over something as \nimportant to the average American and Texas family as high energy \nprices and we are unable to get it teed up so we can actually have a \nmeaningful debate and a vote, an up-or-down vote on more domestic \nproduction of American energy, it is because our friends on the \nDemocratic side control the agenda and they so far have refused to \nallow us that vote. I hope, after traveling their States and listening \nto the American people over this last month, their position will have \nsoftened a little bit and they will be open to this idea of producing \nmore American energy so we are less reliant on imported energy from \nother countries.\n\n  We are going to have a couple of chances to do this. If presumably \nthere were an energy bill that was allowed to come up, that would be \none chance. There is another chance we know we are going to have \nbecause this is basically the vote we are going to have before we leave \nthat is going to decide whether the Federal Government is going to \ncontinue a moratorium on offshore drilling.\n  For almost 30 years now, Congress has imposed an annual appropriation \nrider on appropriations bills that has banned exploration and \nproduction of oil from offshore sources. We are going to have a shot at \nthat regardless of what happens because we are going to have to renew \nthat to keep the Government going forward. My hope would be that we \nwould be a little more farsighted than that and we would be a little \nbit more willing to consider ideas on both sides of the aisle to do \nwhat I know the American people are desperate to see Congress do, and \nthat is to actually work together to solve the country's problems on a \nbipartisan basis and not to continue to turn a deaf ear to people who \nare in some distress because of high energy prices and all of the \nconsequences associated with it.\n  We know the economy has moved to the top of the Nation's priority \nlist in the upcoming election, some 56 days from now. Of course, there \nis more to the economy than high energy prices, but I submit that is a \nsignificant--a very significant--part of it.\n  We need to deal with issues such as obstructing free trade. We have \nhad the Colombia Free Trade Agreement which actually would create \nmarkets for American-produced agriculture and manufactured goods in a \ncountry that now--my State alone sells $2.3 billion worth of goods a \nyear to that country, but they are put at a disadvantage because there \nis a tariff added to the cost of those goods as they are imported into \nColombia but not so when their goods are sent to the United States. So \nwouldn't it make sense, when our economy is softening and when people \nare concerned about jobs, as we all are, to say: Yes, we need to have \nmore markets for American agricultural produce and for manufactured \ngoods because that would create jobs here at home. To me, it just makes \ncommon sense, but we see nothing but obstruction there.\n  Then, when it comes to suggestions about how to deal with so many \nissues, our friends on the other side of the aisle--and including, \nfrankly, some Republicans in the so-called Gang of 10 regarding the \nEnergy bill--have proposed raising taxes on domestic oil and gas \nproduction by $30 billion. We tried that before. There is going to be \nsome division, some difference of ideas on both sides of the aisle. We \ntried that before during the Carter administration, and, because of a \nwindfall profits tax, rather than increasing our independence, \nincreasing our self-sufficiency, we actually depressed domestic \nproduction of oil and gas because those taxes were put \ndisproportionately on American-based, shareholder-owned companies when, \nin fact, you cannot impose those taxes on Saudi Arabia or Canada or \nMexico. By Congress, in a discriminatory fashion, imposing those taxes \non American shareholder-owned oil companies, it actually depressed \ndomestic production, which is opposite of what we have all said that we \nwant to do, which is to decrease our dependence on foreign oil.\n  So we have some huge challenges, there is no doubt about it, and the \nAmerican people are crying out for a Congress that is actually going to \nrespond to those issues.\n  We also know that in the national security debate that is so much a \npart of this Presidential race but ought to be a part of what we focus \non--job No. 1: the national security of the American people--they want \nto make sure there is responsible leadership in place dealing with an \never-dangerous world. If there was any doubt about it, the Russian \ninvasion of the Democratic Republic of Georgia should have reminded \npeople that this is a dangerous world. We cannot let our guard down. We \nneed to remain strong because only from a position of strength will the \nUnited States be able to maintain peace. When our enemies see us let \nour guard down and do things such as try to micromanage the troops and \nset an arbitrary timetable on when they come home rather than based on \nconditions on the ground, they see that not as a sign of strength, they \nsee that as a sign of weakness, which emboldens bullies and emboldens \nnations that would like to take advantage of that.\n  The last thing I wish to mention in my 10 minutes is that the \nAmerican people want fiscal responsibility. They want to see Congress \nactually doing the job we get elected to do and get paid to do. For us \nto be here now in September having not yet passed a single \nappropriations bill out of 13 appropriations bills is not fiscal \nresponsibility. It is simply kicking the can down the road and more of \nthe same. Frankly, what the American people do not want to see is more \nof the same. They want change all right. But I submit to you they want \nthe right kind of change. They wish to see a Congress that is actually \nfunctioning, actually addressing their concerns, and actually working \ntogether to solve problems.\n\n  So far, with this Congress that is controlled by our friends on the \nother side of the aisle, we have been unable to tee up many of these \nimportant issues. I hope in the short period of time we have in the \nmonth of September, where we are actually going to be in session, we \nwill have a productive session and work together to try to solve some \nof these problems because, frankly, our record so far under the \nDemocratic leadership is dismal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \nwise comments. As usual, he is right on the mark. I want to talk about \nthe same subject, which is on the mind of almost every Tennessean I saw \nin the last 5 weeks, and I am sure it is on the\n\n[[Page S8147]]\n\nminds of most Americans. During this work period, all during August and \npart of September, in Tennessee, I did what I imagine most of us from \nthe Senate did. In my case, I visited a producer in Knoxville who \ndelivers tomatoes and vegetables to schools and restaurants. He was \ntalking about the triple whammy that high energy prices cause when they \nhave to pay extra for fuel to bring them to Knoxville, and pay extra to \ndeliver them; and then the farmer, in the first place, had to pay extra \nto grow them because of energy costs. For the trucking company in \nJackson, TN, and the food banks in Nashville and Memphis, it is all the \nsame story about how high energy prices are hurting people and \naffecting the lives of Tennesseans.\n  I wasn't surprised to find that Tennesseans and most Americans know \nthere is no silver bullet and they know we cannot solve this problem \ntomorrow. But they expect us to start today, not tomorrow, to deal with \nthe problem. That is why last May I went to Oak Ridge, TN, to say what \nI thought we ought to do about high energy prices. I proposed a new \nManhattan project for clean energy independence. I said, to begin with, \nwe should do the things we know how to do, and that is to drill \noffshore environmentally for oil and gas that we know we have and that \nwe can use to increase our supply and reduce the price at home. That is \nin the case of transportation, primarily.\n  In the case of electricity, we should pursue much more aggressively \nthe technology we invented, which is nuclear power. It is only 20 \npercent of our electricity, but if you care about global warming and \nclean air, it is 70 percent of our clean electricity. My proposal was \nthat we borrow a page from history, from World War II, when President \nRoosevelt created a secret plan to build a bomb before Germany did, \nbecause if Germany got the bomb, it would have blackmailed the United \nStates and the world. We succeeded due to that Presidential leadership, \nby the congressional leadership, and by drafting companies, literally, \ninto the Manhattan project, by recruiting the best scientists in the \nworld, by stating a clear objective and using American know-how to do \nit. I suggested we should do that same thing--maybe seven mini-\nManhattan projects with seven grand challenges:\n  No. 1. We should make electric cars and trucks commonplace. That is \ngetting to be a little more accepted. I talked to the head of the \nAustin, TX, utility district. He said they have a million cars in his \ndistrict--and light trucks--that he guesses maybe 10 percent of them \ncould be run by electricity instead of gasoline within 5 years, and \nmaybe half of them within 15 to 20 years. That is 120 million vehicles \nif that percentage applied to the whole country. I asked how many more \npowerplants would you have to build so half of your cars and light \ntrucks could be run on electricity instead of gasoline. ``Zero'' is the \nanswer, because if you plug in at night, his utilities, and the \nTennessee Valley Authority, and most utilities have plenty of excess \nelectricity unused at night that they can sell to us at cheaper rates \nto plug our cars and trucks into. So that is one way to use less gas \nand oil--by using more electric cars. So over 5 years we should make \nthat commonplace.\n  A second grand challenge that I offered was to make carbon capture--\nthe capturing of carbon out of coal plants--a reality within 5 years. \nWe talk a lot about this, taking carbon out of coal plants' pollution--\nthat produces about half of our electricity--and make it a reality. We \nhave not done it yet. We do it a few places by putting carbon back down \ninto the ground for oil. But over 5 years, if we made a crash program \nout of it, as we did with the Manhattan project, we might find a way to \nget rid of that carbon, help global warming, use the powerplants, which \nis homegrown electricity, and it would set an example for China, India, \nand other places that are building dirty coal plants that will affect \nour air as well.\n  Third, making solar power cost competitive with fossil fuels. Wind is \nuseful in some places, and it has a subsidy. More widespread and \npromising is solar power. Solar thermal powerplants are solving the \nproblem we have with wind, which is that we cannot store electricity \nmade from it yet. It blows when it wants to. With these solar thermal \nplants, they make steam, which can be put in the ground and use it when \nneeded to create electricity.\n  Fourth, safely reprocess and store nuclear waste. We should do that.\n  Fifth, make advanced biofuels cost competitive with gasoline. There \nis a limit to what we can do with corn to make fuel, but there are \nplenty of crops, such as switchgrass, which, with further research on a \ncrash program, we could use less gas and oil.\n  Sixth, we should make new buildings green buildings. Over the next 30 \nyears, we should make new buildings green buildings.\n  Finally, participate in the international research for fusion. I know \nthat is a long shot. But the United States should participate in trying \nto recreate on Earth the way the Sun creates energy.\n  If we had a new Manhattan project for clean energy independence that \nbegan by doing what we already know how to do--drill offshore, create \nmore nuclear power, and do the seven things I mentioned--that would be \nthe kind of policy we should adopt and people would respect us for. But \nwhat happened? We didn't take it up. When we left in August, despite \nthe fact that, according to surveys by Dave Winston, 81 percent of the \nAmerican people agree with the idea of a new Manhattan project for \nclean energy independence, we were still arguing about whether we ought \nto be discussing high gasoline prices.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic leader didn't want to allow us to bring \nup legislation that we wanted to bring up, which would find more \nAmerican energy. Apparently, that has changed a little bit, and I am \nglad to see that. We may have some choices this month.\n  The question is: What can we do in the next 3 weeks? We are having an \nenergy summit on Friday. That is good. The Democratic and Republican \nleader and the Democratic and Republican head of the Energy Committee \nwill organize it. It would have been better if we had it in June or \nJuly. But that is good. Apparently, we will have legislation to \nconsider, perhaps from the House, and perhaps Senator Bingaman will \nhave legislation. And there is the legislation that the group called \nthe Gang of 10, 16, or 20, a group working in a bipartisan way to solve \nthe problem, is working on. We Republicans offered the Gas Price \nReduction Act, which includes drilling offshore, encouraging electric \ncars, dealing with speculation and oil shale in the Western States. \nThat would be a start.\n  As the Senator from Texas said, we have to deal with the question in \nthe appropriations process that has restricted all these years our \nability to drill offshore. You see, we stick it in the appropriations \nbill every year and say you cannot drill offshore. So we are going to \nhave to deal with that by the end of the month. The responsible way to \ndo that is to bring it up and vote on it. Let everybody stand up and \nsay whether they think it is a good idea to give every single American \nState the opportunity to drill for oil and gas at least 50 miles \noffshore, and for that State to keep 37.5 percent of the proceeds. If I \nwere the Governor of a State with a coastline, which I am not, I would \nbe doing that quickly and using those revenues for higher education, \nkeeping taxes down, and improving the environment.\n  At the very least, we should make certain in these next 3 weeks that \nwe do job one, which is, to me, making sure that we drill offshore to \nproduce American energy. That would keep $50 billion or $60 billion \nmore at home and send a signal that the third largest producer of oil \nin the world is willing to produce, and it would at least get us \nstarted down the road to finding more American oil and using less \nforeign oil.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my remarks in Oak Ridge in May about a \nnew Manhattan project for energy independence be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8148]]\n\n United States Senator Lamar Alexander, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, \n                             May 9th, 2008\n\n         A New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy Independence\n\n\n             Seven grand challenges for the next five years\n\n     Plug-in electric cars and trucks, carbon capture, solar \n         power, nuclear waste, advanced biofuels, green buildings, \n         fusion\n\n\n                                History\n\n       In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Sen. Kenneth \n     McKellar, the Tennessean who chaired the Appropriations \n     Committee, to hide $2 billion in the appropriations bill for \n     a secret project to win World War II.\n       Sen. McKellar replied, ``Mr. President, I have just one \n     question: where in Tennessee do you want me to hide it?''\n       That place in Tennessee turned out to be Oak Ridge, one of \n     three secret cities that became the principal sites for the \n     Manhattan Project.\n       The purpose of the Manhattan Project was to find a way to \n     split the atom and build a bomb before Germany could. Nearly \n     200,000 people worked secretly in 30 different sites in three \n     countries. President Roosevelt's $2 billion appropriation \n     would be $24 billion today.\n       According to New York Times science reporter William \n     Laurence, ``Into [the bomb's] design went millions of man-\n     hours of what is without doubt the most concentrated \n     intellectual effort in history.''\n\n\n                    The goal: victory over blackmail\n\n       I am in Oak Ridge today to propose that the United States \n     launch a new Manhattan project: a 5-year project to put \n     America firmly on the path to clean energy independence.\n       Instead of ending a war, the goal will be clean energy \n     independence--so that we can deal with rising gasoline \n     prices, electricity prices, clean air, climate change and \n     national security--for our country first, and--because other \n     countries have the same urgent needs and therefore will adopt \n     our ideas--for the rest of the world.\n       By independence I do not mean that the United States would \n     never buy oil from Mexico or Canada or Saudi Arabia. By \n     independence I do mean that the United States could never be \n     held hostage by any country for our energy supplies.\n       In 1942, many were afraid that the first country to build \n     an atomic bomb could blackmail the rest of the world. Today, \n     countries that supply oil and natural gas can blackmail the \n     rest of the world.\n\n\n                             Not a new idea\n\n       A new Manhattan Project is not a new idea--but it is a good \n     idea and fits the goal of clean energy independence.\n       The Apollo Program to send men to the moon in the 1960s was \n     a kind of Manhattan Project. Presidential candidates John \n     McCain and Barack Obama have called for a Manhattan Project \n     for new energy sources. So have former House Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich, Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean, \n     Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri--\n     among others.\n       And, throughout the two years of discussion that led to the \n     passage in 2007 of the America COMPETES Act, several \n     participants suggested that focusing on energy independence \n     would force the kind of investments in the physical sciences \n     and research that the United States needs to maintain its \n     competitiveness.\n\n\n                      A new overwhelming challenge\n\n       The overwhelming challenge in 1942 was the prospect that \n     Germany would build the bomb and win the war before America \n     did.\n       The overwhelming challenge today, according to National \n     Academy of Sciences president Ralph Cicerone, in his address \n     last week to the Academy's annual meeting, is to discover \n     ways to satisfy the human demand for and use of energy in an \n     environmentally satisfactory and affordable way so that we \n     are not overly dependent on overseas sources.\n       Cicerone estimates that this year Americans will pay $500 \n     billion overseas for oil--that's $1,600 for each one of us--\n     some of it to nations that are hostile or even trying to kill \n     us by bankrolling terrorists. Sending $500 billion abroad \n     weakens our dollar. It is half our trade deficit. It is \n     forcing gasoline prices toward $4 a gallon and crushing \n     family budgets.\n       Then there are the environmental consequences. If worldwide \n     energy usage continues to grow as it has, humans will inject \n     as much CO2 into the air from fossil fuel burning \n     between 2000 and 2030 as they did between 1850 and 2000. \n     There is plenty of coal to help achieve our energy \n     independence, but there is no commercial way (yet) to capture \n     and store the carbon from so much coal burning--and we have \n     not finished the job of controlling sulfur, nitrogen, and \n     mercury emissions.\n\n\n                 The Manhattan Project model fits today\n\n       In addition to the need to meet an overwhelming challenge, \n     other characteristics of the original Manhattan Project are \n     suited to this new challenge:\n       It needs to proceed as fast as possible along several \n     tracks to reach the goal. According to Don Gillespie, a young \n     engineer at Los Alamos during World War II, the ``entire \n     project was being conducted using a shotgun approach, trying \n     all possible approaches simultaneously, without regard to \n     cost, to speed toward a conclusion.''\n       It needs presidential focus and bipartisan support in \n     Congress.\n       It needs the kind of centralized, gruff leadership that \n     Gen. Leslie R. Groves of the Army Corps of Engineers gave the \n     first Manhattan Project.\n       It needs to ``break the mold.'' To borrow the words of Dr. \n     J. Robert Oppenheimer in a speech to Los Alamos scientists in \n     November of 1945, the challenge of clean energy independence \n     is ``too revolutionary to consider in the framework of old \n     ideas.''\n       Most important, in the words of George Cowan as reported in \n     the excellent book edited by Cynthia C. Kelly, ``. . . The \n     Manhattan Project model starts with a small, diverse group of \n     great minds.''\n       I said to the National Academies when we first asked for \n     their help on the America COMPETES Act in 2005, ``In \n     Washington, D.C., most ideas fail for lack of the idea.''\n\n\n                  The America COMPETES model fits, too\n\n       There are some lessons, too, from America COMPETES.\n       Remember how it happened. Just three years ago--in May \n     2005--a bipartisan group of us asked the National Academies \n     to tell Congress in priority order the 10 most important \n     steps we could take to help America keep its brainpower \n     advantage.\n       By October, the Academies had assembled a ``small diverse \n     group of great minds'' chaired by Norm Augustine which \n     presented to Congress and to the President 20 specific \n     recommendations in a report called ``Rising Above the \n     Gathering Storm.'' We considered proposals by other \n     competitiveness commissions.\n       Then, in January 2006, President Bush outlined his American \n     Competitiveness Initiative to double over 10 years basic \n     research budgets for the physical sciences and engineering. \n     The Republican and Democratic Senate leaders and 68 other \n     senators sponsored the legislation. It became law by August \n     2007, with strong support from Speaker Pelosi and the \n     President.\n\n\n                Not elected to take a vacation this year\n\n       Combining the model of the Manhattan Project with the \n     process of the America COMPETES Act has already begun. The \n     National Academies have underway an ``America's Energy \n     Future'' project that will be completed in 2010. Ralph \n     Cicerone has welcomed sitting down with a bipartisan group to \n     discuss what concrete proposals we might offer earlier than \n     that to the new president and the new Congress. Energy \n     Secretary Sam Bodman and Ray Orbach, the Energy Department's \n     Under Secretary for Science, have said the same.\n       The presidential candidates seem ready. There is bipartisan \n     interest in Congress. Congressman Bart Gordon, Democratic \n     Chairman of the Science Committee in the House of \n     Representatives--and one of the original four signers of the \n     2005 request to the National Academies that led to the \n     America COMPETES Act--is here today to offer his ideas. \n     Congressman Zach Wamp, a senior member of the House \n     Appropriations Committee who played a key role in the America \n     COMPETES Act, is co-host for this meeting.\n       I have talked with Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici, \n     the chairman and senior Republican on the Energy Committee \n     who played such a critical role in America COMPETES, and to \n     Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who likely will succeed Sen. Domenici as \n     the senior Republican on the Energy Committee.\n       Some say a presidential election year is no time for \n     bipartisan action. I can't think of a better time. Voters \n     expect presidential candidates and candidates for Congress to \n     come up with solutions for $4 gasoline, clean air and climate \n     change, and the national security implications of our \n     dependence on foreign oil. The people didn't elect us to take \n     a vacation this year just because there is a presidential \n     election.\n\n\n                           So how to proceed?\n\n       A few grand challenges--Sen. Bingaman's first reaction to \n     the idea of a new Manhattan Project was that instead we need \n     several mini-Manhattan Projects. He suggested as an example \n     the ``14 Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st \n     Century'' laid out by former MIT President Chuck Vest, the \n     president of the National Institute of Engineering--three of \n     which involve energy. I agree with Sen. Bingaman and Chuck \n     Vest.\n       Congress doesn't do ``comprehensive'' well, as was \n     demonstrated by the collapse of the comprehensive immigration \n     bill. Step-by-step solutions or different tracks toward one \n     goal are easier to digest and have fewer surprises. And, of \n     course, the original Manhattan Project itself proceeded along \n     several tracks toward one goal.\n       Here are my criteria for choosing several grand challenges:\n       Grand consequences, too--The United States uses 25 percent \n     of all the energy in the world. Interesting solutions for \n     small problems producing small results should be a part of \n     some other project.\n       Real scientific breakthroughs--This is not about drilling \n     offshore for oil or natural gas in an environmentally clean \n     way or building a new generation of nuclear power plants, \n     both of which we already know how to do--and, in my opinion, \n     should be doing.\n       Five years--Grand challenges should put the United States \n     within five years firmly on a path to clean energy \n     independence so that goal can be achieved within a \n     generation.\n       Family Budget--Solutions need to fit the family budget, and \n     costs of different solutions need to be compared.\n       Consensus--The Augustine panel that drafted the ``Gathering \n     Storm'' report wisely\n\n[[Page S8149]]\n\n     avoided some germane topics, such as excessive litigation, \n     upon which they could not agree, figuring that Congress might \n     not be able to agree either.\n\n\n                         Seven grand challenges\n\n       Plug-in electric cars and trucks, carbon capture, solar \n     power, nuclear waste, advanced biofuels, green buildings, and \n     fusion.\n       Here is where I invite your help. Rather than having \n     members of Congress proclaim these challenges, or asking \n     scientists alone to suggest them, I believe there needs to be \n     preliminary discussion--including about whether the criteria \n     are correct. Then, Congress can pose to scientists questions \n     about the steps to take to achieve the grand challenges.\n       To begin the discussion, I suggest asking what steps \n     Congress and the Federal government should take during the \n     next five years toward these seven grand challenges so that \n     the United States would be firmly on the path toward clean \n     energy independence within a generation:\n       1. Make plug-in hybrid vehicles commonplace. In the 1960s, \n     H. Ross Perot noticed that when banks in Texas locked their \n     doors at 5 p.m., they also turned off their new computers. \n     Perot bought the idle nighttime bank computer capacity and \n     made a deal with states to manage Medicare and Medicaid data. \n     Banks made money, states saved money, and Perot made a \n     billion dollars.\n       Idle nighttime bank computer capacity in the 1960s reminds \n     me of idle nighttime power plant capacity in 2008. This is \n     why:\n       The Tennessee Valley Authority has 7,000-8,000 megawatts--\n     the equivalent of seven or eight nuclear power plants or 15 \n     coal plants--of unused electric capacity most nights.\n       Beginning in 2010 Nissan, Toyota, General Motors and Ford \n     will sell electric cars that can be plugged into wall \n     sockets. FedEx is already using hybrid delivery trucks.\n       TVA could offer ``smart meters'' that would allow its 8.7 \n     million customers to plug in their vehicles to ``fill up'' at \n     night for only a few dollars, in exchange for the customer \n     paying more for electricity between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. when \n     the grid is busy.\n       Sixty percent of Americans drive less than 30 miles each \n     day. Those Americans could drive a plug-in electric car or \n     truck without using a drop of gasoline. By some estimates, \n     there is so much idle electric capacity in power plants at \n     night that over time we could replace three-fourths of our \n     light vehicles with plug-ins. That could reduce our overseas \n     oil bill from $500 billion to $250 billion--and do it all \n     without building one new power plant.\n       In other words, we have the plug. The cars are coming. All \n     we need is the cord.\n       Too good to be true? Haven't U.S. presidents back to Nixon \n     promised revolutionary vehicles? Yes, but times have changed. \n     Batteries are better. Gas is $4. We are angry about sending \n     so many dollars overseas, worried about climate change and \n     clean air. And, consumers have already bought one million \n     hybrid vehicles and are waiting in line to buy more--even \n     without the plug-in. Down the road is the prospect of a \n     hydrogen fuel-cell hybrid vehicle, with two engines--neither \n     of which uses a drop of gasoline. Oak Ridge is evaluating \n     these opportunities.\n       Still, there are obstacles. Expensive batteries make the \n     additional cost per electric car $8,000-$11,000. Smart \n     metering is not widespread. There will be increased pollution \n     from the operation of coal plants at night. We know how to \n     get rid of those sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury pollutants \n     (and should do it), but haven't yet found a way to get rid of \n     the carbon produced by widespread use in coal burning power \n     plants. Which brings us to the second grand challenge:\n       2. Make carbon capture and storage a reality for coal-\n     burning power plants. This was one of the National Institute \n     of Engineering's grand challenges. And there may be solutions \n     other than underground storage, such as using algae to \n     capture carbon. Interestingly, the Natural Resources Defense \n     Council argues that, after conservation, coal with carbon \n     capture is the best option for clean energy independence \n     because it provides for the growing power needs of the U.S. \n     and will be easily adopted by other countries.\n       3. Make solar power cost competitive with power from fossil \n     fuels. This is a second of the National Institute's grand \n     challenges. Solar power, despite 50 years of trying, produces \n     one one-hundredth of one percent of America's electricity. \n     The cost of putting solar panels on homes averages $25,000-\n     $30,000 and the electricity produced, for the most part, \n     can't be stored. Now, there is new photovoltaic research as \n     well as promising solar thermal power plants, which capture \n     the sunlight using mirrors, turn heat into steam, and store \n     it underground until the customer needs it.\n       4. Safely reprocess and store nuclear waste. Nuclear plants \n     produce 20 percent of America's electricity, but 70 percent \n     of America's clean electricity--that is, electricity that \n     does not pollute the air with mercury, nitrogen, sulfur, or \n     carbon. The most important breakthrough needed during the \n     next five years to build more nuclear power plants is solving \n     the problem of what to do with nuclear waste. A political \n     stalemate has stopped nuclear waste from going to Yucca \n     Mountain in Nevada, and $15 billion collected from ratepayers \n     for that purpose is sitting in a bank. Recycling waste could \n     reduce its mass by 90 percent, creating less stuff to store \n     temporarily while long-term storage is resolved.\n       5. Make advanced biofuels cost-competitive with gasoline. \n     The backlash toward ethanol made from corn because of its \n     effect on food prices is a reminder to beware of the great \n     law of unintended consequences when issuing grand challenges. \n     Ethanol from cellulosic materials shows great promise, but \n     there are a limited number of cars capable of using \n     alternative fuels and of places for drivers to buy it. \n     Turning coal into liquid fuel is an established technology, \n     but expensive and a producer of much carbon.\n       6. Make new buildings green buildings. Japan believes it \n     may miss its 2012 Kyoto goals for greenhouse gas reductions \n     primarily because of energy wasted by inefficient buildings. \n     Many of the technologies needed to do this are known. \n     Figuring out how to accelerate their use in a decentralized \n     society is most of this grand challenge.\n       7. Provide energy from fusion. The idea of recreating on \n     Earth the way the sun creates energy and using it for \n     commercial power is the third grand challenge suggested by \n     the National Institute of Engineering. The promise of \n     sustaining a controlled fusion reaction for commercial power \n     generation is so fantastic that the five-year goal should be \n     to do everything possible to reach the long-term goal. The \n     failure of Congress to approve the President's budget request \n     for U.S. participation in the International Thermonuclear \n     Experimental Reactor--the ITER Project--is embarrassing.\n\n\n                          Anything is possible\n\n       This country of ours is a remarkable place.\n       Even during an economic slowdown, we will produce this year \n     about 30 percent of all the wealth in the world for the 5 \n     percent of us who live in the United States.\n       Despite ``the gathering storm'' of concern about American \n     competitiveness, no other country approaches our brainpower \n     advantage--the collection of research universities, national \n     laboratories and private-sector companies we have.\n       And this is still the only country where people say with a \n     straight face that anything is possible--and really believe \n     it.\n       These are precisely the ingredients that America needs \n     during the next five years to place ourselves firmly on a \n     path to clean energy independence within a generation--and in \n     doing so, to make our jobs more secure, to help balance the \n     family budget, to make our air cleaner and our planet safer \n     and healthier--and to lead the world to do the same.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, is there 10 minutes remaining on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 9 minutes 20 seconds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8149-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8149-S8150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                GRIDLOCK\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the American people sent us here to get \nthings done, and they are obviously very frustrated with the fact that \nthis has been a do-nothing Congress, a do-nothing Senate. We have not \ngotten much done. In fact, the problem has been identified by both of \nthe Presidential candidates, Senators McCain and Obama, who have railed \nabout the fact that we need reform in this body because nothing is \ngetting done on behalf of the American people.\n  The Democrats have been in charge of the Senate and House for the \nlast 2 years. So one wonders why haven't we been able to get things \ndone? For example, to fund the Government for next year, we are \nsupposed to by now have passed 13 appropriations bills to fund all of \nthe departments of the U.S. Government. Not one appropriation bill has \nbeen passed and sent to the President. We are going to have to bundle \neverything up in a giant ball at the end of September and, instead of \ncarefully considering each individual department, we are going to have \nto adopt a continuing resolution so the Government can continue to \noperate. That is not the way to do business.\n  With rare exception, the majority leader in the Senate has been less \ninterested in enabling the Senate to work its will and finding \nconsensus than simply pushing an agenda of the majority in a sort of \nmy-way-or-the-highway kind of approach. This has led to gridlock and, \nas I said, not much getting done.\n  Let me illustrate this by a simple statistic that says it all. In \n2008 alone, so far, 28.4 percent of all rollcall votes have been \ncloture votes. That is a record historic high. Over 28 percent of our \nvotes--over a fourth of them--have been cloture votes. Last year set \nthe all-time record at 14 percent, and the average is 4.3 percent.\n  Why is this important? Because cloture stops debate, and it stops \nRepublicans, in this case, from offering our solutions, alternatives, \nor amendments to what the Democratic leader puts on the floor. He says \nit is either this way\n\n[[Page S8150]]\n\nor nothing. You either vote on this or we are not going to let you have \namendments and we are going to have a cloture vote. Again, 28.4 percent \nof the votes have been cloture votes.\n  I remember several years ago when my colleague John McCain stood on \nthe Senate floor fighting for the right of a Democratic Senator to get \na vote on an amendment. He said something we all agreed with, which is \nthat a Senator has a right to get a vote on his or her amendment. That \nwas then and this is now: Sorry, Republicans, no votes on amendments. \nWe are going to fill the legislative tree--a parliamentary tactic--or \nfile cloture and stop anything from being debated or voted on. We don't \nwant to take tough votes or give Republicans a chance to win one of the \nvotes.\n  What have been some of the results? Well, in 2007, some very \nimportant tax provisions expired. The research and development tax \ncredit, for example, and the ability to fix the alternative minimum tax \nso it doesn't apply to most taxpayers. We have to pass what is called a \ntax extender bill to extend these expiring provisions and make sure the \nAMT doesn't get 23 million to 26 million American families this year. \nWe have not gotten it done so far. Why? There is an obvious way to do \nthis. The ranking member on the Finance Committee pretty well figured \nout how this could occur. No, we cannot get that done.\n  On energy production, both of my colleagues have talked about that \nissue. The majority leader called up the so-called antispeculation \nbill. We all agree we could add resources to the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission and make sure it has the ability to regulate this \nfutures trading in a way that would prevent manipulation and \nspeculation in the market. But we also appreciate the fact that supply \nand demand is a much larger factor with regard to the price of \ngasoline, for example. So Republicans wanted to offer amendments that \ncreated some alternatives to the Democratic bill that would assist in \nnuclear energy production, coal to liquids, and allow offshore drilling \nas one of the key elements of it. We need relief from high gasoline \nprices. The Democratic leader said no.\n  The only thing the President could do was to at least remove an \nExecutive moratorium, which he did. That moratorium no longer exists. \nWhat happened to gas prices? Oil prices have dropped, I should say, by \n$40 a barrel, and gas prices have dropped somewhat off of the high \nabove $4 because of the market's belief now that when the President \nwithdrew the Executive moratorium, it was the first step. The second \nstep would be Congress doing something, and that would increase \nproduction, and therefore reduce the cost of the oil, and therefore \nenable the American consumer to pay less at the pump. But Congress \nstill has not done anything.\n  Now we hear that next week the majority leader is going to allow a \nbill to come to the floor, but it is not going to provide the kind of \noffshore drilling that Republicans have been advocating. The ability to \ndebate it is going to be very circumscribed. We are not going to be \nable to present the kind of amendments we would like to present and \nhave this debated and amended so we can come up with real solutions.\n  Another example is free trade. The Colombia Free Trade Agreement is \none that almost everybody acknowledges is a good thing. It is critical \nfor our relationship with this important country in our hemisphere, \nwhich is standing against the likes of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. Yet \nthe Democrats, because of their concern about the reaction of labor \nunions, have said, no, we are not going to take up this Colombia Free \nTrade Agreement.\n  These are the kind of issues--and let me add one more: judges. These \nare the kinds of issues Americans expect us to get done. We have only \nconfirmed four circuit court judges this year, four in the entire year, \nless than the average of all of the last Presidents, certainly less \nthan Bill Clinton. Yet the majority says we don't have time to do that.\n  Clearly, this is a do-nothing Congress. Clearly, our Presidential \ncandidates, both of them, recognize reform is necessary.\n  Let me mention the last issue. I mentioned appropriations bills. We \nare going to have to ball them up into one giant bill called a \ncontinuing resolution. Mark my words, one of the things somebody is \ngoing to try to do is attach a rider to the appropriations bill--maybe \nin the middle of the night, I don't know--but it is going to be to \ncontinue a moratorium on offshore drilling. Mark my words, somebody is \ngoing to try to do that. We cannot allow that to happen. Will \nRepublicans be cut off from our ability to prevent that rider from \ngoing on the appropriations bill or to allow us to vote it off, to have \nan amendment to say, no, moratorium and offshore drilling is not going \nto be on that continuing resolution? This is critical to the American \nfuture. Are we going to have this right?\n  These are the kinds of questions I think are going to be necessary \nfor us to resolve before Congress is going to be able to get anything \ndone. But I will suggest this as well: Republican Senators can only do \nso much in the minority when Democrats are in charge. As my colleague, \nSenator McCain, said at the Republican Convention, if he is elected, \nchange is on the way. And one of the big changes is going to go right \nback to what he said several years ago. As I said, whether it is a \nDemocrat wanting a vote on an amendment or a Republican, they are going \nto get that vote, and we are not going to have so many cloture motions \nfiled to cut off amendments, to cut off debate, and say it is my way or \nthe highway.\n  The American people want something done. We still have time--even in \nthe short time remaining in this year--to do something about the energy \ncrisis in this country, and that means to get offshore drilling. That \nhas to be at the top of our agenda. Secondly, we have to get the \nGovernment funded so it can continue operating next year without, as I \nsaid, a moratorium on more offshore drilling.\n  I am hopeful that in the next 3 weeks we will be able to do some \nthings we have not been able to do in the last 6 months. But if we get \ncooperation from the majority, the minority stands ready to try to work \nout these issues, to conclude this session on a positive note in a way \nwe can finally say we accomplished something this session for the \nAmerican people. After all, that is what they sent us here to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been listening with great interest \nto my colleague from Arizona. I might say, before he leaves the floor, \nmy hope is that after trying eight times and failing to pass a bill to \nextend the tax incentives for renewable energy, we will get a little \ncooperation from the other side in the coming weeks to begin the first \nstep of what we ought to have been doing easily, and that is pass the \ntax extenders to encourage renewable energy.\n  One of the reasons they have opposed it is because we actually pay \nfor it. One of the ways we pay for it is to say to hedge fund managers, \nwho are only paying a 15-percent income tax rate anyway, that they \ncannot be running their income through foreign tax-haven countries as \ndeferred compensation to avoid paying U.S. taxes. Because the other \nside is upset with that as a pay-for the tax extenders for renewable \nenergy, eight times they have blocked our ability to extend renewable \nenergy tax credits, which is a way of substantially expanding our \ncountry's homegrown energy.\n  It is interesting for people to comment on the floor and say we need \nmore cooperation, when eight times we have tried to extend these tax \nincentives for renewable energy, and eight times we have been blocked \nby those who are concerned about protecting the ability of wealthy \nhedge fund managers to avoid paying Federal income taxes. Enough about \nthat.\n  With respect to drilling, I was one of four Senators--two \nRepublicans, two Democrats--who opened the 8.3 million acres called \nlease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico. I have other legislation I have had in \nfor a year and a half to increase substantial drilling. It is a canard \nfor a number of them to come to the Senate floor to say Democrats don't \nsupport drilling. It is simply factually wrong. That is a debate \nperhaps for tomorrow or another day.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of S. 3454 \nand S. 3455 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8151-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8151-S8152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8151]]\n                         ENERGY AND SPECULATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, since the Congress left in early August, \nmuch more has been written and much more explored with respect to the \nrole of speculation in the oil futures market and what it has done to \nthis country. The price of oil has come down some, which is good--from \n$147 a barrel down to $106 a barrel yesterday. It is still very high. \nClearly, the role of speculators in running this price up in a year \nneeds more investigation.\n  There are some who say: Well, there is no speculation. We have people \nwho come to the floor of the Senate and say there is no speculation \nhere. Well, of course, what has happened from July to July, last year \nto this year, is the price of oil and gasoline doubled in this country. \nAnd there is nothing that has happened with respect to the supply and \ndemand for oil and gas that justifies the doubling of the price.\n  A Washington Post story by David Cho says: Financial firms \nspeculating for their clients or for themselves account for about 81 \npercent of all the oil contracts on NYMEX. A few speculators are \ndominating the vast market for oil trading.\n  Wall Street Journal: Speculator in oil market is key player in real \nsector.\n  We are now beginning to understand what has been happening in that \nmarket. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is supposed to \nbe the regulatory body on behalf of the public interest, has been \nsteadfastly proclaiming now for over a year that there is no \nspeculation here, or at least speculation is minimal. Nothing is \nhappening that is untoward. Don't worry, be happy. In my judgment, this \nis the work of a regulatory body that has decided it doesn't wish to \nregulate. Regulators are supposed to be referees. Let the market work, \nbut when there is a foul, call the foul. The Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission not only doesn't wear a striped shirt, it doesn't have a \nwhistle and it is not even at the game. It isn't even interested. They \nsay: Well, there is no problem. Yet the evidence is all around us that \nthere is a problem.\n  The investigative reports by the Washington Post and the Wall Street \nJournal confirm that a vast majority of the trading in the oil futures \nmarket is done by profiteering speculators with the market power to \ndrive up oil and gas prices. These aren't people who want to ever have \nany oil. They don't want to buy a quart of oil or a 30-gallon drum of \noil. All they want to do is trade paper and make money on oil futures \ncontracts. As a result, I believe intense speculation has driven up the \nprice of oil, double in a year, in a manner that was not at all \njustified.\n  In July, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission reclassified a very \nlarge trading firm from commercial to non-commercial. This fact was \nhidden deep inside the bowels of the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission Web site. But for a couple of enterprising reporters, the \nAmerican public would still be unaware of that. They reclassified a \nvery large trader. My understanding is that trader, I believe, had \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of 300 million barrels of oil in its \ncontracts. The same trader on June 6 reportedly held oil futures \ncontracts that were triple the amount of oil that consumers in this \ncountry use every day. By the end of July, 4 swaps dealers held one-\nthird of the speculative oil futures contracts traded on NYMEX.\n  This information confirms what many of us already knew--that the CFTC \nwas dead wrong--has been repeatedly dead wrong--when it was telling \nCongress this past year that supply and demand, not excess speculation \nin the oil futures market, was driving up oil and gasoline prices to \nrecord highs.\n  Now, in light of this, I believe Congress has a responsibility to \naddress speculation. I know there are various groups forming around \nhere to bring forth certain kinds of energy proposals, and I commend \nthem all. I think they make a lot of sense. I think we ought to do all \nof or most of that which is being discussed--drill more, conserve more, \nproduce much more in renewables, and address speculation. But there are \nsome who are putting together proposals that decidedly leave out the \nissue of speculation. They leave it out. Why? Because they are getting \npressure from the same special interests that have been speculating. \nThe same big interests that helped drive up the price of oil and gas \ndouble in a year have prevailed upon some in this Congress not to touch \nthem. Don't do anything.\n  We have a responsibility when we consider energy policy next week and \nbeyond to talk about position limits that would wring the excess \nspeculation out of these markets. The oil futures market is an \nimportant market. It is important for legitimate hedging of a physical \nproduct between producers and consumers. I fully understand that. But \nit is a broken market. It has been broken by excess, relentless \nspeculation by those who are not hedging risk of a physical product. \nAnd we have a responsibility, I believe, to understand that the \nregulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the \nassurances by these regulators have been discredited.\n  I think the conclusions trumpeted by the head of the CFTC, Mr. \nLukken, that the wild increases in energy prices we have seen this past \nyear are solely based on supply and demand is not the case. A study by \nan MIT economist this summer rebuts the claims of the CFTC that it is \nworld demand, including demand by China and India, driving up prices. \nThat is not true.\n  Since 2005, the rates of growth in world demand and Chinese demand \nhave dropped some. Richard Eckaus, MIT Professor of Economics Emeritus, \nfound in his study, which was published in June of this year, that the \ngrowth rate for world demand is less than 2 percent annually. He \nsuggests the assertion by some that the drop in value of the U.S. \ndollar has played a big role in skyrocketing price is simply wrong. I \nbelieve the drop in the value of the dollar has played a role, but it \nis not a big role, and the MIT study demonstrates that.\n  Another study to be released this week looks at the flow of money \ninto and out of the S Goldman Sachs commodity index in recent months, \nand that study has interesting conclusions. It finds that WTI crude oil \nfuture prices have risen and fallen almost directly related to the flow \nof investment money in and out of the energy futures market. When \ninstitutional investors poured more than $60 billion into the \ncommodities market in January to May, the WTI price, West Texas \nIntermediate crude price, increased by $33 a barrel. When $39 billion \nwas taken out by these investors, starting on July 15 through the end \nof August, the price began to drop. When speculators invest, the WTI \nprice goes up; when they take money out, the price goes down.\n  One of the interesting things I wish to understand is where are the \nsubstantial losses from these speculators? Mr. Lukken, the head of the \nCFTC, suggests speculation isn't happening, against all the evidence \nthat has now been published. But we know there is a dramatic amount of \nspeculation. This chart shows the oil futures market taken over by \nspeculators. In 2000, speculators accounted for just thirty-seven \npercent of the trades in the oil futures market, and now we are told it \nis 81 percent today 2008. The CFTC still says oil excess speculation \nisn't a problem.\n  My point this morning is simple: We should have, and will have, a \ndebate on energy. The debate can be about yesterday or tomorrow. Those \nwho say you can drill your way out of this, well, I think we ought to \ndrill. I am all for drilling. But I think that is yesterday forever. If \nevery 10 or 15 or 20 years we have folks around here in their loafers \nand suspenders bloviating about where we drill next, there is not much \nof a future in that, in my judgment.\n\n  What we need to do is change the whole game on energy and make us far \nless dependent on foreign sources of energy. Why should this country, \nwith the strongest and best economy in the world, have its economic \nopportunity in the future dependent on whether Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, \nIraq, Venezuela, or others will give us, or sell us oil? Sixty-five \npercent of the oil we need to run this economy comes from off our \nshores. That makes us unbelievably dependent. So, yes, let's drill \nhere, but we are not going to drill our way out of this. T. Boone \nPickens, who has been in the oil business for 40 years, says we are not \ngoing to drill our way out of this problem. I agree with that. But let \nme end where I started. He talks about solar and wind. I think we ought \nto do all those things. I think solar and wind have the capability to \nprovide a substantial amount of additional energy\n\n[[Page S8152]]\n\nfor this country. In order to do that we have to continue with the tax \nincentives for solar and wind. But we have had eight votes on it, and \neight times the other side has blocked us in providing the incentives \nto provide dramatic new approaches for renewable energy. It makes no \nsense to me.\n  We said in 1916 that we want you to go looking for oil, and in fact \nwe want you to look for oil and gas sufficiently that we will give you \nbig tax breaks as you look and find oil and gas. So we put tax \nincentives in place. I wasn't here, of course, but we put tax policies \nin place nearly a century ago to say look for oil and gas and we will \ngive you big tax breaks. Now, let's look at what we did for renewable \nenergy. We put in place in 1992, 16 years ago, tax incentives for wind \nand solar and other renewable energy. They were short-term, fairly \nshallow tax incentives. They have been extended, short term, five \ntimes, and they have been allowed to expire three times. It is a \npathetic response.\n  Even now, the current incentives die at the end of this year. They \nexpire. We tried eight times to renew them and so far we have been \nblocked. Why? Because some of our colleagues are upset that one of the \nways we pay for those is to shut down the tax scam being used by hedge \nfund managers to move their income through tax haven countries in \nsomething called deferred compensation to avoid paying even the minimal \ncompensation to the Federal Government in taxes that they now pay. They \nget to pay already some of the lowest tax rates in America, at 15 \npercent, which I think makes no sense. But even so, many of them are \ntrying to avoid U.S. taxes by using deferred compensation techniques to \nrun it through offshore tax havens.\n  Our colleagues on the other side are so protective of that and \nbelieve, apparently, they should be able to continue doing that. They \nappear willing to shut down our ability to extend the tax credits for \nrenewable energy in the long term for this country.\n  The plea for a little cooperation runs both ways around here. When I \ntook the floor this morning, we had several colleagues talking about an \ninterest in cooperation. I think there ought to be a lot of cooperation \non everything. Let's start first with something that is going to shut \ndown on December 31 of this year, and that is the incentives to \ncontinue and be more aggressive on developing renewable, homegrown \nenergy, which reduces our need for foreign oil. Let us at least start \nto do that.\n  Mr. President, I believe my colleague is here to take the remaining \nportion of our time, so let me at this point yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as I understand it, we are about to run \nout of time for morning business; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have 6 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business until 11:15 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8152-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8152-S8156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ENERGY AND THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I note that Senator Murray will be coming, \nand I am hopeful she will arrive shortly and then I will yield, after 5 \nminutes, my remaining time.\n  Senator Dorgan is very eloquent on the issue of energy and the issue \nof renewables. We have no more excuses. How many filibusters do we have \nto have around this place before we get the other side to relent?\n  In my State, we are on the cutting edge of alternative energies. We \nhave part of our coastline that is drilled upon, but part of it is \npreserved because it supports a very robust tourist and recreation \nindustry. So we have found a balance in our State. But we are going to \nlose a lot of momentum if we don't get on with at least going after the \nspeculators and renewing these important tax breaks to alternative \nenergies, and also, if I might say, tell the oil companies they need to \ndrill.\n  Mr. President, I note Senator Murray has come to the floor, and I \nwant to inform her that I took 15 minutes and I am going to take 5 and \nleave her 10, if that is all right with her, unless she needs more \ntime.\n  All right. So, Mr. President, if you will tell me when 5 minutes has \nexpired from this point.\n  I am so pleased Senator Murray has come to the floor. She works so \nhard to fund the transportation priorities of our Nation over in the \nAppropriations Committee, and my work is at the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, where we authorize the highway bill every 5 years.\n  We know today, because we have been informed by Secretary of \nTransportation Peters, that there is a dangerous shortfall in the \nFederal fund that helps our States pay for critical highway \nconstruction. We have tried to fix this problem many times--\nunfortunately, without the help of the Bush administration. Now we get \nan SOS: Thursday they are going to start reducing the funds to the \nStates.\n  Happily, they have awakened to the reality, but, unhappily, they have \nnot talked to Republican Senators because last night, when Senator Reid \ntried to solve this problem so we can keep our construction going, keep \nour funds flowing to the States, there was an objection from the \nRepublican side. Mind you, we are talking about an $8 billion sum of \nmoney that was taken from the fund years ago--in 1992, I believe it \nwas; is that right? Or later than that? I am sorry, 1998. We borrowed \n$8 billion from the trust fund. Now all we are saying is we need to pay \nit back so we can make sure we can continue to build these important \nhighways, fix our bridges, and help our transit systems. The fact is, \nif we do not do this, we are looking at tens of thousands, if not \nmillions, of jobs lost.\n  Mr. President, I know you come from a State that is struggling \neconomically, desperately needing change. I come from a State that is \nin a recession. We have horrible problems. The housing bust has \naffected us, and what is keeping us going, frankly, are solar energy \nprojects, the wind energy projects, the highway projects. If, in fact, \nthe Republicans continue to stand in the way of replenishing the \nhighway trust fund, my State will be in big trouble. What will happen \nis that funds that were set aside for my State for important projects \nwill not be forthcoming. My State of California, with more than 35 \nmillion people, receives more than $3 billion for Federal funding for \nhighways per year. According to the California Department of \nTransportation, if no action is taken to avert the shortfall, \nCalifornia would experience a potential revenue reduction of $930 \nmillion. We are talking almost $1 billion to my State.\n  California is not alone. My Republican colleagues who come here and \nsay: No, don't worry, forget it, who cares--I don't hear one word about \nany trouble spending American taxpayer dollars overseas. I never heard \none of them say: We are spending $5,000 a second in Iraq on the war, \nlet's bring some of that home--oh, no. But they are willing to make our \npeople suffer here at home.\n  Enough is enough is enough. The other day, the President announced he \nis sending $1 billion to Georgia. For a minute, I thought: Gee, Atlanta \nis in need of some help. Oh, no, it is the country of Georgia. Why? \nThey had a war, as we all know, and we are compassionate toward them. \nBut the war cost them $1 billion. I ask rhetorically, are there \ncountries in Europe that can help the country of Georgia? I don't mind \ndoing our part. We say we had nothing to do with the war that started \nthere. We are certainly angry at Russia for the way it responded to the \nincursion of Georgian troops. We believe it was overkill. We all agree \non that. We all want to help. But $1 billion to the country of Georgia \nwhile Atlanta, GA, and Los Angeles, CA, and all our other cities and \ntowns and States are struggling and suffering and losing jobs? Enough \nis enough.\n  I am going to work with my colleague and my dear friend, Senator \nMurray, who is such a leader on the funding of these programs we \npainstakingly authorize every 5 years. We are going to be on this floor \nas often as we can to move this, to ask unanimous consent. We will let \nour Republican friends know. This is not a sneak attack. We are not \ngoing to do it when they are not aware of it. We are going\n\n[[Page S8153]]\n\nto move to fix this problem every day, maybe several times a day, until \nour Republican friends relent.\n  I have used the 5 minutes. This is just the start of a battle I am \nhappy to be engaged in on behalf of the American people.\n  I yield my time to Senator Murray, the remaining 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \ncoming and talking about an absolutely critical issue this Congress \nshould be focused on like a laser beam, and that is the issue of our \nhighway funding for construction projects across this country and the \nhighway trust fund. I and my Democratic colleagues have been telling \nthe Bush administration repeatedly that we face a looming disaster \nacross this Nation. We have proposed a solution that would enable this \ntrust fund to stay solvent. We have warned that without action this \nyear, we are going to face a financial disaster. We warned that it was \ncoming very fast. But, as we have seen with a lot of problems in this \ncountry this year, President Bush and our Republican colleagues have, \nunfortunately, chosen to hide their heads in the sand and just avoid \nthe problem. They told us earlier this year that the trust fund would \nhave more than $3 billion in the bank at the end of this month. They \nhave worked to block our proposed solution.\n  I rise today because last Friday, President Bush's Transportation \nSecretary, Mary Peters, finally acknowledged what we have been warning \nabout for months now, and that is that the highway account of our \nhighway trust fund is broke. The administration has taken a closer look \nat the real receipts they are getting in from the Federal gas tax and \ndiscovered that their estimates have been off by some $3 billion just \nsince May. The Bush administration is now preparing to default on its \nbills to every one of our States. Right now, instead of reimbursing our \nStates twice a day, as the Federal Government has always done, \nSecretary Peters has told the States that they are only going to get \npaid now once a week. That is happening right now in every State in \nthis country.\n  This coming Thursday, 2 days from now, may be the last time the \nFederal Government will be able to reimburse 100 percent of their \nexpenses. The Department of Transportation has told my Transportation \nand Housing Appropriations Subcommittee that on Thursday, September \n18--just 9 days from now--reimbursements could drop to as little as 64 \npercent of the funds that our States are due. They will have to offer \nour States an IOU for the rest of that money. The result of the \nadministration's failure to act on this is that we are now faced, in \nthis country, across every single State, with an emergency situation. \nIf we do not pass a solution very fast right here in the Senate, our \nStates, every one of them, are going to be forced to cancel critical \nhighway construction and repair projects that are ongoing right now \nthat ensure our roads and our bridges are safe and secure.\n  Not only does this threaten the safety of our transportation \ninfrastructure, it could bring about massive layoffs in the \nconstruction sector in this country. That is an area of our economy \nthat has suffered one of the biggest hits in recent months, and this is \ngoing to have a huge impact across the country.\n  As we all know, this news is coming just as the unemployment rate has \nnow reached the highest it has been in nearly 5 years. We are talking \nabout a scenario in which ongoing highway projects could be stopped \ndead in their tracks if we do not take action in the next day or two. \nAcross the country, thousands upon thousands of workers are going to be \ntold to go home and not to come to work the next morning. These are \ncritical safety and congestion relief projects that are ongoing right \nnow across the country, and they could be halted--by the way, right in \nthe heart of the construction season.\n\n  Fortunately, we do have a solution. It is ready to go, if only the \nRepublicans would put their partisan ideology aside just for this event \nand work with us to get this passed. Earlier this year, we proposed \nreturning, as the Senator from California talked about, $8 billion that \nwas taken out of the highway trust fund back in 1998. Contrary to what \nsome people have said about our proposal, it is not a bailout from the \ngeneral fund of the Treasury. That $8 billion was collected from gas \ntaxes for the purpose of being deposited into the highway trust fund. \nAt the end of 1998, that money was taken from the trust fund because at \nthe time the fund was flush and we didn't think we needed it. We \ndefinitely need it now, so we have proposed restoring to the trust fund \nthe $8 billion that was borrowed and not a penny more. All the money \nthat was borrowed, we propose putting it back into the highway trust \nfund.\n  This situation is extremely serious. After months of blocking our \nlegislative solution, the Bush administration did a 180 and is now \nasking all of us please to get this bill on the President's desk by the \nend of this week. You would think that would be enough for his \nRepublican allies. You would think they would finally see how dire this \nproblem is and work with us to avoid the thousands of layoffs that are \ncoming across the country if we do not act. Instead, last night, as we \nsaw, they blocked our efforts to bring this bill to the floor and get \nit to the President.\n  Senator Bond and I--he is my ranking member on the Appropriations \nTransportation Subcommittee--included this proposed transfer in our \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill this \nyear. Democrats tried to press this proposal in June, in fact, as part \nof the FAA bill. Democrats included it in the tax extender package. We \nwere blocked. We tried to pass it as part of the stimulus bill. We were \nblocked. We have seen this blocked by Republicans at every turn as this \ncrisis has gotten larger and larger. Now it is on us.\n  The final effort we needed was just 60 votes. Do you know how many we \ngot? We got 51. Only 5 Republicans voted to move that bill forward, \nwhile 42 Republican Senators voted against it. Now we are here in a \ncrisis mode. But we have another chance, a final chance. The House has \npassed a similar bill by a 10-to-1 margin. It is not partisan over \nthere. They know the emergency. That bill is here in the Senate. We \ncould pass it by unanimous consent today. But, as we saw last night, \nRepublicans are blocking it.\n  We literally cannot afford to tread water like this. I came to the \nfloor yesterday to urge my Republican colleagues to see how important \nthis legislation is. We are here again today making the case. I hope \nour colleagues across the aisle will listen and work with us. The \nobstruction and failure to take action has now gotten our country into \na crisis, and we do not need another one. We have a housing and \nmortgage crisis. We have an economic crisis. We cannot afford, in this \ncountry right now, to have a transportation construction crisis in \nevery one of our cities and communities across the country.\n  Within just a few days--take note--we are going to be seeing \nconsequences across the country. This Thursday, as I said, could be the \nlast day our States will be fully reimbursed by the Federal Government \nfor the construction work that is ongoing. By this time next week, \nStates are going to have to start doing without.\n  The stakes could not be higher. Mr. President, 84,000 jobs in this \ncountry were lost last month alone. We cannot put another American job \nat risk, and we cannot afford to play Russian roulette with our \ncountry's highway construction effort. That is what is happening right \nnow. We have to act. We need to act now. I plead with our Republican \ncolleagues, put your partisanship aside. When it comes to our country's \nsafety, infrastructure, construction jobs, economy--all at risk--can we \ntake care of that today, please? Can we move forward and fix this \nemergency that is upon us?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, I would like to engage in a \ncolleague.\n  I ask for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the reason I want to engage my friend in a \ncolloquy--I know she has other important hearings and so on--is I want \nto be specific here. I have just looked at a chart of loss of jobs if \nwe do not fix this shortfall. I wanted to make sure my friend in the \nchair understands that if\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\nwe do not fix this, the State of Arkansas will lose almost 5,000 jobs.\n  I say to my friend, Senator Murray, I looked at Washington and if we \ndo not fix this problem, 7,211 jobs--in the State of California, given \nour size, 32,315 jobs--will be lost if we do not fix this problem.\n  Now, as I calculated, that is six times more people than who live in \nWasilla, AK, who would lose their jobs in California alone. So we are \ntalking families, families who need good-paying jobs. I wanted to ask \nmy friend a question, because I see that she has her chart that says, \n``Democrats sounded alarm, Republicans pressed snooze.''\n  This was true in the early days. But I would urge her to change what \nthey have done. Now they have turned the alarm into a siren in our \nState. I mean, my friend knows the calls that are coming into our \ncommittee, to her committee. People are concerned that these jobs will \nbe stopped midway through or slowed down. And when you slow down the \nwork, it is terrible for everybody. It is inconvenient, it is money \nlost to corporations, it is jobs lost. There is no excuse.\n  I say to my friend, does she agree now that, yes, in the beginning \nthey snoozed, they also, according to my records, launched five \nfilibusters against fixing this problem? So even then it was a little \nmore aggressive than snoozing. And if we put that into the context of \nfive filibusters, that is 5 of 92 filibusters the Republicans have \nlaunched this Congress.\n  So when we come back and we debate change versus the status quo, I \nsay to the American people and ask my friend if she agrees: Are not we \nfacing more of the same on obstruction, more of the same filibusters, \nmore of the same: I do not really care about middle-class workers, you \nlose your job, too bad, as we spend our money abroad?\n  I ask my friend if she has this deep sense of where we are?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I share with my colleague from California \na real sense of frustration. The people across the country know we are \nin political season. They understand politics. They understand all of \nthat. But this is beyond politics. This is about severe consequences. I \ndo not understand putting partisan politics, more filibusters, an \neffort to not let anything happen, on the backs of every single \ncommunity across this country.\n  These are specific dollars that go to keeping our construction \nprojects moving along. Now, I get frustrated like everyone in the \nsummer when you come across a project in progress and you have to wait. \nBut I want that construction process done because I know that highway \nneeds to be repaired.\n  We saw a bridge collapse not that long ago. Not that long ago deaths \noccurred. A huge community in Minnesota was impacted. That can happen \nacross the country. We are attempting to fix those construction \nprojects and they are going to be halted if we do not fix this trust \nfund problem.\n  This has dire consequences.\n  This is not about politics. It is not about a Presidential election. \nIt is not about who is going to stop what. This is about real \nconsequences in our community, jobs lost in the construction sector to \nfamilies who will not have a paycheck next month in the middle of an \neconomy that is already struggling.\n  In some of our States, as we know well, the construction season is \nshort; it ends in a few short months. And those projects, if they are \nhalted now, will not begin again until next March or April. The long-\nterm consequences are real.\n  Our Governors had better wake up and start calling all of our \nRepublican colleagues. Our community leaders who want these projects \ncompleted had better start calling our Republican colleagues. We have a \nsolution in hand. It is easy to do. We can do it today. The President \nnow has turned around, finally, and asked for this solution.\n  I do not understand why it is being blocked. It makes no sense to me. \nI can tell you, to those families who wake up 2 weeks from now without \na job, and to those families who are trying to drive to get to work and \nall of a sudden they see a critical construction project stopped in \ntheir State, they are going to be asking all of us: What are you doing \nback there?\n  I heard Senator McCain say recently: Watch what happens in Congress \nover the next several weeks. Well, I hope the American people are \nwatching. What we see is obstruction and filibusters with dire \nconsequences. It is going to be felt in every one of our communities if \nwe do not put this aside for once and at least get this highway trust \nfund fixed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In the remaining time we have, I want to thank my friend. \nWe work very closely, because I am the Chair of the committee that \nauthorizes these programs and she is the one who funds them. We work \nvery closely with our ranking members. Those are bipartisan measures.\n  I want to be clear one more time, because pretty soon we are going to \ncome back here and we are going to ask unanimous consent to fix this \nproblem. We are going to be back here pretty soon.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a document \ncalled ``State Federal Highway Funds in Jeopardy.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        STATE FEDERAL HIGHWAY FUNDS IN JEOPARDY--SUPPORT BAUCUS-GRASSLEY TRUST FUND FIX TO PREVENT 34 PERCENT

Data include apportioned programs plus High Priority Projects. Transportation Construction Coalition analysis of\n  job impact.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This shows in the State of New Hampshire, of Senator \nGregg, who was the one who objected yesterday, a loss of 1,800 jobs. It \nshows in the State of South Carolina, the State of Senator DeMint, a \nloss of 6,300 jobs.\n  I say to my friend from Montana, who I know supports repaying the \nhighway trust fund that he is working to support, 3,428 jobs in the \nState of Montana would be lost. That is big. That is larger than some \ntowns.\n  Think about more than 30,000 families in my case, 32,000 families \nbeing hit by layoffs in the middle of a recession because Republicans \ncontinue to filibuster and to filibuster and to do nothing. It is not \ngoing to go down well.\n  I am glad you mentioned that Senator McCain says for the people to \nwatch the Senate. I urge the people to watch the Senate this week where \nwe are going to try to fix this highway trust fund, and we are going to \nget this done if we can. If we cannot, we know who is stopping us.\n  We are also going to work on a Defense authorization bill that is so \nimportant while there are two wars going on. I hope Senator McCain will \nkeep saying that on the stump: Watch the Senate. And this issue is \ngoing to be as clear as a bell. I urge you to go change that sign now, \nbecause, yes, the Republicans snoozed earlier, but now they are in \nfighting mode and they have raised the alarm to a siren.\n  And all of our Governors, you are right, ought to be calling, and our \nState legislators as well.\n  I want to thank you very much for your patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 3 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from California and I have \nbeen on the Senate floor this morning talking about the dire straits we \nare in in terms of the construction trust fund, the highway trust fund, \nthat provides the money across the country for construction projects \nand the fact that within a few short days our States are not going to \nbe getting the checks they need to pay for those construction projects, \nresulting in layoffs across this country and construction projects \nliterally coming to a halt very quickly.\n  We are going to offer a unanimous consent request to bring up that \nbill again and pass it and get it to the President, as he requested. We \nunderstand, unfortunately, now there is an objection on the Republican \nside, and we will not be able to do this request at this time. I \nrespect our Republicans' request to be able to discuss this issue at \ntheir weekly meeting they are going to be having shortly to determine \nhow to move forward. But I want everyone on notice this is a critical \nissue, it is not going to go away, and we are going to be asking again \nthis afternoon to move this legislation forward because we believe we \nhave a responsibility as leaders in this country to get this trust fund \nemergency problem fixed and moving. We hope our Republican colleagues, \nupon reflection, will join us and we can quietly pass this legislation \nthis afternoon and move on to other major issues of the day.\n  But to me this is the most important critical issue facing us right \nnow in the Senate, and I hope we can move it this afternoon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me say, I agree with everything my \nfriend said. We are talking about highway construction. We are talking \nabout fixing dangerous bridges. We have all seen what happens when \nthere is neglect there. We are seeing all of this happen in the middle \nof a recession, where last month alone 84,000 jobs were lost. As we \nlook at the list, we see if our Republican colleagues and friends do \nnot join us in this effort, and they do not fix this shortfall problem, \nwhich, by the way, is a reimbursement to the highway trust fund of \nmoneys that were borrowed from it--it is a reimbursement--we are \nlooking at a loss of 379,537 jobs.\n  Mr. President, I ask you in rhetorical fashion, is this the time \nwhere this country can afford to see 379,537 jobs disappear when we are \nalready at the worst unemployment rate we have seen in 5 years? We have \nto stop business as usual around here. We need to start the change \nnow--the change away from confrontation, everything is political, \nfilibuster after filibuster. The time is now.\n  So we will be back after the caucuses have their meetings this \nafternoon in the hopes that they have resolved this issue, that they \nstep out of the way and let us get this work done so our families--our \nfamilies all across this country who work in the construction trades--\ncan breathe a sigh of relief. They have enough on their plate. They \ncannot get good health care; they have problems sending their kids to \nschool; the price of gas. We all know what has happened to our \nfamilies. This would be one additional slap they simply do not deserve. \nThey do not deserve any of this.\n  We say to our Republican friends, leave your politics outside the \nChamber for this one.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S8156]]\n\n  Mr. WEBB.

Mr. President, today I am going to offer an amendment to \nthe Defense authorization bill that will do two things. The first is it \nwill extend the mandate or, shall I say, direct the President to \nnegotiate the extension of the mandate we now operate under inside Iraq \nunder the rubric of the United Nations. The second would be to place a \nrestriction on the implementation of the strategic framework agreement \nthat is now being negotiated inside Iraq to bring it inside the \nConstitution of the United States and require that the Congress of the \nUnited States approve this strategic framework agreement before it is \nactually put into motion.\n  The reality right now is, our justification for operating inside Iraq \nunder international law will expire at the end of this year. For almost \na year, this administration has been negotiating two separate \nagreements with the Government of Iraq. One is a strategic framework \nagreement; the other is a status of forces agreement that would take \nplace under the umbrella of the strategic framework agreement.\n  This period of negotiation has been done largely without the \ninvolvement of the Congress. It will, if implemented, shape and direct \nthe policy of the United States in Iraq for a good period of time--our \nsecurity framework, all these sorts of things that traditionally have \ntaken place only inside a treaty. Under the Constitution, a treaty is \nrequired to be approved by a two-thirds vote in the Senate.\n  So we have two realities that have come together, that by the end of \nthis year we need to address in some form or another. The first is we \nhave to be operating under some proper international legal structure in \norder to maintain our forces in Iraq after December 31. The other is we \nneed to be negotiating the right kind of bilateral future relationship \nbetween our country and the country of Iraq.\n  This amendment intends to resolve both of these situations in a way \nthat is not disruptive, that is within the constraints of the \nConstitution, and it will allow us some time to get the right kind of \nstrategic framework in place rather than our having to rush it, as we \nare seeing right now, to get something in place by the end of the year \nthat is arguably not within the Constitution.\n  The first portion of this amendment basically says the President will \ndirect the U.S. Special Representative to the United Nations to seek an \nextension of the multinational agreement that already is in place under \nthe rubric of the Security Council of the United Nations. It also \nstates it is the sense of Congress that this extension should expire \nwithin a year or earlier. It should expire at the end of next year, \nunless we have a strategic framework agreement in place, at which time \nit will expire earlier.\n  The second goes to the notion that this agreement must be approved \nwith the consent of the Congress. I have not gone so far in this \namendment as to say we should treat this agreement as we would treat a \nlonger, more formal treaty, with the recognition that treaties \nsometimes get tied up for years, but that we should have a law by the \nCongress, a vote by a majority of the Congress, approving this major \nstep forward in our relationship with the country of Iraq.\n  As it stands right now, I am a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. I am also a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations. We \nhave not been shown one word of the actual document that is being \nnegotiated. There are members of the Iraqi Parliament that have been \nshown portions of this document, if not all of it.\n  I think it is very important for us to give this agreement the time \nwe can give it if we extend the mandate of the United Nations for a \nyear but also to get the proper involvement of the Congress in this \nmost important step into the future of our relationship with Iraq.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. I hope we can have \nbipartisan support on it. This is an amendment that goes to the \npropriety of the constitutional process and also is intended to take \nthe time constraints out of the negotiation of this agreement with \nIraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8156-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the remarkable \nsuccess story in the fight against terrorism and narcotrafficking that \nI believe very strongly needs to be told. It is a story that has \nlargely gone unnoticed because it has not taken place in the Eastern \nHemisphere or east of here, where most of the world's attention is \nfocused today. It comes, rather, from the Southern Hemisphere in a \ncountry where protagonists have surged ahead of narcoterrorists \nmilitarily, while simultaneously improving the overall security and \nsafety of the civilian population. What is most important is they have \ndone so while ensuring that protection of human rights and adherence to \ninternational humanitarian law are fully integrated into the daily life \nof every member of the security forces.\n  I am speaking about Colombia, of course. I visited there just a \ncouple of weeks ago. I visited Bogota. I also visited Ecuador to find \nout what was going on in Latin America. I was greatly encouraged by the \ntangible evidence I saw in Colombia of a country in complete \ntransformation. Most of us probably realize that just about 6 years \nago, in 2002, as much as 40 percent of the area of Colombia was \ncontrolled by terrorist groups and ruthless narcotics trafficking. Many \nof my colleagues visited Colombia at the time and brought back grim \nreports, as they should have, of a country apparently descending into \nchaos, with a dim future, as Colombia was on the verge of becoming a \nfailed state. The security situation was bleak, the economic outlook \nwas decidedly negative, and drug trafficking threatened the very \nculture of Colombia and its people.\n  The situation had been slowly deteriorating in Colombia for decades. \nEven before the United States experienced the dramatic acts of \nterrorism of 2001 that would change our national perceptions forever, \nColombians were dealing with an increasingly dangerous, deadly, and \nbrutal form of terrorism that threatened to tear the country apart. \nDrug cartels were controlling larger and larger swaths of territory and \nhad turned Colombia into the world's leading exporter of cocaine. Much \nof the cocaine was finding its way into the United States. Insurgent \ngroups we have come to know as the FARC or the ELN were turning \nColombia into a war zone, negatively affecting the economy and \nthreatening the very stability of the nation.\n  That was the situation in 1998 when former Colombian President \nPastrana conceived Plan Colombia, a 6-year plan to end long-armed \nconflict, to eliminate drug trafficking, and promote economic and \nsocial development. As you may recall, the United States agreed to take \na gamble and invest in Colombia. President Clinton, a Democrat, led the \nway, and he was followed by President Bush. Both were strong \nsupporters. The good news is that since 1998, the United States has \ncontinued to be the principal contributor to the plan, mostly through \nthe Andean Counterdrug Initiative but also through foreign military \nfinancing and the central counternarcotics account of the Department of \nDefense.\n  Today, our mutual objectives in support of Plan Colombia have evolved \nfrom a strict counternarcotics focus to encompass counterterrorism \nactivities as well. Our investment appears to have paid off with \ndividends. I am happy to report that with U.S. aid to Colombian \nsecurity forces and assistance in trade preferences under the Andean \nTrade Preferences Agreement, or the ATPA, the Colombian people have\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\nbeen positively transforming their nation. We owe a great debt of \ngratitude, as the people of Colombia do, to President Alvaro Uribe \nbecause his programs and policies have dramatically improved the \nsecurity situation in Colombia and demonstrated his personal commitment \nto being a strong and capable partner in fighting drugs, crime, and \nterror.\n  Since Uribe took office in 2002, the Colombian Government reports \nthat homicides have dropped by 40 percent, murders of union \nrepresentatives have been reduced by 80 percent, kidnapings have \ndeclined by more than 80 percent, and terrorist attacks are down by \nmore than 70 percent. That is a pretty amazing set of numbers, Mr. \nPresident. They are evidence of nothing less than a complete turnaround \nthat has given the people of Colombia hope and a new country to live \nin, one free from constant fear of killings and kidnapings.\n  Now, in July of this year, the world watched with admiration and \namazement as President Uribe and his administration, with their \nsecurity forces, scored an impressive triumph against the Marxist \nterrorists of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the full name \nof the FARC. Members of the Colombian military successfully rescued 15 \nhostages, including 3 Americans, being held by FARC. They did it \nthrough guile, without any armed combat, and with great boldness and \nrisk to the members of the participating team. Weeks later, more than 1 \nmillion Colombians marched in their nation's streets, calling on the \nFARC to release its remaining hostages and stop practicing terror.\n  Today, President Uribe's approval rating has soared above 90 percent, \nand the FARC, still holding 700 hostages, is now faced with increasing \nevaporation of its now limited popular support base.\n  As their security has improved, so has their economy. Last year, \nColombia's economy saw the largest growth rate in nearly three decades, \nand unemployment and poverty are at the lowest levels in a decade. \nImprovements in security, stability, and economic development are \nadding to Colombia's reputation as a vibrant democracy with a history \nof free elections and solid opposition political parties.\n  Americans can be proud that U.S. assistance has been at the center of \nthis historic turnaround. Americans can be prouder still of our \npartners in the Colombian Government who have ensured that while \nColombian military and police forces have made significant strides \nagainst the FARC and taken back much of the territory once held by \nthem, they have done so while completely overhauling their human rights \nprograms, policies, and enforcement mechanisms.\n  In January of this year, the Colombian Minister of Defense released \nthe integrated policy of human rights and international humanitarian \nlaw, a comprehensive policy that directs the integration of human \nrights and international law into all military instruction, stronger \ncompliance and controls, legal defense of military personnel, \nspecialized treatment of vulnerable groups, better integration with the \ncivilian judiciary, and closer consultation with civil and \ninternational groups on human rights issues. The U.N. High Commissioner \nfor Human Rights in Colombia called this a key step in promoting \nrespect for human rights in the military.\n  I was told by members of our U.S. country team, at our embassy in \nBogota, that this policy is a written encapsulation of the remarkable \nchanges that have been made over the past several years in the \nColombian security forces.\n  For example, the Defense Minister, Juan Manuel Santos, assigned seven \ncolonels as inspector delegates for each division of the Army with \nauthority to oversee investigations of human rights abuses committed by \nmilitary personnel in their divisions, including the commanders. As a \nresult, U.S. Embassy officials report impressive signs of progress in \nthe suspension, arrest, or conviction of military and former military \nviolators of human rights, including several general officers and \ngreater civilian access and handling of human rights cases involving \nthe military.\n  In addition, the Colombian Army has now installed judicial \ncoordination offices as well as operational legal advisers in all units \nto advise commanders on human rights and international humanitarian \nlaw, to coordinate with civilian judicial authorities, and to conduct \nliaison with national and international organizations about ongoing \ncases. These legal advisers are present during the planning of any \nmilitary operation to ensure that the targets are legitimate, that \ncivilian casualties are avoided, and that the human rights of any \ncaptured terrorists are protected. The armed forces have designated \nhuman rights officers in all their battalions to support human rights \ntraining and instruction at the lowest level of the military. \nOperationally, I am told the Colombian armed forces have changed the \nnature of their missions on the ground against the FARC. What may have \nonce been pure military operations conducted to kill terrorists and \nseize territory have become surgical operations specifically designed \nto protect lives and gather evidence for prosecution of terrorists in \nthe Colombian judicial system. Legal advisers and prosecutors are \npresent during every operation to begin, at the earliest possible time \nin the operation, the difficult task of evidence collection and \nprosecution under the law.\n  Mr. President, this is nothing short of an amazing turn of events. I \nhave to stress, however, the message our people on the ground and the \nColombians themselves have delivered to me. They emphasize that while \nthe turnaround is dramatic, they are not out of the woods just yet, and \ncritical challenges remain.\n  The terrorist and paramilitary groups are weakened but not yet \ndefeated. Violence still threatens all sectors of Colombian society and \ncontinues to cause displacement and economic hardship. Defense Minister \nSantos told me they have already come a long way, but they have a \nlittle ways yet to go until they can stand fully on their own two feet. \nIn other words, in the season of football this fall, we would say they \nare on the 10-yard line, and they need our continued support to cross \nthe goal.\n  As a result of our investment in and support of President Uribe and \nthe Colombian Government, Colombia has emerged as possibly our most \nsuccessful bilateral partner in Latin America. It would be hard to find \na greater friend, a bolder leader, and one who has made more progress \nthan President Alvaro Uribe. The Colombians have worked hard in \nfighting against terrorists and drug traffickers, and they have done \neverything we have asked of them.\n  Mr. President, since Plan Colombia began in 1999, the United States \nhas given nearly $6 billion in assistance to Colombia. Yet there is one \nmore thing we can do to help them cross the goal line and ensure their \nsuccess for the future. The Senate can and must cement America's long-\nterm strategic partnership with Colombia by approving the one thing \nevery Colombian official, every U.S. Embassy official, everybody we \ntalk to who is in America--the U.S. businessman or others have told me \nthat they must get--the free-trade agreement. This would be a great \ndeal on several accounts for America.\n  Our two-way trade with Colombia reached $18 billion last year, making \nColombia our fourth largest trading partner in Latin America and the \nlargest export market for U.S. agricultural products in South America. \nAs a representative of an agricultural exporting State, we need to get \ninto that country. We need to get into that country without tariffs \nmaking our products less competitive. Exports to Colombia, despite the \ntariffs that they impose, reached $8.6 billion in 2007. The United \nStates-Colombia Free Trade Agreement would open this growing economy \nfurther to U.S. goods and services. U.S. companies are already doing \nbusiness with and in Colombia. There are 112 U.S. companies operating \nthere. All seven of America's largest employers have active commercial \nrelations with Colombia. The Colombia Free Trade Agreement would \ndefinitely benefit U.S. businesses. Upon entry into force of the \nagreement, over 80 percent, close to 90 percent, of U.S. exports of \nconsumer and industrial goods to Colombia would enter duty free. U.S. \nfarmers and ranchers would benefit by the immediate elimination of \nColombia's duties on high-quality beef, cotton, wheat, soybeans, key \nfruits, and many processed foods.\n  Exports diversify our economy, shield it from shock in the domestic\n\n[[Page S8158]]\n\nmarket, and help to close the trade deficit which we continue to hear \nso much about. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. exports \nto free-trade countries are at twice the rate of non-free-trade \ncountries.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, through the ATPA we already offer Colombia \nthe advantages, the trade advantages, coming in largely duty free. The \nFTA with Colombia is one-sided. It knocks down their tariff barriers to \nour exports and I am at a loss to explain why we would not quickly \napprove it when our exporters, our farmers, our workers in \nmanufacturing sectors, our people in the IT industry, and people \nworking in the food industry, all have so much to gain. One might ask \nwhy the Colombians want this FTA when America would see most of the \nbenefit. They gave me the answer to that question when I was in Bogota \na few weeks ago. They believe the FTA will send a strong signal that \nthe United States remains committed to its friends and is supportive of \na continuation of positive reforms in Colombia, such as those I have \nalready mentioned.\n\n  On the flip side, they believe--and I am afraid from everything I \nhave seen it is true--if we fail to do it, if we send an adverse \nmessage, if we do not approve the FTA, it would be bad news, for we \nwould be, in effect, telling our best ally we are not as close a \nstrategic partner as they thought, and Hugo Chavez, Raoul Castro, and \nother Marxists in the region will have their heyday ridiculing the \nColombians for having turned to the United States. To continue to delay \nthe United States-Colombia free trade agreement would be a refutation \nof our strong friendship of the Colombian people, a dismissal of the \nblood and treasure spent over the last decade to help Colombia and \neliminate terrorism and improve its economy, and a signal to our allies \nthat no matter how hard you cooperate with the United States you will \nbe abandoned in the end. As the Colombians told me, if we do not \napprove the FTA, Hugo Chavez and Raoul Castro will rub their noses in \nit, saying: This is the way the devil pays his friends.\n  We saw another side of that yesterday in a good op-ed piece in the \nWall Street Journal by Mary Anastasia O'Grady, ``Latin Americans Want \nFree Trade.'' In that op-ed piece she pointed out what happened the \nlast time we imposed tariffs, and when we cracked down on trade with \nLatin America. She quoted Sebastian Edwards that ``protectionist \npolicies based on import substitution were well entrenched and \nconstituted, by far, the dominant perspective'' in the downturn of \nLatin America. It:\n\n       . . . made a mess out of the region, and not only because \n     spiraling tariffs and nontariff barriers blocked imports and \n     destroyed the export sector. They also . . . had a \n     deleterious effect on politics too, as closed economies \n     spawned powerful interests which seized not only on economic \n     but political control and grew entrenched.\n\n  That is one of the reasons we have so many problems with so many \ncountries in Latin America that are not realizing their full potential.\n  In sum, a Colombia FTA seems a simple but effective way to help \nsolidify our image as a nation committed to helping our strategic \nallies in the world, in the Western Hemisphere, and standing shoulder \nto shoulder with us fighting those who attack our freedom. I urge my \ncolleagues to consider seriously the importance of passing a Colombia \nFTA before this Congress ends in a few short weeks. This may be one of \nthe few strongly bipartisan actions in the Senate before this session \nends and, for our Colombian friends who know how important it is, this \naction would be unforgettable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Wall Street Journal op-ed \npiece to which I referred as part of my remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 8, 2008]\n\n                     Latin America Wants Free Trade\n\n                      (By Mary Anastasia O'Grady)\n\n       Of the two U.S. presidential candidates, one promises to \n     expand international trading opportunities for American \n     producers and consumers. The other pledges to raise the \n     barriers that Americans already face in global commerce.\n       For Latin America, this is the single most important policy \n     issue in the campaign. If Republican candidate John McCain \n     wins, he says he will lead the Western Hemisphere toward \n     freer trade. Conversely, Democratic candidate Barack Obama \n     has promised that he will craft a U.S. trade policy of \n     greater protectionism against our Latin neighbors. The former \n     agenda will advance regional economic integration, the latter \n     will further Latin American isolation.\n       Anyone who has read 20th-century history knows the \n     seriousness of this policy divide. The last time Washington \n     adopted a protectionist stance toward our southern neighbors \n     was in 1930, when Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs. \n     It took more than 50 years to even begin to climb out of that \n     hole.\n       Many economists blame Smoot-Hawley for the depths of the \n     U.S. depression. But Latin Americans have suffered even more \n     over a longer period. Their leaders chose to retaliate at the \n     time with their own protectionist tariffs, but the damage \n     didn't end there.\n       In his 1995 book ``Crisis and Reform in Latin America,'' \n     UCLA professor Sebastian Edwards writes that though there was \n     a brief period of liberalization in Argentina, Brazil and \n     Chile in the late 1930s, it didn't last long. Adverse \n     conditions brought about by World War II prompted the \n     region's policy makers to restore tariffs, in the hope that \n     protectionism would stimulate economic development.\n       ``By the late 1940s and early 1950s,'' writes Mr. Edwards, \n     ``protectionist policies based on import substitution were \n     well entrenched and constituted, by far, the dominant \n     perspective.'' The U.N.'s Economic Commission on Latin \n     American and the Caribbean, he adds, provided the \n     ``intellectual underpinning for the protectionist position.''\n       Protectionism made a mess out of the region, and not only \n     because spiraling tariffs and nontariff barriers blocked \n     imports and destroyed the export sector. They also provoked \n     an intellectual isolation as the information and new ideas \n     that flow with trade dried up, along with consumer choice and \n     competition. This had a deleterious effect on politics too, \n     as closed economies spawned powerful interests which seized \n     not only economic but political control and grew entrenched.\n       According to Mr. Edwards, it was only in the late 1980s and \n     early 1990s that U.S. and Latin leadership (not counting \n     Chile, which liberalized earlier) began to recognize the twin \n     unintended consequences of this model--poverty and \n     instability--and decided to act. ``Tariffs were drastically \n     slashed, many countries completely eliminated import licenses \n     and prohibitions and several countries began negotiating free \n     trade agreements with the United States.''\n       Mexico and Canada signed the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement with the U.S. in 1993, but the regional opening \n     process continued well into this decade. A U.S.-Chile \n     bilateral agreement kicked off in 2004. Five Central American \n     countries and the Dominican Republic signed their own FTA \n     (CAFTA) with the U.S. in 2006. Peru's FTA with the U.S. was \n     finalized in 2007. Colombia and Panama have signed agreements \n     with the U.S. that are awaiting ratification by the U.S. \n     Congress.\n       It is true that unilateral opening would have been a \n     superior path. Yet for a variety of reasons--not the least \n     the political attraction of reciprocity--FTAs have become \n     fashionable. And there is no doubt that the agreements, warts \n     and all, have aided in the process of dismantling trade \n     barriers, strengthening the rule of law, and moving the \n     region in the direction of democratic capitalism.\n       Mr. McCain wants the U.S. to continue its leadership role \n     in opening markets in the region. He favors ratification of \n     the Colombia and Panama FTAs, which the Democratic-controlled \n     Congress is blocking. He also wants to lift the U.S.'s 54-\n     cent tariff on Brazilian ethanol, and he wants to preserve \n     NAFTA.\n       Mr. Obama would reverse regional trade progress. He \n     supports House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's opposition to the \n     Colombia FTA, even though it will open new markets for U.S. \n     exporters. He promises to ``stand firm'' against pacts like \n     CAFTA and proposes to force a renegotiation of NAFTA, which \n     is likely to disrupt North American supply chains and damage \n     the U.S. economy. By heaping new labor and environmental \n     regulations on our trading partners, his ``fair trade'' \n     proposal will raise costs for our trading partners and reduce \n     their competitiveness.\n       Perhaps worst of all, his antitrade bias will signal the \n     region that protectionism is back in style in the U.S., and \n     encourage new trade wars.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture \ntime be considered expired and that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 732, which is S. 3001, the Defense \nDepartment authorization bill, and that once the bill is reported, it \nbe considered under the following limitations: that the only first-\ndegree amendments in order be those that are germane to S. 3001 or to \nH.R. 5658, and that the first-degree amendments be subject to second-\ndegree amendments which are germane to the amendment to which it is \noffered; that there be up to 10 additional amendments which are \nrelevant to S. 3001 or to H.R. 5658 and have been agreed upon by the \nleaders--the leaders being Senators McConnell and Reid--with up to 5 \namendments per side; that those 10 relevant amendments also be subject \nto second-degree amendments which would be relevant to the first-degree \namendment to which offered; that upon the disposition of all \namendments, the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on \npassage of the bill; that upon passage, it then be in order for the \nSenate to consider en bloc the following calendar items: Nos. 733, 734, \nand 735; that all after the enacting clause of each bill be stricken \nand the following divisions of S. 3001, as passed by the Senate, be \ninserted as follows: Division A: S. 3002; Division B: S. 3003; Division \nC: S. 3004; that these bills be read a third time, passed, and the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc; further, that \nthese items appear separately in the Record; provided further that the \nSenate then proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 758, H.R. \n5658, the House companion; that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 3001, as amended and passed by the Senate, \nbe inserted in lieu thereof; the bill be read a third time, passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the title \namendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to; that upon \npassage of H.R. 5658, as amended, the Senate insist on its amendments, \nrequest a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate, with the above occurring without further intervening action \nor debate, and that no points of order be considered waived by virtue \nof this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object, and if I could just take a moment \nto explain why. As we have been discussing, we would like to proceed to \nthe bill under a regular order. In discussing the proposed amendments \nwe have ready to offer, I think it is clear they are relevant, if not \ngermane. In fact, the first few we have suggested I know are germane.\n  I think we would be better served to just begin the process of \nbringing up amendments and having debate and votes on those amendments \nthan trying to get the approvals that would be necessary to agree to \nthis rather cosmic unanimous consent request. That is why we object to \nit at this time, but I assure the majority leader that based upon the \namendments we have already indicated we wish to bring forth, I would \nhope there would be a clear understanding of good faith on both sides \nthat that is the way we intend to proceed. I do appreciate that the \nmajority leader then would presumably set up a parliamentary procedure \nby which the majority would have to approve the offering of any \nRepublican amendment thereafter, so the majority certainly would be \nprotected in doing that. It would still be our intention to bring forth \nthe right kind of amendments to deal with this legislation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, maybe we can do indirectly what we can't do \ndirectly. That is, we are going to go through the procedure here to--\nand when I finish the procedural issues I am going to bring before the \nSenate, then the two managers, Senator Levin and Senator Warner, will \nbe, in effect, the gatekeepers. They won't be under the control of \nSenator McConnell or Senator Reid. These two very professional, \nexperienced legislators will move through these amendments as quickly \nas they can. We all relish the time we used to move to this bill and \nother bills to have an old-fashioned legislative battle. I don't \nthink--with all that is going on around the country today, including \nthe Presidential election being in effect and all the other things \ngoing on politically--we can do that.\n  I hope, as I said, we can do indirectly what we can't do directly. It \nwould be good for the country if we could finish this bill this week. \nIt is so important. It has extremely important elements in it, \nincluding a pay raise for our troops, a good pay raise for our troops. \nThis bill has things that are done to improve our military that only \nthese two managers of this bill could lead based on their experience. I \nbelieve I am right when I say I think this has been--this is the 30th \nbill Senators Levin and Warner have worked on together, the 30th bill. \nIt would be a shame, as Senator Warner leaves this great career in the \nSenate, that in his final year we don't do something that is as much of \nhis legislative history as anything he has done in his career, and that \nis the Defense authorization bill. So I hope for his sake, the Senate's \nsake, and the country's sake, we can complete this legislation sometime \nthis week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8159-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8159-S8161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time be \nconsidered expired and the Senate now proceed to the consideration of \nS. 3001.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Global War on Terror\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on where America \nstands in the global war on terror. This week, of course, marks the \nseventh anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on our country. While our \nallies in Europe have suffered terrible acts of terrorism in subsequent \nyears since September 11, 2001, our Nation has been blessed with no \nattacks since that time. Yet that single fact should not obscure the \nreality that America remains dangerously vulnerable to future attacks \nand that the very policies pursued by President Bush have made our \nNation less secure.\n\n  Today, the President announced that he will redeploy 8,000 soldiers \nout of a total of 146,000 U.S. troops in Iraq over the remainder of \nthis year and early next year. The scheduled replacements for those \n8,000 forces will instead head to Afghanistan to respond to the sharply \ndeteriorating circumstances there. I am pleased the President has \nstarted to come to grips with the severity of the threat we face in \nAfghanistan and the need to devote more U.S. troops and resources to \nwhat remains the central front in the war on terror. But let's be \nserious. Shifting 8,000 American troops to Afghanistan is wholly \ninadequate when we see Taliban extremists using sanctuary bases in \nPakistan to increase attacks on U.S. and NATO forces there, when we see \nthe Karzai government struggling to maintain the confidence of the \nAfghan people, and when we see the Taliban gaining new recruits by the \nday.\n  Against all evidence, President Bush continues to view Iraq as the \ncentral front on the war on terror. We have heard him say that over and \nover again. He refuses to acknowledge al-Qaida established a presence \nin Iraq only as a by-product of our invasion in 2003. He ignores recent \nintelligence reports that al-Qaida leaders are sending senior level \ncommanders and new recruits into Afghanistan, not Iraq. President Bush \ndisregards the fact that al-Qaida has reconstituted its global \nheadquarters to plan future worldwide attacks of terrorism in the \nfrontier regions of Pakistan, ungoverned territories that remain off-\nlimits to Pakistani military. After September 11, 2001, this President \nvowed al-Qaida would never again enjoy sanctuary to target the American \npeople. Yet we are seeing it happening again before our very eyes.\n  So, unfortunately, President Bush will end his Presidency in the same \nmanner he started--with a disastrous miscalculation of the threat posed \nby al-Qaida and the necessary tools to combat Islamic extremism. When \nthe President took office in January of 2001, he and his senior \nadvisers dismissed the focus on terrorism held by the preceding \nadministration, refusing to believe a superpower such as the United \nStates could be threatened by nonstate actors. That mindset allowed the \nadministration to ignore repeated warnings by the intelligence \ncommunity that al-Qaida was preparing for a major attack on the United \nStates.\n  Following the 9/11 attacks, the President rightfully moved to topple \nthe Taliban regime in Afghanistan after they refused to turn over \nsenior al-Qaida leaders. Yet the administration failed to recognize \nthat only a long-term investment of troops, developmental assistance, \nand economic benefits was essential if Afghanistan was to not once \nagain collapse into a failed state. Instead, the President shifted his \nfocus to Iraq, redeploying such critical\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\nassets as Special Forces units and unmanned aircraft to the Persian \nGulf to prepare for what was an inevitable war.\n  Five years later, we are still living with the consequences of this \nadministration's rush to war in Iraq. Afghanistan teeters on collapse, \nwith the drug trade resurgent and Taliban forces controlling more and \nmore territory. Pakistan remains dysfunctional, with a difficult \ntransition of power occurring now and an extremist insurgency taking \nroot in its border regions. Iran has grown immeasurably stronger over \nthe past 5 years, taking advantage of America's inattention to move \nforward on its nuclear program and support extremist groups throughout \nthe Middle East. And what we can never forget, the men who perpetrated \nthe most deadly attacks on American soil remain free 7 years after the \nfact. This is not only a slap in the face to the families of the 3,000 \nAmericans murdered on September 11, it remains a continuing danger as \nal-Qaida plots new attacks on our Nation.\n  In his speech today at the National Defense University, the President \nmade the following assertion:\n\n       Together, with our allies, we made substantial progress \n     towards breaking up terrorist networks--and we will not rest \n     until they are destroyed.\n\n  We have heard similar statements from President Bush and senior \nadministration officials dating back to 2002--that America is taking \nthe fight to al-Qaida and winning the war on terrorism. The only \nproblem is the administration has never defined what victory means nor \nprovided a set of benchmarks to allow the American people to judge \nwhether we are making real progress.\n  For that reason, I am joined today by Senator Hagel in introducing an \namendment to the Defense authorization bill to require the executive \nbranch to produce, on a semiannual basis, a comprehensive report on the \nstatus of our Nation's efforts and the level of resulting progress to \ndefeat al-Qaida and related affiliates in the global war on terrorism. \nThe Congress receives numerous reports on the status of our efforts in \nindividual theaters, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, but we have never \nreceived a basic update from the administration on what the United \nStates is doing to ensure that al-Qaida never again succeeds in \nlaunching the type of devastating attacks such as those we suffered 7 \nyears ago this week. This amendment, if adopted, would allow the \nCongress and the American people to hold administration officials--this \nor future administration officials--accountable when they claim we are \nwinning against al-Qaida.\n  Let me briefly conclude by returning to a topic on which I have \nspoken previously on this floor--the danger of nuclear terrorism. \nTomorrow, a high-level panel convened by the Partnership for a Secure \nAmerica, consisting of some of the men and women who served on the 9/11 \nCommission, will release a report card on America's efforts to combat \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and prevent a \ncatastrophic act of terrorism involving such weapons on American soil. \nPress reports indicate the final grades will not be good. Our \nGovernment will receive an overall grade of C, with sharp criticism \nfocused on our lack of a coherent governmentwide strategy, our acute \nvulnerability to an act of bioterrorism, and our continuing failure to \nsecure loose fissile materials and nuclear stockpiles around the world.\n  Four years ago, this President declared in a campaign debate that he \nagreed with his opponent that the prospect of a nuclear weapon \ndestroying an American city is the single greatest threat to U.S. \nnational security. Yet while there have been useful efforts in recent \nyears, it remains clear the U.S. Government has not marshaled all of \nits resources to combat this threat. For instance, we have spent more \nfunds securing our aviation system against another hijacking than \npreventing a future act of nuclear terrorism. However, I fear when al-\nQaida strikes our Nation the next time, they will not be using their \nold playbook.\n  America stands today less secure than it should be. Our massive \nmilitary presence in Iraq, now approaching its seventh year, has \nstrained our most precious resources--our men and women in uniform. It \nhas reduced our flexibility to respond to various other threats \nthroughout the world, including Russia's recent military incursion into \nGeorgia, and emboldened other enemies--Iran most notably. We have \nfailed to finish the job we started in Afghanistan. For too long, we \ntolerated a dictator in Pakistan on the basis that he was best equipped \nto serve as an ally in the war on terrorism, only to find out al-Qaida \nhad reconstituted its central headquarters in that very nation.\n  The President and those who seek to continue his policies \nindefinitely will make speeches all week long that we are winning the \nwar on terror. But they make those statements in direct contradiction \nto the assessments of our intelligence community, and they fail to \noffer the evidence to back up their assertions. Enough is enough. We \ncannot afford to continue the same misguided policies that have made \nAmerica less safe for another 4 years.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 636 that \nSenator Lieberman will be trying to introduce tomorrow. It is a \nresolution of the Senate, and he will be trying to introduce it \ntomorrow. I am going to speak on it tonight. I am a coauthor of it. It \nspeaks about the phenomenal success of the surge, of troops into Iraq. \nBut it is more than just a surge of 30,000 troops. It has been a surge \non many fronts: political, economic, and militarily. The resolution \nwould be a statement by the Senate recognizing that the surge has \nworked, that those who executed the strategy are recognized for being \nthe great leaders they are, it is a compliment to our troops, and it is \nalso a recognition that the Iraqi people have stepped to the plate and \nchanged the tides that existed in their country of extremism and Iraq \nnow is becoming a stable government, a country where people are working \nout their differences through the rule of law and representative \ndemocracy, and al-Qaida has been delivered a dramatic blow.\n  To put this in perspective, at the end of 2006, it was clear the old \nstrategy was not working, that the troops we had in Iraq were not being \nused in a way to counter the insurgency and were not enough in number. \nAll this came to a head in late 2006 when Senator McCain, myself, and \nSenator Lieberman, among others, were arguing for a change in strategy.\n  We had, I think, seven visits to Iraq; at the time about four. During \nour visits--Senator McCain, myself, and Senator Lieberman--every time \nwe went, it was worse than the time before, up until the surge became \nthe new strategy. The sergeants, the colonels, and captains were very \nblunt with us, saying this was not working. It was clear to us we did \nnot have the right number of troops or the right strategy. In January \nof 2007, President Bush, much to his credit, announced a new strategy, \nan infusion of, I think, 30,000 new combat brigades into Iraq to bring \nabout security.\n  It has always been our belief--Senator McCain, myself, and Senator \nLieberman--that without security, it is hard to have a representative \ndemocracy. It is one thing to talk about political compromise and the \ndifficulty of talk radio and MoveOn.Org. But it is another thing to \ntalk about political compromise when your family is being murdered. It \nis very hard to administer the rule of law when the judges and the \nprospective participants in the trial are under siege and under attack. \nSo without better security, there was no hope.\n  I have always believed that a security environment is required before \nyou can have political compromise, economic progress, or any \nforgiveness. The economic progress in Iraq is pretty stunning: 5 \npercent growth. The oil revenues have almost doubled. Oil production \nhas almost doubled. The economy is doing very well in Iraq compared to \na year ago. The availability of energy and power is dramatically up. So \nthe everyday life of the Iraqi people is still a struggle and difficult \nbut far better than it was a year ago. There are a lot of people \npurchasing refrigerators and televisions and other electronic devices. \nThe availability of power is at an all-time high. But demand is also at \nan all-time high.\n  Economically, inflation is down and the Iraqis have a surplus. People \nsay: Well, should they pay us back? I would like to get some of our \nmoney back. They are certainly paying more. They are paying for all \nmajor reconstruction projects now, and they are paying for the \noperation of their army, for the most part.\n  But the best way to pay us back as a nation is for Iraq to be a place \nthat embraces democracy, rejects al-Qaida, would be a buffer to Iranian \nambitions, would be a place where a woman would have a say about her \nchild. All that, to me, is priceless. For Iraq to go from a Saddam \nHussein dictatorship to a representative government where Sunnis, \nShias, and Kurds live in peace with each other, at peace with their \nneighbors is a major sea change in the overall war on terror and is a \npriceless event as far as I am concerned.\n  To have an Arab nation in the heart of the Mideast, a Muslim nation \nthat rejected al-Qaida, is exactly what we need more of. The Iraqi \npeople need to be acknowledged as to their sacrifice. What they have \ndone has been tough. Their casualty rate has been about three times \nours. The political reconciliation progress is moving forward now in \nIraq. Fifteen of the 18 political benchmarks have been met by the Iraqi \nGovernment. The debaathification law was passed. That allows members of \nthe Baath Party under Saddam to come back into the Government and get \nsome of their old jobs back.\n  The amnesty law was passed. That means Sunni insurgents who were \ncaptured a year or 2 years ago as part of the insurgency to topple the \nGovernment in Baghdad will be let go and go back home and become part \nof the new Iraq.\n  Forgiveness is required before you have reconciliation. You see \nthroughout Iraq a level of forgiveness that I think is encouraging. For \nthe Shias and the Kurds to pass the amnesty law, telling their Sunni \nbrothers and sisters: Let's start over, is a major step forward. For \nthe Sunnis to embrace new elections after they boycotted them in 2005 \nis a recognition by the Sunni factions in Iraq that democracy is the \nway to go: Go to Baghdad through representation, not through violence. \nThe Kurds have created stability in the north, and they are working \nwith their partners in the south and in the west with the Sunnis and \nthe Shias.\n  Maliki has stepped to the plate. I was not so excited about his \nleadership a year ago, but he has turned things around. The Shia-\ndominated Government in Iraq is taking on Shia militias in the southern \npart of Iraq, in the Basra area, that have been supported by Iranian \nspecial groups. The knock on Maliki was: Well, he is a sectarian \nleader. The fact that he would take on al-Sadr and Shia-backed militias \nfrom Iran--Iranian-backed militias in his own country--is a sign that \nhe does not want to be dominated by Iranian theology.\n  So I am hopeful more so now than ever that Iraq has turned a corner \neconomically, politically, and militarily. Their army is 100,000 \nstronger than it was before the surge, and they performed well after a \nslow start in the southern part of Iraq against the Shia militias, and \nthey are fighting very well in Mosul.\n  One of the most stunning events and turnarounds, I believe, has been \nthe recent handing over of Anbar Province back to the Iraqis. About 2 \nyears ago, Anbar was declared lost. It was an al-Qaida stronghold--the \nSunni part of Iraq--where al-Qaida was going up and down the streets of \nRamadi holding a parade. And it was a very tough situation in Fallujah.\n  What happened was a combination of events. The Sunni Iraqis in that \npart of Iraq, in Anbar, tasted al-Qaida life and did not like it. They \njoined with the coalition forces and, with the addition of more troops, \nmade a strong stand against al-Qaida. About a week ago, Anbar was \nturned back over to the Iraqis, and al-Qaida has been delivered a very \npunishing blow. They are not yet completely defeated, but structurally \nthey are in disarray, and you see the message traffic among al-Qaida \noperatives that Iraq has been a nightmare for them, and it has turned \nout to be their Vietnam. At the end of the day, anything that will \ndiminish al-Qaida is good for us. There is no more diminishing event \nwhen it comes to al-Qaida than to have fellow Sunni Muslims turn on \nthem.\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\n  I am proud of the Iraqi people. They need to do more. I think they \nwill. The surge has worked beyond my expectation--not just militarily. \nPolitically and economically the surge has worked, and we are on the \nroad now to what I would say is victory in Iraq.\n  People ask me: What is winning? Winning is being able to leave Iraq \nand have behind an ally in the overall war on terror. Winning would be \nhaving a partner in the heart of the Arab world, the Iraqi Government, \nthat will reject al-Qaida and deny al-Qaida a safe haven or a foothold. \nWinning would be having a Shia-led government that will stand up to \nIran, be a good neighbor but not allow Iran to become stronger. Winning \nwould be a place in the heart of the Middle East where a woman would \nhave a say about her children through democracy. Winning would be the \nrule of law replacing the rule of gun. All of that makes us safer. The \nconsequences of losing in Iraq would be enormous and would have been \nenormous to our national security interests. Al-Qaida would have \nclaimed victory over the United States. Iran would be dominating the \nsouthern part of Iraq. The sectarian violence that was widespread, in \nmy view, would have spread throughout the region. There would have been \nSunni-Shia battles throughout the Middle East and Turkey, and the Kurds \nwould have had a real problem among themselves. So a failed state in \nIraq would have been a nightmare for our security interests. Winning in \nIraq means a stable government aligned with us that rejects al-Qaida, \nand means a buffer to Iranian ambitions; a nation that accepts \ndemocracy and would be a peaceful partner to its neighbors. That is a \nmajor victory in the war on terror because it was a place where al-\nQaida was defeated by Muslims.\n\n  This resolution in great detail lays out what happened over the last \nyear and a half regarding the surge. It is a statement by the Congress \nacknowledging success on the battlefield and in other areas. I hope \nthis is one area where Republicans and Democrats can come together and \nrecognize the great success of our troops and acknowledge the Iraqi \npeople themselves looked chaos in the eye and turned it away. I know it \nhas been difficult for this country; we spent a lot of money and lost a \nlot of lives. But this war we are involved in is not a place, it is not \nabout taking your eye off the ball; it is about fighting the enemy \nwherever the enemy goes. I would argue that the world is better off \nwithout Saddam Hussein being in power. The big mistake we made after \nthe fall of Baghdad is not having enough troops and letting the \nsituation get out of hand. I don't believe it was a mistake at all to \ngo after Saddam's regime after 17 U.N. resolutions were ignored. So I \nthink the world is much better off without Saddam Hussein being in \npower.\n  I would argue we are now on the road to victory in Iraq where we are \ngoing to have a stable, functioning, representative government to \nreplace a dictatorship--that will be our ally. This has come about with \na lot of sacrifice on behalf of the men and women in uniform, their \ncivilian counterparts, and Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus have \nbeen great teammates over in Iraq. Here we are--a year ago tomorrow \nGeneral Petraeus testified before the Congress. I wish to let him and \nall of those under his command, as well as Ambassador Crocker and all \nof those civilians who have been helping him, know that they have done \nan enormous good for the world, that they have protected our country \nfrom what I thought would have been a humiliating defeat. They have \nprevented that defeat. They have turned things around so that if we \nhave the right exit strategy now, we are going to secure a major \nvictory on the war on terror. Senator McCain: Hats off to him. He has \nalways been about winning. We are coming home, but we are going to come \nhome winners, with honor, and a more secure America because of what has \nhappened in Iraq in the last year and a half due to the surge.\n  I hope and pray we can have a vote on this resolution. It would be a \ngood thing for the Senate to do. Whether you agree with us going into \nIraq, that is an honest, genuine debate. Once there, we couldn't lose. \nWe were about to lose. Thank God the surge was implemented, and more \nthan anything else, thank God for good leadership, brave young men and \nwomen representing our Nation who took the fight to the enemy, and God \nbless the Iraqi people. I wish them nothing but the best in the future. \nI do believe the best days lie ahead for the Iraqi people, and that 20 \nyears from now, long after many of us are gone, here in the Senate we \nwill look back on this period and understand what was at stake better \nthan we do today. We will be looking at an Iraq that is part of the \nsolution, not the problem, in the Mideast. History will say that the \nsurge was a monumental event in the course of the war on terror, that \nthe change in strategy was necessary work. I think militarily they will \nbe studying this Petraeus plan for decades to come, and economically \nand politically, the courage that has been shown by the Iraqi people to \nstep to the plate should be acknowledged by all of us.\n  At the end of the day, if we had continued with the old strategy, I \nthink we would have lost. Iraq would have been a failed state and it \nwould have been a mighty blow to this country and the overall war on \nterror. Now I think we can say with confidence we have turned a corner. \nNothing is irreversible. However, I think the gains made on the \npolitical, economic, and military front are going to be hard to roll \nback if we will stay the course and end this fight. We are very close \nnow to having our troops come home in a way that will make us all \nsafer. I have always believed this one thing about Iraq: Our national \nsecurity interests in history will judge us not by the date we left \nIraq but by what we left behind. I think we are very close to being \nable to say in the coming months that we are going to leave behind a \nnew nation that is part of the solution, not the problem; a place where \nMuslims said no to al-Qaida; a place where different groups chose the \nrule of law over the rule of gun; a place where the woman can finally \nhave a say about her child and her children's future in the heart of \nthe Mideast; and that truly makes us all safer.\n  I do hope Senator Lieberman will be allowed to introduce his \nresolution and we will have a vote on that.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8163-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8163-S8164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in July, the House of Representatives \nresponsibly passed legislation to prevent the highway trust fund from \nrunning out of money. They put the date that the $8 billion would be \ntransferred at October 1, the end of the fiscal year, the beginning of \nthe new fiscal year. That legislation passed by an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote of 387 to 37.\n  The reason the bill receives such strong support is Democrats and \nRepublicans in the House recognize that funding for these critical \ntransportation projects is extremely important. This is infrastructure. \nFor every billion dollars we spend in infrastructure, there are 47,500 \nhigh-paying jobs, and a lot of other jobs spin off from that amount. So \nthis $8 billion is about half a million jobs. Yes, that is a lot when \nyou think about the problems we have in the country today economically.\n  But when that bill reached the Senate before we left for the \nconvention recesses, Republicans objected to it. Since that time, the \nlegislation has even taken on more urgency. Gas prices have \nskyrocketed. Fewer Americans are driving, which has decreased the flow \nof the money into the trust fund.\n  Second, the Bush-McCain economy has plunged America further into \neconomic peril. Just last month, 84,000 jobs were lost, bringing to the \ntotal this year during the Bush-McCain era over 600,000 jobs lost this \nyear alone. And today it was announced that this year will be the \nlargest deficit in the history of our country. So we have an economy \nthat is in deep trouble, we have 84,000 jobs lost just last month and \nmore than 600,000 this year, and it\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\nhas just been announced that the deficit is the largest we have ever \nseen as a country.\n  The investments in this highway trust fund make our transportation \nsafe. It is not just roads, it is mass-transit projects that are so \nimportant to this country. As I told the distinguished ranking member \nof the Budget Committee who was here objecting yesterday, maybe two or \nthree decades ago, my being from Nevada, I may not have been concerned \nabout mass transit, but we are now. Las Vegas is a metropolitan area \nwith traffic congestion. We have to do something with mass transit. It \ncannot be handled on the highways.\n  With this new urgency in mind, the Bush administration joined us in \ncalling for a transfer of these funds immediately. I received a call \nfrom the Secretary of Transportation saying this needs to be done. I \nsaid: Why didn't you help us before? Basically, the Bush-McCain crew \nwas just hoping they could squeeze through before the new President is \nelected before anything would happen. But even this President has \nacknowledged that we have to do something.\n  Democrats and Republicans in the House, I repeat, have already voted \nto have this money transferred, and they did it last July. We want to \nfollow suit. Yet some in the President's own party continue to refuse \nthis economically vital legislation that is so important.\n  We have had 92 filibusters led by the Republicans so far. I am not \nsure if we counted the last one. Anyway, we will say 92. I have \nexpressed many times my disappointment about the Republicans blocking \nlegislation supported by a majority of Senators--a majority of \nSenators. They have blocked legislation not only that we Democrats \nsupport but a majority of Senators, Democrats and Republicans.\n  Here we have an interesting thing now. This is new. Republicans are \nblocking a bill supported by an overwhelming majority of both parties \nin the House and in the Senate and supported by the President of their \nown party. They are even blocking that. They are doing everything \nwithin their power to maintain the status quo. Yesterday, Republicans \nprevented us from passing this bill. It is so important that it be \ndone. I have trouble understanding why the Republicans are objecting to \na bill that Democrats and Republicans in the House support, Democrats \nand Republicans in the Senate support, and the President supports. They \nare objecting to their own best interests, it seems to me. But that is \nwhat they are doing. I think we should send this bill to the \nPresident's desk, as the President has requested.\n  The people who are objecting are using all kinds of excuses. \nYesterday, they said they had a few amendments. Tonight, I guess they \nhave a few more amendments. They think it is really not right to take \nthe money to replenish the highway trust fund from the general fund, \nbut they haven't objected to almost spending a trillion dollars of \nborrowed money going to Iraq. They haven't objected to taking tens of \nbillions of dollars from the general fund to give tax breaks to big oil \ncompanies. That didn't seem to bother them. But when it comes to $8 \nbillion to maintain our highways and our mass-transit projects that \ncreate jobs at a time when we have about 10 million Americans out of \nwork, they are even blocking that. This legislation is prudent and \nnecessary. It is a prudent and necessary investment in the economic \nwell-being of our struggling Nation. I hope our Republican colleagues \nanswer the call of President Bush and Secretary Chertoff. Judge \nChertoff said the lack of investment in U.S. infrastructure is ``kind \nof like playing Russian roulette with our citizens' safety.'' That is \nwhat President Bush's Secretary of Homeland Security has said. So this \nis no time for games such as that.\n\n  So, Mr. President, here is my unanimous consent request: That the \nFinance Committee be discharged from its consideration of H.R. 6532 and \nthe Senate proceed to its consideration; that the amendment at the desk \nbe considered agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any \nstatements relating to this matter be printed at the appropriate place \nin the Record, with no intervening action or debate.\n  But we don't have a Republican here to object, and so I am not going \nto take advantage of their not being here. But I hope the American \npeople see what is going on. It is another day gone by with our not \nhaving the ability here because of the Republicans refusing to approve \nlegislation that is extremely urgent. It is emergency legislation. We \nhave been told so by the President and his Secretary of Treasury, and \nthey still would not let us do this.\n  I wonder where John McCain is. What is his idea on this? Should we \nlet the fund go belly up? Where is John McCain? Couldn't he send a \nstatement, a message from somebody saying: I agree with President Bush, \nor does he disagree, for one of the rare, 10 percent of the times when \nhe disagrees? The word out is he supports the President 90 percent of \nthe time. It is really 95 percent of the time.\n  But is he now going to be part of the 5 percent where he says: I \ndisagree with the President; I don't think that money should be \nreplenished.\n  Where is John McCain? Let us hear from John McCain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8164-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LAURA SANDERS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable teacher from my home State of Kentucky, Laura Sanders, who \nwas recognized on August 19 as Kentucky's 2008 No Child Left Behind \nAmerican Star of Teaching.\n  Sanders, a kindergarten teacher at Cumberland Trace Elementary School \nin Bowling Green, KY, has based her teaching career on the belief that \nall children can achieve and holds high expectations for each and every \none of them.\n  She looks at each child's strengths and weaknesses and works with \nthem individually or in small groups to ensure their success. She is \nthe recipient of numerous awards recognizing her contributions to \neducation.\n  For the 2006-2007 school year, her students' reading scores went from \nthe 52 percent benchmark in the fall to 91 percent in the spring. For \nthe 2007-2008 school year, her kindergarteners started with a 58 \npercent benchmark and by mid-year, 85 percent had met the benchmark \nscores.\n  However, it is her love of teaching, and the love she has for her \nstudents, that defines her effective and creative teaching style that \ngives students a willingness to learn.\n  ``Love. Love the children that come in your door every day,'' Sanders \nadvises other educators.\n  Patrice McCrary, who has been a colleague and friend of Sanders for \nover a decade, nominated Sanders for this year's award.\n  ``I've had the honor and privilege of team teaching with her. This is \nour 11th year together, and I have never seen anybody who puts more \ninto their teaching or loves their students more than Ms. Sanders \ndoes,'' McCrary said.\n  Each year since 2004, teachers across all grade levels and \ndisciplines are honored in the fall as American Stars of Teaching based \non their success in improving academic performance and making a \ndifference in their students' lives.\n  Margaret Spellings, the Secretary of Education, acknowledged the \noutstanding teaching style that Sanders brings to her students.\n  ``Teachers like Laura Sanders combine a passion for teaching with \nhigh expectations that every child can learn,'' Spellings said. ``We at \nthe U.S. Department of Education are proud to recognize these \ndedicated, hard-working professionals, who are committed to closing the \nachievement gap and challenging every child to achieve his or her \npotential.''\n  Her former students are walking examples of her success and her \npassion for teaching. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with \nme in recognizing Laura Sanders's unwavering dedication to education, \nher community, and Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8164-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8164-S8165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              EXPANSION OF THE VERDE VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to relate some good news from my \nState of Arizona. It is good news for Arizonans who live in the Verde \nValley, which lies between Phoenix and Flagstaff.\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\n  The Verde Valley Medical Center, a 99-bed, full-service hospital, has \nrecently completed a $35 million expansion project. The project, which \ntook nearly 3 years to complete, increases the size of the facility and \nupdates a portion of the existing space.\n  The expansion and renovation will add new medical services and help \nthe center serve patients more efficiently. For instance, the medical \nimaging department will be moved to a centralized location, and more \nbeds will be added to the telemetry unit, which serves patients who \nneed to be monitored, but do not require intensive care. The updated \nfacility also includes improvements and additions to serve women and \nchildren. The perinatal unit will move to a new location with a C-\nsection operating room and a recovery room. The increase in the \nfacility's size will also allow the creation of a pediatrics unit.\n  This recent project is only the latest expansion in the history of \nthe Verde Valley Medical Center. For the past 70 years, the center has \nadapted to meet the needs of the growing community.\n  The origins of the Verde Valley Medical Center can be traced to 1939, \nwhen a small, outpatient facility brought xray equipment and an \noperating room to Cottonwood. At that time, the Marcus J. Lawrence \nMemorial Clinic, as the center was then known, served a small, rural \npopulation. In 1940, Yavapai County, which contains Cottonwood, was \nhome to just over 26,000 Arizonans. Today, the county has a population \nof over 167,000.\n  The Verde Valley Medical Center has grown just like the region. Just \n6 years after opening, the Marcus J. Lawrence Memorial Clinic added \nmore beds and became a hospital. Two decades later, the hospital moved \nto its current location and opened a new 50-bed facility.\n  Then, in 1995, the medical center began extending its services into \nneighboring communities with the opening of a facility in Sedona. \nLater, new facilities would open in Camp Verde and Oak Creek. In 1998, \nthe hospital became known as it is today, as the Verde Valley Medical \nCenter, and 8 years later, the expansion project that has just been \ncompleted would begin.\n  With the opening of the expansion, Verde Valley Medical Center is \nready to build on its record of serving the north-central Arizona \ncommunity. During the 2008 fiscal year, the center served about 77,000 \npatients. This recent expansion will help to ensure that the medical \ncenter continues to meet the health care needs of Arizonans, just as it \nhas for the past 70 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8165-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I would like to speak about the new \nmarkets tax credit, NMTC--a vital development financing tool for low-\nincome communities that is set to expire at end of this year unless \nCongress takes action.\n  The NMTC was signed into law 8 years ago in order to attract private \ninvestment to economically distressed communities by offering a modest \nFederal tax credit as an incentive for investors. Since its inception, \nthis program has proven remarkably effective.\n  According to the Treasury Department, as of the first of July, the \nNMTC has been responsible for $11 billion of new investment in \neconomically distressed communities across the country, including $600 \nmillion for community development entities based in Massachusetts. A \nJanuary 2007 General Accountability Office report indicates that 88 \npercent of NMTC investors would not have made a particular investment \nin a low income community without the credit, and 69 percent had never \nmade such an investment prior to working with the NMTC.\n  The NMTC program has successfully generated private investment in \nlow-income communities. Community development entities, CDEs, that \nadminister the program funds are frequently involved with communities \nwith poverty rates higher than 30 percent and unemployment rates \nsignificantly greater than the national average. This program, by \nmerging public and private investments, is infusing these communities \nwith the resources to begin new businesses, create new jobs, build new \nhomes, and jumpstart their economies.\n  In Massachusetts, six community development entities have been \nawarded credit allocations. One such entity in Massachusetts, the \nRockland Trust Company, is a commercial bank that has been serving Cape \nCod, southeastern Massachusetts, and Rhode Island for over 100 years. \nIn an effort to serve areas with high employment and low income, \nRockland Trust applied for an NMTC allocation to expand its capacity to \noffer financing products that could effectively serve these \ncommunities. Since 2004, the Rockland Trust has received $75 million in \ncredits, which have been used to finance 70 different non-real estate \nand real estate business loans ranging in size from $50,000 to $8 \nmillion. The NMTC loans made by Rockland Trust have been instrumental \nin financing the acquisition and redevelopment of over 2.1 million \nsquare feet of real estate and thus far have contributed to the \ncreation of over 1,200 jobs.\n  The Massachusetts Housing Investments Corporation, MHIC, based in \nBoston, is another entity putting the tax credit to work in \nMassachusetts. MHIC has used the credit to finance a range of \ncommercial and industrial real estate projects, large and small, that \nwould not have been possible without the financing brought in by the \ncredit. One such project, the Holyoke Health Center, HHC, is a \nfederally qualified health center located in a community of 40,000 with \na poverty rate of 27 percent and the highest per capita mortality rate \nand rate of teen births in the United States. After many unsuccessful \nattempts to obtain financing for its expansion, the Holyoke Health \nCenter approached MHIC and within months the project was approved, \nachieved closing, and began construction. MHIC helped finance the \nlargest investment ever made in Holyoke, and created a financing \nstructure that has become a national model for other community health \ncare expansion projects nationwide. The new state-of-the-art Holyoke \nfacility houses primary care and laboratory services, an on-site \npharmacy, a dental clinic, counseling services, a day care facility \naccommodating 100 preschool children. The project created 210 \nconstruction related jobs as well as 239 permanent jobs principally for \nHolyoke residents.\n  I am a strong supporter of NMTC because I have seen it work in \nMassachusetts and I believe in its potential to revitalize communities \nand businesses that are too often left out of the mainstream market. I \nencourage my colleagues to join me in strong support of the extension \nof the NMTC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8165-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8165-S8169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PAYMENTS TO PHYSICIANS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, several years ago I started looking at \nthe financial relationships between physicians and drug companies. I \nfirst began these inquiries by examining payments from pharmaceutical \ncompanies to physicians serving on Food and Drug Administration \nadvisory boards. More recently, I began looking at professors at \nmedical schools and their financial relationships with pharmaceutical \ncompanies. In turn, I scrutinized the grants that these physicians may \nhave received from the National Institutes of Health.\n  I first examined a psychiatrist at the University of Cincinnati. Then \nI looked at three research psychiatrists who took millions of dollars \nfrom the drug companies and failed to fully report their financial \nrelationships to Harvard and Mass General Hospital.\n  I then discovered a doctor at Stanford who founded a company that is \nseeking the Food and Drug Administration's approval to market a drug \nfor psychotic depression. The National Institutes of Health is funding \nsome of the research on this drug, which is being led by this same \nStanford scientist. If his own research finds that the drug is \nsuccessful, this researcher stands to gain millions. The NIH later \nremoved this researcher from the grant.\n  I would now like to address two doctors with the University of Texas \nSystem.\n  Dr. Augustus John Rush is a psychiatrist at the University of Texas \nSouthwestern Medical Center. During 2003-2005, Dr. Rush received an NIH \ngrant to conduct a clinical training program. This program helped \ntrainees understand how to conduct proper clinical trials and also \ndealt with medical ethics.\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\n  However, just 2 years before getting this Federal grant, Dr. Rush \nfailed to report all of the money that Eli Lilly paid him. Dr. Rush \ndisclosed $3,000 in payments from the company, but Eli Lilly tells me \nthat they paid Dr. Rush $17,802 in 2001.\n  I would also like to discuss Dr. Karen Wagner, a professor at the \nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.\n  Dr. Wagner was one of the authors on a Paxil study known as Study \n329. This study was published in 2001.\n  Study 329 was cited in a New York case where GlaxoSmithKline was \ncharged with ``repeated and persistent fraud.'' Part of the case \nagainst Glaxo was that the drug company promoted positive findings but \ndidn't publicize unfavorable data.\n  In March 2006, Dr. Wagner was being deposed in a case on Paxil. \nDuring that deposition, Dr. Wagner was asked how much money she had \ntaken from drug companies over the previous 5 years.\n  Her response? She said: ``I don't know.'' In fact, she testified that \nshe couldn't even estimate how much money she received from the drug \ncompanies.\n  According to Glaxo, they paid Dr. Wagner over $53,220 in 2000. In \n2001, when study 329 was published the company reported paying her \n$18,255.\n  During many of these years, Dr. Wagner has led NIH-funded studies on \ndepression. These studies involved Paxil and Prozac; an antidepressant \nmade by Eli Lilly. Eli Lilly reported to me that they paid Dr. Wagner \nover $11,000 in 2002. However, Dr. Wagner did not disclose this payment \nto the University of Texas.\n  Apparently, the University of Texas Medical Branch didn't require \ntheir physicians to disclose their financial relationships with the \ndrug industry, until around 2002. But federal guidelines from 1995 are \nclear that researchers need to disclose this money when they take a \ngrant from the NIH.\n  What makes this even more interesting is that from September 2003 \nthrough August 2004, Dr. Wagner was a voting member of the Conflict of \nInterest Committee at her university. That is right, she was one of the \nuniversity's experts on conflicts of interest during the same time that \nshe was not reporting her outside income.\n  Before closing, I would like to say that the University of Texas \nSystem has been very cooperative in this investigation. And I \nappreciate the continued cooperation of companies like GlaxoSmithKline \nand Eli Lilly.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have my letter to the University of Texas \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2008.\n     Mark G. Yudof,\n     Chancellor, The University of Texas System, Austin, TX. \n         78701.\n       Dear Mr. Yudof: The United States Senate Committee on \n     Finance (Committee) has jurisdiction over the Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs and, accordingly, a responsibility to the \n     more than 80 million Americans who receive health care \n     coverage under these programs. As Ranking Member of the \n     Committee, I have a duty to protect the health of Medicare \n     and Medicaid beneficiaries and safeguard taxpayer dollars \n     appropriated for these programs. The actions taken by \n     recognized experts, like those at the University of Texas \n     (University/Texas System) system's medical schools who are \n     discussed throughout this letter, often have a profound \n     impact upon the decisions made by taxpayer funded programs \n     like Medicare and Medicaid and the way that patients are \n     treated and funds expended.\n       Moreover, and as has been detailed in several studies and \n     news reports, funding by pharmaceutical companies can \n     influence scientific studies, continuing medical education, \n     and the prescribing patterns of doctors. Because I am \n     concerned that there has been little transparency on this \n     matter, I have sent letters to almost two dozen research \n     universities across the United States. In these letters, I \n     asked questions about the conflict of interest disclosure \n     forms signed by some of their faculty. Universities require \n     doctors to report their related outside income, but I am \n     concerned that these requirements are sometimes disregarded.\n       I have also been taking a keen interest in the almost $24 \n     billion annually appropriated to the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH) to fund grants at various institutions such as \n     yours. As you know, institutions are required to manage a \n     grantee's conflicts of interest. But I am learning that this \n     task is made difficult because physicians do not consistently \n     report all the payments received from drug and device \n     companies.\n       To bring some greater transparency to this issue, Senator \n     Kohl and I introduced the Physician Payments Sunshine Act \n     (Act). This Act will require drug and device companies to \n     report publicly any payments that they make to doctors, \n     within certain parameters.\n       I am writing to assess the implementation of financial \n     disclosure policies of the University of Texas system. In \n     response to my letters of October 26, 2007, your University \n     provided me with the financial disclosure reports that Dr. \n     Augustus John Rush, Jr., at the University of Texas \n     Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (UTSW) and Dr. Karen \n     Wagner at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston \n     (UTMB) filed during the period of January 2000 through June \n     2007. (the Physicians)\n       My staff investigators carefully reviewed each of the \n     Physicians' disclosure forms and detailed the payments \n     disclosed. I then asked that the University confirm the \n     accuracy of the information. In February 2008 your counsel \n     provided clarification and additional information from the \n     Physicians pursuant to my inquiry.\n       In addition, I contacted executives at several major \n     pharmaceutical companies and device manufacturers (the \n     Companies) and asked them to list the payments that they made \n     to Drs. Wagner and Rush during the years 2000 through 2007. \n     These Companies voluntarily and cooperatively reported \n     additional payments that the Physicians do not appear to have \n     disclosed to the University.\n       Because these disclosures do not match, I am attaching a \n     chart intended to provide a few examples of the data reported \n     to me. This chart contains columns showing the payments \n     disclosed in the forms the Physicians filed with the \n     University and amounts reported by some of the Companies.\n       I understand that UTMB did not require that dollar amounts \n     be reported in financial disclosures until 2002, despite \n     federal requirements which required such reporting for NIH \n     grantees in 1995. I also understand that UTSW's disclosures \n     do not disclose if payments were made during a calendar year \n     or an academic year.\n       I would appreciate further information to see if the \n     problems I have found with these two Physicians are systemic \n     within the University System.\n\n\n                     INSTITUTIONAL AND NIH POLICIES\n\n       The Texas System requires that all compensation (income or \n     monetary value given in return for services) be reported. Its \n     policies consider compensation in the aggregate that meet or \n     exceeded $10,000 for the current calendar year, or are \n     expected to meet or exceed that amount in the next 12 months, \n     to be a significant financial interest.\n       Further, federal regulations place several requirements on \n     a university/hospital when its researchers apply for NIH \n     grants. These regulations are intended to ensure a level of \n     objectivity in publicly funded research, and state in \n     pertinent part that NIH investigators must disclose to \n     their institution any ``significant financial interest'' \n     that may appear to affect the results of a study. NIH \n     interprets ``significant financial interest'' to mean at \n     least $10,000 in value or 5 percent ownership in a single \n     entity.\n       Based upon information available to me, it appears that \n     each of the Physicians identified above received NIH grants \n     to conduct studies. During the years 2003-2005, Dr. Rush \n     received an NIH grant to conduct a clinical intervention \n     training program that was to provide trainees with, among \n     other things, ``. . . knowledge and experience in the proper \n     conduct of clinical intervention research, ethics, human \n     subjects issues . . .'' However, my inquiry discovered that \n     Dr. Rush did not disclose all of the drug and device industry \n     payments to the University. For example, in 2001, Dr. Rush \n     disclosed $3,000 in outside income for his work as an \n     Advisory Board member for the Eli Lilly Company (Lilly). In \n     contrast, Lilly reported to me that it paid Dr. Rush $17,802 \n     for advisory services that year.\n       For calendar years 2000 through 2008, Dr. Wagner led NIH-\n     funded studies on depression. These studies involved drugs \n     produced by Lilly (Prozac) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) (Paxil). \n     Lilly reported to me that it paid Dr. Wagner over $11,000 in \n     2002. However, and based upon the information in my \n     possession, Dr. Wagner did not disclose this payment to the \n     University in 2002 the first year that UTMB required \n     financial disclosures from its faculty.\n       It seems that Dr. Wagner also did not report payments she \n     received from GSK. GSK reported paying Dr. Wagner $53,220 in \n     2000--the first year of the NIH grant. Further, GSK reported \n     paying her $18,255 in 2001, and $34,961 in 2002 and $31,799 \n     in 2003. Between the years of 2000 through 2005, GSK reported \n     paying Dr. Wagner $160,404. The only report Dr. Wagner made \n     of these payments was in 2005 when she reported $600 from \n     GSK.\n       In light of the information set forth above, I ask your \n     continued cooperation in examining conflicts of interest. In \n     my opinion, institutions across the United States must be \n     able to rely on the representations of its faculty to ensure \n     the integrity of medicine, academia, and the grant-making \n     process. At the same time, should the Physician Payments \n     Sunshine Act become law, institutions like yours will be able \n     to access a database that will set forth the payments made to \n     all doctors, including your faculty members.\n       Accordingly, I request that your respective institutions \n     respond to the following questions and requests for \n     information. For each response, please repeat the enumerated \n     request and follow with the appropriate answer.\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\n       (1) For each of the NIH grants received by the Physicians, \n     please confirm that the Physicians reported to the University \n     of Texas System's designated official ``the existence of [a] \n     conflicting interest.'' Please provide separate responses for \n     each grant received for the period from January 1, 2000 to \n     the present, and provide any supporting documentation for \n     each grant identified.\n       (2) For each grant identified above, please explain how the \n     University ensured ``that the interest has been managed, \n     reduced, or eliminated.'' Please provide an individual \n     response for each grant that each of the Physicians received \n     from January 2000 to the present, and provide any \n     documentation to support each claim.\n       (3) Please report on the status of the University's review \n     of the discrepancies in the financial disclosures made by \n     Drs. Rush and Wagner to the University, including what \n     action, if any, will be considered.\n       (4) For Drs. Rush and Wagner, please report whether a \n     determination can be made as to whether or not there is/was a \n     violation of the guidelines governing clinical trials and the \n     need to report conflicts of interest to an institutional \n     review board (IRB). Please respond by naming each clinical \n     trial for which the doctor was the principal investigator, \n     along with confirmation that conflicts of interest were \n     reported, if possible.\n       (5) Please provide a total dollar figure for all NIH monies \n     received annually by the Texas System. This request covers \n     the period of 2000 through 2007.\n       (6) Please provide a list of all NIH grants received by the \n     University of Texas System. This request covers the period of \n     2000 through 2007. For each grant please provide the \n     following:\n       a. Primary Investigator;\n       b. Grant Title;\n       c.

Mr. President, on August 1, 2008, the Senate passed H.R. \n6432, the Animal Drug User Fee Amendments of 2008. Title I of this bill \nincludes the reauthorization of the FDA's animal drug user fee program, \nwhile title II of this bill establishes the FDA's generic animal drug \nuser fee program.\n  Performance goals, existing outside of the statute, accompany the \nauthorization of animal drug user fees and animal generic drug user \nfees. These goals represent realistic projections of what the Food and \nDrug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine can accomplish \nwith industry cooperation. The Secretary of Health and Human Services \nforwarded these goals to the chairmen of the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions of the Senate, in documents entitled \n``Animal Drug User Fee Act Performance Goals and Procedures'' and \n``Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act Performance Goals and Procedures.''\n  According to section 101(b) of H.R. 6432, ``the fees authorized by \nthe amendments made in this Act will be dedicated toward expediting the \nanimal drug development process and the review of new and supplemental \nanimal drug applications and investigational animal drug submissions as \nset forth in the goals identified, for purposes of part 4 of subchapter \nC of chapter VII of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in the \nletters from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the Chairman \nof the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives \nand the Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions of the Senate as set forth in the Congressional Record.''\n  According to section 201(b) of H.R. 6432, ``the fees authorized by \nthis title will be dedicated toward expediting the generic new animal \ndrug development process and the review of abbreviated applications for \ngeneric new animal drugs, supplemental abbreviated applications for \ngeneric new animal drugs, and investigational submissions for generic \nnew animal drugs as set forth in the goals identified in the letters \nfrom the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the Chairman of the \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and \nthe Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nof the Senate as set forth in the Congressional Record.''\n  Today I am submitting for the Record these documents, on behalf of \nSenator Kennedy, who could not be here today, which were forwarded to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on July 30, \n2008, as well as the letter from Secretary Leavitt that accompanied the \ntransmittal of this document.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have material printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  The Secretary of\n\n\n                                    Health and Human Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2008.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to formally transmit the \n     Agreements on the Goals and Procedures for the \n     reauthorization of the Animal Drug User Fee Act and new \n     authorization for Animal Generic Drug User Fees. These \n     documents incorporate the agreement made between the animal \n     drug industry and FDA and contain the goals for the review of \n     animal drug applications over the FY 2009 through FY 2013 \n     period. These Goals and Procedures are a companion to the \n     authorizing legislation reauthorizing the animal drug user \n     fees and enacting new animal generic drug fees and they \n     represent the commitment of the Administration to apply the \n     user fees authorized by Congress towards the outlined goals \n     and procedures.\n       We appreciate your leadership and considerable efforts of \n     your Committee to make it possible to reauthorize the \n     important animal drug user fee program and enact a \n     corresponding user fee program for generic animal drugs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael O. Leavitt.\n       Attachments.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Animal Drug User Fee Act Performance Goals and Procedures\n\n       The goals and procedures of the FDA Center for Veterinary \n     Medicine (CVM) as agreed to under the ``Animal Drug User Fee \n     Act of 2008'' are summarized as follows:\n       1. Application/Submission Goals \n       a. For the application/submission goals below, the term \n     ``review and act on'' is understood to mean the issuance of a \n     complete action letter after the complete review of an animal \n     drug application, supplemental animal drug application, or \n     investigational animal drug submission which either (1) \n     approves an animal drug application or supplemental \n     application or notifies a sponsor that an investigational \n     animal drug submission is complete or (2) sets forth in \n     detail the specific deficiencies in such animal drug \n     application, supplemental animal drug application, or \n     investigational animal drug submission and, where \n     appropriate, the actions necessary to place such an \n     application, supplemental application, or submission in \n     condition for approval. Within 30 days of submission, FDA \n     shall refuse to file an animal drug application, supplemental \n     animal drug application, or their reactivation, which is \n     determined to be insufficient on its face or otherwise of \n     unacceptable quality for review upon initial inspection as \n     per 21 CFR 514.110. Thus, the agency will refuse to file an \n     application containing numbers or types of errors, or flaws \n     in the development plan, sufficient to cause the quality of \n     the entire submission to be questioned to the extent that it \n     cannot reasonably be reviewed. Within 60 days of submission, \n     FDA will refuse to review an investigational animal drug \n     submission which is determined to be insufficient on its face \n     or otherwise of unacceptable quality upon initial inspection \n     using criteria and procedures similar to those found in 21 \n     CFR 514.110. A decision to refuse to file an application or \n     to refuse to review a submission as described above will \n     result in the application or submission not being entered \n     into the cohort upon which the relevant user fee goal is \n     based. The agency will keep a record of the numbers and types \n     of such refusals and include them in its annual performance \n     report.\n       b. FDA may request minor amendments to animal drug \n     applications, supplemental animal drug applications, and \n     investigational animal drug submissions during its review of \n     the application or submission. At its discretion, the Agency \n     may extend an internal due date (but not a user fee goal) to \n     allow for the complete review of an application or submission \n     for which a minor amendment is requested. If a pending \n     application is amended with significant changes, the amended \n     application may be considered resubmitted, thereby \n     effectively resetting the clock to the date FDA received the \n     amendment. The same policy applies for investigational animal \n     drug submissions.\n       c. The term ``end-review amendment'' is understood to mean \n     an amendment to an animal drug application, supplemental \n     animal drug application, or investigational animal drug \n     submission that is requested by the Agency after it has \n     completed its review of the submitted information and \n     determines that the submission of additional non-substantial \n     data or information would likely complete the application or \n     submission. This term does not include minor amendments \n     requested by the Agency during review of applications or \n     submissions that do not impact upon the user fee goals, as \n     described in paragraph 1.b.\n       d. The term ``submission date'' is understood to mean the \n     date CVM's Document Control Unit receives an application or \n     submission.\n       2. Non-administrative Animal Drug Applications \n       a. The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of non-\n     administrative animal drug applications and reactivations of \n     such applications within\n       i. 180 days after the submission date (Day 180) if the \n     Agency determines that the application is complete or \n     incomplete. An application is incomplete if it would require \n     substantial data or information to enable the Agency to \n     complete a comprehensive review of the application and reach \n     a decision on the approvability of the application; or\n       ii. 220 days after the submission date if the Agency \n     determines that the submission of additional non-substantial \n     data or information would likely complete the application and \n     electronically requests an end-review amendment to the \n     application on or before Day 180, but the sponsor fails to \n     file such amendment on or before Day 210. If a sponsor files \n     an amendment after Day 210, then the amendment is ineligible \n     for consideration as an end-review amendment, the extended \n     performance goal (345 days) will not apply, and a complete \n     action letter will be issued by Day 220 for the original \n     application; or\n       iii. 345 days after the submission date if the Agency \n     electronically requests an end-review amendment to the \n     application on or before Day 180 and the sponsor files an \n     end-review amendment on or before Day 210.\n       b. The end-review amendment procedure is not intended to \n     prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency review of \n     an animal drug application as described in paragraph 1.b. \n     above.\n       3. Administration Animal Drug Applications\n       a. Review and act on 90 percent of administrative animal \n     drug applications (NADAs submitted after all scientific \n     decisions have been made in the investigational animal drug \n     process, i.e., prior to the submission of the NADA) within 60 \n     days after the submission date.\n       4. Non-manufacturing Supplemental Animal Drug Applications\n       a. The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of non-\n     manufacturing supplemental animal drug applications (i.e. \n     supplemental animal drug applications for which safety or \n     effectiveness data are required) and reactivations of such \n     supplemental applications within\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\n       1. 180 days after submission date (Day 180) if the Agency \n     determines that the application is complete or incomplete. An \n     application is incomplete if it would require substantial \n     data or information to enable the Agency to complete a \n     comprehensive review of the application and reach a decision \n     on the approvability of the application; or\n       ii. 220 days after the submission date if the Agency \n     determines that the submission of additional non-substantial \n     data or information would likely complete the application and \n     electronically requests an end-review amendment to the \n     application on or before Day 180, but the sponsor fails to \n     file such amendment on or before Day 210. If a sponsor files \n     an amendment after Day 210, then the amendment is ineligible \n     for consideration as an end-review amendment. the extended \n     performance goal (345 days) will not apply, and a complete \n     action letter will be issued by Day 220 for the original \n     application; or\n       iii. 345 days after the submission date if the Agency \n     electronically requests an end-review amendment to the \n     application on or before Day 180 and the sponsor files an \n     end-review amendment on or before Day 210.\n       b. The end-review amendment procedure is not intended to \n     prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency review of a \n     supplemental new animal drug application as described in \n     paragraph 1.b. above.\n       5. Manufacturing Supplemental Animal Drug Applications\n       a. Review and act on 90 percent of manufacturing \n     supplemental animal drug applications and reactivations of \n     such supplemental applications within 120 days after the \n     submission date.\n       6. Investigational Animal Drug Study Submissions\n       a. The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of \n     investigational animal drug study submissions within\n       i. 180 days after the submission date (Day 180) if the \n     Agency determines that the submission is complete or \n     incomplete. A submission is incomplete if it would require \n     substantial data or information to enable the Agency to \n     complete a comprehensive review of the study submission and \n     reach a decision on the issue(s) presented in the submission; \n     or\n       ii. 220 days after the submission date if the Agency \n     determines that the submission of additional non-substantial \n     data or information would likely complete the submission and \n     electronically requests an end-review amendment to the \n     submission on or before Day 180, but the sponsor fails to \n     submit such amendment on or before Day 210. If a sponsor \n     submits an amendment after Day 210, then the amendment is \n     ineligible for consideration as an end-review amendment, the \n     extended performance goal (270 days) will not apply, and a \n     complete action letter will be issued by Day 220 for the \n     original submission; or\n       iii. 270 days after the submission date if the Agency \n     electronically requests an end-review amendment to the \n     submission on or before Day 180 and the sponsor submits an \n     end-review amendment on or before Day 210.\n       b. The end-review amendment procedure is not intended to \n     prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency review of a \n     study submission as described in paragraph 1.b. above.\n       7. Investigational Animal Drug Protocol without Data \n     Submissions\n       a. Review and act on 90 percent of investigational animal \n     drug submissions consisting of protocols without substantial \n     data, that the Agency and the sponsor consider to be an \n     essential part of the basis for making the decision to \n     approve or not approve an animal drug application or \n     supplemental animal drug application, within\n       i. 60 days after the submission date (Day 60) if the Agency \n     does not request an end-review amendment to the protocol.\n       (1) If the Agency determines that the protocol is \n     acceptable, the Agency will notify the sponsor of this \n     decision electronically on or before Day 50, followed by a \n     complete action letter; or\n       (2) If the Agency determines that a protocol is not \n     acceptable, the Agency will notify the sponsor of this \n     decision electronically, providing preliminary broad areas of \n     protocol deficiency, on or before Day 50, with the \n     subsequently issued complete action letter providing the \n     detailed protocol assessment. The sponsor may contact the \n     Agency for a brief clarification of these areas of \n     deficiency prior to the issuance of the complete action \n     letter; or\n       ii. 75 days after the submission date if the Agency \n     electronically requests an end-review amendment to the \n     protocol on or before Day 50, but the sponsor fails to submit \n     such amendment within 10 days of the amendment request date. \n     If a sponsor files an amendment more than 10 days after the \n     amendment request date, then the amendment is ineligible for \n     consideration as an end-review amendment, the extended \n     performance goal (refer to 7.a.iii below) will not apply, and \n     a complete action letter will be issued by Day 75 for the \n     original submission; or\n       iii. the greater of 60 days after the original protocol is \n     received by the Agency or 20 days after the amended protocol \n     is received by the Agency if the Agency electronically \n     requests an end-review amendment on or before Day 50 and the \n     sponsor submits such amendment within 10 days of the date the \n     amendment is requested.\n       b. Sponsors are not required to submit study protocols for \n     review. However, for each voluntarily submitted protocol for \n     a study that the Agency and the sponsor consider to be an \n     essential part of the basis for making the decision to \n     approve or not approve an animal drug application or \n     supplemental animal drug application, the Agency will issue a \n     complete action letter providing comments resulting from a \n     complete review of the protocol. The complete action letter \n     will be as detailed as possible considering the quality and \n     level of detail of the protocol submission; will include a \n     succinct assessment of the protocol; and will state whether \n     the Agency agrees, disagrees, or lacks sufficient information \n     to reach a decision that the protocol design, execution \n     plans, and data analyses are adequate to achieve the \n     objectives of the study.\n       c. If the Agency determines that a protocol is acceptable, \n     this represents an agreement that the data generated by the \n     protocol can be used to support a safety or effectiveness \n     decision regarding the subject animal drug. The fundamental \n     agreement is that having agreed to the design, execution, or \n     analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under this process, \n     the Agency will not later alter its perspectives on the \n     issues of design, execution, or analyses unless the Agency by \n     written order determines that a substantiated scientific \n     requirement essential to the assessment of the study appeared \n     after the Agency's protocol assessment, or public or animal \n     health concerns unrecognized at the time of protocol \n     assessment under this process are evident.\n       d. The end-review amendment procedure is not intended to \n     prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency review of a \n     protocol without data submission as described in paragraph \n     1.b. above.\n       8. Electronic Review of Applications/Submissions\n       a. The Agency will develop an electronic submission tool \n     for industry submissions and online review capability within \n     24 months of appropriated ADUFA funds for FY 2009. The Agency \n     will consult with the sponsors in the development of this \n     tool.\n       9. Pre-Approval Foreign Inspections\n       a. The Agency and regulated industry are committed to \n     improving the review and business processes that will \n     facilitate the timely scheduling and conducting of pre-\n     approval inspections (PAIs). To improve the timeliness and \n     predictability of foreign PAIs, sponsors may voluntarily \n     submit 1) at the beginning of the calendar year, a list of \n     foreign manufacturing facilities that are subjects of animal \n     drug applications, supplemental animal drug applications, or \n     investigational animal drug submissions and may be subject to \n     foreign PAIs for the following fiscal year; and 2) a \n     notification 30 days prior to submitting an animal drug \n     application, a supplemental animal drug application, or \n     investigational animal drug submission that informs the \n     Agency that the application includes a foreign \n     manufacturing facility. Should any changes to the annual \n     list occur after its submission to the Agency, the sponsor \n     may provide the updated information to the Agency.\n       b. The Agency will keep a record of the number of foreign \n     PAIs conducted for new animal drug applications, along with \n     the average time for completing the PAIs, and include this \n     information in its annual performance report. The time for \n     completing the PAIs is understood to mean the time from the \n     date of scheduling the inspection through notification to the \n     Center of inspectional findings.\n       10. Public Workshops\n       a. The Agency and regulated industry agree to participate \n     in 10 public workshops by the end of FY 2013 on mutually \n     agreed upon topics.\n       11. Additional Efforts Related to Performance Goals\n       a. The Agency will review all submissions in accordance \n     with procedures for working within a queue. An application/\n     submission that is not reviewed within the applicable \n     Application/Submission Goal time frame (noted above) will be \n     reviewed with the highest possible priority among those \n     pending.\n       b. The Agency and the regulated industry agree that the use \n     of both formal meetings (e.g., presubmission conferences, \n     workshops, etc.) and informal communication by both parties \n     is critical to ensure high submission quality such that the \n     above performance goals can be achieved.\n       c. The Agency and the regulated industry agree to explore \n     and discuss the applicable use of pharmacokinetic/\n     pharmacodynamic data in the development and evaluation of new \n     animal drugs submitted for approval.\n       d. The Agency and the regulated industry agree to explore \n     opportunities for exchange of information regarding the \n     characteristics of a new animal drug, and to identify safety \n     and effectiveness issues as early as possible in the drug \n     development process.\n       e. The Agency and regulated industry commit to work \n     together to explore shorter timeframes commensurate with the \n     magnitude of the submitted data/information referenced under \n     11.c and 11.d.\n       12. Workload Adjustment\n       The Animal Drug User Fee Act requires FDA to annually \n     adjust fee revenues after FY 2008 to reflect changes in \n     review workload utilizing a weighted average of animal drug \n     applications, supplemental animal drug applications for which \n     data with respect to safety or effectiveness are required, \n     manufacturing supplemental animal drug applications, \n     investigational animal drug study submissions, and \n     investigational animal drug protocol submissions. The Agency \n     will use the method detailed below to calculate the workload \n     adjustment, and the percent increase in fees will be the \n     amount of the\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\n     workload adjuster that is greater than one (1.0).\n       The term ``workload adjuster'' applicable to a fiscal year \n     consists of the sum of the following 5 components:\n       a. The percent of change in the total number of original \n     and reactivated animal drug applications submitted (comparing \n     the five-year average number of such submissions for  fiscal \n     years 1998-2002 to the five-year average for the most \n     recent five-year period ending June 30 before the start of \n     the next fiscal year) times a weighting factor that is the \n     percent of direct review time spent on the review of \n     original and reactivated new animal drug applications over \n     the most recent five-year period.\n       b. The percent of change in the total number of original \n     and reactivated supplemental animal drug applications \n     submitted for which data with respect to safety or \n     effectiveness are required (comparing the five-year average \n     number of such submissions for fiscal years 1998--2002 to the \n     five-year average for the most recent five-year period ending \n     June 30 before the start of the next fiscal year) times a \n     weighting factor that is the percent of direct review time \n     spent on the review of original and reactivated supplemental \n     animal drug applications for which data with respect to \n     safety and effectiveness are required over the most recent \n     five-year period.\n       c. The percent of change in the total number of original \n     and reactivated manufacturing supplemental animal drug \n     applications submitted (comparing the five-year average \n     number of such submissions for fiscal years 1998--2002 to the \n     five-year average for the most recent five-year period ending \n     June 30 before the start of the next fiscal year) times a \n     weighting factor that is the percent of direct review time \n     spent on the review of original and reactivated manufacturing \n     supplemental animal drug applications over the most recent \n     five-year period.\n       d. The percent of change in the total number of \n     investigational animal drug study submissions submitted \n     (comparing the five-year average number of such submissions \n     for fiscal years 1998--2002 to the five-year average for the \n     most recent five-year period ending June 30 before the start \n     of the next fiscal year) times a weighting factor that is the \n     percent of direct review time spent on the review of \n     investigational animal drug study submissions over the most \n     recent five-year period.\n       e. The percent of change in the total number of submitted \n     investigational animal drug protocol submissions (comparing \n     the five-year average number of such submissions for fiscal \n     years 1998--2002 to the five-year average for the most recent \n     five-year period ending June 30 before the start of the next \n     fiscal year) times a weighting factor that is the percent of \n     direct review time spent on the review of investigational \n     animal drug protocol submissions over the most recent five-\n     year period.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act Performance Goals and Procedures\n\n       The goals and procedures of the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA or the Agency) as agreed to under the \n     ``Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act of 2008'' are summarized \n     as follows:\n       Five-Year Goals (to be implemented by September 30, 2013)\n       1. Review and act on 90 percent of non-administrative \n     original abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs) \n     and reactivations of such applications within 270 days after \n     the submission date.\n       2. Review and act on 90 percent of manufacturing \n     supplemental ANADAs and reactivations of such supplemental \n     applications within 270 days after the submission date.\n       3. Review and act on 90 percent of generic investigational \n     new animal drug (JINAD) study submissions within 270 days \n     after submission date.\n       4. Review and act on 90 percent of JINAD submissions \n     consisting of protocols without substantial data, that the \n     Agency and the sponsor consider to be an essential part of \n     the basis for making the decision to approve or not approve \n     an ANADA or supplemental ANADA, within 100 days after the \n     submission date.\n       5. Review and act on 90 percent of administrative ANADAs \n     (ANADAs submitted after all scientific decisions have been \n     made in the JINAD process, i.e., prior to the submission of \n     the ANADA) within 100 days after the submission date.\n       For the application/submission goals above, the term \n     ``review and act on'' is understood to mean the issuance of a \n     complete action letter after the complete review of an \n     original ANADA, supplemental ANADA, or JINAD submission which \n     either (1) approves an original or supplemental ANADA or \n     notifies a sponsor that a JINAD submission is complete or (2) \n     sets forth in detail the specific deficiencies in such \n     original or supplemental ANADA or JINAD submission and, where \n     appropriate, the actions necessary to place such an original \n     or supplemental ANADA or JINAD submission in condition for \n     approval (``incomplete letter''). Within 30 days of \n     submission, FDA shall refuse to file an original or \n     supplemental ANADA, or their reactivation, which is \n     determined to be insufficient on its face or otherwise of \n     unacceptable quality for review upon initial inspection as \n     per 21 CFR 514.110. Thus, the agency will refuse to file an \n     application containing numbers or types of errors, or flaws \n     in the development plan, sufficient to cause the quality of \n     the entire submission to be questioned to the extent that it \n     cannot reasonably be reviewed. Within 60 days of submission, \n     FDA will refuse to review a JINAD submission which is \n     determined to be insufficient on its face or otherwise of \n     unacceptable quality upon initial inspection using criteria \n     and procedures similar to those found in 21 CFR 514.110. A \n     decision to refuse to file an application or to refuse to \n     review a submission as described above will result in the \n     application or submission not being entered into the cohort \n     upon which the relevant user fee goal is based. The agency \n     will keep a record of the numbers and types of such refusals \n     and include them in its annual performance report.\n       FDA may request minor amendments to original or \n     supplemental ANADAs and JINAD submissions during its review \n     of the application or submission. At its discretion, the \n     Agency may extend an internal due date (but not a user fee \n     goal) to allow for the complete review of an application or \n     submission for which a minor amendment is requested. If a \n     pending application is amended with significant changes, the \n     amended application may be considered resubmitted, thereby \n     effectively resetting the clock to the date FDA received the \n     amendment. The same policy applies for JINAD submissions.\n       Sponsors are not required to submit study protocols for \n     review. However, for each voluntarily submitted protocol for \n     a study that the Agency and the sponsor consider to be an \n     essential part of the basis for making the decision to \n     approve or not approve an original or supplemental ANADA, \n     the Agency will issue a complete action letter providing \n     comments resulting from a complete review of the protocol. \n     The complete action letter will be as detailed as possible \n     considering the quality and level of detail of the \n     protocol submission; will include a succinct assessment of \n     the protocol; and will state whether the Agency agrees, \n     disagrees, or lacks sufficient information to reach a \n     decision that the protocol design, execution plans, and \n     data analyses are adequate to achieve the objectives of \n     the study. If the Agency determines that a protocol is \n     acceptable, this represents an agreement that the data \n     generated by the protocol can be used to support a safety \n     or effectiveness decision regarding the subject new animal \n     drug. The fundamental agreement is that having agreed to \n     the design, execution, or analyses proposed in protocols \n     reviewed under this process, the Agency will not later \n     alter its perspectives on the issues of design, execution, \n     or analyses unless the Agency issues a written order that \n     a substantiated scientific requirement essential to the \n     assessment of the study appeared after the Agency's \n     protocol assessment, or public or animal health concerns \n     unrecognized at the time of protocol assessment under this \n     process are evident.\n       The Agency and the regulated industry agree that the use of \n     both formal meetings (e.g., presubmission conferences) and \n     informal communication by both parties is critical to ensure \n     high submission quality such that performance goals can be \n     achieved.\n       The term ``submission date'' is understood to mean the date \n     the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) Document Control \n     Unit (DCU) receives an application or submission. DCU date \n     stamps an application or submission on the day of receipt.\n       Work Queue Review Procedures\n       The Agency will review all submissions in accordance with \n     procedures for working within a queue. An application/\n     submission that is not reviewed within the applicable. \n     Application/Submission Goal time frame (noted below) will be \n     reviewed with the highest possible priority among those \n     pending.\n       Interim Goals\n       Interim Application/Submission Goals\n       FY09 90 percent of:\n       Non-administrative original ANADAs and reactivations of \n     such applications received during FY 2009 are reviewed within \n     700 days after the submission date.\n       Manufacturing supplemental ANADAs and reactivations of such \n     supplemental applications received during FY 2009 are \n     reviewed within 600 days after the submission date.\n       JINAD study submissions received during FY 2009 are \n     reviewed within 700 days after the submission date.\n       JINAD submissions consisting of protocols without \n     substantial data received during FY 2009 are reviewed within \n     400 days after the submission date.\n       Administrative ANADAs received during FY 2009 are reviewed \n     within 120 days after the submission date.\n       FY10 90 percent of:\n       Non-administrative original ANADAs and reactivations of \n     such applications received during FY 2010 are reviewed within \n     680 days after the submission date.\n       Manufacturing supplemental ANADAs and reactivations of such \n     supplemental applications received during FY 2010 are \n     reviewed within 570 days after the submission date.\n       JINAD study submissions received during FY 2010 are \n     reviewed within 680 days after the submission date.\n       JINAD submissions consisting of protocols without \n     substantial data received during FY 2010 are reviewed within \n     390 days after the submission date.\n       Administrative ANADAs received during FY 2010 are reviewed \n     within 115 days after the submission date.\n       FY11 90 percent of:\n       Non-administrative original ANADAs and reactivations of \n     such applications received during FY 2011 are reviewed within \n     500 days after the submission date.\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\n       Manufacturing supplemental ANADAs and reactivations of such \n     supplemental applications received during FY 2011 are \n     reviewed within 420 days after the submission date.\n       JINAD study submissions received during FY 2011 are \n     reviewed within 500 days after the submission date.

The Agency will refuse to file poor quality and \n     incomplete applications and submissions rather than allowing \n     them to serve as ``placeholders'' in the review queue that \n     are subsequently amended to add the missing or inadequate \n     portions.\n       The Agency recognizes that there are circumstances in which \n     a controlled amendment process can make the review of \n     similar, pending submissions more efficient, without \n     compromising the sponsor's responsibility for high quality \n     submissions. Thus, starting no later than FY 2012, if the \n     Agency requests an amendment to a non-administrative original \n     ANADA, manufacturing supplemental ANADA, JINAD study \n     submission, or a JINAD protocol submission (a ``CVM-initiated \n     amendment''), or issues an incomplete letter for such an \n     application or submission, a sponsor may request to amend \n     other, similar applications or submissions it has pending \n     with the Agency (``sponsor-initiated amendment(s)'') in \n     accordance with the following criteria:\n       1. The amended information for these similar applications \n     or submissions must be the same as in the CVM-requested \n     amendment or incomplete letter; and\n       2. The amended information must not significantly change \n     the pending application or submission; and\n       3. The amended information for these similar applications \n     or submissions must be submitted no later than:\n       a. 120 days after the submission date for a pending non-\n     administrative original ANADA, manufacturing supplemental \n     ANADA, or JINAD study submission; or\n       b. 50 days after the submission date for a pending JINAD \n     protocol.\n       If the Agency determines that the above criteria have been \n     met, it will not change the user fee goal for a pending \n     application or submission that has been amended by a sponsor-\n     initiated amendment If the above criteria have not been met, \n     the Agency may consider the application or submission \n     resubmitted on the date of the sponsor-initiated amendment, \n     thereby resetting the clock to the date FDA received the \n     amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8173-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express a word of enthusiastic \nappreciation to the thousands of courageous and principled law \nenforcement members who did their utmost to allow the Republican \nNational Convention in St. Paul to proceed in an orderly fashion. I saw \nsome of their work with my own eyes and want them to know we respect \nthem and the vital role they play in our Nation.\n  It has been said that every society is defined by the boundary \nbetween each individual's right to do whatever they want and the \nbroader community's right to peace and order. Societies without such a \nborder disintegrate into chaos and eventually repression. That boundary \nis not an abstract philosophical construct, but the life's work of law \nenforcement personnel who enforce society's laws.\n  This past week we saw an extreme test of that principle as self-\ndescribed anarchists, who represented a very small segment of thousands \nof peaceful demonstrators, sought to disrupt proceedings of the \nconvention. Law enforcement personnel acted with professionalism, \nrestraint and great skill in the face of serious threats to public \nsafety. The great irony is the actions of law enforcement guarantee the \nfuture rights of protestors to protest. I only wish the small minority \nof violent protestors had not created a climate of fear that may have \nregrettably kept observers away and reduced the patronage of St. Paul \nbusinesses, that were counting on increased sales during the convention \nweek.\n  The convention, the first in Minnesota since 1892, presented many \nlogistical obstacles. St. Paul is a town of less than 300,000, not the \nkind of metropolis where these events are usually held. The ability of \nmultiple jurisdictions to work together to scale up their response to \nthe level needed was a great example of the Minnesota can-do spirit.\n  Many thanks are due, specifically to St. Paul chief of police John \nHarrington whose team was able to ensure the safety of all of our \nvisitors, displaying Minnesota admirably in the national spotlight. \nSpecial thanks are also very much in order to the law enforcement \nofficers who traveled from all over Minnesota and the rest of the \ncountry to assist in the security efforts.\n  I would also like to take a moment to express my thanks for the \nexcellent work of a few other individuals during the convention: St. \nPaul assistant chief of police Matt Bostrum, Minneapolis chief of \npolice Tim Dolan, Minneapolis deputy chief of police Rob Allen, \nBloomington chief of police John Laux, Ramsey County sheriff Bob \nFletcher, Hennepin County sheriff Rich Stanek, and Minnesota Department \nof Public Safety commissioner Michael Campion all deserve our \ngratitude. They, and their departments, performed with excellence in \nthe way they did their duty and their integration with other \ndepartments.\n  The week of September 1, 2008, will be remembered by almost all of \nthe thousands of visitors to Minnesota as a great week and proof-\npositive that our State is capable of putting on a world class event. \nThe ability of our excellent law enforcement personnel to play defense \nagainst those who sought to disrupt the festivities allowed the people \nattending the convention and a worldwide audience to see an orderly \nprocess of our democratic society at its finest.\n  My heartfelt thanks to all the Minnesotans who worked so hard to make \nour dreams a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8173-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8173-S8175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate\n.gov to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for this opportunity to express my concerns \n     regarding the escalating price of living in Idaho due in \n     large part to the ever increasing cost of energy.\n       I work for Alaska Airlines in Boise, Idaho. My gas bill to \n     cover my commute has gone from $100 to $300 per month. My own \n     industry has been heavily affected by the obscene rise in the \n     cost of aviation fuel. Alaska Air is a profitable business. \n     They have worked hard at putting a lot of cash in the bank. \n     They never just spent their way into bankruptcy then emerged \n     a few years later with\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\n     all of their debts relieved. Now in order to stay alive, in \n     addition to raising air fares and reducing routes, they have \n     to charge seemingly ridiculous charges for the ordinary \n     services associated with travel. And still the cost of fuel \n     rises. Just today we received the second corporate letter, \n     advising us that Alaska Airlines is doing all it possibly can \n     to reduce costs, that each of us needs to be conscious of \n     everything we do and be as profitable as we can with each \n     service we provide. I work in a call center. Are those the \n     voices of Pakistani call center agents I hear at Alaska \n     Airline's front door? So not only are some of the finest \n     American customer service agents in danger of losing our \n     jobs, but the least respected of all call center personnel \n     will smudge the heretofore finest airline service in the \n     world.\n       I read that you have worked on alternative fuels. This is a \n     fine aspiration, but with what result? At present alternative \n     fuels can not even begin to touch the huge volume it would \n     take to replace gas and oil energy. As a result of corn-based \n     fuels, corn-based commodities around the world have also \n     escalated in price. Cereal, tortillas, breads, dog food, \n     chicken and beef feed, the list goes on, are all affected by \n     increased prices I pay every day. And in third world \n     countries, where such commodities are staples, people are \n     facing shortages and starvation. When the farmer cannot \n     afford to cultivate his crops, the trucker cannot afford to \n     pick up the crops and bring them to market, and the market \n     has to raise the prices of staples, how far behind are we \n     from becoming a society of haves and haves and have-nots?\n       Senator Crapo, for far too long we have let the \n     environmental movement intimidate our energy policy in this \n     country. It started with a little bit of this and that. We \n     stopped drilling for oil and gas off our scenic coasts and \n     large inland tracts of land deemed environmentally sensitive. \n     We stopped approving refineries and thereby reduced our \n     domestic supplies of fuel, relying instead on ever-increasing \n     foreign sources. One of the biggest environmental accidents \n     happened near Valdez, Alaska. Environmentalists blamed big \n     oil. Ironically the oil spilled was imported from the Middle \n     East. Accompanying all this was the slow rise in the price \n     consumers pay to run their cars and heat their homes. \n     Government has played both sides of the isle with C.A.F.E \n     standards that have not improved gas mileage so much as to \n     drive the price of cars to the same price as a good house in \n     the 1960's. Refineries further increase the price of fuel \n     required to manufacture multiple blends. All of these \n     products are heavily taxed by our government. If the oil \n     companies are accused of making obscene profits, then can we \n     not say the same thing about the never-mentioned windfall \n     profits our Federal government collects?\n       What would I do? I would ask you to start plans to find and \n     develop our best sources of domestic oil and natural gas \n     resources. I would ask you to find places in this country \n     that would just love to refine petroleum and encourage their \n     communities to do so. Just getting the plans on the board \n     would burst this bubble of inflationary speculation. (These \n     suggestions, if started today would take at least 10 years to \n     get up and running).\n       I would also ask that we start plans to build safe and \n     efficient nuclear power. France and Germany possess marvelous \n     examples we can emulate and exceed. And further we need to \n     fend off the environmentalist's incessant legal maneuvering \n     that subvert inflate the price of energy development.\n       Well, this is more than two paragraphs. But it contains in \n     my opinion, the elements we need to address today and with \n     haste.\n           Thank you.\n     Robert, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would expect that I am an average Idahoan in means of \n     monthly financial resources. The average family in my valley \n     has 2 full-time incomes of $8/hr, totaling around $2200.00/\n     mo. take-home after taxes. The average family also has to \n     travel 50 miles a day--5 days a week--just for that work. The \n     average vehicle does 20MPG. That alone is $220 in gas a month \n     ($30.00 over most people's monthly available gas budget). Now \n     figure that the nearest shopping mall is 50 miles away, and \n     the nearest shopping center is 15 miles away.\n       The economy is and will suffer to make the difference. On-\n     line shopping to the lowest bidder is becoming a necessity, \n     and activities of enjoyment are on the out. Some people find \n     themselves in a position where they can no longer afford the \n     job they have had for decades, and others like myself are \n     forced to close storefronts, and look for alternative methods \n     of doing business in order to make ends meet.\n       I consider myself a Statesman; amateur as that may be. It \n     is near impossible to educate and influence the general \n     populace toward principles of freedom and free market if my \n     means of exposure to the people is severely hampered due to \n     extravagant and unnecessary fuel costs.\n       If we want so much to be like Europe that we are willing to \n     take on their fuel costs, then we better be ready to downsize \n     our person per square foot ratios to match theirs, otherwise \n     we will desolate ourselves, and their 200 year wait for our \n     failure and re-absorption back into their kingdom will be \n     complete.\n       We must learn to look at what is seen, and what is not \n     seen. We must be able to see all the impacts, and not just 5-\n     10 years down the road. We must have 20-30 and 50-80 year \n     plans that will cause freedom from debt and servitude to \n     others, or we will weaken and eventually fall . . . even if \n     that fall may take a century, we will fall if we do not \n     change the current direction of events. Gas price recognition \n     is merely a baby step.\n       We must set up forms of governing that will ensure freedom \n     for generations, and not get caught up in the mere momentary \n     crisis.\n       I beg of you . . . as do many I know . . . be true to your \n     positions of civil servants; handle all situations with no \n     thought for self, and every thought for generations of \n     freedom for those you serve and represent, not bondage and \n     slavery and misery.\n       Be astute in your history. Civilization has repeated cycles \n     of growth and downfall. Must we make the same mistakes? Or is \n     ours truly wise enough, not pompous, to overcome the \n     challenges that face our day? Our day is truly the greatest \n     day in history . . . for we have yet to write its annals. \n     Victorious or victored. After all, only a small degree, or \n     percentage caused the great chasm that made two nations of \n     one in 1776 . . .\n       You are the warriors in government for us, the people. I \n     commend every effort on your behalves to maintain and support \n     the principles upon which our nation was founded. Be true, \n     and be courageous. Do not let lost lives be in vain, lest \n     that blood lie on your shoulders. I know you can, and will to \n     help our Nation be great again. Press on!\n     Jason, St. Anthony.\n                                  ____\n\n       It is a national security issue for our country to be \n     energy independent. The issues outlined in the piece on your \n     website are exactly the ideas and means I would try to \n     implement. I feel that the environmental movement and \n     powerful lobbyists have had too much power and influence over \n     many Senators and Congressmen. I wish the names of the \n     lobbyists could be widely broadcast and the bills that have \n     been shot down could be widely circulated so people could see \n     the total dishonesty and power grab these environmental \n     groups have taken. It is a real disaster that we do not have \n     more nuclear energy, more domestic oil production, more coal \n     and of course more refineries. The massive amount of lawsuits \n     and cost of defending many annoyance suits has cost the \n     government and utility companies hundreds of billions of \n     dollars if not into the trillions. We have a small business \n     and a huge increase in cost in transportation shrinks the \n     profit and makes cuts in other important areas necessary.\n     Lew, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thanks for the opportunity to respond to your request for \n     energy stories. I do not have a sad one of not being able to \n     heat my house or whether to put gas in my SUV so I can get to \n     work (I drive a car that gets 27 mpg and I walk a lot) or put \n     groceries on the table. But, I have sympathy for folks who do \n     have to make hard choices. I'm glad you are looking for \n     answers. I think I can offer some insights for you.\n       My background is this: I travel a lot and have spent 11 \n     years living abroad and 5 of those years living in various \n     places in the Middle East. I understand our energy needs very \n     well, having personally negotiated the delivery of $500 \n     million dollars worth of free fuel for US/Coalition forces \n     going into Iraq in 2003. I have spent a lot of time with guys \n     in the petroleum industry in Kuwait. They are cranking out \n     more than 2 million bbl a day and they consider U.S. needs \n     their highest priority and have since 1991. From my \n     experience I know there is not a fuel shortage, just an 8 \n     million bbl per day shortfall in the needs of the U.S. \n     Personally I think raising gasoline taxes will reduce waste, \n     encourage conservation and utilization of mass transit and \n     that might help close the gap, but I understand this might \n     not be the popular option because we do like our power cheap \n     and plentiful.\n       I have lived through the oil embargo in 1973 and the little \n     one in 1978. I've listened to the energy companies explain \n     that they would go after oil shale in Wyoming in 1978, but it \n     would not be profitable unless gas prices reached $2.00 a \n     gallon. I don't hear much about oil shale these days and gas \n     is at $4.00 a gallon.\n       The EPA recently (last few years) opened new areas for \n     drilling on the North Slope of Alaska, off the California \n     coast and in the Gulf of Mexico that the energy companies \n     have been asking to drill in since 1978. Those areas were \n     protected but when an energy producer threatened to close a \n     profitable refinery in Santa Barbara a few years ago citing \n     ``lack of demand'' gas prices spiked to $4.00 a gallon in \n     Phoenix, Arizona and in the Chicago area so in the interest \n     of the national good, the EPA lifted the restrictions, so now \n     they can get oil that was profitable at $24 a bbl in 1978--\n     must be really low fruit at $130 a bbl in 2008. This would \n     help explain some of the recent profits enjoyed by the energy \n     companies and make their complaint that finding new energy is \n     very expensive seem a bit hollow.\n       A Halliburton country manager told me in 2002 that \n     Azerbaijan is awash in oil, has been for some time. A \n     pipeline was opened in May 2005 in Azerbaijan that runs about \n     a million bbl a day. There is more available but new \n     pipelines are held hostage to the political process in a \n     couple of those other countries. The Iraq fields are on the \n     mend and they went from 200,000 bbl a day in 2006 to a \n     reported 2 million bbl a day (but I don't believe that number \n     yet) and they have the capability of generating 6 million bbl \n     a day if that political situation ever stabilizes. Kazakhstan \n     and some of the others are likewise situated, the trick has \n     always been to\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\n     get the oil out of there. Obviously there is fuel out there \n     and the energy companies are willing to get it--we just have \n     to be willing to pay the price or develop alternatives. The \n     energy companies have to spin ``doom and gloom'' so we give \n     them a pass and do not question their methods. Political \n     action committees and lobbyists are the point on that \n     challenge, but you know that part already.\n       Sir, I don't understand the reluctance of our elected \n     representatives to make energy independence a national \n     priority, the same way President Kennedy made going to the \n     moon a national priority. I do understand there is a lot of \n     effort by the energy lobby to not encourage alternative \n     production.\n       If the energy companies (gas/electric/coal) have no \n     interest in finding alternatives, that impetus must come from \n     the body politic.\n       By the way, the inside news is that banks in the Middle \n     East are actively investing in alternative energy \n     development, so why aren't we? They know oil will not last \n     forever and they are getting ahead of the problem. We are \n     not.\n       I will offer this. In Idaho we have a climate not unlike \n     Seville, Spain. There they are working on a project using the \n     sun's energy to eventually generate enough power for 600,000 \n     homes. That would be the Treasure valley and beyond. Owyhee \n     County is a great place to set one up. In 2007 it was already \n     generating 11mw, enough for 6000 homes so we know the \n     application works. It is expensive, but those costs will come \n     down. The Spanish paid the big cost of R & D for all the rest \n     of us. This is a place with no carbon footprint. You can see \n     the BBC article about this effort at: http://news.bbc.co.uk/\n2/hi/science/nature/6616651.stm\n       So why is there only talk in Idaho of a nuclear power plant \n     (very expensive, does make some waste) or a new gas fired \n     electrical plant (very expensive, depletes resources and \n     leaves a big carbon footprint)? Why is the battlefield being \n     prepared by an Idaho Power rep saying recently ``the era of \n     cheap power is over.'' Why is Idaho power (and all the other \n     electricity providers) not championing alternative sources to \n     generate electricity?\n       Why is the government not doing more to promote wind power \n     as a source of electrical generation. I heard a story that it \n     might affect birds. I studied a wind farm in Oklahoma \n     recently (along the interstate). Those blades turn pretty \n     slow and it would be a stupid bird who couldn't fly past it. \n     We have lots of wind in Elmore County and most of Idaho along \n     the interstate. For people concerned about birds or views, \n     the birds will be killed the effects of global warming and \n     the view is not worth much if our society collapses.\n       As an elected official and guardian to protect America from \n     all enemies, foreign and domestic (it is in the oath) I am \n     surprised that you (and the other elected officials) are just \n     so stymied by this problem. It is not too hard a problem (we \n     did figure out how to split the atom some years ago) and it \n     cannot be too expensive since we have already spent a \n     trillion dollars in Iraq.\n       You just have to want to do this.\n       Thanks for asking for my story. I will send this off to a \n     couple of other Idahoans for them to share.\n           Respectfully,\n     Mike, Boise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8175-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8175-S8176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECIPIENTS OF THE 2008 DAVIDSON FELLOWS AWARD\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute today to \n20 outstanding young scholars and recipients of the 2008 Davidson \nFellows Award, a scholarship granted to exceptional students to assist \nthem in pursuing higher education. The Davidson Institute for Talent \nDevelopment distributes grants to highly gifted individuals under the \nage of 18 who have demonstrated academically rigorous projects that \ndemonstrate a potential to make a significant positive contribution to \nsociety. Mr. President, allow me to introduce the recipients and \nelaborate on their noteworthy accomplishments.\n  Akhil Mathew, a 16-year-old from Madison, NJ, proved a single filter, \nor system of weights, can decode only a finite number of rationals. \nAkhil's work is relevant to signal processing, analog-to-digital \nconversion, and representing numbers in an alternative way.\n  From Gaithersburg, MD, 17-year-old Sikandar Porter-Gill developed a \nnovel process to clean wastewater and produce methane for use as an \nalternative form of energy by engineering bio-catalyzed microbial fuel \ncells to degrade organic material in wastewater. Sikandar's research is \na promising step toward pursuing a cost-effective and environmentally \nfriendly energy source.\n  A 17-year-old from Setuaket, NY, Christine Shrock, studied a region \nof the HIV protease, a protein crucial in the replication of HIV. She \nfound that this region is a promising target for drugs to bind to \nchange the shape of the protease, preventing it from performing its \nfunction. Christine's research is an important contribution to the \ndevelopment of a new class of drugs to reduce the number of infections \nand deaths caused by HIV.\n  Philip Streich, a 17-year-old from Platteville, WI, showed that \ncarbon nanotubes are thermodynamically soluble, contradicting the \ngenerally held assumption that they were universally insoluble. He \ndesigned and custom built a unique photon-counting spectrometer that is \nmore sensitive and precise than any commercially available. Philip's \nwork has broad applications in the field of nanotechnology engineering.\n  At just 14 years old, Conrad Tao from New York, NY, has made \nclassical music relevant to younger generations through his \nperformances that display a vast knowledge, deep understanding, and \nmature interpretation of the repertoire. A composer, pianist, and \nviolinist attending the Juilliard Pre-College Division, he has been \nfeatured on NPR's ``From the Top,'' performed at Carnegie Hall and has \nreceived five consecutive American Society of Composers, Authors and \nPublishers, ASCAP, Morton Gould Young Composer Awards.\n  Michael Cherkassky from Minneapolis, MN, compared the application of \nseveral machine learning methods to real-life medical data sets in \norder to understand the generalization capability of the estimated \nmodels, advancing the current predictive diagnostic model. Michael, who \nis 16 years old, also compared the diagnostic accuracy of two \nclassification methods, allowing physicians to obtain more accurate \ndiagnostic conclusions while advancing patient care.\n  Twelve-year-old Hilda Huang from Palo Alto, CA, has determined to \nchange the way people feel about Johann Sebastian Bach. Performing on \nthe harpsichord and piano, Hilda aims to bring Bach to everyone, \nespecially young people who may be unfamiliar with his music. Her many \naccomplishments include performances on NPR's ``From the Top'' and at \nCarnegie Hall.\n  Jasmine Miller, a 17-year-old from Nashville, TN, examined her \ngeneration's interactions with technology and the impact of digital \nmedia on our identities. Through a one-act play, creative essays, and a \nnovel excerpt, Jasmine explored the uncharted minds of the current \ngeneration of American youth.\n  At age 17, Saraswathi Shukla from Princeton, NJ, has conducted an in-\ndepth study of sound and music in Franz-Anton Mesmer's theory of animal \nmagnetism. Combining history, music, language, and literature, she \nexamined the role of music in Mesmer's therapeutic seances in the \ncontext of broader changes in the popular perception of sound in pre-\nRevolution Paris. The importance of sound in mesmerism presents new \nways to analyze scientific theories of this period.\n  Seventeen-year-old August Siena Thomas from Montague, MA, examined \nthe ways in which personal and political histories are purposefully \nreimagined and rewritten. Through a historical novel, literary \nreflection, drama, and historical interpretation, August observed the \nmanner in which interpretation of history remain fluid and reflected on \nhow writers have used malice, ambition, flattery, and imagination \nthrough the ages to shape the way history is written.\n  Vijay Venkatesh, a 17-year-old from Laguna Niguel, CA, won the grand \nprize at the Los Angeles Music Spotlight Awards and the second prize at \nthe Virginia Waring International Piano Solo Intermediate Competition. \nVijay views music as a gift to move the world, serving as a common link \nto touch humanity, and believes it is his duty as a performer to assure \nthe audience of the joy and love that transcend life's struggles.\n  Only 12 years old from Beaverton, OR, William Yuan invented a novel \nsolar panel that enables light absorption from visible to ultraviolet \nlight, doubling the light-electricity conversion efficiency. William \nalso developed a model for solar towers and a computer program to \nsimulate and optimize the tower parameters, providing 500 times more \nlight absorption than commercially available solar cells and 9 times \nmore than the cutting-edge, three-dimensional solar cell.\n  At age 17, Charles Zhang from Oakland Township, MI, has researched \nand\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\ndeveloped a prototype for renewable battery power that harvests energy \nfrom mechanical vibrations with a larger magnitude and efficiency of AC \nvoltage. His prototype can be used as a primary power source in \nwireless structural monitoring sensors for bridges, implantable medical \ndevices, tire pressure monitoring systems and portable devices.\n  Another 17-year-old, from Ponte Vedra Beach, FL, Nathan Georgette, \ndeveloped a mathematical model intended to reduce the costs of stopping \nviral disease outbreaks in impoverished nations. He used mathematical \nmodeling to generate a formula to calculate in real time the minimum \nnumber of vaccines needed to stop a measles outbreak. Nathan's research \nrepresents a new approach to understanding the dynamic effects of \ninfectious disease spread and gradual immunization.\n  Seventeen-year-old Molly Hensley-Clancy from Minneapolis, MN, \nexplored the primal human instinct of storytelling through the eyes and \nminds of young girls, demonstrating that geographic and linguistic \ndifferences do not change the universality of dreams, thoughts, and \ntroubles. She believes the more we notice the commonalities that bind \nus together as human beings, rather than what sets us apart, the less \nwe will be able to ignore those who are suffering among us.\n  Kyle Hutzler, a 16-year-old from Huntingtown, MD, authored a \nsubstantial policy paper on education reform, recommending that \nsuccessful school reform must incorporate choice, autonomy, and \naccountability, along with the empowerment of parents, students, and \nteachers. His work articulates a vision for restructuring with specific \nproposals ranging from classroom organization and curriculum, to \nfunding and teacher pay.\n  At 17 years old, Michael Leap from Okemos, MI, has examined the role \nof science in our society by synthesizing and applying several complex \nphilosophical concepts to basic questions about science in everyday \nlife. With the thesis that conventional views of science, truth, and \nnature only function from a self-referential viewpoint, he presents \nnew, transversal perspectives in hopes that this critical examination \nwill lead to a greater understanding of the world at large.\n  Divya Nag, a 17-year-old from El Dorado Hills, CA, developed both a \nthermal analysis technique to quantify the effects of forest fires and \na novel ratio to determine organic matter loss in on-site situations. \nBy using differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, and x-ray \ndiffraction, Divya determined soil ignition temperatures and soil \ncompositions before and after burning. These techniques can be used in \nevaluating the efficacy of prescribed burning and forest management.\n  Seventeen-year-old Avanthi Raghavan from Orlando, FL, studied \nmechanisms of protein transport critical to the survival and \npathogenicity of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, which \ninfects human red blood cells and causes malaria. By using confocal \nmicroscopy, Avanthi characterized the role of the SNARE proteins \nPfSec22 and PfBet1, thus identifying potentially exploitable targets \nfor the future development of parasite-specific drugs.\n  Sarah Waliany, a 16-year-old from Arcadia, CA, discovered that \nexpression of the gene t-Darpp can make Her-2 positive breast tumor \ncells become resistant to the drug Herceptin. Sarah demonstrated that \nt-Darpp alters a critical signaling pathway that regulates growth and \nsurvival in cells. Sarah's work shows that blocking the t-Darpp gene \ncan eventually lead to more effective breast cancer treatment.\n  Mr. President, today each of these 20 young scholars deserve our \npraise for the commitment they have demonstrated to enriching our \nunderstanding in the fields of music, science, literature, and \ntechnology. These 20 young people also deserve our admiration for their \ndesire to improve the lives of individuals worldwide by addressing \nissues of practical import. Finally, these young people deserve our \ngratitude for the shining example they have set for us by the \nexcellence of their work and their desire to work on the behalf of \nothers. I would also like to thank the Davidson Institute for the \nsupport and direction they provide to this group of our country's young \nleaders. The knowledge of such dedicated and gifted young Americans \ngives me great hope and comfort for the future. Clearly, the future of \nour country rests in capable hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8176-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING TERRANCE DAVIS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with great sorrow I rise today to \nremember a bright young man who was taken from us far too soon. \nTerrance Davis, 20 years old and from Osceola, AR, was a gifted student \nmajoring in sociology, theater and performance studies, and African-\nAmerican studies at Georgetown University.\n  My staff and I were blessed to benefit from this young man's talents \nthis past summer when he served as an intern in my office. I had the \nprivilege of getting to know Terrance during this time and to see his \npassion for public service.\n  Terrance was an enthusiastic leader who was not afraid to take on \nmultiple responsibilities. After fulfilling his duties in the Senate he \nwould attend rehearsals for the play he was directing at Georgetown \nUniversity until late into the evenings. He also served as director of \nthe Georgetown University Gospel Choir.\n  His friends at school and people in my office referred to him as \nsomeone with a positive attitude who was always ready to work.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 40th anniversary of Hayward-based Eden Housing, one of \nnorthern California's oldest and most esteemed nonprofit affordable \nhousing developers and managers.\n  In 1968 six community activists, troubled by the lack of affordable, \nnondiscriminatory housing throughout Alameda County founded Eden \nHousing. Over the last 40 years, Eden Housing has expanded its advocacy \nfor affordable housing beyond Alameda County. Through the dedicated \nwork of its staff, volunteers, and board of directors, Eden Housing has \nsucceeded in creating nearly 5,000 affordable housing units that have \nprovided homes to thousands of Californians. Throughout the last 40 \nyears, Eden Housing has grown to partner with 20 cities in 6 counties \nthroughout California.\n  Eden Housing has an outstanding commitment to providing low to \nmoderate-income families and seniors, people with disabilities, the \nformerly homeless and first-time homeowners with affordable housing \nopportunities, social services and supportive programs. Eden Housing \nhas received numerous awards for its work in quality affordable \nhousing, including being named one of the Top 50 Affordable Housing \nOwners in the United States by Affordable Housing Finance Magazine in \n2007 and 2008.\n  In 2006, Eden Housing was honored by the California Housing \nConsortium for its ``contribution to fostering the creation of \naffordable housing throughout California.'' The services and programs \nprovided by Eden Housing offer those with limited incomes or \ndisabilities, and potential first-time homeowners, the opportunity to \nturn the dream of quality affordable housing into a reality.\n  I commend Eden Housing staff and volunteers for their many \naccomplishments over the last 40 years and I send\n\n[[Page S8177]]\n\nmy best wishes for many future successes over the next 40 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8177-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING MATT GARCIA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that my \nfriend Senator Dianne Feinstein and I ask our colleagues to join us \ntoday in honoring the memory of an extraordinary young man, Fairfield \nCity councilmember Matt Garcia. Matt, a dedicated public servant, was \nshot in a senseless act of violence on the evening of Monday, September \n1, 2008. Matt passed away on Friday, September 5, 2008. He was 22 years \nold.\n  In November 2007, Matt was elected to a 4-year term on the city \ncouncil of Fairfield, CA. Just 21 years old when he was elected, Matt \nwas the youngest councilman in Fairfield City history and one of the \nyoungest elected officials in the State of California. With a deep \nsense of civic pride, Matt worked tirelessly to address Fairfield's \ncrime rate and to develop effective gang prevention programs. In his \nshort time on the council, Matt served with distinction and passion, \nearning the respect of both his colleagues on the council and the youth \nof his beloved city.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Long before being elected to the Fairfield City \nCouncil, Matt Garcia's ambition and dedication inspired his community \nto be better and to do better. Since the 6th grade, friends remember \nMatt telling them that one day he would become the mayor of his \nhometown of Fairfield. Matt attended Armijo High School, where he \nserved as vice president of his senior class and was selected as both \nprom king and homecoming king.\n  Matt Garcia was a driven young leader who cared for his community \ndeeply, and will be remembered by friends and colleagues as honest, \npassionate, and full of life. Matt served Fairfield with enthusiasm and \na commitment to creating a better world. His dedication to his goals \nand dreams of improving his community will live on in those whose lives \nhe touched.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Matt Garcia is survived by his grandmother, parents, \nsiblings, and extended family members. Senator Feinstein and I will \nalways be grateful for Matt's example of passionate public service. Our \nhearts go out to Matt's family, friends, and colleagues who struggle \nwith this incomprehensible loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8177-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   A TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN ED W. FREEMAN\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, on August 20, America lost one of \nher bravest heroes, and I am honored to say he was an Idahoan. Ed ``Too \nTall'' W. Freeman, U.S. Army, retired, was awarded the Congressional \nMedal of Honor for actions undertaken during the battle of Ia Drang in \nVietnam in November, 1965. Recounted in the book by Joseph Galloway, \n``We Were Soldiers Once . . . And Young,'' Ed's bravery became legend. \nAmerican forces were heavily engaged with North Vietnamese soldiers and \nthe medical evacuation helicopters refused to fly into the battle zone \nto retrieve soldiers--it was deemed too dangerous. The infantry \ncommander asked for volunteers, and young Captain Freeman, followed by \nLTC Bruce Crandall, stepped forward and offered to fly, unarmed, to the \nbattlefield to bring supplies and carry out the wounded. Ed flew 14 \nseparate missions and his actions, literally under fire, saved life and \nlimb of 30 soldiers--all in a landing zone that was within 100 to 200 \nmeters of the defense perimeter set up to engage the North Vietnamese \nArmy at close range. Many of us have been to the Vietnam Wall--that \ntragic list is dozens of names shorter for Ed's extraordinary valor. \nImagine the children and grandchildren that are here today because he \nsaved the life of their father or grandfather. Incidentally, Ed himself \nhad two young boys--preschool and elementary school-aged at the time.\n  When he retired from the Army in 1966, Ed continued flying \nhelicopters, this time for the U.S. Department of the Interior, \nconducting animal censes, herding horses and fighting fires. In 2001, \nEd was presented the Congressional Medal of Honor by President George \nW. Bush for his actions during the Battle of Ia Drang.\n  Ed was laid to rest in the Idaho State Veteran's Cemetery, a \nbeautiful place that overlooks a vista bounded to the south by the \nSnake River Valley and distant mountains, to the east and west by a \nvast expanse of open sky, and behind to the north, by foothills rising \nto meet their less-weathered relatives. The wind blows with reassuring \nregularity, and it seems that in this western meeting place of land and \nsky, at once comfortingly familiar and awe-inspiring, it is indeed an \nappropriate place for Ed.\n  In a tribute written upon Ed's death, author, former war \ncorrespondent and friend Joseph Galloway said:\n\n       Too Tall Ed was 80 years old when he died in a hospital in \n     Boise, Idaho, after long being ill with Parkinson's disease. \n     He turned down a full dress hero's funeral in Arlington \n     National Cemetery in favor of a hometown service and burial . \n     . . close to the rivers he loved to fish and the mountains he \n     flew through in his second career flying for the U.S. Forest \n     Service . . . Now Too Tall Ed Freeman, a much larger than \n     life-size hero . . . and a much better friend than we \n     deserved, is gone, and we are left with too large a hole in \n     our hearts and in our dwindling ranks.\n\n  When Ed spoke to a reporter in Idaho back in 2000, he recounted those \n14 harrowing hours. He said, ``That Huey helicopter was my tool, and I \nwas trained to use it. It was capable of flying into that hell hole, \nand I was capable of making it do that.'' When asked if he was afraid \nhe said he ate ``franks and beans'' and chain-smoked. ``God knows how \nmany I smoked. Till I had a blister on my tongue.'' When asked about \nwhy he volunteered for this dangerous duty, he said: ``You don't think, \n`I'm going to go out and win the Medal of Honor.' You're going to win a \nbody bag if you're not real lucky.''\n  And, in a testament to Ed's humble nature, his comment on his heroism \nwas simply: ``I did think I possibly did a little more than was \nrequired of me. But again, I had a job to do.''\n  It is a tremendous honor for me to pay tribute to Ed W. Freeman, and \nmy condolences go to his wife Barbara, his sons, and their families at \nthis difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8177-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BILL GWATNEY\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with great sadness I rise to \nhonor a great American, a great Arkansan and my friend. Bill Gwatney, a \nvaliant public servant, was taken from us on August 13, 2008.\n  Bill was my friend for many years. This included his days as an \nelected official in Arkansas where he served as a State senator for 10 \nyears. He was committed to improving the State of Arkansas by taking \nthe lead on legislative redistricting, reforming ethics rules, and \nencouraging economic development throughout the State. While serving in \nthe State senate he fought against insurance companies to pass the Any \nWilling Provider legislation. This allowed patients more flexibility in \nchoosing their doctors. He inspired other great leaders to lift the \nState and the country into a prosperous future. He worked tirelessly \nevery day to make Arkansas a better place for his children and for \nchildren from the Delta to the Ozarks.\n  He became chair of our State party in 2007 and was a leader in \ngetting the party to where it is today. His work ethic and ability to \nbring people together were unmatched. His personality was contagious, \nlikable, and he was an all around wonderful person. In the days \nfollowing his death, he was praised on both sides of the aisle. Bill \nwas taken from us too soon.\n  I echo a comment by Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe who said: ``Arkansas \nhas lost a great son, and I have lost a great friend.'' These words \nring true to any Arkansan who had the privilege of knowing him. He \nbelieved strongly in integrity and good leadership within the State of \nArkansas. His death put in perspective what he believed, that public \nservice is about people, and with his passing Arkansas has lost one of \nits finest.\n  Bill leaves behind a wife Rebecca and children, Christian and Chase, \nalong with two step-children, Zachary and Emily.\n  I ask my collogues to join with me in paying tribute to the life of a \ngreat family man, business leader, and public servant, Mr. Bill \nGwatney.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8177-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8177-S8178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMENDING THE CANYON LAKE LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

The \nCanyon Lake All-Stars, under coaches Doug Simons, Steve Nolan, and Jeff \nMinnick, have the honor of being the first South Dakota team to make it \nto the Little League World Series, held this year in Williamsport, PA.\n  The Rapid City Canyon Lake All-Stars went through the Central \nRegional Tournament with wins over such teams as Kansas, with a final \nscore 15-3, and Iowa, 9-8. They advanced to the Little League World \nSeries where they played the Southeast, New England, and West teams.\n  These young people represented Rapid City and South Dakota in an \nextraordinary fashion. While the final outcome of the Little League \nWorld Series was not what these young athletes had hoped for, their \nhard work and sportsmanship is representative of South Dakota. I would \nlike to give credit to the coaches, parents, supporters, though \nespecially the dedication of these young players. The community of \nRapid City will recognize the hard work and sportsmanship this team has \nshown during the tournament with a welcome home celebration and parade \nSaturday. This is a well deserved victory and the team merits \nacknowledgment for their extraordinary achievement.\n  I want to recognize Manager Doug Simons, Coach Steve Nolan, and Coach \nJeff Minnick for their guidance and support to help make this year's \nteam so successful. I also want to congratulate all of this year's team \nmembers: Logan Anderson, Cale Fierro, Tanner Hagen, Jonah Hanson, \nWilliam Hendricks, Matthew Minnick, TJ Nolan, Mark Petereit, Jesse \nRiddle, Tanner Simons, Carter Wevik, Matthew Wilson, and Alec Winter.\n  Again, congratulations to the Rapid City Canyon Lake All-Stars on \nfighting their way to the Little League World Series.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8178-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BERLIN AIRLIFT\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

The Berlin Airlift Veterans \nAssociation will be holding the reunion September 29 through October 3, \n2008.\n  The first skirmishes of the Cold War began with the Soviet blockade \nof Berlin in 1948, which prevented residents of West Berlin from \naccessing food and fuel from outside the city indefinitely. Later \ndeemed ``the greatest humanitarian airlift in history,'' American, \nBritish, and French Allies supplied the 2 million residents of West \nBerlin with coal, food, medicine, and other supplies. Through nearly \n300,000 flights, 2.5 million tons of supplies were delivered before the \nUSSR lifted the blockade in 1949.\n  I am proud to have this opportunity to honor those involved in the \nBerlin Airlift, and their outstanding service to those in a most dire \nsituation. The 50th anniversary reunion was held in Berlin in 1998, \nwith President Clinton in attendance. Due to the deployment of B-29s \nfrom Ellsworth Air Force Base during the airlift, the 60th anniversary \ncelebrations will be held in Rapid City, SD. Again, I commend the hard \nwork and dedication of the American, British, and French pilots \ninvolved, and I am very pleased that their substantial efforts are \nbeing publicly honored and celebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8178-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF EPIPHANY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

The town \nwitnessed an influx of residents after the arrival of Father William \nKroeger in 1893, who was known for his medical studies and work to \nbuild the Church of Epiphany. This grand, historic landmark continues \nto be a beautiful and inspirational symbol of pride to the community \nand its residents.\n  Epiphany originally featured several local businesses, including the \nJ.P. Zeihen General Store, a blacksmith, saloon, barbershop, and cream \nstation. Today, the town claims the Coonhunter Inn, the Village Hair \nDesign, J & H Construction, and Denis & Evie Wingen's Appliance Shop.\n  Epiphany commemorated its anniversary with a celebration on the \nweekend of August 1-3. Even 125 years after its founding, Epiphany \ncontinues to be a vibrant community.

In three decades, Horizon Health Care has been transformed \ninto a pillar of the community by providing affordable health care to \nresidents of rural South Dakota.\n  Beginning as a group of concerned citizens with hopes of providing \nquality, affordable health care in rural southwest South Dakota, \nHorizon Health Care began in 1978 as Miner-Hamlin Health Care and Tri-\nCounty Health Care. With the help of Federal funding and a steady \ninflux of various physicians, the separate health care entities in the \narea finally merged in 1998, continuing their mission to serve the \narea. Horizon Health Care is governed by a volunteer board of \ndirectors, comprised of 16 members representing the community, with \nJohn Mengenhausen being hired as the chief executive officer in 1983.\n  I wish to congratulate the current and past directors and caregivers \nof Horizon Health Care on reaching this milestone for their business, \nand for their years of service to the community.

Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 3454. A bill to transfer unexpended Iraq reconstruction funds to \ndevelop renewable energy and improve energy efficiency in the United \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today in two \nways, and I will send the bills to the desk following my comments. The \nfirst bill is called the Iraq Self-Sufficiency and American Energy \nIndependence Act, and, the second is called the Rescission of Unneeded \nIraq Reconstruction Funds Act of 2008.\n  In a nutshell, the bills say this: We are going to take up to $11.48 \nbillion that has been appropriated but not yet expended for Iraq \nreconstruction, funds that are American taxpayers' dollars and that the \nIraqi Government says it does not need, and bring that money back to \nthis country. In the first approach, we would use the funds to \nsubstantially increase our renewable energy and make us less dependent \non foreign sources of oil. Alternatively, in the second approach, we \nwould use those funds to reduce the deficit. Either is fine with me, \nand I am introducing it both ways.\n  Here is the Special Inspector General Report for Iraq Reconstruction. \nThis report shows that there are now $11.48 billion in U.S. funds \ndestined for Iraq reconstruction.\n  And let me quote, if I may, the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq: ``Iraq \ndoes not need financial assistance.''\n  That is for sure. The price of oil has gone way up like a Roman \ncandle. They are producing 2 million barrels a day in Iraq. They have, \nby all accounts, somewhere around a $49 billion surplus in bank \naccounts for the Government of Iraq, and there have been estimates that \nwill reach a $79 billion surplus. Meanwhile, our country is deep in \ndebt, and yet we have money going to Iraq for reconstruction coming \nfrom American taxpayers' dollars while Iraqi money sits in the bank? It \ndoesn't make any sense to me.\n  There is $11.4 billion that has already been appropriated and is as \nyet unspent. My feeling is let's take the Iraqis at their word: ``Iraq \ndoes not need financial assistance.''\n  All right, I agree with that. Then let's not provide that financial \nassistance, and let's tell the Iraqis they have the capability to use \ntheir own surpluses to invest in their country.\n  It is interesting to me that we are now funding something like 900 \nwater projects in the country of Iraq, and President Bush, in his \nbudget, says let's cut back water projects in our country by a very \nsubstantial amount. We are going to take American taxpayers' dollars \nand build water projects in Iraq and stop building infrastructure in \nthis country at a time when they have a big surplus and we have a big \ndeficit? I don't think so.\n  I have a chart that shows what has happened to the price of oil from \nJuly 2003 to July 2008: $27 a barrel to $128 a barrel. The country of \nIraq is producing 2 million barrels a day, and therefore their treasury \nis fattening in a way that is very significant.\n  I have a New York Times story on August 6, just a month ago:\n\n       Soaring oil prices will leave the Iraqi Government with a \n     cumulative budget surplus of as much as $79 billion by year's \n     end, according to an American federal oversight agency. But \n     Iraq has spent only a minute fraction of that on \n     reconstruction costs, which are now largely borne by the \n     United States.\n\n  That makes no sense to me. It just makes no sense. I want to show \nsomething on page 10 of the special inspector general's report, which \nis a description of what is going on in Iraq. This is a picture of \nsomething called the Whale. This is referred to as the Whale in Iraq. \nIt is actually the Kahn Bani Sa'ad Correctional Facility. U.S. \ntaxpayers paid $40 million to build that prison in Iraq. I am told the \nIraqis said they don't want the prison, but $40 million went to the \nParsons Corporation.\n  Take a look at this photo. I will bring it to the Senate floor in a \nchart. It is in unbelievable disrepair. Apparently, after the $40 \nmillion, they kicked the contractor off the site, brought another \ncontractor in, and spent another $10 million. So they have $50 million \ninvested in something called the Whale, a prison the Iraqis did not \nwant, is not now being used, will never be used, and sits in the desert \nrotting with 50 million of American taxpayers' dollars having been \nspent on it. Reconstruction, American taxpayers' dollars, construction \nin Iraq, in some cases even construction Iraqis don't want.\n  The question, it seems to me, for us is, are we going to continue \nthis? At some point, is some common sense going to prevail? We \nshouldn't take money from American taxpayers and send it to Iraq, a \ncountry that has substantial surplus in the bank, and build projects in \nIraq even while we cut infrastructure projects in our country.\n  The legislation I am introducing will say we will take $11.48 billion \nthat is appropriated but as of yet unspent and rescind that spending \nand use it either to reduce this country's budget deficit or use it to \nsubstantially change our energy future so we are less dependent on that \npart of the world for our energy future.\n  The funds I am proposing to eliminate are in three categories. One is \nthe IRRF2. It is called the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, which \ncovers many projects, including, as I just described, the prison which \nsits unused and falling apart, a $50 million prison called the Whale. \nThe ISFF is the Iraq Security Forces Fund. A country with currently \nabout $50 billion in the bank in surplus surely should have the ability \nnow, after these long years of the American taxpayers footing the bill, \nto provide for infrastructure for their own army and their own police. \nFinally there is the ESF, the Economic Support Fund, which includes \nfunding for provincial reconstruction teams, microfinance, and so on.\n  I would note that I am not proposing to cut the Commander's Emergency \nResponse Program, which gives field commanders some discretion to \nprovide funds for local projects.\n  But I do suggest it is long past the time for this Congress to use \njust a small amount of common sense. Instead of shoveling money out the \ndoor in support of reconstruction projects in Iraq, money we don't \nhave, money we are borrowing from the Chinese and Japanese, by the way, \ninstead of shoveling money out the door to provide money in a country \nthat is piling up its\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\nown surpluses from oil sales, let's decide that which we previously \ndecided to spend will no longer be spent and brought back home. It \nseems to me we must do that if we are going to begin to put this \ncountry's fiscal house in order.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 3457. A bill to reaffirm United States objectives in Ethiopia and \nencourage critical democratic and humanitarian principles and \npractices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nSupport for Democracy and Human Rights in Ethiopia Act of 2008. Senator \nLeahy joins me as an original cosponsor. The purpose of this bill is to \nreaffirm policy objectives towards Ethiopia and encourage greater \ncommitment to the underpinnings of a true democracy--an independent \njudiciary and the rule of law, respect for human and political rights, \nand an end to restrictions on the media and non-governmental \norganizations.\n  As many in this body know, I have spoken numerous times in recent \nmonths about the situation in Ethiopia and I continue to believe that \nthe U.S.-Ethiopian partnership is very important--one of the more \ncritical ones given not only our historic relationship but also \nEthiopia's location in an increasingly strategic region. Ethiopia sits \non the Horn of Africa--perhaps one of the roughest neighborhoods in the \nworld, with Somalia a failed state and safe haven for terrorists, \nEritrea an inaccessible authoritarian government that meddles across \nnational borders, Sudan a genocidal regime, and Kenya still emerging \nfrom a profound electoral crisis. One look at the deteriorating \nsituation across the Horn and the importance of a robust relationship \nwith Ethiopia is obvious. And, by contrast with some of its neighbors, \nEthiopia appears relatively stable with a growing economy. But I am \nconcerned about a number of anti-democratic actions in that country, \nparticularly since this administration has largely overlooked them.\n  The security threats in Ethiopia are real but, unfortunately, the \nBush administration's approach to addressing these threats and \nstrengthening this alliance remains short-sighted and narrow--focusing \npredominately on short-term ways to address insecurity while \noverlooking the need for long-term measures that are needed to achieve \nthe same goal, such as desperately needed goverance reform, the rule of \nlaw, and increased accountability. Genuine democratic progress in \nEthiopia is essential if we are to have a healthy and positive \nbilateral relationship. It is also essential if we are going to \nsuccessfully combat extremism, thereby bolstering our own national \nsecurity here at home.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Support for Democracy and \nHuman Rights in Ethiopia Act of 2008--because as our administration \nfails to balance our priorities in Ethiopia, or to adopt comprehensive \nstrategies to achieve those priorities, we are watching significant \nbacksliding in previously hard-won democratic gains. As we turn a blind \neye to the escalating political tensions, people are being thrown in \njail without justification and non-government organizations are being \nrestricted, while civilians are dying unnecessarily in the Ogaden \nregion--just like so many before them in Oromiya, Amhara, and Gambella. \nFurthermore, the Ethiopian military has come under increasing scrutiny \nfor its conduct in the Ogaden as well as Somalia, with credible reports \nfrom non-governmental organizations of torture, rape and indiscriminate \nattacks. By providing unconditioned security assistance we are also \nsowing the seeds of insecurity and creating new grievances both in \nEthiopia and in its neighboring countries.\n  I want to see greater progress--not less--in Ethiopia which is why \nthis bill authorizes an additional $20 million for democracy and \ngovernance projects in Ethiopia. The addition of these funds would make \nit one of the top five countries on the continent receiving this kind \nof assistance from this U.S. Government. This bill calls on the \nPresident to take additional steps to implement these programs but also \nrequires that funds made available to the Ethiopian government be \nsubject to regular congressional notification. This ensures U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars are being used appropriately--and used to support a \ngovernment taking steps to become more democratic, not less.\n  I make it a practice to pay for all bills I introduce, and the \nauthorization in this bill is offset by a transfer of funds from NASA. \nSome may disagree with me on the need for an offset, but recent Office \nof Management and Budget projections confirm that we now have the \nbiggest budget deficit in the history of our country. We cannot afford \nto be fiscally irresponsible so we must make choices to ensure that our \nchildren and grandchildren do not bear the burden of our reckless \nspending. Instead of cutting specific programs, which are likely to \nhave begun and thus would cost more to close, transferring $20 million \nfrom the general budget would allow appropriators to evaluate, at their \ndiscretion, how best to make this transfer.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider what our own State Department has \nsaid about the political situation in Ethiopia and then consider how \nbest to rectify the situation. The 2007 State Department Report on \nHuman Rights notes that in Ethiopia the following occurred: \n``limitation[s] on citizens' right to change their government during \nthe most recent elections; unlawful killings, and beating, abuse, and \nmistreatment of detainees and opposition supporters by security forces; \npoor prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention, particularly of \nthose suspected of sympathizing with or being members of the opposition \nor insurgent groups; detention of thousands without charge and lengthy \npretrial detention; infringement on citizens' privacy rights and \nfrequent refusal to follow the law regarding search warrants; use of \nexcessive force by security services in an internal conflict and \ncounter-insurgency operations; restrictions on freedom of the press; \narrest, detention, and harassment of journalists for publishing \narticles critical of the government; restrictions on freedom of \nassembly; limitations on freedom of association; violence and societal \ndiscrimination against women and abuse of children; female genital \nmutilation, FGM; exploitation of children for economic and sexual \npurposes; trafficking in persons; societal discrimination against \npersons with disabilities and religious and ethnic minorities; and \ngovernment interference in union activities, including killing and \nharassment of union leaders.''\n  The continued failure of the administration to acknowledge this \nreality is emblematic of its insular thinking and unwillingness to see \nthe big picture. Without a balanced policy that addresses both short \nand long-term concerns in Ethiopia we are putting ourselves at greater \nrisk and making ourselves more vulnerable, not less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 3459. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to authorize a connecting education and emerging professions \ndemonstration grant program; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this week I am introducing a number of \ndifferent bills designed to fuel job creation and spur economic \ndevelopment. My initiative, dubbed E4, because of its focus on economy, \nemployment, education, and energy, seeks to respond to economic and job \ndevelopment needs both in my State of Wisconsin and around the country. \nToday I am introducing a bill, the Connecting Education and Emerging \nProfessions Act of 2008, to help promote better collaboration between \nour Nation's high schools and local, regional, and statewide businesses \nand workforce development groups.\n  This legislation seeks to address a couple of interrelated issues. \nThe first issue is the alarmingly high dropout rate in our Nation's \nhigh schools. While numbers vary slightly, a growing body of research \nindicates that the United States has a graduation rate of approximately \n70 percent and about one-third of our country's high school students \nwill not graduate on time. Graduation rates for minority and low-income \nstudents are even lower, in many cases, alarmingly lower. In addition, \nmany of our Nation's urban school districts report very high dropout \nrates, including the Milwaukee\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\nPublic School District. According to the Cities in Crisis report put \nout earlier this year by the Editorial Projects in Education Research \nCenter, the Milwaukee Public Schools has a graduation rate of 46.1 \npercent. Unfortunately, there are at least a dozen large urban \ndistricts that have even lower graduation rates than Milwaukee.\n  One of our top education priorities as a nation must be to address \nthe low graduation rates nationwide in urban, suburban, and rural \nschool districts. We must also work to close the huge opportunity gap \nthat is created by the large disparity in graduation rates between our \nminority and non-minority students as well as between low income and \nmore affluent students. Solving this problem will require a broad, \ncomprehensive solution involving the Federal, State and local \ngovernments. It is my hope that when Congress finally reauthorizes the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, we pay particular attention to \nthe needs of our Nation's high schools and our students.\n  While many factors contribute to high dropout rates, disengagement \nfrom classroom instruction can contribute to a student's decision to \ndrop out. Some students feel that high school is not relevant to their \nlives and do not see how completing high school will translate into \nfuture career and academic success. In this increasingly competitive \ntwenty-first century where postsecondary education is now required for \nmany entry-level jobs, it is up to us to show our Nation's students why \nit is imperative that they graduate from high school.\n  Another issue that this bill seeks to address is the growing sense \namong employers and postsecondary institutions that our Nation's high \nschool students who do graduate are increasingly unprepared for success \neither in the workforce or in college. Employers in various economic \nsectors, including technology, manufacturing, health care, \nconstruction, and others, report difficulty in identifying qualified \ncandidates for skilled positions. Recent surveys also indicate that \nmany employers are dissatisfied with the overall preparation of \nsecondary school graduates. In order for companies in the United States \nto be competitive in a global economy, we must have a highly skilled \nworkforce. Adequate preparation at the high school level can help \nprepare students for entry into our rapidly changing global economy \nwhere new emerging industries are cropping up in Wisconsin and around \nthe country.\n  To address these two interrelated issues, I am introducing the \nConnecting Education and Emerging Professions Act. My bill would \nprovide 5-year competitive education grants to states and school \ndistricts to foster collaboration and discussions between schools, \nbusinesses, and others about the emerging industry workforce needs and \nhow to prepare our high school students to meet those needs, both \nacademically and practically. States and local school districts must \nuse this money to form partnerships with local or regional businesses, \npostsecondary institutions, workforce development boards, labor \norganizations, nonprofit organizations and others.\n  These partnerships will have the responsibility of surveying the \nlocal, regional, and statewide emerging industries and deciding what \nare the academic and work-based skills that our high school students \nneed in order to be successful in these emerging industries. The \npartnerships will then work together to develop new and engaging \ncurriculum and programs designed to teach the academic and work-based \nskills that are necessary to succeed in these new emerging industries. \nOnce the partnership has designed a curriculum or program and received \napproval from the Federal Department of Education, the partnership will \nwork to implement the program in qualifying schools.\n  During the implementation phase, the partnership will come together \nto implement hands-on learning and work opportunities for students \nincluding internships, apprenticeships, job shadowing, and other career \nand technical education programs. These hands-on learning and work \nopportunities will be based on the emerging industry pathways \ncurriculum or program that the eligible partnership has designed and \nwill offer students practical academic experiences and skill-building \nlessons that they can use in the workplace or in postsecondary \neducation.\n  This legislation seeks to help schools, businesses, colleges, and the \nstudents who would be served by this legislation all talk with each \nother to build new programs that would help boost student engagement in \nlearning and student attendance and graduation rates while also \npreparing students for success in the workforce or in college after \nthey graduate. There are a number of successful local and state \nprograms around Wisconsin that this legislation would help support and \nthat served as valuable examples as I developed this legislation.\n  Wisconsin's Department of Public Instruction, Department of Workforce \nDevelopment, and various local school districts have all been working \nto boost Wisconsin's career and technical education offerings and gear \nthese offerings towards emerging industries. My bill seeks to help \nWisconsin and other states build on these efforts and engage in \nadditional conversations with interested stakeholders to design new \ncurriculums and programs to prepare students for emerging industries.\n  I look forward to pushing this legislation forward in the coming \nweeks and months. Some of our Nation's schools are experiencing high \ndropout rates in part because students aren't connecting with what they \nare being taught. At the same time, we're seeing an emergence of new \nindustries, like those aiming to capitalize on alternative energies and \nenergy efficiency, that need employers with skills and training in \ntheir field. If we help schools connect their students with businesses, \nworkforce development boards, and colleges that offer career and \nacademic opportunities in these new and exciting fields, we can help to \nlower the alarming dropout rates while helping these emerging \nindustries thrive.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3459\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Connecting Education and \n     Emerging Professions Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The majority of secondary school students in the United \n     States receive some career-related instruction before \n     graduation, and about half of secondary school students have \n     a strong career-related component to their educational \n     programs.\n       (2) A gap still remains between what students are learning \n     in school and the knowledge required to succeed in the \n     current labor market.\n       (3) Employers in various economic sectors, including \n     technology, manufacturing, healthcare, construction, and \n     others, report difficulty in identifying qualified candidates \n     for skilled positions.\n       (4) A survey of more than 400 employers nationwide found \n     that nearly half were dissatisfied with the overall \n     preparation of secondary school graduates.\n       (5) Almost 40 percent of secondary school graduates report \n     feeling unprepared for the workplace or postsecondary \n     education.\n       (6) In order for companies in the United States to be \n     competitive in a global economy, the United States must have \n     a highly skilled workforce.\n       (7) Adequate preparation on the secondary school level can \n     help prepare students to enter high-demand fields in need of \n     skilled workers.\n       (8) Collaboration between businesses, industries, and \n     education leaders can help determine how best to prepare \n     students for workforce success.\n       (9) Career-related experiences, such as apprenticeships \n     during secondary education are associated with positive labor \n     market outcomes for students.\n       (10) The United States has a secondary school graduation \n     rate of 70 percent, and approximately one-third of students \n     entering secondary school will not graduate on time.\n       (11) Minority and low socioeconomic status students have \n     significantly lower graduation rates.\n       (12) Disengagement from classroom instruction contributes \n     to student decisions to drop out of school.\n       (13) Studies indicate a link between career-oriented models \n     of secondary education, dropout rate reduction, and higher \n     earning potential for graduates.\n       (14) Studies suggest that academic lessons taught in a work \n     context or an applied manner can improve some students' \n     ability to comprehend and retain information.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n\n[[Page S8184]]\n\n       (1) foster improved collaboration among secondary schools, \n     State, regional, and local businesses, institutions of higher \n     education, industry, or workforce development organizations, \n     labor organizations, and other nonprofit community \n     organizations to identify emerging industry pathways, as well \n     as the academic skills necessary to improve student success \n     in the workforce or postsecondary education;\n       (2) address industry and postsecondary education needs for \n     a prepared and skilled workforce;\n       (3) improve the potential for economic and employment \n     growth in covered communities; and\n       (4) help address the dropout crisis in the United States by \n     involving students in a collaborative curriculum or program \n     development process related to emerging industry pathways to \n     improve student engagement and attendance in secondary \n     school.\n\n     SEC. 3.

COUNTERTERRORISM STATUS REPORTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Success in Countering Al Qaeda Reporting Requirements Act \n     of 2008''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Al Qaeda and its related affiliates attacked the United \n     States on September 11, 2001 in New York, New York, \n     Arlington, Virginia, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, murdering \n     almost 3000 innocent civilians.\n       (2) Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri remain \n     at large.\n       (3) Al Qaeda and its related affiliates maintain freedom of \n     movement in the Afghan-Pakistani border region and continue \n     to strengthen their operational capabilities to plot and \n     carry out attacks.\n       (4) Nearly 7 years after the attacks on September 11, 2001, \n     Al Qaeda and its related affiliates remain the most serious \n     national security threat to the United States, with alarming \n     signs that Al Qaeda and its related affiliates recently \n     reconstituted their strength and ability to generate new \n     attacks throughout the world, including against the United \n     States.\n       (5) The July 2007 National Intelligence Estimate states, \n     ``Al Qaeda is and will remain the most serious terrorist \n     threat to the Homeland''.\n       (6) In testimony to the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives on February 7, \n     2008, Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell \n     stated, ``Al-Qa'ida and its terrorist affiliates continue to \n     pose significant threats to the United States at home and \n     abroad, and al-Qa'ida's central leadership based in the \n     border area of Pakistan is its most dangerous component.''.\n\n[[Page S8202]]\n\n       (7) The Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of \n     2004, which implemented the recommendations of the 9/11 \n     Commission, and a subsequent executive order, assigned to the \n     National Counterterrorist Center (NCTC) the responsibility to \n     develop comprehensive, integrated strategic operations plans \n     for all of the Federal Government and to assess the execution \n     of these plans for the President. This vital aspect of the \n     NCTC's mission is not sufficiently resourced or supported by \n     the executive branch or Congress, resulting in a lack of \n     coherent and effective planning and implementation in the \n     struggle against terrorism.\n       (8) The ``National Strategy for Combating Terrorism'', \n     issued in September 2006, affirmed that long-term efforts are \n     needed to win the battle of ideas against the root causes of \n     the violent extremist ideology that sustains Al Qaeda and its \n     affiliates. The United States has obligated resources to \n     support democratic reforms and human development to undercut \n     support for violent extremism, including in the Federally \n     Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan and the Sahel region of \n     Africa. However, 2 reports released by the Government \n     Accountability Office in 2008 found that ``no comprehensive \n     plan for meeting U.S. national security goals in the FATA \n     have been developed,'' and ``no comprehensive integrated \n     strategy has been developed to guide the [Sahel] program's \n     implementation''.\n       (9) Such efforts to combat violent extremism and radicalism \n     must be undertaken using all elements of national power, \n     including military tools, intelligence assets, law \n     enforcement resources, diplomacy, paramilitary activities, \n     financial measures, development assistance, strategic \n     communications, and public diplomacy.\n       (10) There remains a paucity of information on current \n     counterterrorism efforts undertaken by the Federal Government \n     and the level of success achieved by specific initiatives.\n       (11) Congress and the American people can benefit from more \n     specific data and metrics that can provide the basis for \n     objective external assessments of the progress being made in \n     the overall war being waged against violent extremism.\n       (12) In its key recommendations to the 110th Congress, the \n     Government Accountability Office urged greater congressional \n     oversight in assessing the effectiveness and coordination of \n     United States international programs focused on combating and \n     preventing the growth of terrorism and its underlying causes.\n       (13) The Secretary of State is required by law to submit \n     annual reports to Congress that detail key developments on \n     terrorism on a country-by-country basis. These Country \n     Reports on Terrorism provide information on acts of terrorism \n     in countries, major developments in bilateral and \n     multilateral counterterrorism cooperation, and the extent of \n     state support for terrorist groups responsible for the death, \n     kidnaping, or injury of Americans, but do not assess the \n     scope and efficacy of United States counterterrorism efforts \n     against Al Qaeda and its related affiliates.\n       (14) The Executive Branch submits regular reports to \n     Congress that detail the status of United States combat \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including a breakdown of \n     budgetary allocations, key milestones achieved, and measures \n     of political, economic, and military progress.\n       (15) The Department of Defense compiles a report of the \n     monthly and cumulative incremental obligations incurred to \n     support the Global War on Terrorism in a monthly Supplemental \n     and Cost of War Execution Report.\n       (16) In March 2008, the Government Accountability Office \n     reported to Congress that it found the data in these reports \n     to be of ``questionable reliability'' and recommended \n     improvements in transparency and reliability in Department of \n     Defense reporting.\n       (17) The absence of a comparable timely assessment of the \n     ongoing status and progress of United States counterterrorism \n     efforts against Al Qaeda and its related affiliates in the \n     overall Global War on Terrorism hampers the ability of \n     Congress and the American people to independently determine \n     whether the United States is making significant progress in \n     this defining struggle of our time.\n       (18) The Executive Branch should submit a comprehensive \n     report to Congress, updated on a semiannual basis, which \n     provides a more strategic perspective regarding--\n       (A) the United States' highest global counterterrorism \n     priorities;\n       (B) the United States' efforts to combat and defeat Al \n     Qaeda and its related affiliates;\n       (C) the United States' efforts to undercut long-term \n     support for the violent extremism that sustains Al Qaeda and \n     its related affiliates;\n       (D) the progress made by the United States as a result of \n     such efforts;\n       (E) the efficacy and efficiency of the United States \n     resource allocations; and\n       (F) whether the existing activities and operations of the \n     United States are actually diminishing the national security \n     threat posed by Al Qaeda and its related affiliates.\n       (c) Semiannual Counterterrorism Status Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than July 31, 2009, and every 6 \n     months thereafter, the President shall submit a report, to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, the \n     Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives, the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives, which contains, for the most recent 6-month \n     period, a review of the counterterrorism strategy of the \n     United States Government, including--\n       (A) a detailed assessment of the scope, status, and \n     progress of United States counterterrorism efforts in \n     fighting Al Qaeda and its related affiliates and undermining \n     long-term support for violent extremism;\n       (B) a judgment on the geographical region in which Al Qaeda \n     and its related affiliates pose the greatest threat to the \n     national security of the United States;\n       (C) an evaluation of the extent to which the \n     counterterrorism efforts of the United States correspond to \n     the plans developed by the NCTC and the goals established in \n     overarching public statements of strategy issued by the \n     executive branch;\n       (D) a description of the efforts of the United States \n     Government to combat Al Qaeda and its related affiliates and \n     undermine violent extremist ideology, which shall include--\n       (i) a specific list of the President's highest global \n     counterterrorism priorities;\n       (ii) the degree of success achieved by the United States, \n     and remaining areas for progress, in meeting the priorities \n     described in clause (i); and\n       (iii) efforts in those countries in which the President \n     determines that--\n\n       (I) Al Qaeda and its related affiliates have a presence; or\n       (II) acts of international terrorism have been perpetrated \n     by Al Qaeda and its related affiliates;\n\n       (E) the specific status and achievements of United States \n     counterterrorism efforts, through military, financial, \n     political, intelligence, and paramilitary elements, relating \n     to--\n       (i) bilateral security and training programs;\n       (ii) law enforcement and border security;\n       (iii) the disruption of terrorist networks; and\n       (iv) the denial of terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries;\n       (F) a description of United States Government activities to \n     counter terrorist recruitment and radicalization, including--\n       (i) strategic communications;\n       (ii) public diplomacy;\n       (iii) support for economic development and political \n     reform; and\n       (iv) other efforts aimed at influencing public opinion;\n       (G) United States Government initiatives to eliminate \n     direct and indirect international financial support for the \n     activities of terrorist groups;\n       (H) a cross-cutting analysis of the budgets of all Federal \n     Government agencies as they relate to counterterrorism \n     funding to battle Al Qaeda and its related affiliates abroad, \n     including--\n       (i) the source of such funds; and\n       (ii) the allocation and use of such funds;\n       (I) an analysis of the extent to which specific Federal \n     appropriations--\n       (i) have produced tangible, calculable results in efforts \n     to combat and defeat Al Qaeda, its related affiliates, and \n     its violent ideology; or\n       (ii) contribute to investments that have expected payoffs \n     in the medium- to long-term;\n       (J) statistical assessments, including those developed by \n     the National Counterterrorism Center, on the number of \n     individuals belonging to Al Qaeda and its related affiliates \n     that have been killed, injured, or taken into custody as a \n     result of United States counterterrorism efforts; and\n       (K) a concise summary of the methods used by NCTC and other \n     elements of the United States Government to assess and \n     evaluate progress in its overall counterterrorism efforts, \n     including the use of specific measures, metrics, and indices.\n       (2) Country selection.--The countries referred to in \n     paragraph (1)(D)(iii) shall include Afghanistan, Algeria, \n     Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, India, \n     Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, \n     Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Spain, Syria, Thailand, \n     Tunisia, Turkey, Yemen, and any other country that meets the \n     conditions described in subclause (I) or (II) of paragraph \n     (1)(D)(iii).\n       (3) Interagency cooperation.--In preparing the report under \n     this subsection, the President shall include relevant \n     information maintained by--\n       (A) the National Counterterrorism Center and the National \n     Counterproliferation Center;\n       (B) Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation;\n       (C) the Department of State;\n       (D) the Department of Defense;\n       (E) the Department of Homeland Security;\n       (F) the Department of the Treasury;\n       (G) the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,\n       (H) the Central Intelligence Agency;\n       (I) the Office of Management and Budget;\n       (J) the United States Agency for International Development;

PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION TO MEMBERS OF THE ARMED \n                   FORCES AND CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES OF THE UNITED \n                   STATES CAPTURED BY JAPAN AND FORCED TO PERFORM \n                   SLAVE LABOR DURING WORLD WAR II.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States fought valiantly against the Armed Forces of \n     Japan in the Pacific. In particular, from December 1941 until \n     May 1942, members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     fought courageously against overwhelming Armed Forces of \n     Japan on Wake Island, Guam, the Philippine Islands, including \n     the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor, and the Dutch East \n     Indies, thereby preventing Japan from accomplishing strategic \n     objectives necessary for achieving a preemptive military \n     victory in the Pacific during World War II.\n       (2) During initial military action in the Philippines, \n     members of the Armed Forces of the United States were ordered \n     to surrender on April 9, 1942, and were forced to march 65 \n     miles to prison camps at Camp O'Donnell, Cabanatuan, and \n     Bilibid. More than 10,000 people of the United States died \n     during the march (known as the ``Bataan Death March'') and \n     during subsequent imprisonment as a result of starvation, \n     disease, and executions.\n       (3) Beginning in January 1942, the Armed Forces of Japan \n     began transporting United States prisoners of war to Japan, \n     Taiwan, Manchuria, and Korea to perform slave labor to \n     support Japanese industries. Many of the unmarked merchant \n     vessels in which the prisoners were transported (known as \n     ``Hell Ships'') were attacked by the Armed Forces of the \n     United States, which, according to some estimates, killed \n     more than 3,600 people of the United States.\n       (4) Following the conclusion of World War II, the \n     Government of the United States agreed to pay compensation to \n     former prisoners of war of the United States, amounting to \n     $2.50 per day of imprisonment. This compensation, paid from \n     assets of Japan frozen by the Government of the United \n     States, is wholly insufficient to compensate fully such \n     former prisoners of war for the conditions they endured. \n     Neither the Government of Japan nor any corporations of Japan \n     admit any liability requiring payment of compensation.\n       (5) Other countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, \n     Isle of Man, Norway, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and \n     Australia have previously awarded such a compensation to \n     their surviving veterans who were captured by the Japanese \n     during World War II and required to perform slave labor. \n     Currently, the United States is the only Western Allied power \n     that has not awarded similar compensation to these \n     distinguished heroes of World War II who were prisoners of \n     war of Japan.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to recognize, \n     by the provision of compensation, the heroic contributions of \n     the members of the Armed Forces and civilian employees of the \n     United States who were captured by the Japanese military \n     during World War II and denied their basic human rights by \n     being forced to perform slave labor by the Imperial \n     Government of Japan or by corporations of Japan during World \n     War II.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Covered veteran or civilian internee.--The term \n     ``covered veteran or civilian internee'' means any individual \n     who--\n       (A) is a citizen of the United States;\n       (B) was a member of the Armed Forces, a civilian employee \n     of the United States, or an employee of a contractor of the \n     United States during World War II;\n       (C) served in or with the Armed Forces during World War II;\n       (D) was captured and held as a prisoner of war or prisoner \n     by Japan in the course of such service; and\n       (E) was required by the Imperial Government of Japan, or \n     one or more corporations of Japan, to perform slave labor \n     during World War II.\n       (2) Slave labor.--The term ``slave labor'' means forced \n     servitude under conditions of subjugation.\n       (d) Payment of Compensation Required.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the availability of \n     appropriated funds, the Secretary of Defense shall pay \n     compensation to each living covered veteran or civilian \n     internee, or to the surviving spouse of a covered veteran or \n     civilian internee, in the amount of $20,000.\n       (2) Rebuttable presumption.--An application for \n     compensation submitted under this section by or with respect \n     to an individual seeking treatment as a covered veteran or \n     civilian internee under this section is subject to a \n     rebuttable presumption that such individual is a covered \n     veteran or civilian internee if the application on its face \n     provides information sufficient to establish such individual \n     as a covered veteran or civilian internee.\n       (e) Relationship to Other Payments.--Any amount paid to a \n     person under this section for activity described in \n     subsection (c)(1)(D) is in addition to any other amount paid \n     to such person for such activity under any other provision of \n     law.\n       (f) Inapplicability of Taxation or Attachment.--Any amount \n     paid to a person under this section shall not be subject to \n     any taxation, attachment, execution, levy, tax lien, or \n     detention under any process whatever.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5304.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME \n                   COURT ON THE DEATH PENALTY FOR CHILD RAPISTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) 1 out of 3 sexual assault victims is under 12 years of \n     age.\n       (2) Raping a child is a particularly depraved, perverted, \n     and heinous act.\n       (3) Child rape is among the most morally reprehensible \n     crimes.\n       (4) Child rape is a gross defilement of innocence that \n     should be severely punished.\n       (5) A raped child suffers immeasurable physical, \n     psychological, and emotional harm from which the child may \n     never recover.\n       (6) The Federal Government and State governments have a \n     right and a duty to combat, prevent, and punish child rape.\n       (7) The popularly elected representatives of Louisiana \n     modified the rape laws of the State in 1995, making the \n     aggravated rape of a child 11 years of age or younger \n     punishable by death, life imprisonment without parole, \n     probation, or suspension of sentence, as determined by a \n     jury.\n       (8) On March 2, 1998, Patrick Kennedy, a resident of \n     Louisiana, brutally raped his 8-year-old stepdaughter.\n       (9) The injuries inflicted on the child victim by her \n     stepfather were described by an expert in pediatric forensic \n     medicine as ``the most severe he had seen from a sexual \n     assault''.\n       (10) The cataclysmic injuries to her 8-year-old body \n     required emergency surgery.\n       (11) A jury of 12 Louisiana citizens convicted Patrick \n     Kennedy of this depraved crime, and unanimously sentenced him \n     to death.\n       (12) The Supreme Court of Louisiana upheld this sentence, \n     holding that the death penalty was not an excessive \n     punishment for Kennedy's crime.\n       (13) The Supreme Court of Louisiana relied on precedent \n     interpreting the eighth amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States.\n       (14) On June 25, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United \n     States held in Kennedy v. Louisiana, No. 07-343 (2008), that \n     executing Patrick Kennedy for the rape of his stepdaughter \n     would be ``cruel and unusual punishment''.\n       (15) The Supreme Court, in the 5-4 decision, overturned the \n     judgment of Louisiana's elected officials, the citizens who \n     sat on the jury, and the Louisiana Supreme Court.\n       (16) This decision marked the first time that the Supreme \n     Court held that the death penalty for child rape was \n     unconstitutional.\n       (17) As Justice Alito observed in his dissent, the opinion \n     of the majority is so broad that it precludes the Federal \n     Government and State governments from authorizing the death \n     penalty for child rape ``no matter how young the child, no \n     matter how many times the child is raped, no matter how many \n     children the perpetrator rapes, no matter how sadistic the \n     crime, no matter how much physical or psychological trauma is \n     inflicted, and no matter how heinous the perpetrator's prior \n     criminal record may be''.\n       (18) In the United States, the people, not the Government, \n     are sovereign.\n       (19) The Constitution of the United States is supreme and \n     deserving of the people's allegiance.\n       (20) The framers of the eighth amendment did not intend to \n     prohibit the death penalty for child rape.\n       (21) The imposition of the death penalty for child rape has \n     never been within the plain and ordinary meaning of ``cruel \n     and unusual punishment'', neither now nor at the time of the \n     adoption of the eighth amendment.\n       (22) Instead of construing the eighth amendment's \n     prohibition of ``cruel and unusual punishment'' according to \n     its original meaning or its plain and ordinary meaning, the \n     Court followed a 2-step approach of first attempting to \n     discern a national consensus regarding the appropriateness of \n     the death penalty for child rape and then applying the \n     Justices' own independent judgment in light of their \n     interpretation of a national consensus and evolving standards \n     of decency.\n       (23) To the extent that a national consensus is relevant to \n     the meaning of the eighth amendment, there is national \n     consensus in favor of the death penalty for child rape, as \n     evidenced by the adoption of that penalty by the elected \n     branches of the Federal Government only 2 years ago, and by \n     the swift denunciations of the Kennedy v. Louisiana decision \n     by the presumptive nominees for President of both major \n     political parties.\n       (24) The evolving standards of decency standard is an \n     arbitrary construct without foundation in the Constitution of \n     the United States and should have no bearing on Justices who \n     are bound to interpret the laws of the United States.\n\n[[Page S8212]]\n\n       (25) The standards of decency in the United States have \n     evolved toward approval of the death penalty for child rape, \n     as evidenced by 6 States and the Federal Government adopting \n     that penalty in the past 13 years.\n       (26) The Supreme Court rendered its opinion without \n     knowledge of a Federal law authorizing the death penalty for \n     child rapists.\n       (27) The Federal law authorizing the death penalty for \n     child rapists was passed by Congress and signed by the \n     President 2 years before the Supreme Court released the \n     decision.\n       (28) The Court presumably would have deferred to the \n     elected branches of government in determining a national \n     consensus regarding evolving standards of decency had it been \n     aware of the Federal law authorizing the death penalty for \n     child rapists at the time that it made the decision.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the depraved conduct of the worst child rapists merits \n     the death penalty;\n       (2) standards of decency allow, and sometimes compel, the \n     death penalty for child rape;\n       (3) the eighth amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States allows the death penalty for the rape of a child in \n     cases in which the crime did not result, and was not intended \n     to result, in death of the victim;\n       (4) the Louisiana statute making child rape punishable by \n     death is constitutional;\n       (5) the Supreme Court of the United States should grant any \n     petition for rehearing of Kennedy v. Louisiana, No. 07-343 \n     (2008), because the case was decided under a mistaken view of \n     Federal law;\n       (6) the portions of the Kennedy v. Louisiana decision \n     regarding the national consensus or evolving standards of \n     decency with respect to the imposition of the death penalty \n     for child rape should not be viewed by Federal or State \n     courts as binding precedent, because the Supreme Court was \n     operating under a mistaken view of Federal law; and\n       (7) the Supreme Court should reverse its decision in \n     Kennedy v. Louisiana, on rehearing or in a future case, \n     because the decision was supported by neither commonly held \n     beliefs about ``cruel and unusual punishment'', nor by the \n     text, structure, or history of the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5325.

I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate concur in the House amendments, that the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to \nthis matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on S. 2403, a bill \nto name the new U.S. courthouse in Richmond, VA, after two \ndistinguished jurists and sons of Virginia.\n  Senator Webb and I introduced this bill last year, and the bill \npassed the Senate on June 24, 2008. The House of Representatives passed \nthe bill last night, with a minor technical change, by a vote of 376 to \n0. Tonight, I would like to thank the Senate for accepting this minor \nmodification and once again passing this bill.\n  Our bill recognizes two of Virginia's outstanding jurists: Spotswood \nRobinson III and Robert Mehrige, Jr. They were lawyers who throughout \ntheir careers adhered to the principle of ``equal justice under law.''\n  The first, Spottswood William Robinson III, was born in Richmond, VA, \non July 26, 1916. He attended Virginia Union University and then the \nHoward University School of Law, graduating first in his class in 1939 \nand serving as a member of the faculty until 1947.\n  Judge Robinson was one of the core attorneys of the NAACP Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund from 1948 to 1960, achieving national \nprominence in the legal community with his representation of the \nVirginia plaintiffs in the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Board \nof Education. Brown outlawed public school segregation declaring \n``separate but equal'' schools unconstitutional.\n  In 1964, Judge Robinson became the first African American to be \nappointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and \nin 1966, President Johnson appointed Judge Robinson the first African \nAmerican to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit. Finally, on May 7, 1981, Judge Robinson became the first \nAfrican American to serve as Chief Judge of the District of Columbia \nCircuit.\n  Our second jurist, Judge Robert R. Merhige, Jr., was born in 1919 and \nlater attended High Point College in North Carolina. He subsequently \nearned his law degree from the T.C. Williams School of Law at the \nUniversity of Richmond, from which he graduated at the top of his class \nin 1942.\n  From 1942 to 1945, Judge Merhige served in the U.S. Air Force. He \npracticed law in Richmond from 1945 to 1967, establishing himself as a \nformidable trial lawyer representing criminal defendants as well as \ndozens of insurance companies.\n  On August 30,1967, Judge Merhige was appointed U.S. District Court \njudge for the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division, by \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson, serving as a Federal judge until 1998. In \n1972, Judge Merhige ordered the desegregation of dozens of Virginia \nschool districts. He considered himself to be a ``strict \nconstructionist'' who went by the law as spelled out in precedents by \nthe higher courts. In 1970, he ordered the University of Virginia to \nadmit women. As evidence of Judge Merhige's groundbreaking decisions, \nhe was given 24-hour protection by Federal marshals due to repeated \nthreats of violence against him and his family. His courage in the face \nof significant opposition of the times is a testimony to his dedication \nto the rule of law.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, I have worked to name the new \ncourthouse in Richmond for these two men for several years. I am proud \nthat the Virginia Congressional Delegation, the Virginia Bar \nAssociation, the mayor of Richmond, and many others decided that the \nbest way to honor both men was to have them equally share the honor of \nhaving the courthouse so named.\n  With the ribbon cutting for this grand facility tentatively set for \nOctober 17 of this year, I am please by the passage of this legislation \nin honor of\n\n[[Page S8218]]\n\nSpottswood Robinson and Robert Merhige. Mr. President, in conclusion, I \nthank my colleagues in joining me in support of this legislation, and I \nthank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of these two great \nVirginians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/09/senate-section/article/S8218-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2008\n\n  Mr. REID.
