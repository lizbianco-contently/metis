Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 6 p.m. is equally divided and controlled between the two leaders \nor their designees. Each side will have a full 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use.\n  Mr. President, our Nation was founded on the basic principle of \nfairness, justice, and equality. Over the years, a continuing march of \nprogress has brought these shared ideals to ever more Americans. The \n``Whites only'' signs that were a stain on America are a thing of the \npast. We have opened the door of opportunity to African Americans, \nLatinos, Asians, and Native Americans. Glass ceilings that limited the \nopportunities of women and persons with disabilities are shattered. We \nhave improved protections for persons of faith who suffer \ndiscrimination and intolerance because of their beliefs. Opportunities \nfor older workers are greater now than perhaps at any previous time in \nour history. The march of progress represents America at its best. It \nhas brought us ever closer to the ideal of Dr. Martin Luther King that \nAmericans will one day be measured not by the color of their skin, \ntheir gender, their national origin, their race, their religion, or \ntheir disability, but by the content of their character.\n  The Senate has been an important part of the progress in guaranteeing \nfairness and opportunity. We passed strong bipartisan laws to protect \nbasic civil rights, and we must not turn back the clock again. Time and \nagain, the Senate has gone on record in favor of fairness and against \ndiscrimination, and we have done so by overwhelming majorities. We will \nhave an opportunity in a few moments to do so again.\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\n  This chart shows the record of the Senate in ensuring pay equity for \nthose whose skin is a different color, on the basis of age, disability, \ngender, religion, or national origin. Here it is: The Equal Pay Act was \npassed on a voice vote. An overwhelming majority in the Senate, \nDemocrats and Republicans, said equal pay, equal work should be the law \nof the land. It was passed in 1963.\n  The Civil Rights Act of 1964, title VII, equal pay for equal work, \npassed 73 to 27.\n  Age discrimination that says you will not discriminate on the basis \nof age passed the Senate under President Johnson by a voice vote.\n  The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provided the same kind of protections \nfor disabled individuals, individuals who have some disability but are \notherwise qualified to do work. You cannot discriminate against them. \nThat was passed on a voice vote under President Nixon. And this was \nrepeated in the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988, the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\n  Look at the Presidents: Kennedy, Johnson, Johnson, Nixon, Reagan, \nBush, Bush. And now in the Senate our Republican friends want to say: \nOh, no, we are going to permit discrimination against women because \nthey did not have adequate notice that the discrimination was taking \nplace because the employer did not give them that notice when they gave \nthem a paycheck that was unequal to their male counterparts. That was a \n5-to-4 decision.\n  We have an opportunity to go back on the right track that Republican \nand Democratic Presidents and Congress led us down. Let's restore the \nfairness, the equity, the decency, and the humanity this Senate of the \nUnited States has gone on record with regard to equal pay for women, \ndisabled, and the elderly in our society. Let's do that. We have a \nchance to do so in just 45 minutes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask that I be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts makes an eloquent and passionate statement, but everyone \nwithin the sound of my voice needs to understand something. This debate \ntoday is not about allowing, favoring, or supporting discrimination. It \nis about preserving the Civil Rights Act to which the distinguished \nSenator just referred, because the Civil Rights Act stated clearly that \nif a complaint was filed, it needed to be filed within 180 days of the \nact of discrimination, or as, as current EEOC practice allows, 180 days \nfrom the date which a reasonable person should have known.\n  Let's make sure everyone understands all this. Since 1964, 44 years \nago, that has been the provision in the statute. No one is trying to \nkeep that from happening.\n  Secondly, everybody needs to understand this: It is very important to \npeople, regardless of whether they are a woman, a man, a Methodist, \nAfrican American, Latino, whatever, if they are discriminated against, \nwe need to make sure there is timely evidence so the handling of these \nclaims can be completed thoroughly and completely.\n  The Ledbetter Fair Pay Act changes the civil rights law provisions \nfrom 180 days from the time a discriminatory act was made or a \nreasonable person should have known they had been discriminated against \nto 180 days from any ``economic effect.'' This means that someone can \nwork for a company for 30 years, go on retirement and pension, get a \npension check, declare the 180 days just started, and file a complaint \nfrom 30 years ago.\n  We are about having integrity in the system so we have timely \ncomplaints, we have timely evidence, and the parties who are there can \nquickly be remedied.\n  I would like my staff to put up a chart because I would like to \nreview the history of the Ledbetter case.\n  In 1982, Mrs. Ledbetter filed a complaint for sexual harassment \nagainst her supervisor. That complaint was settled between her and the \ncompany, Goodyear, in a timely fashion, and she was satisfied.\n  In 1992, Mrs. Ledbetter, under testimony, testified that she became \naware she was being paid less than her peers, but she filed no \ncomplaint.\n  In 1993, she did not file a complaint.\n  In 1994, she did not file a complaint.\n  In 1995, Mrs. Ledbetter said:\n\n       I told him at that time that I knew definitely that they \n     were all making a thousand at least more per month than I was \n     and that I would like to get in line.\n\n  But she did not file a complaint.\n  In 1996, she did not file a complaint.\n  In 1997, she did not file a complaint.\n  And then on July 21, 1998, a complaint was filed, shortly after her \nsupervisor died. That is the reason for the statute of limitations on \nthe complaint to begin with--to ensure you have contemporary and timely \ninformation and the parties who might have committed the act of \ndiscrimination are alive and can be held accountable.\n  No less than Justice John Paul Stevens, the first time this \nparticular provision of statute of limitations was taken to the Court, \nin a 7-to-2 decision in 1977 said the following:\n\n       A discrimination act which has not made the basis for a \n     time charge is merely an unfortunate event in history which \n     has no present legal consequence.\n\n  Some will argue--and I am sure Senator Kennedy will--about hidden, or \nconcealed, discrimination, whereby a person might not become aware they \nare being victimized. Essentially, you can rope-a-dope someone and fool \nthem. Current EEOC practice clearly states that it is 180 days from the \ntime a reasonable person should have known or would have known they \nwere discriminated against.\n  It is very important for us to understand that we have a case, the \nLedbetter case, where the individual testified under oath in deposition \nthat she was aware she was being underpaid and did not file. We also \nhave a person in 1982, a decade before the alleged act, who did file a \ncase for sex discrimination. So it was not ignorance of the system, \nignorance of the law, or ignorance of the court; it was violation of \nthe time provided.\n  Just to make sure the record is clear, in a deposition of Mrs. \nLedbetter on July 18, 2000:\n\n       Question: So you had this conversation with Mike Tucker \n     about the 1995 evaluation. You told him then that you wanted \n     to try to get your pay more in line with your peers?\n       Mrs. Ledbetter: That is correct.\n       Question: How did you know that your peers were earning \n     more?\n       Mrs. Ledbetter: Different people I worked for along the way \n     had always told me my pay was extremely low.\n\n  Again in a deposition later on:\n\n       Question: And so you knew in 1992 that you were paid less \n     than your peers.\n       Mrs. Ledbetter: Yes, sir.\n\n  Mr. President, I abhor discrimination. I share the reverence of the \nquote of Martin Luther King, a citizen of my home State, quoted by \nSenator Kennedy, that we all yearn for the day that a man will be \njudged by the content of his character and not the color of his skin. \nWe respect that today. That is why the Civil Rights Act we discuss \ntoday was passed. That is why, when they passed the Civil Rights Act, \nCongress put in a standard of 180 days from the date of discrimination \nto ensure the evidence was there, the supervisors were there. That way \nan aggrieved person could take action to remedy quickly this situation \ncould. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act changes that to a distant time \nin the future when people could have passed away, records could have \nbeen destroyed, and the ability to prove the allegation would be \nimpossible.\n  I submit, in an environment in 2008 in the United States of America \nwhere equity, nondiscrimination, and freedom are available to all \nAmericans, that it is this timeliness is important so that anybody who \nis injured and anybody who is aggrieved gets a swift and just action in \nthe courts of the United States of America.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take 30 seconds.\n  We are attempting to restore the law prior to the Supreme Court \ndecision. That is all we are trying to do. The law before the Supreme \nCourt's decision is that when the paycheck reflects discrimination the \ntime to file starts.\n  Here is a chart. All light green and dark green. That was the law of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\nland. That was the law of the land, Mr. President. That is what our \nbill does. Let's not confuse the facts. We want to go back to what the \nlaw of the land was--that and only that.\n  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for his brilliant \nleadership on this and so many other issues.\n  First, I have to say that I sat and listened to my good friend from \nGeorgia, and I noted that Lilly Ledbetter is in the gallery, and I was \njust thinking of having her listen to all of this talk, a lot of it \nsort of legalese and parsing hairs. Just think of who she is--a hard-\nworking woman from Gadsden, AL, a supervisor in a tire plant working \njust as hard as the men alongside her and every day and every week and \nevery year not getting paid the same as they simply because she was a \nwoman. It was not because she did a worse job, not because of any other \nreason. She has had to listen first to the Supreme Court and then to \nsome of my colleagues parse hairs, and it is just not fair, it is not \nright, and it is un-American.\n  Now, let me say this: As a male, this is something that is very \ndifficult for men to understand, and yet women, whether they make \n$20,000 or $70,000 or $200,000, they know it and live with it every \nsingle day. It is not a surprise that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was so upset \nat this decision--a mean decision, a decision that makes people dislike \nthe law--that she read her entire dissent from the bench, a highly \nunusual practice on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Equal pay for equal work is as American as it comes. Equal pay for \nequal work is as American as apple pie. And to have a bunch of lawyers, \nwhether they are Senators or Supreme Court Justices, parse hairs and \ndeny simple, plain justice is as un-American as can be as well.\n  So I hope this body will rise to the occasion. This is not a decision \nwhere you need a Harvard law degree to understand how backward it is. \nAll you have to do is know who Mrs. Ledbetter is and who the millions \nof other American women are who are put in the same position as she is, \nand you know the cry for justice, justice, justice should ring from \nthese Halls.\n  So I hope we in this body, again, will rise to the occasion. I hope \nthis body will do right by Mrs. Ledbetter in her long struggle to right \nthis wrong, and to the millions of American women, our wives, our \ndaughters, our friends, our relatives, and the many others we all do \nnot know who are working hard, by the sweat of their brow, trying to \nsupport their family, trying to move up the ladder of decency and honor \nand success so that they, too, when they work, will be treated like \ntheir male counterpart.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts referred to restoring \nthe law to pre-2002. The Supreme Court, in 1977, through John Paul \nStevens' majority opinion, 7 to 2; 1980 and 1986, in all three of those \nrulings they upheld the 180-day provision of the Civil Rights Act of \nthe United States of America. That was the law prior to Ledbetter, and \nthat is what the court reaffirmed in Ledbetter.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Mr. Enzi.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to both the \nsubstance of H.R. 2831, the so-called Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, as well \nas the process--or more accurately, the lack of process--that has \nbrought this matter to the Senate floor today.\n  Welcome to ``gotcha politics 2008.'' When we really are intending to \npass a bill, particularly with our Health, Education, Labor and Pension \nCommittee, this is not the way we do it. We sit down, we talk about the \nprinciple, we list the mechanisms for solving that principle, and we \nwork together to come up with a solution. That is not the case on this \none. There has been a lack of any meaningful legislative process \nregarding this bill.\n  Earlier in this session, the Supreme Court upheld a Circuit Court \ndecision regarding the limitations period for filing claims under the \ndiscrimination statutes I have noted. In my view, this decision was \nunquestionably correct and completely consistent with the intent of \nthose statutes. However, even for those who might ultimately disagree \nwith that view, there can be no debate Congress's subsequent action was \na slapdash response and a transparent attempt to score political points \nat the expense of responsible legislating.\n  No sooner was the ink dry on the decision from the Supreme Court, \nthan this legislation was introduced in the House. It was rushed \nthrough committee without change and rammed through the House on an \nessentially party-line vote just 5 days later. The bill was debated \nunder a rule that allowed only 1 hour of debate and no amendments. Does \nthat seem a little familiar? Yesterday, we heard a diatribe on the \nSenate floor about how Republicans are holding up everything and \ninsisting on these motions to proceed being brought up. Then, after \ncloture was approved 94 to 0 on a veterans bill, we weren't allowed to \nvote on it again anytime that day, and we didn't even go into session \nuntil 5 o'clock tonight. That was to keep any discussion or any votes \nfrom happening and to limit any debate on this issue.\n  That is not the way the Senate is supposed to operate, but it is the \nway we are operating on this bill, just as they did in the House--not \ngoing through the normal process of making sure that concerns were \nbeing solved. That is the only way anything ever makes it through this \nbody. A look at the House vote reveals this was not the result of any \ngroundswell of unanimity in that body. The margin was razor thin. The \nbill was then sent to the Senate, where by regular order it is supposed \nto come before the appropriate committee for debate and amendments, but \nthat hasn't happened. This body has consistently and rightfully taken \npride in the care and thorough negotiation of its deliberative process.\n  Now, despite the deceptive name, this legislation doesn't restore \nanything. Quite to the contrary, it completely destroys a vital \nprovision of title VII of the Civil Rights Act that was intentionally \nincluded by the drafters of that legislation. Employment discrimination \nbased on race, sex, age, national origin, religion, or disability is \nintolerable, and the drafters wanted to ensure any claims of sex \ndiscrimination could be promptly addressed.\n  Beyond this consideration, the drafters of those laws also recognized \ntwo practical realities: First, in the employment context, unaddressed \nclaims of discrimination are particularly corrosive. Federal \ndiscrimination policy must ensure that bias is rooted out and remedied \nas quickly as possible. And, second, it is virtually impossible to \ndiscover the truth with respect to such claims based on events in the \ndistant past. With the passage of time, memories fade, critical \nwitnesses become unavailable for one reason or another, and records, \ndocuments, and other physical evidence are destroyed or otherwise not \navailable. Under this bill, that claim can go until the time of \nretirement and then be claimed back to the time of whenever this \nsupposed discrimination was, where the witnesses aren't available. But, \nmost importantly, the accounting records aren't available anymore. How \ncan you go back and figure that amount without the records?\n\n  It is for these reasons that all statutes granting the right to take \nlegal action contain a limitation period for commencing such actions. \nThese general considerations of discrimination in the workplace led the \ndrafters of title VII to intentionally establish a relatively short \nperiod with respect to such claims. They selected a period of 180 days \nfrom the discriminatory act, a period that, depending upon the State \nwhere the claim arises, could extend to 300 days.\n  This bill doesn't restore this well-reasoned and plainly intended \nlimitation period and policy; it would eliminate it in virtually all \nemployment discrimination cases. Under this bill, an individual could \nfile a timely charge of discrimination based on an event or act that \noccurred years, even decades before.\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\n  We are told, however, that such a change is necessary because \nemployees may not know they are being discriminated against, or that \nemployers will hide the fact from employees in order to prevent the \ntimely filing of a claim. These appear on their face to be appealing \narguments; however, they ignore and they misrepresent the actual state \nof the law. The law already provides remedies in these instances. The \nlimitations period for filing employment discrimination claims is not \nnearly as inflexible as the proponents of this bill would lead people \nto believe.\n  What about individuals who simply don't know the facts that would \nlead a reasonable person to conclude they have been discriminated \nagainst? Would they be barred from bringing a claim with the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission? If an employee doesn't know the \nfacts, wouldn't their employer just get a free pass on discrimination? \nThe EEOC has addressed this directly. Here is what the EEOC's own \ncompliance manual says:\n\n       Sometimes a charging party will be unaware of a possible \n     EEO claim at the time of the alleged violation. Under such \n     circumstances, the filing period should be tolled until the \n     individual has, or should have, enough information to support \n     a reasonable suspicion of discrimination.\n\n  Under the well-recognized doctrine of a continuing violation, all \nthat the law requires is that there be a single act of discrimination \nwithin the applicable filing period, and the other context is properly \nswept into the charge from the reasonable time of knowing it.\n  Now, this flawed legislation also hides another vast expansion of \nworkplace discrimination laws that must not go unmentioned. Since 1968, \nthe law has been that the individual who is discriminated against is \nthe person with the standing to file a lawsuit. But under this bill, \nany individual affected by application of a discriminatory compensation \ndecision or other practice has standing to sue. So now it isn't just at \nretirement or death when the person can bring this up, it is other \nfamily members or other dependents who can bring it up, long after the \nlast paycheck.\n  Practitioners we have consulted agree that this incredibly broad \nlanguage would easily cover dependents, such as spouses and children \nbenefiting from pension payments and family health care coverage. It \ncould also be construed by courts to extend liability long after \npension payments are completed, if the money is invested in an annuity, \nfor example. This is a huge expansion that we have never talked about \nin committee.\n  And, before I close, I want to mention my greatest concern in dealing \nwith the legislation. If we were really concerned about helping the \ngreatest number of workers, we wouldn't be focused on changing the law \nto help improve their chances of a successful lawsuit. Instead, we \nwould be extending a helping hand and providing a source for them to \nobtain the training they need to keep their current jobs and work \ntoward better ones--the flexibility to move.\n  Such a change would come if we were able to convince the majority to \nfinish the job we started on the Workforce Investment Act. It is 5 \nyears overdue for reauthorization, and we passed it through the Senate \ntwice, but we have never been able to have a conference committee. This \nlegislation would mean 900,000 people a year could have better job \ntraining. So our inability to get this bill signed into law is a shame.\n  Again, I say this has not gone through the proper process here in the \nSenate and it was rushed through the House. I guess some think it is \nalways easy to be able to catch a little publicity based on some \narticles in the paper and try to push something along, but if you \nactually want to pass a bill it doesn't work. It has to go through a \nnormal process to pass the Senate, and that is what I am sure will \nhappen on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for his leadership on this \nissue and for the way his staff worked with the women in the Senate to \novercome what we thought was a flagrant abuse of power.\n  In May of last year, the Supreme Court issued a decision called the \nLedbetter case that was basically sexist and biased. It didn't reflect \nthe spirit of the civil rights law on discrimination. It didn't reflect \nthe reality of the workplace or the reality of women's lives. The \nSupreme Court overturned the opinions that had been given by the \nappellate court, by precedent, by history, and so on.\n  What did the Supreme Court say? That it was OK to discriminate, \nunless you knew 180 days from the time you were discriminated against \nand brought an action or brought this to the attention of your \nemployer. Well, it just doesn't work that way. Anyone who knows the \nreality of the workplace knows that you don't know if you are being \ndiscriminated against.\n  What is the reality of the workplace? You can talk about sex at the \nwater cooler, you can talk about religion by your computer, you can \ntalk politics in the lunchroom, but if you open your mouth about your \npay and whether you have gotten a raise, you are in trouble. If a woman \nbegins to go and ask: Hey, George, what do you get paid, mum's the \nword.\n\n  If, then, Bill gets a raise, the guys are sitting around at the ball \ngame downing a few beers and they say: Hey, George, you have done a \ngreat job, we are going to give you a promotion, how do you know about \nthis? The only way you know about it is over time.\n  What we are doing in this legislation, led by Senator Kennedy--we \nhave a bipartisan bill--is to right the Supreme Court decision. We are \ndoing this at the urging of Justice Ginsburg. The Supreme Court \ndecision was so bad that Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the only woman on the \nSupreme Court, took the unusual step of reading her dissent from the \nbench, and she said:\n\n       In our view the Court does not comprehend or is indifferent \n     to the insidious way in which women can be victims of pay \n     discrimination.\n\n  She said this needed to be fixed by Congress, and Congress has a \nremedy we are voting on today.\n  I was appalled to read that not only was the Supreme Court decision \nbad, but now the President has issued a veto threat. He said this bill \nis going to ``impede justice.'' That is baloney. This bill doesn't \nimpede justice, it restores justice. It reinstates a fair rule for both \nworkers and employers. He said it is going to mess up the process. This \nbill does not slow down the process, it gives people a way of getting \ninto the process if you can't bring a claim in more than 6 months after \nyou have been hired.\n  President Bush also says he wants to veto this because this bill \nwould eliminate the statute of limitation in wage discrimination cases. \nThat is not true. This bill does not change the 180-day time limit. It \nonly changes when the clock starts to run. The bill restarts the clock \nwith each time you get a paycheck that discriminates, so each time you \nget a paycheck that discriminates, the 180-day clock starts to run \nagain. This is critical. How many people, as I said, know the salary of \ntheir coworkers? If you are hired at an equal rate with your male \ncounterpart but he gets a raise in a few months and you don't, what \nshould you do?\n  This is what Lilly Ledbetter found. She was a faithful employee at \nthe Goodyear Company, Over time and with great risk she had to fight in \nher workplace, she had to fight in her courtroom.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Now it is time to fight for Lilly Ledbetter and the 150 \nmillion women in her position. The CBS poll on women says the No. 1 \nissue they face is equal pay for equal or comparable work. If in fact \nthis is not a problem, why does every woman in every poll make this a \nNo. 1 issue?\n  I ask that we make it a No. 1 issue in the Senate. We are now on a \nvote, as we faced with Anita Hill. I have a terrible feeling that \ntonight the Senate will not get it, but the women will get it and we \nare going to start a revolution as Abigail Adams asked us to do.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am surprised that my colleagues say \nthis is all about publicity. How can it be about publicity when, in \nreality, women make less than men in their everyday jobs? Last week in \nPittsburg I\n\n[[Page S3277]]\n\nattended an equal pay forum and found young children carrying handmade \nsigns about justice: Gussie, a young girl, said, ``I will work for \njustice;'' Sofia, another young girl, said, ``I will work for \njustice;'' Leo, who wanted to join in with these young ladies, said, \n``I will work for change and for justice.'' The children planned to \nwalk around and collect 23 cents on street corners, begging for an \namount of change that represents the difference between what men and \nwomen get paid.\n  This young generation of Americans wants to know that they are going \nto grow up in a world where they are going to get equal pay for equal \nwork.\n  Women, on average, make 77 cents per every dollar their male \ncounterparts make and stand to lose $250,000 dollars in income over \ntheir lifetime. We are talking about real dollars. The pay gap follows \nwomen into retirement. A single woman in retirement, making less pay in \nher career, could receive $8,000 dollars less in retirement income \nannually than a man--this is an issue of justice.\n  I appreciate that the Senator from Massachusetts has led the charge \non this. I want to remind my colleagues that we had a similar Supreme \nCourt decision on identity theft, which passed by a 9-0 vote, that \nlimited a victim's ability to recover when it is held that the statute \nof limitations begins at the time of the initial violation, rather than \nwhen the victim discovers the injury. It was the same issue. You did \nnot know that your identity had been stolen, but the courts maintained \na very narrow definition of how long you had to recover. What did we \ndo? We acted. Congress extended the statute of limitations to two years \nafter the individual knew their identity had been stolen or 5 years \nafter the violation. That is what Congress did. We corrected that. That \nis what we need to do to give equal justice to women so they can have \nequal pay.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  If I could have the attention of the Senator from Maryland, can the \nSenator explain to me why there would be reluctance in this body to \nvote for equal pay for equal work? We voted on this now more than five \ntimes in a 40-year period, to knock down the prejudice and \ndiscrimination to women, to minorities, to the disabled, and to the \nelderly. Under the Supreme Court decision, that discrimination can take \nplace in the United States of America today. This legislation can halt \nit. Can the Senator possibly think about why we should hesitate in \ntaking the action to restore the law to what it was prior to the \nSupreme Court decision?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First, I believe in this matter the Senate would be out \nof touch with the American people. The American people want fairness, \nthey want justice, and they believe women should be paid equal pay for \nequal or comparable work.\n  I also believe, though, there is opposition to the bill because \npeople make profits off of discrimination. If you pay women less, you \nmake more.\n  Also I believe when they talk about when the law was passed--the \nworkplace has changed. There are now more women in the workplace than \nthere were when the original laws were passed. But as the Senator from \nWashington State said, my gosh, this adds up to real money. You know, \n20 cents an hour that we make less than the guy next to us--unless we \nare in the Senate; we do have equal pay here--this, over a lifetime, \nadds up to over a quarter of a million or a million dollars. When we \nlook at its impact on Social Security, it is tremendous. Then if we \nlook at its impact on a 401(k), if you have one, it adds up.\n  I believe discrimination is profitable, but I think it is time that \njustice is done.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  If I can ask the Senator from Washington, in this downturn in our \neconomy we find that women have less savings, they are participating \nless in pension plans, they are subject to more foreclosures in \nhousing. At a time when women are under more pressure, can the Senator \npossibly explain why there should be reluctance in this body to restore \nfairness?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. It is quite simple to correct this issue today. We are \nasking that more women be a part of the math and science and \nengineering workforce, be part of the information technology age. But \nif they cannot ask how much their male counterparts are making and find \nout later that they are only making 77 cents per every dollar their \nmale counterparts make, that is not fair.\n  We could correct that by now by not only allowing people to come \nforward at the first instance of unequal pay--but every instance.\n  It is critical that we address this simple correction. This body has \ncorrected other Supreme Court decisions on these same statute of \nlimitations issues. This is the least we can do.\n  I see my colleague from New York has come to the floor. We ought to \nget this bill passed and get on to her legislation that is even more \nrobust--to make sure that employers are treating women fairly and \ngiving them information. This is basic. We should pass it and make sure \nwe send this to the President's desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I owe the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts an answer to the rhetorical questions he has asked. \nEverybody within the sound of my voice should understand we are not \ndebating whether anybody in here believes in discrimination. We have \nvoted over and over in this body for 44 years. We have the Equal Pay \nAct, as the Senator had on his chart there. That passed the Senate on \nvoice vote. That is not the issue. The issue in this case is the \ntolling provisions of the 1967 Civil Rights Act, Title VII, which dealt \nwith discrimination in wages based on race, religion, sex, or national \norigin. I will debate what tolling period is appropriate, but I am not \ngoing to stand here and allow this to be described as a debate over one \nside being for discrimination and another being against it. We are for \nthe timely reporting of claimants and the ability of people to be \nremedied expeditiously if they have been discriminated against.\n  How much time is left on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 13 minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield the distinguished Senator from Utah, Senator \nHatch, 11 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the bill that \nwould overturn the Supreme Court's ruling in Ledbetter v. Goodyear \nTire. At the outset, let me be perfectly clear about the basis for my \nopposition to the so-called Fair Pay Restoration Act. I know of no one \non either side of the aisle in this Senate who condones any form of \nunlawful employment discrimination, including pay discrimination.\n  Indeed, all forms of unlawful employment discrimination under Title \nVII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, including pay discrimination, should \nbe confronted promptly, efficiently, fairly and forthrightly, \nconsistent with the enforcement scheme provided for by the Congress \nwhich enacted that law.\n  Yet, once again we open debate on another of the magnificently \nmisnamed and misleading bills--the so-called Fair Pay Act which its \nproponents claim will ``restore'' the intent of Congress in enacting \nthe 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n  In fact, this bill does not restore anything, certainly not the \nrights of individuals under the Civil Rights Act and clearly not the \nstatute of limitations set by Congress for the timely filing of \nunlawful employment discrimination charges, including pay \ndiscrimination charges, with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, the EEOC, or similar State agencies.\n  In fact, Congress fully intended the charge-filing period to be 180 \ndays, or 300 days where there are similar State agencies, so as to \nencourage prompt, effective investigation, conciliation, and resolution \nof pay discrimination charges and charges of other forms of unlawful \nemployment discrimination.\n  It was for that reason that Congress carefully chose and designed the \ncurrent enforcement scheme, which has been consistently upheld by the \nSupreme Court for over 40 years.\n  Over that time, Congress and the courts have wisely and consistently \nencouraged cooperation and voluntary\n\n[[Page S3278]]\n\ncompliance, in the first instance, by the parties themselves and with \nthe timely assistance of the EEOC or similar State agencies, as the \npreferred method for addressing alleged unlawful employment \ndiscrimination.\n  Where voluntary compliance and conciliation are unsuccessful, title \nVII provides for vigorous enforcement by the private parties and the \nEEOC through litigation.\n  In other words, voluntary compliance and conciliation first, \nlitigation thereafter whenever necessary.\n  So, in fact, the so-called Fair Pay Act does not restore the intent \nof Congress or the original statute of limitations for the filing of \npay discrimination charges, and neither does it restore lost rights \nunder the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n  In fact, this bill dramatically expands the charge filing beyond all \nrecognition and expectations of the Congress which passed the 1964 \nCivil Rights Act. If this bill were to become law there would be no \nstatute of limitations, no time limit for the filing of alleged pay \ndiscrimination charges. Not 180 days, not 300 days, not years or even \ndecades, as in the Ledbetter case, or even after the employee has long \nsince retired and is receiving pension checks.\n  This bill not only expands the statute of limitations for filing \ncharges of alleged unlawful pay discrimination, it also expands the \nclass of individuals who can file such charges. And, beyond reversing \nthe Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision, which was an intentional \ndiscrimination case, this bill expands the time for filing the type of \nunintentional, disparate impact, or adverse impact, charges involving \npay practices which are facially neutral but could have some type of \nunintended consequences adverse to women or other protected groups.\n  As to the expansion of charge filing under the 1964 Civil Rights Act \nto individuals outside the protected groups, the so-called Fair Pay Act \nwould eliminate the existing requirement that to have standing there \nmust be an employer-employee or employer-applicant relationship. This \nbill expands the standing to sue requirements to include individuals \naffected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice. This language would appear to include spouse and other \nrelatives, as well as anyone else affected indirectly.\n  I am not imagining this. In fact, when questioned about whether such \na radical expansion of the law's standing requirements was intended by \nthe bill's proponents, they responded that it was their intention to do \nso.\n  Thus, under this bill, not only could employees and retirees file \ncharges of pay discrimination at any time, years or decades after the \ncurrent statute of limitations, but so too could anyone affected by \nalleged pay discrimination file charges, presumably even after the \nemployee is dead since the relatives or others were affected.\n  Let's also be candid about the type of pay discrimination alleged. \nThe Ledbetter case involved only claims of intentional discrimination \nor disparate treatment of individuals in a protected group. This bill \nwould apply also to unintentional discrimination--so-called disparate \nimpact, or adverse impact, discrimination. Those are cases where the \npay practices are neural and non-discriminatory on their face, but \nthrough statistical analysis such pay practices may have an unintended, \nattenuated disparate impact on a protected group, such as women. \nIndeed, the challenged pay practices may not have been intentionally \ndiscriminatory treatment, or even have had a disparate impact at the \ntime of their enactment, but sometime later a social scientist or \nstatistician may assert that the pay practices subsequently may have \nhad an adverse impact on one group or another.\n  Thus, in fact this bill goes well beyond simply reversing the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Ledbetter as its proponents claim.\n  I am also convinced that the so-called Fair Pay Act which we are \ndebating today would turn the system of enforcement established by \nCongress in 1964 on its head in a way that is most unfair.\n  At the heart of title VII and every other employment \nnondiscrimination statute--indeed, at the heart of every civil law \nenacted in this country--there is a statute of limitations within which \nclaims and charges must be brought. Actions brought outside those \nstatutory time periods are time barred.\n  The Supreme Court has consistently held in a long line of well-\nsettled and well-recognized case law that under title VII the statutory \nperiod for filing a charge begins to run when the alleged \ndiscriminatory decision is made and communicated, not when the \ncomplaining party feels the consequences of that decision.\n  Proponents of this act are, in essence, permitting an open-ended \nperiod for filing charges of pay discrimination with every paycheck and \nevery decision that contributed to current pay, or even with receipt of \npension or other retirement checks. The so-called Fair Pay Act would \nresult in a litigation ``gotcha'' strategy, or a ``litigation first and \nask questions later'' enforcement scheme which is directly contrary to \ncongressional intent in enacting title VII.\n  The current statutory charge-filing period for allegations of \nemployment discrimination, including pay discrimination, did not \nsuddenly pop up under the current Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision.\n  In fact, the Supreme Court has long upheld that the current statute \nof limitations for filing charges under title VII. In an often quoted \npassage from the 1974 Supreme Court decision American Pipe v. Utah, the \ntitle VII statutory limitation on the filing of charges beyond the 180- \nor 300-day period ``promote(s) justice by preventing surprises through \nthe revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence \nhas been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.''\n  In its 1979 decision in United States v. Kubrick, the Supreme Court \nsaid that the charge-filing period under title VII is ``balanced'' and \n``fair'' to both employers and employees.\n  The current 180- or 300-day charge filing period allows the employer \nand the EEOC (1) to investigate the pay discrimination charge: (2) to \nseek compromise, conciliation, settlement and fair resolution of the \ncharge; and (3) to allow both parties to prepare for litigation, if \nnecessary, by gathering and preserving evidence for trial where \nresolution is not possible outside of litigation.\n  Now let's look at how the current system would change under the so-\ncalled Fair Pay Act.\n  The plaintiff's charges of pay discrimination could be brought years, \ndecades, or even after the plaintiff's retirement from the company, or \nas I have stated earlier, by charges filed by relatives or other \naffected parties even after the employee's death. The employer's \nability to defend its actions or decisions will have dissipated. \nManagers and decision-makers may no longer be available. Business units \nmay have been reorganized, dissolved, or sold, and operations may have \nchanged or been eliminated. Relevant documents and records which are \nnot required to be preserved by law might have been disposed of, or are \notherwise unavailable. In effect, as the Supreme Court stated in \ndefending the current charge-filing period under title VII, unless an \nemployer receives prompt notice of allegations of employment \ndiscrimination it will have no ``opportunity to gather and preserve the \nevidence with which to sustain (itself). . . .''\n  I am convinced that the only beneficiaries of the so-called Fair Pay \nAct--the only ones who will see an increase in pay--are the trial \nlawyers.\n  So, if the so-called Fair Pay Act:\n  (1) does not restore lost rights under the 1964 Civil Rights Act and \nother employment non-discrimination statutes it amends, but greatly \nexpands them;\n  (2) does not restore the statute of limitations under title VII but \neliminates any statute of limitations creating open-ended, unlimited \nliability;\n  (3) does not further the intent of Congress in title VII of the 1964 \nCivil Rights Act to encourage prompt investigation, conciliation and \nresolution of unlawful discriminatory pay practices; and\n  (4) does not result in increased pay except for the plaintiff's trial \nlawyers who will gain an unfair advantage when the employer's witnesses \nare unavailable, memories have faded, records are long gone, and the \njury trial becomes a ``he said, she said'' based solely on the word of \na corporation against that of an individual plaintiff;\n\n[[Page S3279]]\n\n  Then what does the bill do?\n  I believe this bill undermines one of the bedrock principles of all \nJudeo-Christian jurisprudence--the statute of limitations. Frankly, I \nmay be mistaken, but I know of no other civil statute that allows an \nunlimited, open-ended time for filing an action. Criminal statutes, of \ncourse, may be open-ended in bringing indictments for such felony \ncrimes as murder, but even criminal misdemeanors generally have a \nstatutory period within which prosecutions must be brought.\n  For all these reasons, I suggest that this largely political vote on \nthis misnamed and misunderstood bill is one that is designed to place \nopponents of the bill in a false light of being unsympathetic to \nvictims of pay discrimination. That is simply untrue.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to this \nbill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have always supported efforts to \nensure fair pay and fair process. I would support a longer statute of \nlimitation for gender discrimination in the workplace, but the bill \nbefore us eliminates any statute of limitation. A reasonable statute \nmight be 1 or 2 years after the discovery of the inequity. The purpose \nof statutes of limitation is to ensure that witnesses are available and \ndefendants have records to defend themselves fairly. That is the reason \nthat statutes of limitation are an integral part of our legal system.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for \nprotecting American workers from willful pay discrimination. To show my \nsupport, I will support cloture on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of \n2007, H.R. 2831. I appreciate Chairman Kennedy and the bipartisan \ncoalition he has built around this legislation to ensure equal pay for \nequal work.\n  Every employee deserves to earn the same pay for doing the same work.\n  Our country was founded on the principle that all men and women are \ncreated equal.\n  Our workers should be paid equally for doing the same job.\n  As President Kennedy stated when he signed the original Equal Pay Act \nin 1963, protecting American workers against pay discrimination is \n``basic to democracy''. We owe our workers the same protection today \nthat President Kennedy did in the 1960s.\n  Despite our obligation to this issue, our work is far from complete. \nForty-five years after he signed that historic piece of bipartisan \nlegislation, American women still only make 77 cents for every dollar a \nman makes for doing the same work. African-American workers make 18 \npercent less than white workers for doing the same work and Latinos \nmake 28 percent less for doing the same work. Unfortunately for all of \nus, American Indians make even less for doing the same work.\n  Congress cannot ignore this kind of discrimination. We have a duty to \nsupport this bill and speak out against pay discrimination.\n  This bill will merely restore the law to what it was before the \nSupreme Court's decision in Ledbetter. This bill merely states that a \npay discrimination claim accrues when a pay decision is made, when an \nemployee is subject to that decision, or at any time they are injured \nby it.\n  Lilly Ledbetter had worked at Goodyear for 19 years when she \ndiscovered she was being paid significantly less than her male \ncounterparts for doing the exact same work. A jury agreed and awarded \nher $223,776 in back pay, and over $3 million in punitive damages. The \nUnited States Supreme Court however, interpreted the law to take away \nher jury award, saying that the 180-day filing limit had begun way back \nwhen her very first paycheck showed lesser pay, nearly 18 years \nearlier. So because too much time had elapsed the Court said, her claim \nwas invalid. Despite Goodyear's willful wage discrimination, the Court \noffered her no protection. In fact, it reversed the protection the jury \nawarded her.\n  We are here today to undo this wrongheaded decision and clarify this \nlaw to make it fair to American workers.\n  Opponents will argue that this bill will lead to a flood of \nlitigation, benefiting nobody but trial attorneys. They forget, \nhowever, that this bill merely returns the law to how the vast majority \nof States, including the great State of Montana, interpreted it before \nthe Ledbetter decision. This bill will only change the way courts \ninterpret the law in 7 States.\n  Opponents will also argue that this bill will punish businesses for \nacts of discrimination in some cases, decades ago, before management \nand corporate culture changed. The argument is hollow, however, because \nthe bill contains a provision to limit claims filed to a 2-year \nmaximum. In the spirit of negotiation, proponents had to limit \npotential awards. Take Lilly Ledbetter's case, for example. If this law \nwould have been in effect for her, 16 out of the 18 years that she \nsuffered pay discrimination would still go unpunished.\n  This bill is not perfect. We still have a long ways to go to protect \nAmerican workers from pay discrimination. But this bill is a step in \nthe right direction and the time is now. The House of Representatives \npassed this important bill last July, and It is time for this body to \ndo the same. President Kennedy was absolutely right to support the \nEqual Pay Act in 1963. Forty-five years later, this bill will ensure \nthat we turn the clock forward, not backward, on pay discrimination.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, yesterday was Equal Pay Day in America. It \nis befitting that it was on a Tuesday because Tuesday is the day on \nwhich women's wages catch up to men's wages from the previous week. It \nis most unfortunate that women continue to be discriminated against by \nemployers, in particular those who routinely pay lower wages for jobs \nthat are dominated by women.\n  However, today my colleagues in the Senate will have an opportunity \nto begin the process to restore the intent of Congress as it relates to \nthe fundamental fairness to millions of workers. We will have a chance \nto override a decision by the Supreme Court last June, in the case of \nLedbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. In this case, the Court, \nin a 5-to-4 ruling, reversed a longstanding interpretation, used by \nnine Federal circuits and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, \nEEOC, under which the statute of limitations for pay discrimination \nbegins to run each time an employee receives a paycheck or other form \nof compensation. Instead, the Court ruled that the 180-day statute of \nlimitations on filing a discrimination claim with the EEOC begins to \nrun when the original discriminatory decision is made and conveyed to \nthe employee, regardless of whether the pay discrimination continues \nbeyond the 180-day period. This is an unfair and unjust ruling. For \nemployees who are prohibited from having access to data reflecting the \nwages of other employees, it is impossible for them to ascertain \nwhether they have been a victim of wage discrimination--let alone, to \nknow from the original time of the discriminatory act. In many cases, \nemployees may not know until years later that they have been \ndiscriminated against on the basis of pay.\n  I urge my colleagues to support cloture on the motion to proceed to \nthis important legislation, and to support enactment of this bill. The \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007 will restore the interpretation \nthat the statute of limitations begins to run each time an employee \nreceives a paycheck or other form of compensation reflecting the \ndiscrimination, otherwise known as the ``paycheck accrual'' rule. It \nwould ensure that employees who can prove pay discrimination based on \nrace, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability will \nnot be forever barred from seeking redress because they did not learn \nthat they were victims of pay discrimination within 6 months after the \ndiscrimination first occurred.\n  Although women still only earn 77 cents for every $1 earned by men, \nwe should not be moving backwards. It is simple, this legislation will \nrestore an employee's right to seek restitution against wage \ndiscrimination at the time the employee discovers it. In addition, it \nis important to note that this legislation is not just about gender pay \ndiscrimination. In 2007, EEOC received more than 7,000 pay \ndiscrimination charges. While some are on the basis of gender, others \nare on the basis of race, disability, national origin, and age.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to do what is right and support \ncloture and passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n\n[[Page S3280]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Fair Pay \nRestoration Act, which is currently before the Senate.\n  On May 29, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision in the case \nof Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Inc. After her retirement \nfrom Goodyear in 1998, Lilly Ledbetter filed a sex discrimination case \nagainst her employer. Ms. Ledbetter claimed that she had been paid \nsignificantly less than her male counterparts during her work as one of \nthe few female supervisors at Goodyear. Unfortunately, due to a company \npolicy that prohibited employees from discussing their pay, Ms. \nLedbetter couldn't confirm the discrimination until she received an \nanonymous note that detailed the salaries of three of the male \nmanagers. This note confirmed that Ms. Ledbetter had been paid 20 \n+percent to 40 percent less than the male managers throughout her \nemployment with Goodyear. A jury found that this pay discrepancy was \nbased, at least in part, on sex discrimination.\n  Ms. Ledbetter is an example of an employee who has done all that is \nexpected of her. By all reports, she performed her job admirably, the \nsame work being performed by her male counterparts. She raised concerns \nabout her pay level and eventually brought suit against her employer.\n  Through this process came the Supreme Court decision which limits an \nemployee's right to collect backpay to 180 days after the issuance of a \ndiscriminatory paycheck. This is true even if the employee was unaware \nof the discrimination or, as in the case of Ms. Ledbetter, was unable \nto discover proof of such discrimination through the deliberate efforts \nof her employer.\n  The Fair Pay Restoration Act is a return to the rational, reasonable \napproach that had been applied by Federal circuit courts in most \nStates, including my home State of New Mexico, prior to the Ledbetter \ndecision. Under the previous rule, an employee could bring a claim \nwithin 180 days of the last discriminatory paycheck. This bill would \nalso implement a limitation on backpay claims to 2 years, providing \nbusinesses a protection against claims that are allowed to accumulate \nover years and encouraging employees to act with all due diligence in \npursuing discrimination claims. The Congressional Budget Office has \ndetermined that the Fair Pay Act is unlikely to increase the number of \nclaims brought in discrimination cases.\n  We must work to ensure that the courts remain a source of redress for \nemployees many of whom are fighting much larger and better financed \nemployers. Employees should not face unreasonable obstacles in their \nefforts to pursue a discrimination claim and to seek appropriate \nremedies. By placing an undue burden on employees to quickly prove \ndiscrimination, the Ledbetter decision has negatively altered the use \nof the courts as a remedy for discriminatory conduct by employers. \nEmployers who are more successful at hampering their employees' efforts \nto prove discrimination and delay are now afforded more protection than \nthose employers who treat their employees justly under the law. The \nFair Pay Restoration Act seeks to restore this equity and to ensure \nthat employees and employers have full and equal access to the courts.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the Fair Pay \nRestoration Act, legislation that protects American workers from pay \ndiscrimination, and I am glad the Senate is debating it.\n  This bill is designed to overrule an incorrect court decision that \ncut off one woman's efforts to seek recourse for pay discrimination she \nexperienced at the hands of her employer. As one of the few female \nsupervisors at her company's plant, Lilly Ledbetter was paid \nsubstantially less than male employees in the same position who \nperformed the same duties. This information about unequal pay was kept \nconfidential. It was only after Ms. Ledbetter received an anonymous \nnote revealing the higher salaries of other managers who were male that \nMs. Ledbetter recognized that she was being paid less because she was a \nwoman. Ms. Ledbetter's case went to trial and a jury awarded her full \ndamages and back pay.\n  Last year, in a sharply divided opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that \nMs. Ledbetter had filed her lawsuit too long after her employer \noriginally decided to give her unequal pay. Under title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, an individual must file a complaint of wage \ndiscrimination within 180 days of the alleged unlawful employment \npractice. Before the Ledbetter decision, each time an employee received \na new paycheck, the 180-day clock was restarted because every paycheck \nwas considered a new unlawful practice.\n  The Supreme Court changed this longstanding rule. It held that an \nemployee must file a complaint within 180 days from when the original \npay decision was made. Ms. Ledbetter found out about the decision to \npay her less than her male colleagues well after 180 days from when the \ncompany had made the decision. Under the Supreme Court's decision, Ms. \nLedbetter was just too late to get back what she had worked for. It did \nnot matter that she only discovered that she was being paid less than \nher male counterparts many years after the inequality in pay had begun. \nAnd it did not matter that there was no way for her to find out she was \nbeing paid less until someone told her that was the case.\n  Mr. President, to put it simply, the Supreme Court got it wrong. It \nignored the position of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and \nthe decisions of the vast majority of lower courts that the issuance of \neach new paycheck constitutes a new act of discrimination. It ignored \nthe fact that Congress had not sought to change this longstanding \ninterpretation of the law.\n  The decision also ignores the workplace reality for millions of \nAmerican workers just like Ms. Ledbetter. Workers often have no idea \nwhen they are not being compensated fairly because their companies do \nnot disclose their employee's salaries. Because of the secrecy \nsurrounding salaries, pay discrimination is one of the most difficult \nforms of discrimination to identify. Unlike a decision not to promote \nor hire, discrimination on the basis of pay can remain hidden for \nyears. The Supreme Court's decision leaves victims of pay \ndiscrimination who do not learn about the discrimination within 6 \nmonths of its occurrence with no ability to seek justice. In the wake \nof this decision, employers can discriminate against employees by \nunfairly paying them less than what they are due, and as long as the \nemployee does not learn about the discrimination and file a complaint \nwithin 6 months, the employer gets off scot free.\n\n  The financial impact of a late filing is felt for years, even into \nretirement. Even a small disparity in pay can add up to thousands of \ndollars over multiple years. This is because other forms of \ncompensation such as raises, overtime payments, retirement benefits, \nand even Social Security payments are calculated according to an \nemployee's base pay. Thus, the Supreme Court's decision harms American \nworkers even after their careers are over.\n  The Fair Pay Restoration Act reestablishes a reasonable timeframe for \nfiling pay discrimination claims. It returns us to where we were before \nthe Court's decision, with the time limit for filing pay discrimination \nclaims beginning when a new paycheck is received, rather than when an \nemployer first decides to discriminate. Under this legislation, as long \nas workers file their claims within 180 days of a discriminatory \npaycheck, their complaints will be considered.\n  This bill also maintains the current limits on the amount employers \nowe once they have been found to have committed a discriminatory act. \nCurrent law limits backpay awards to 2 years before the worker filed a \njob discrimination claim. This bill retains this 2-year limit, and \ntherefore does not make employers pay for salary inequalities that \noccurred many years ago. Workers thus have no reason to delay filing a \nclaim. Doing so would only make proving their cases harder, especially \nbecause the burden of proof is on the employee, not the employer.\n  Opponents say that this bill will burden employers by requiring them \nto defend themselves in costly litigation. This is simply not the case. \nMost employers want to do right by their employees, and most employers \npay their employees fair and equal wages. This legislation will only \naffect those employers who underpay and discriminate against their \nworkers, hoping that employees, like Ms. Ledbetter, won't find out in \ntime. The Congressional Budget\n\n[[Page S3281]]\n\nOffice has also reported that restoring the law to where it was before \nthe Ledbetter decision will not significantly affect the number of \nfilings made with the EEOC, nor will it significantly increase the \ncosts to the Commission or to the Federal courts.\n  Yesterday, individuals from across the country observed Equal Pay \nDay, a day which reminds us as a nation that a woman is still paid 77 \ncents for every dollar earned by a man. This disparity is all too real. \nEnding it will require commitment, and we can show that commitment by \npassing this bill. The last thing American women need is a Supreme \nCourt decision that prevents them from seeking compensation from \nemployers who have engaged in outright discrimination.\n  In addition to passing the Fair Pay Restoration Act, Congress needs \nto do more to ensure all of America's citizens receive equal pay for \nequal work. Wage discrimination costs families thousands of dollars \neach year. This is hard-earned money that working women and men simply \ncannot afford to lose. We should pass the Fair Pay Act introduced by \nSenator Tom Harkin and the Paycheck Fairness Act introduced by Senator \nHillary Rodham Clinton. Senator Harkin's legislation would amend the \nFair Labor Standards Act to prohibit wage discrimination on account of \nsex, race, or national origin. Senator Clinton's legislation would \nstrengthen penalties for employers who violate the Equal Pay Act and \nrequire the Department of Labor to provide training to employers to \nhelp eliminate pay disparities. I can think of no better way to \ncommemorate Equal Pay Day than to pass these three pieces of \nlegislation now.\n\n  Wage discrimination is not just a women's issue. Individuals and \norganizations from every part of our country, of different political \nbeliefs and racial backgrounds, men and women, older Americans, \nreligious groups, and individuals with disabilities have come out in \nsupport of the Fair Pay Restoration Act. These supporters understand \nthat this legislation not only assists female workers who are trying to \nfight discrimination based on their sex. Because the Ledbetter decision \nestablished a general rule for all title VII employment discrimination \nclaims, they know that this legislation is needed to restore the \nability of employees across the Nation to redress discrimination based \non factors such as race, national origin, age, religion, and \ndisability.\n  Congress has repeatedly passed landmark bipartisan legislation to \neliminate discrimination in the workplace. These laws include the Equal \nPay Act of 1963, title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act of 1990, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Indeed, we \nhave made great progress in securing equal pay rights, but we must \ncontinue to defend these rights. Justice Ginsburg, in her sharply \nworded dissent in the Ledbetter decision, called on Congress to do \nsomething to rectify the inequity that the Supreme Court's decision \nleft to our country. The Fair Pay Restoration Act is our answer to \nJustice Ginsburg's call.\n  Lilly Ledbetter turned 70 years old this month. For almost two \ndecades, Ms. Ledbetter worked hard for a company that discriminated \nagainst her by not paying her what it was legally required to pay. The \nSupreme Court, in its decision last year, ended Ms. Ledbetter's long \nquest for justice. She can no longer recover what was rightfully hers. \nSince the Ledbetter decision, other workers have already had their \ncases dismissed. These unjust outcomes will continue to mount until \nCongress acts. Each case is a new injustice, and it is an avoidable \ninjustice because Congress can take steps right now to reverse the \nSupreme Court's erroneous decision.\n  Passing the Fair Pay Restoration Act is an essential step in the \nright direction--a step toward the day when the basic right of American \nworkers to equal pay for equal work will be realized. I urge my \ncolleagues to stand up for the rights of women and all American workers \nby voting for this vital legislation.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, our country has lost 230,000 jobs in just \nthe first 3 months of this year. The unemployment rate has gone up to \n5.1 percent. In Ohio, unemployment hovers around 6 percent.\n  Women are also disproportionately at risk in the current foreclosure \ncrisis, since women are 32 percent more likely than men to have \nsubprime mortgages. Existing pay disparities for women exacerbate the \neconomic strain on women and on households run by women, since women \nearn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. Women have \nsignificantly fewer savings to fall back on in a time of economic \nhardship. Nonmarried women have a net worth 48 percent lower than \nnonmarried men, and women are less likely than men to participate in \nemployer-sponsored retirement savings programs.\n  These facts make this bill--the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration \nAct--all the more timely. Lilly Ledbetter was one of just a handful of \nfemale supervisors in the Goodyear tire plant in Gadsden, AL. For \nyears, she endured insults from her male bosses because she was a woman \nin a traditionally male job. She worked 12-hour shifts--which often \nstretched to 18 hours or more when another supervisor was absent. But \nshe did not know she was being paid less than men until later in her \ncareer. She had no way of knowing how much her coworkers made.\n  Late in her career with the company, Lilly got an anonymous note in \nher mailbox informing her that Goodyear paid her male counterparts 20 \nto 40 percent more than she earned for doing the same job. She then \nfiled a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She \nalso filed a lawsuit. In court, a jury found that Goodyear \ndiscriminated against Lilly Ledbetter. The jury awarded Ms. Ledbetter \nfull damages, but the Supreme Court said she was entitled to nothing \nbecause she was too late in filing her claim.\n  The Court's Ledbetter decision reversed decades of precedent in the \ncourts of appeals. It also overturned the policy of the EEOC under both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations. The Bush EEOC was on the \nside of Lilly Ledbetter until the Solicitor General took over for the \nBush administration. The Ledbetter decision leaves workers powerless to \nhold their employers accountable for their unlawful, unjust conduct. \nEmployers who can hide discrimination from their workers for just 180 \ndays get free rein to continue to discriminate.\n  The Fair Pay Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor, will allow workers \nto file a pay discrimination claim within 180 days of a discriminatory \npaycheck. It only makes sense that as long as the discrimination \ncontinues, a worker's ability to challenge it should continue also. \nThis legislation would simply restore the law to what it was in almost \nevery State in the country the day before the Ledbetter decision. We \nknow it is workable and fair--it was the law of the land for decades.\n  Now, some in this Chamber will say this will result in more \nlitigation. That is wrong. The Fair Pay Act restores the law to what it \nwas before the Supreme Court decision. In fact, the Congressional \nBudget Office says the bill will not establish a new cause of action \nfor claims of pay discrimination. Restore the Fair Pay Act. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support \nfor the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007. I want to thank Senator \nKennedy for his leadership on this issue and on so many civil rights \nissues throughout his Senate career.\n  Earlier this week, we observed Equal Pay Day. Equal Pay Day is the \nday up until which a woman had to work past the end of 2007 to make as \nmuch money as a man made in 2007 alone. That means that a woman has to \nwork almost 16 months to make what a man makes in 12.\n  Every day in this country, women get up and go to work, just like \nmen. Women--who make up nearly 50 percent of the American workforce--\nput in 8, 10, 12 or more hours every day. And just like men, women go \nhome each night to families that rely on the money they earn. In the \nmillions of households led by single mothers, these women's paychecks \nare the only source of income.\n  But there is one day that looks very different for men and women--\npayday.\n  A woman makes only 77 cents for every dollar that a man makes. These\n\n[[Page S3282]]\n\ninequalities cut across educational divides. In my State of New Jersey, \na college-educated woman makes only 72 cents for every dollar a \ncollege-educated man makes.\n  This wage gap costs working families $200 billion in income every \nyear. And the strain on working families is only getting worse in \ntoday's struggling economy, which is hitting women especially hard. In \n2007, women's wages fell 3 percent, while men's wages fell one-half of \n1 percent. Unemployment for women also rose faster than for men during \nthe past year.\n  Yet last year, the Supreme Court reached a decision that made it even \nharder for women.\n  After spending almost 20 years working long hours as a supervisor at \na Goodyear plant in Alabama, Lilly Ledbetter discovered that she was \nmaking 20 percent less than the lowest paid male supervisor.\n  A jury awarded her back pay and damages, but the Supreme Court said \nthat she filed her lawsuit against her employer too late. The Supreme \nCourt said that she could not sue her employer more than 180 days after \nthe discrimination first began.\n  That simply does not make sense. Every time a worker receives a \ndiscriminatory paycheck, the employer is discriminating against the \nworker. So every paycheck should start a new clock for challenging that \ndiscrimination.\n  That was the rule in all but four States up until the day that \nLedbetter was decided. I am proud to say it was the rule in New Jersey. \nAnd it should be the rule again.\n  It is important to recognize that, although Ledbetter involved gender \ndiscrimination, its implications are much more far-reaching. The \nLedbetter decision will have the same effect on cases brought for \ndiscrimination based on race, national origin, religion, disability, \nand age. In all of these cases, victims of pay discrimination will be \nwithout recourse as long as their employers can get away with it for \n180 days.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would simply restore the pre-\nLedbetter rule that every paycheck is an act of ongoing discrimination. \nIt would not create any new right or remedy.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Senate version of this bill, and \nI support it wholeheartedly. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nvoting for this important civil rights law. It is the right thing to do \nfor America's working families.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, yesterday was Equal Pay Day. Equal Pay \nDay is the day that marks the extra months into the next year that a \nwoman needs to work in order to receive pay equal to what a man would \nmake for the equivalent job in only 12 months. Yes, Mr. President, as \nastonishing as it is, in the year 2008, it takes nearly 4 extra months \nfor a woman to bring home the same amount of money as her male \ncounterpart. According to the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, women earn, on average, only 77 cents for every dollar \nearned by men in comparable jobs. What a truly unthinkable, and frankly \ndisgraceful, circumstance--one that we must do everything within our \npower to change.\n  And today we can take a small but very significant step to make sure \nthat Americans have the legal opportunity to challenge pay \ndiscrimination by supporting the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Before I \nbegin, let me thank Senator Kennedy for his efforts to ensure that we \ndon't just stand by doing nothing, following an ill-advised Supreme \nCourt ruling that takes us a step back in time by making it \nextraordinarily difficult for victims of pay discrimination to sue \ntheir employers.\n  This Congress must not stand by while the Court forces an \nunreasonable reading of the law. Through this decision, it tosses aside \nits own precedent and weakens protection provided by the Civil Rights \nAct to rule in favor of an employer that had underpaid a female \nemployee for years. That is why I call on all of my colleagues, on a \nbipartisan basis, to stand together today to send a clear signal that \npay discrimination is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by voting \nto move forward to debate the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n  This legislation overturns the Court's decision in Ledbetter v. \nGoodyear Tire. The Court held employees who are subjected to pay \ndiscrimination must bring a complaint within 6 months of the \ndiscriminatory compensation decision, meaning the day the employer \ndecides to pay her less, and that each paycheck that is lower because \nof such discrimination does not restart the clock. Under this decision \nit doesn't matter if the discrimination is still ongoing today or if \nthe worker initially had no way of knowing that others were being paid \nmore for the same work just because of age, race, gender or disability. \nMost inexplicably, the majority insisted it did not matter that \nGoodyear was still paying her far less than her male counterparts when \nshe filed her complaint. Mr. President, if you asked anyone on the \nstreet, they would tell you that this decision simply defies common \nsense. In fact, it is so clearly contrary to Americans' sense of right \nand wrong that everyone should be outraged.\n  Lilly Ledbetter, a loyal employee for 19 years, discovered she was \nbeing paid significantly less than the men in her same job. At first, \nher salary was in line with that of her male colleagues, but over time \nshe got smaller raises creating a significant pay gap. How was she to \nknow that this discrimination was happening? Hardworking Americans do \nnot have the time to sit around talking about their salaries. It is \nclearly not her fault she didn't discover this inequity sooner.\n  In closing, it is disturbing that the Court chose to gut a key part \nof the Civil Rights Act that has protected hardworking Americans from \npay discrimination for the past 40 years. It is our duty to send a \nmessage to employers that this type of discrimination is unacceptable. \nFortunately, Congress can amend the law to undo this damaging decision. \nAnd, it should do so without delay.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I strongly support passage of H.R. 2831, the \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. We must continue to ensure that workers \nare protected from pay discrimination and treated fairly in the \nworkplace.\n  As an original cosponsor of the Senate companion of this legislation, \nI am pleased that this bipartisan bill seeks to address and correct the \nSupreme Court's Ledbetter decision from last spring that required \nemployees to file a pay discrimination claim within 180 days of when \ntheir employer initially decided to discriminate, even if the \ndiscrimination continues after the 180-day period. The Ledbetter \ndecision overturned longstanding precedent in courts of appeals across \nthe country and the policy of the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission under both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n  H.R. 2831 returns the law to the pre-Ledbetter precedent and would \nmake clear that each discriminatory paycheck, not just the first pay-\nsetting decision, will restart the 180-day period. This allows workers \nto demonstrate and detect a pattern or cumulative series of employer \ndecisions or acts showing ongoing pay discrimination. As Justice \nGinsburg noted in her Ledbetter dissent, such a law is ``more in tune \nwith the realities of the workplace.'' The Supreme Court majority \nfailed to recognize these realties, including that pay disparities \ntypically occur incrementally and develop slowly over time, and they \nare not easily identifiable and are often kept hidden by employers. \nMany employees generally do not have knowledge of their fellow \ncoworkers' salaries or how decisions on pay are made.\n  Yesterday was Equal Pay Day, an opportunity to recognize the progress \nwe have made as a nation on ensuring fairness, justice, and equality in \nthe workplace. But there are barriers still to be overcome to close the \npay gap and make certain that an individual's gender, race, and age are \nnot an impediment to their economic and employment growth. The Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act is one step forward in the direction of ensuring \nthis growth and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Lilly Ledbetter was the only female manager \nworking alongside 15 men at a Goodyear tire plant in Gadsden, AL. One \nday, she learned that, for no good reason, she had been receiving \nhundreds of dollars less per month than her male colleagues--even those \nwith far less seniority.\n  Unfortunately, the wrongs done to Lilly Ledbetter are familiar to far \ntoo\n\n[[Page S3283]]\n\nmany women who work every bit as hard as men do but take home a smaller \npaycheck.\n  We must continue to fight to guarantee equal pay for women everywhere \nand justice for those women who are discriminated against.\n  It is disgraceful that women still make just 77 cents for every \ndollar earned by men. In fact, yesterday marked Equal Pay Day--the \nsymbolic day on which a woman's average pay catches up to a man's \naverage earnings from the previous year. Think of all the hours of work \ndone since January 1--those are hours that women have worked just to \nbring home the same amount of money as a man. It is equivalent to \nmonths of working with no pay--something I am sure the bosses doling \nout unequal paychecks wouldn't stand.\n  Unequal pay for women is an injustice whose poison works on multiple \nlevels. Women aren't just paid less for doing the same work--they are \nalso given a none-too-subtle message that their thoughts and efforts \nare less valued just because of their gender.\n  I have two wonderful daughters, Alex and Vanessa. Alex is a filmmaker \nand Vanessa is a doctor. If it weren't for the women who came and \nmarched before them, they wouldn't have had the access to high school \nand college sports that made such a difference in their development. \nBut that cause isn't yet complete. The progress isn't yet perfected. We \nare fighting today so that they are never told that a man deserves a \npenny more for doing the same hard work they have done.\n  In the face of injustice, Lilly Ledbetter and many women like her \nhave had the courage to stand up to sexist bosses, demand her legal \nright to equal pay for equal work, and say ``enough is enough.'' The \ntrial was difficult, but Lilly stood strong--and the jury awarded her a \nlarge legal settlement.\n  Then Lilly's case ran head-on into a group of men--and one woman--\nabove whose heads she could not appeal: the U.S. Supreme Court. The \nCourt's 5-to-4 ruling went against common sense and most people's sense \nof basic fairness. They ruled that the Equal Rights Act of 1964 \nrequires an employee to file a discrimination claim within 180 days of \na boss's decision to discriminate--rather than 180 days from the last \ndiscriminatory paycheck. Amazingly, Lilly Ledbetter didn't just lose \nher settlement and her standing to seek justice--she also lost future \nretirement benefits which will now be awarded according to decades of \ndiscriminatory pay.\n  The ruling goes against common sense and the practical realities of \nthe workplace. It goes against our basic sense of fairness. People \noften don't know what their colleagues are being paid and thus don't \nfind out for some time that they are being discriminated against. Many \nnever find out at all that they have been discriminated against for a \nlifetimeand many who do choose to stay quiet rather than rock \nthe boat, confront their bosses, or be perceived as angry when they \nhave every right to be.\n\n  As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote, ``In our view, the court does \nnot comprehend, or is indifferent to, the insidious way in which women \ncan be victims of pay discrimination.'' The Court's only woman took the \nrare and defiant step of delivering her eloquent dissent out loud.\n  Five male Justices denied justice to thousands of women who could now \nbe denied legal standing in similar cases, not because these women \nhadn't been discriminated against but because too much time had passed \nbetween the moment when their bosses started discriminating against \nthem and the moment they either found out about it or took action to \nstop it. In effect, it rewards bosses for stringing out their deceit.\n  One of these five male Justices was Samuel Alito--against whose hasty \nconfirmation I waged a lonely filibuster battle for which I was widely \ncriticized back in 2006. Back then, I worried and warned that Alito \nwould create a 5-to-4 majority to deny hard-working Americans their day \nin court. Which is exactly what happened to Lilly Ledbetter. I don't \nregret my filibuster one bit--it was an important statement drawing a \nline in the sand against this administration's radical judicial \nnominees. I just wish we could have won that fight.\n  Would Sandra Day O'Connor, the woman Alito replaced, have voted this \nway? I strongly suspect not. And so, with Sam Alito's decisive vote, \nour judicial branch struck a major blow against justice, against fair \ntreatment for all, and against women's rights. The good news is that \nCongress still makes the laws--and we have the opportunity to make \nclear the intent of our fair pay laws and ensure that female victims of \npay discrimination have their day in court.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act clarifies what the Court ought to \nhave known--that the laws against pay discrimination apply to every \npaycheck a worker receives--not to the moment a boss begins \ndiscriminating. A person only gets 180 days to file a discrimination \nclaim--and the clock should be reset to zero every time a \ndiscriminatory paycheck goes out. We should make it easier for \ndiscrimination to be rooted out not harder.\n  Businesses have nothing to fear from this bill--unless they are \nacting disgracefully, in which case they should be afraid--they should \nbe very afraid. But employers will not be asked to make up for salary \ndifference from decades ago--current law, rightly or wrongly, limits \nbackpay awards to 2 years before the worker filed a job discrimination \nclaim. This bill wouldn't change that limit.\n  We should and must do whatever we can to chip away at discrepancies \nthat still exist in pay between men and women. When the Equal Pay Act \nof 1963 passed, women were making 59 cents a dollar. Forty five years \nlater, that number is 77 cents. In other words, women are narrowing the \ngap by less than half a penny a year. We must do better.\n  If I am lucky enough to have them, I don't want my future \ngranddaughters and great-granddaughters to wait another 45 years for \nequal wages.\n  In so many ways, discriminatory pay contributes to our worst \nshortcomings as a society. It discriminates against children in \npoverty--who are far more likely than other children to be raised by \nsingle mothers. It also discriminates against women of color--who are \nmore likely to live in households without a male income-earner.\n  Each paycheck and each discriminatory raise compounds injustice upon \ninjustice. Unfortunately, the pay gap runs across industries and \neducation levels. This isn't something that fixes itself at higher \nlevels of income. Comparing men and women with comparable education, \nwork title, and experience, over the course of their lives, women with \na high school diploma earn $700,000 less. Women with a college diploma \nearn $1.2 million less. And women with advanced degrees earn $2 million \nless over time.\n  To our enduring shame, it was once true that American slaves were \ntreated as three-fifths of a human being. But it remains true today \nthat women are paid as just three-quarters of a man.\n  We can't unravel or erase hateful attitudes toward women in a single \nday or with a single vote. But we have a bill before us today that will \nrestore women's right to seek equal justice under the law. We should \npass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act today and do all that we can to \nlive according to the truth that, while self-evident to Thomas \nJefferson, remains elusive to employers everywhere: that all of us are \ncreated equal.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, America has come a long way in addressing \ndiscrimination in the workplace since the days my ancestors faced ``No \nIrish Need Apply'' signs. Yet discrimination today still exists. Even \nnow, women still earn on average 77 cents for every dollar a man earns \nperforming the same work. This is not fair. And with a record 70.2 \nmillion women in the workforce, this wage discrimination hurts American \nfamilies across the country.\n  Since passage of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, working \nwomen have been able to challenge discriminatory pay. Most appellate \ncourts, including the Third Circuit that incorporates Delaware, and the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission operated under a rule that \ngives workers a reasonable time limit to file complaints and receive a \nfair hearing in our country's courtrooms.\n  Last year, the Supreme Court in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber\n\n[[Page S3284]]\n\nCo., ignored the basic reality of how--and indeed, when--workers \ndiscover that they have been the victim of paycheck discrimination. The \nCourt ruled that employees must sue within 180 days of the employer's \npay decision. That Supreme Court's ruling, in the words of Justice \nGinsberg, is at best a ``cramped interpretation'' of title VII and at \nworst reverses the hard-won gains women have made in the workplace.\n  As a practical matter, employees often do not know what their peers \nearn, the amount of annual raises, or how wages are determined. Given \nthe typical confidentiality rules covering pay issues, the Supreme \nCourt's ruling means that women will in many instances be shut out from \nrecovering what they are owed after years of unfair pay. This \ninterpretation makes title VII of the Civil Rights Act an empty \npromise.\n  The Supreme Court's decision will hurt Americans from all walks of \nlife. It perpetuates inequality by allowing workers to receive lower \npay because of their age, gender, religion, ethnicity, or disability. \nIt threatens to stop and reverse the steady progress we have made \ntoward job equality by letting employers off the hook for prolonged \ndiscrimination. The House took the first step toward correcting this \ninjustice when it passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007. The \nSenate now has the opportunity, and an obligation, to do the same. I am \na cosponsor and strong supporter of this bill, which would simply \nclarify and restore the rule the country operated under before the \nSupreme Court's decision. That rule was strong and simple--each \nseparate paycheck based on a previous discriminatory decision is itself \nan unlawful employment practice.\n  Mr. President, this Fair Pay Restoration Act isn't a radical change \nof direction. It is really nothing new. We know the consequences of the \nact because for years American businesses and their workers operated \nunder the standards it restores. It will not open the floodgates for \nlitigation or force employers to fork out exorbitant sums of money--it \nwill just restore the rules of the game before the Court changed them. \nIt gives Americans who are doing the same job as someone else--but for \nlower pay--access to courts and equality.\n  In today's economy, coping with a recession and a housing crisis, \nAmerican workers need our help. The basic social compact that built our \neconomy, that created our middle class, that provided opportunities for \nmillions--that compact is breaking down. This is one small step to \nrestore some fairness.\n  Mr. President, equal work should mean equal pay. I urge my colleagues \nto join me and restore that principle.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Supreme Court's recent decision in \nLedbetter v. Goodyear Tire struck a severe blow to the rights of \nworking women in our country. More than 40 years ago, Congress acted to \nprevent discrimination in the workplace based on an employee's sex, \nrace, color, national origin or religion. The Ledbetter decision is yet \nanother example of the Supreme Court misinterpreting congressional \nintent and denying justice to a victim of discrimination.\n  For nearly two decades, Lilly Ledbetter, a supervisor at Goodyear \nTire, was paid significantly less than her male counterparts. \nNonetheless, a thin majority of Justices on the Supreme Court found \nthat she was ineligible for title VII protection against discriminatory \npay because she did not file her claim within 180 days of Goodyear's \nrepeatedly discriminatory pay decisions.\n  The Supreme Court's ruling sent the message to employers that wage \ndiscrimination cannot be punished as long as it is kept under wraps. At \na time when one third of private sector employers have rules \nprohibiting employees from discussing their pay with each other, the \nCourt's decision ignores a reality of the workplace--pay discrimination \nis often intentionally concealed. Ms. Ledbetter only found out that she \nwas earning as much as $15,000 less per year than a male coworker with \nthe same job and seniority when an anonymous letter appeared on her \ndesk weeks before her retirement. By the time she retired in 1997, Ms. \nLedbetter's monthly salary, despite receiving several performance based \nawards, was almost $600 less than the lowest paid male manager and \n$1,500 less than the highest paid male manager.\n  Congress passed title VII of the Civil Rights Act to protect \nemployees like Lilly Ledbetter from discrimination because of their \nsex, race, color, national origin or religion--however the Supreme \nCourt's cramped interpretation guts the purpose and intent of the \nbipartisan and historic effort to root out discrimination. Ms. \nLedbetter argued that her claim fell within the 180 day window provided \nunder title VII for filing claims because she suffered continuing \neffects from her employer's discrimination. After filing a complaint \nwith the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a Federal jury found \nthat she was owed almost $225,000 in back pay. However, five Justices \nof the Supreme Court overturned the jury's decision, holding that Ms. \nLedbetter was not protected under the law because she filed suit more \nthan 180 days after her employer's discriminatory act.\n  This Supreme Court decision contradicts both the spirit and clear \nintent of title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which was created to \nprotect workers from discriminatory pay. The Court's 5-to-4 decision \nundercuts enforcement against discrimination based on sex, race, color, \nreligion, and national origin. In Justice Ginsburg's dissent, she wrote \nthat the Court's decision ``is totally at odds with the robust \nprotection against workplace discrimination Congress intended Title VII \nto secure.''\n  This October, my wife Marcelle and I will host Vermont's 12th annual \nWomen's Economic Opportunity Conference, a chance for women to come \ntogether to learn new career skills. Thousands of women in my State \nhave used these skills to advance their careers. It is a shame that \ndespite such initiatives and years of hard work, women continue to \nsuffer pay discrimination. I commend the Vermont Legislature for \npassing laws requiring equal pay for equal work and barring employers \nfrom retaliating against employees for disclosing the amount of their \nwages. Unfortunately, not all States offer these protections.\n  For all of the gains that women have made in the past century, there \nremains a troubling constant--women continue to earn less than men--on \naverage, only 77 cents on the dollar. Discriminatory pay not only \naffects women it affects their children, their families, and all of us \nwho believe in the words inscribed on the Vermont marble of the Supreme \nCourt building ``Equal Justice Under Law.''\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would correct the unfortunate and \ncramped ruling of the Supreme Court which denied Ms. Ledbetter equal \njustice. It would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to clarify that an \nunlawful employment practice occurs not only when that discriminatory \ndecision first goes into effect but each time an individual is affected \nby it, such as each time compensation is paid.\n  The House of Representatives passed this bill in a bipartisan vote \nlast summer. It also has bipartisan support here in the Senate, but \nunfortunately some Republicans have objected to even considering the \nbill. I hope their filibuster can be broken so that we can clarify that \ndiscrimination against hard-working men and women in their own \nworkplaces is not the American way. The law and our justice system \nshould protect working people when it happens. Our bill underscores \nthis vital American principle against efforts to devalue it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to speak about an issue of economic \nfairness that affects the very dignity and the security of millions of \nAmericans: the right to equal pay for equal work. Before I begin, let \nme thank the chairman of the HELP Committee for his leadership on this \nimportant issue. The Fair Pay Restoration Act goes a long way toward \nensuring that right. In a perfect world, of course, we could take that \nright for granted; we could take it for granted that the value of work \nlies in a job well done, not in the race or gender of the person who is \ndoing it. But we don't live in that world. We know that, even now, \nemployers can cheat their employees out of equal pay, and equal work.\n  That is what happened to Lilly Ledbetter. For almost two decades, \nfrom 1979 to 1998, she was a hardworking supervisor at a Goodyear tire \nplant in Gadsden, AL. And it is telling\n\n[[Page S3285]]\n\nthat she suffered from two types of discrimination at the same time. On \nthe one hand, there was sexual harassment, from the manager who said to \nher face that women shouldn't work in a tire factory, to the supervisor \nwho tried to use performance evaluations to extort sex. And on the \nother hand, there was pay discrimination: by the end of her career, as \nthe salaries of her male coworkers were raised higher and faster than \nhers, she was making some $6,700 less per year than the lowest paid man \nin the same position.\n  Now, the two kinds of discrimination faced by Ms. Ledbetter have a \ngood deal in common. Morally, they both amount to a kind of theft: the \ntheft of dignity in work and the theft of the wages she fairly earned. \nBoth send a clear message: that women don't belong in the workplace. \nBut there is a clear difference between sexual harassment and pay \ndiscrimination. The former is blatant. The latter far too often stays \ninsidiously hidden.\n  In fact, Lilly Ledbetter didn't even know she was being paid unfairly \nuntil long after the discrimination began, when an anonymous coworker \ngave her proof. Otherwise, she might be in the dark to this very day. \nAnd that is hardly surprising. How many of you know exactly how much \nyour coworkers make? What would happen if you asked? At some companies, \nyou could be fired.\n  Armed with proof of pay discrimination, Ms. Ledbetter asked the \ncourts for her fair share. And they agreed with her: she had been \ndiscriminated against; she had been cheated; and she was entitled to \nher back pay.\n  Regrettably, the Supreme Court ruled against her, and took it all \naway. Yes, she had been discriminated against--but she had missed a \nvery important technicality. She only had 180 days--6 months--to file \nher lawsuit. And the clock started running on the day Goodyear chose to \ndiscriminate against her. Never mind that she had no idea she was even \nthe victim of pay discrimination until years later--figure it out in \n180 days, or you are out of luck for a lifetime.\n  One can clearly see how this ruling harms so many Americans beyond \nMs. Ledbetter. In setting an extremely difficult, arbitrary, and unfair \nhurdle, it stands in the way of many Americans fighting against \ndiscrimination. It flatly contradicts standard practice of the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission and flies in the face of years of \nlegal precedent and clear congressional intent. As Justice Ginsburg put \nit in her strong dissent, the Court's Ledbetter ruling ignores the \nfacts of discrimination in the real world: ``Pay disparities often \noccur in small increments; cause to suspect that discrimination is at \nwork develops only over time. Comparative pay information, moreover, is \noften hidden from the employee's view . . . Small initial discrepancies \nmay not be seen as meet for a federal case, particularly when the \nemployee, trying to succeed in a nontraditional environment, is averse \nto making waves.''\n  ``The ball,'' Ginsburg concluded, ``is in Congress's court . . . The \nlegislature may act to correct this Court's parsimonious reading.''\n  That is precisely what we are here to do today. If the Fair Pay \nRestoration Act passes, employees will have a fair time limit to sue \nfor pay discrimination. They will still have 180 days, but the clock \nwill start with each discriminatory paycheck, not with the original \ndecision to discriminate. After all, each unfair paycheck is in itself \na decision to discriminate--it is ongoing discrimination. And if this \nlegislation passes, employees like Ms. Ledbetter will no longer be \nblocked from seeking redress, through no fault of their own, except a \nfailure to be more suspicious.\n  Mr. President, millions of Americans depend on the right to equal pay \nfor equal work: to earn a livelihood, to feed their families, and to \nsecure the dignity of their labor. We ought to make it easier for \nAmericans to exercise that right, not harder. We ought to get unfair \nroadblocks, hurdles, and technicalities out of their way. We ought to \npass this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I think it is important we go back to \nthe facts and remind ourselves in this Chamber about the person, the \nreal live woman, for whom this legislation is named, Lilly Ledbetter.\n  She was a supervisor at a Goodyear Tire and Rubber plant in Gadsden, \nAL, from 1979 until her retirement in 1998. For most of those years, \nshe worked as an area manager, a position normally occupied by men.\n  Now, initially, Lilly Ledbetter's salary was in line with the \nsalaries of men performing substantially similar work. Over time, \nhowever, her pay slipped in comparison. And it was slipping in \ncomparison with men who had equal or less seniority. By the end of \n1997, Lilly Ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager, \nand the pay discrepancies between her and her 15 male counterparts were \nstark.\n  She was paid $3,727 a month. The lowest paid male area manager \nreceived $4,286 a month and the highest $5,236. In other words, \nGoodyear paid her male counterparts 25 to 40 percent more than she \nearned for doing the same job.\n  Now, when she discovered this, which she had not for years, because \nit is somewhat difficult, if not impossible, to obtain information \nabout the salaries of your counterparts--and lots of times why would \nyou ask? You are doing the same job; you show up at the same time; you \nhave the same duties. Who would imagine that you would be paid less \nthan the younger man who came on the job a year or two before, or the \nolder man with whom you had worked for years?\n  So when she discovered that, she rightly sought to enforce her \nrights, and a jury agreed, a jury of her peers, that she had suffered \ndiscrimination on the basis of her gender.\n  And the district court awarded her $220,000 in backpay, and more than \n$3 million in punitive damages. The court of appeals reversed that, \nclaiming she had not filed her charge of discrimination in a timely \nmanner. The Supreme Court agreed.\n  Now Lilly Ledbetter is retired from her job. Nothing we do today will \nhave any impact on her, but she has tirelessly campaigned across this \ncountry for basic fairness. We thought we had ended discrimination in \nthe workplace against women when the Equal Pay Act was passed all those \nyears ago.\n  In fact, yesterday was the day we commemorated the passage of the \nEqual Pay Act, but clearly we have not finished the business of \nguaranteeing equality in the workplace; fair and equal pay to those who \ndo the same job. Nearly a century after women earned the right to vote, \nwomen still make 77 cents to every man's dollar.\n  The affect of the recession we are in right now in many parts of our \ncountry is affecting women worse than their male counterparts. This is \nnot about the women themselves, it is about their families. I came from \nIndianapolis, where I was introduced at an event by a young single mom. \nI meet young single moms all over America who work hard for themselves \nand their children. So when they are discriminated against in the \nworkplace, they bring less home to take care of those children whom \nthey are responsible for. We can talk about what needs to be done, and \nthere are, I am sure, all kinds of legal reasons it does not make sense \nto end discrimination; that it does not make sense finally to have our \nlaws enforced. But this is the law we had until the Supreme Court \nchanged it. Until the Supreme Court said: No, wait a minute, you are \nsupposed to actually know you are being discriminated against to \ndispute the conditions in the workplace, and file whatever action, make \nwhatever complaint you can at that moment.\n  Well, Lilly Ledbetter acted as soon as she knew. She did not know \nuntil that information was made available to her. I am hoping this \nChamber will stand up for fundamental fairness for women in the \nworkplace. I am hoping you will stand up and vote to make it clear that \nwomen who get up every single day and go to work deserve to be paid \nequally to their male counterparts.\n  That is all Lilly Ledbetter wanted. That is what we should deliver \ntoday.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe there is 5 minutes 45 seconds \nremaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 4 minutes 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the assistant majority leader.\n\n[[Page S3286]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank Senator Kennedy, Senator Mikulski, and many \nothers for bringing this measure before the Senate.\n  You remember when we debated Supreme Court Justices, and do you \nrecall their testimony; you saw it on television. I can recall Justice \nRoberts, the Chief Justice, he told us he was similar to an umpire in \nbaseball; all he did was call balls and strikes. He was not going to \nwrite the law or change the law, he was going to apply the law to the \nfacts. Well, lo and behold, as soon as Justice Roberts and Justice \nAlito, the new Justices on the Supreme Court, arrived, they took a \nprecedent, a law that had been followed for years by the Supreme Court \nand turned it upside down.\n  Lilly Ledbetter, 19 years serving as a manager in this Goodyear Tire \nfacility in Gadsden, AL, was the only female manager in a group of 15; \nall the rest were men. It was not until she was about to retire that \nsomeone said to her: Incidentally, you are not being paid as much as \nthe men who are doing the same job.\n  She did not realize it. How would she? Employers do not go around \npublishing how much they pay their employees in the newspaper, and they \ncertainly do not post it on the bulletin board. So she had no way of \nknowing until the last minute. She filed a discrimination claim and \nsaid: I did the work, I deserve the pay.\n  It went all the way up to the Supreme Court, to new Supreme Court \nChief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito. You know what they said? Your \nproblem, Lilly Ledbetter, is you should have discovered how much they \nwere paying the other employees at the time the initial discrimination \nbegan. That is physically impossible. They held her to a standard she \ncould not live up to. They knew what they were doing. They were \nthrowing out her case of wage discrimination and thousands of others. \nThose Justices were not calling balls and strikes, they were making new \nrules; and the rules were fundamentally unfair.\n  We have a chance today to straighten that out. I hope we have \nbipartisan support for it. We should be against pay discrimination for \nwomen, men, disabled, minorities. Every American deserves to be treated \nfairly.\n  The Chicago Tribune, not always a paragon of liberal ideas, said this \nabout the Ledbetter decision by the Supreme Court:\n\n       The majority's sterile reading of the statute ignores the \n     realities on the ground. A woman who is fired on the basis of \n     sex knows she has been fired. But a woman who suffers pay \n     discrimination may not discover it until years later, because \n     employers often keep pay scales confidential. The \n     consequences of the ruling will be to let a lot of \n     discrimination go unpunished.\n\n  Those who vote against this effort to bring the bill to the floor \nwill allow a lot of discrimination to go unpunished in America.\n  We owe the workers of America, the women of America, all workers a \nlot more. I encourage colleagues to support Senator Kennedy and the \nmotion to invoke cloture.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). There is 2 minutes 5 seconds.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  Madam President, with all due respect to the Senator from Illinois, \nas was said earlier, in this case, in each and every year from 1992 to \n1997, Ms. Ledbetter testified that she knew she was being discriminated \nagainst but didn't file a claim.\n  Secondly, this is not about restoring the Civil Rights Act to its \nstate before Ledbetter was decided last year. This is about amending \ntitle VII of the Civil Rights Act passed in 1964 in terms of its \nstatute of limitations.\n  The fact is that every one of us in this body is for precisely the \nsame thing: Discrimination against no one for race, sex, color, creed, \nnational origin; equal pay for everyone. As the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts showed in his chart, we have over and over again \nreaffirmed this. This is not about the issue of discrimination. This is \nabout the rule of law, the Civil Rights Act as it was passed in 1964 \nand amended in 1967, and its statute of limitations that has been \nupheld by the Supreme Court--not once, not twice, not three times, but \nfour separate opinions in 1977, 1980, 1989, and 2002. Ledbetter simply \nreaffirmed these cases.\n  If we have a problem, let's address it in committee. Let's fix it \nafter open debate. Let's not eviscerate the committee process and bring \na flawed bill to the floor of the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 1 \nminute 30 seconds.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, today too many women are still earning \nless than men for doing the same work, making it harder not just for \nthose women but for the families they help support to make ends meet. \nIt is harder for single moms to climb out of poverty, harder for \nelderly women to afford their retirement. That kind of pay \ndiscrimination is wrong and has no place in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  This evening, we have a chance to do something about it. Passing this \nbill is an important step in closing the pay gap, something I helped to \ndo in Illinois and something I have fought to do since I arrived in the \nSenate. I have cosponsored legislation to ensure women receive equal \npay for equal work and to require employers to disclose their pay \nscales for various kinds of jobs. It is this information which will \nallow women to determine whether they are being discriminated against, \ninformation they often lack now.\n  In addition to passing this bill, we need to strengthen enforcement \nof existing laws. In the end, closing the pay gap is essential, but it \nis not going to be enough to make sure that women and girls have an \nequal shot at the American dream, which is why we are also going to \nhave to work on issues such as sick leave and prohibiting \ndiscrimination against caregivers. If you work hard and do a good job, \nyou should be rewarded, no matter what you look like, where you come \nfrom, or what gender you are. That is what this bill is about. That is \nwhy I am supporting this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired under time reserved for \nSenators Isakson and Kennedy.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield myself leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I remind my colleagues that if we \ninvoke cloture on this bill, we will actually be moving off the \nveterans bill. Let me repeat that. A vote to proceed to the Ledbetter \nbill is a vote to proceed away from the veterans bill. This is really \nhighly ironic because my side was taking a pounding Monday and Tuesday \nfor allegedly holding up, if you will, the veterans bill. Of course, \nthat was not the case. We have ended up, in order to accommodate the \nschedules of those who are frequently not here--and understandably not \nhere because they are running for President--we had the Senate, in \neffect, not in session until 5 o'clock this afternoon. While Americans \nare waiting for Congress to do something about the economy, jobs, and \ngas prices, our friends on the other side decided to close shop in \norder to accommodate the uncertainties of the campaign trail. Finding \nsolutions for the concerns of all our constituents should be our top \npriority, not just accommodating the travel schedules of two of our \nMembers.\n  The proper course of action is clear. We should vote to stay on the \nveterans bill and finish our work on behalf of American veterans. The \nbest way to do that is to vote against cloture on the motion to proceed \nto the matter before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, first of all, for all Members, we are \nclose to having agreement on the veterans bill when we get to it. Let \nme just say initially, I really like my counterpart, the Republican \nleader. But I have trouble understanding how he could stand on the \nfloor and say that when we have been trying to do legislation on the \nveterans bill since last Thursday and\n\n[[Page S3287]]\n\nwe have been prevented from doing that.\n  Understand, there is nothing we could do, unless by unanimous \nconsent, to change this vote. It occurs automatically an hour after we \ncome in. There is no secret. We have two Senators running for President \nof the United States--three, as a matter of fact. I am only concerned \nabout two of them. Their schedules were very difficult recently. They \ncould be here at 6 o'clock. So I made the suggestion, which I thought \nwas reasonable--we haven't been able to legislate on the veterans bill \nsince last Thursday; how about doing it on Wednesday, until 5 o'clock. \nThat would be 6 hours more than we have done since last Thursday. There \nwas a refusal to allow us to do that. To have my friend, the Republican \nleader, come here and say we haven't done anything today because we had \na vote scheduled at their convenience--he didn't use the names, but \nSenators Clinton and Obama--that is absolutely without any foundation. \nI have trouble understanding how my friend would have the gall to stand \non the floor and make the comment he did, but he did.\n  Now to the issue at hand, Lilly Ledbetter. Put your mind to this. We \nhave a woman who is working. She has worked for 20 years and worked \nhard, very hard, and after 20 years she comes to the realization that \npeople are making a lot more money than she. They are men, and they are \ndoing the same work as she is. That is what this is all about. As a \nfoundation, understand that for a woman to make the same amount of \nmoney as a man in our country--that is, how much a man makes in our \ncountry for 1 year--for similar work, she must work not only that whole \nyear but an additional 113 days. In fact, women who work full time earn \nabout 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man who does the same work.\n  That is why yesterday, April 23, which was the 113th day of the year, \nwas Equal Pay Day, to illustrate how women are treated unfairly in the \nworkplace in America. I can think of no better way for us to honor \nEqual Pay Day than to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n  She was a manager at a Goodyear factory in Gadsden, AL. She worked \nthere for 20 years. She was the only woman among 16 men at her same \nmanagement level. She was paid at various times 20 percent less than \nsome of her male colleagues doing the same work and as much as 40 \npercent less than other colleagues doing the same work. That included \nfellow workers who had a lot less seniority than she had. They got paid \nmore because they were men.\n  At most jobsites, especially office work, salary is not a topic that \nyou discuss. It is private. It wasn't until Ledbetter had been with the \ncompany for 20 years, as I have indicated, that Mrs. Ledbetter became \naware of the disparity in her paycheck, and only then because someone \nanonymously tipped her off.\n  After she learned, after 20 years, that people were being paid more \nmoney than she was for doing the same work, she became concerned, and \nshe did what we should do in a situation like that. She went to talk to \na lawyer. She had been cheated for 20 years. A jury that was called in \nthat court listened to what she had to say. They found she had been \ndiscriminated against. Why? Because she was a woman. The jury awarded \nher appropriate damages.\n  Her employer appealed all the way to the Supreme Court. No way are we \ngoing to let this happen. They overturned the lower court's verdict, \nclaiming she was entitled to nothing because she waited too long. The \nstatute of limitations had run. The Supreme Court upheld that decision. \nThey upheld the reversal of the decision that she had gotten, the award \nby the jury that she had gotten. The Supreme Court held that the 180-\nday filing deadline for discrimination cases like hers should be \ncalculated from the day of Ms. Ledbetter's first discriminatory \npaycheck. So using that faulty logic, this woman is only protected if, \nafter the first 6 months, she had filed a lawsuit. Well, she didn't \nknow. The ruling reversed the position that most courts had previously \nheld--contrary to what my good friend Senator Isakson said--that each \ndiscriminatory paycheck represents a new case of discrimination and \ntherefore the 180-day filing period applies to each subsequent \npaycheck.\n  The practical result of the Supreme Court decision is that women like \nLilly Ledbetter must sue for discrimination no later than 6 months \nafter their employment begins, 6 months after her first paycheck. The \nSupreme Court's ruling puts unfair conditions on legitimate \ndiscrimination claims, and it applies not only to millions of women in \nthe workforce but also to those discriminated against on the basis of \nrace, religion, age, or disability.\n  As Justice Ginsburg said--and rarely from the Supreme Court does one \nof the Justices read their opinion; she did that--she noted in her \nstrong and compelling dissent that the Supreme Court's ruling is wrong \nbecause it overlooks the realities of the workplace and the realities \nof the world. Think about that. She had worked there 20 years. She had \nbeen cheated for 20 years. They are telling her she should have filed \nher lawsuit 19\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  Many employers explicitly or implicitly prohibit employees from \ndiscussing their salary with coworkers. Could Ms. Ledbetter be expected \nto have known the salaries of her male colleagues after just 6 months \non the job? Of course not. And even if a new employee is aware of a \ndiscrepancy in pay, many choose not to make waves, preferring to hang \non to their job, preferring to quietly build job security. But over the \nyears, these initial discrepancies, which may start out small, will \noften widen considerably--in her case, to as much as 40 percent when \ncompared to a man.\n  The Supreme Court's ruling ignores basic facts. As long as \ndiscrimination continues, an employee's right to challenge \ndiscrimination should continue as well. That is why the legislation now \nbefore us is so important. We can talk about court cases and hearings \nbefore the committee and doing things in regular order. Let's have some \nregular order of fairness. That is what this legislation is all about.\n\n  This legislation would restore the previously accepted interpretation \nof law: that each and every discriminatory paycheck constitutes a new \nact of discrimination and that restarts the 180-day clock.\n  By supporting this motion to proceed and voting in favor of this \nlegislation, we have the opportunity to correct this important \ninjustice for millions of women and millions of others who work hard \nbut are unfairly deprived of compensation they deserve.\n  Some on the Republican side argue that this legislation would lead to \na flood of litigation. Obviously, we know the Republicans are not \nexcited about trial lawyers. We know their first attack to take care of \nthe housing crisis was to lower taxes and do something about \nlitigation. So it is no surprise they are concerned about litigation, \neven though they are wrong.\n  That argument has no basis in fact. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas researched this issue and found no reason--no reason--to believe it \nwould increase the number of discrimination cases.\n  Furthermore, this legislation maintains the current law's 2-year \nlimit on back pay. Employers would not be liable for salary differences \nthat occurred in years past. In her case, Ledbetter could sue, but she \ncould only get 2 of the 20 years she had been cheated. That is what \nthis legislation does. How much fairer could it be?\n  The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest Court in our country. But in \nthis case, they simply got it wrong. I am sad to report, in my opinion, \nmany times they have done the same thing since Justices Roberts and \nAlito have joined that Court.\n  Many of us have spoken against recent Supreme Court nominees for fear \nthey would not uphold our Nation's proud tradition of civil rights and \nequal rights in law. This faulty judgment on the part of the Court, in \na 5-to-4 decision, lends credence to our concerns that we must support \njudges with a reliable history of support for the values of equality \nthat we cherish.\n  There is no reason for the Fair Pay Act to be a partisan issue.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to join us in sending a strong and \npowerful message that in America, discrimination will never be \ntolerated and justice will always be blind. But no matter the result \ntoday, that message--and our commitment to those enduring values--will \ncontinue.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3288-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3288]]\n     VETERANS' BENEFITS ENHANCEMENT ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we are within minutes of working out \nsomething to complete tomorrow's work. There will be no more votes \ntonight. We should have several votes tomorrow. Probably, if things \nwork out right, we will have three votes tomorrow. We should finish \nbefore 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am deeply disappointed we were not \nable to get the required 60 votes. With the majority leader's vote, we \nwould have had 57 votes--57 votes. There is virtually unanimous \nopposition on the other side of the aisle to restore what had been \nfairness and decency and equity in our fair pay laws.\n  I think most of us who have been around this institution for some \ntime and who have been involved in the civil rights issue understand if \nyou don't have a remedy, you don't have a right. This debate was about \nrestoring a right to Lilly Ledbetter, her right to be treated fairly in \nthe workplace and the rights of millions of others too. Those who are \ndisabled, elderly, people in our society of various national origins, \nthose of particular religious faiths, and women all are threatened by \nthe underlying Supreme Court decision. That has to be altered. It has \nto be changed.\n  I welcome the fact that our majority leader has sent a powerful \nsignal by indicating that we will come back and revisit this issue. \nThis issue is about fairness. It is about equity. If we are going to \npermit discrimination in the workplace, we shouldn't permit it to pay, \nand the best way to make sure it does not pay is to provide the remedy \nto ensure it will not.\n  This is an early skirmish in this battle toward true fairness and \nequity and equitable pay for women and all others in our society. I \nlook forward to working with our colleagues in the ongoing battle. I am \nvery hopeful and optimistic that the next time we will get the votes \nthat are necessary to permit us to take final action on this \nlegislation.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader for his addressing this issue and \nfor his willingness to bring this back to the floor so we can have \nfurther debate and discussion on it.\n  And I would like to thank my staff--Charlotte Burrows, Sharon Block, \nand Portia Wu, who worked very hard on this important legislation. I \nwould also like to thank Michael Myers, Scott Fay, and Kate Dowling \nfrom my staff for all of their help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3288-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3288-S3296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VETERANS' BENEFITS ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am deeply disappointed about the \nfact that we did not get the necessary votes to move the Fair Pay \nRestoration Act forward. We fell three votes short of what we needed to \ndo to get the job done. This fight for equal pay for equal comparable \nwork, however, will go on.\n  As the senior woman in the Senate, I take the floor tonight to say we \nwill fight on. This was the first step forward. It will not be the only \nstep we will take. But what we will not tolerate is another step \nbackward.\n  We are going to continue to bring this fight. We will look for \nopportunities to bring this legislation back to the Senate floor. What \nis it we want to do? It is to end discrimination against women in their \npersonal paychecks. In order to end that, we need to change the \nlawbooks so they can experience fairness in their personal checkbook.\n  This is the year 2008. You would think that in the year 2008, on the \n40th anniversary of the passage of so many historic civil rights bills, \nwe would finally have legislation that would guarantee fairness in \nterms of pay.\n  So we regret we didn't get the votes, but we will move on. Many \npeople have been mesmerized by the John Adams miniseries. I like John \nAdams, but I really liked Abigail. While John Adams was down in \nPhiladelphia with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and a bunch of \nthe other guys writing the Declaration of Independence and laying the \ngroundwork for the Constitution and inventing America, Abigail Adams \nwrote her husband from the farm--while raising the four children and \nkeeping the family going. She said: As you write those documents, do \nnot forget the ladies, for we will foment a revolution of our own.\n  I stand here today to say: Do not forget the ladies because we will \nfoment a revolution of our own. I was here in 1992 when we didn't get \nit on Anita Hill. I am here in 2008 when we didn't get it in pay \nequity.\n  In 1992, we had a revolution that went on. We got six new women in \nthe Senate. There are now 16 of us. The majority of us voted for this \nbill. I am telling you we are ready for an ``Abigail Adams'' effort \nhere. If they don't want to put us in the lawbooks so we can have \nfairness in the checkbooks, we will do a revolution. What do I mean by \nthat? We will take it out to the voting booths. We will go on the \nInternet. We are going to go on TV, on the blogs. And we are going to \ntell everybody about this ignominious vote that occurred. When we tell \nit, we are going to say: Call to arms, women of America, put your \nlipstick on, square your shoulders, suit up, we have a hell of a fight \ncoming, but, boy, are we ready. The revolution starts tonight.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nspeak again on behalf of S. 1315, the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement \nAct.\n  At the outset, I wish to commend Senator Akaka for his leadership in \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs, as well as the ranking member, \nSenator Burr, for having brought together a package, which is a good \none, which is now on the floor of the Senate. I hope our colleagues \ncome together tomorrow to pass this important legislation for the \nveterans of America.\n  The bill expands eligibility for traumatic injury insurance; extends \neligibility for specially adapted housing benefits for veterans with \nsevere burns; increases benefits for veterans pursuing apprenticeships \nor on-job training programs; and a whole host of other benefits that \nare needed for the veterans of America. It is especially crucial at \nthis time because of the fact that we have so many returning veterans \nfrom Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  This is legislation that will help not only those veterans but the 25 \nmillion veterans we have here in America. I am proud to be a cosponsor \nof this legislation. I urge my colleagues to fully support it.\n  The issue of debate, which has, frankly, kept this legislation from \nreceiving a unanimous consent vote in the Senate has been the issue of \nthe treatment for veterans benefits of the Filipino warriors from World \nWar II. I wish to remind our colleagues there were 470,000 Filipino \nveterans that volunteered and served to preserve the freedoms of the \nworld during World War II; that approximately 200,000 of them were with \nthe Philippine Commonwealth Army, with the Philippine Army Air Corps, \nand the Philippine Army Offshore Patrol.\n  Today, there are about 18,000 of those warriors who now live in the \nUnited States of America. In my view, we cannot forget the sacrifices \nthese Filipino warriors made as they fought side by side with American \ntroops in World War II. They constituted the vast majority of the \n80,000 soldiers who defended the Bataan Peninsula during the Japanese \ninvasion. They constituted the vast majority of the soldiers who were \nforced on the Bataan Death March. The provisions in this legislation \nthat deal with the benefits for Filipino veterans--and most of them are \nin their late seventies and eighties--are provisions we should support \nin the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the order from \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt, dated July 26, 1941, concerning his order \nplacing the Philippine Army under the control of the United States \nDepartment of Defense.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\n     Military Order Placing Land and Sea Forces of Philippines \n         Under United States Commands, July 26, 1941\n       Under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the \n     Constitution of the United States, by section 2(a)(12) of the \n     Philippine Independence Act of March 24, 1934 (48 Stat. 457), \n     and by the corresponding provision of the Ordinance appended \n     to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, \n     and as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United \n     States, I hereby call and order into the service of the armed \n     forces of the United States for the period of the existing \n     emergency, and place under the command of a General Officer, \n     United States Army, to be designated by the Secretary of War \n     from time to time, all of the organized military forces of \n     the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines: \n     Provided, that all naval components thereof shall be placed \n     under the command of the Commandant of the Sixteenth Naval \n     District, United States Navy.\n       This order shall take effect with relation to all units and \n     personnel of the organized military forces of the Government \n     of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, from and after the \n     dates and hours, respectively, indicated in orders to be \n     issued from time to time by the General Officer, United \n     States Army, designated by the Secretary of War.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, in that statement and order by \nPresident Roosevelt, this is what he said, on July 26, 1941:\n\n       Under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the \n     Constitution of the United States, [by the corresponding laws \n     concerning the Constitution] . . . of the Commonwealth of the \n     Philippines, and as Commander in Chief of the Army and the \n     Navy of the United States, I hereby call and order into the \n     service of the Armed Forces of the United States for the \n     period of the existing emergency, and place under the command \n     of a General Officer, United States Army . . . all of the \n     organized military forces of the Government of the \n     Commonwealth of the Philippines . . .\n       This order shall take effect with relation to all units and \n     personnel of the organized military forces of the Government \n     of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. . . .\n\n  By this order, President Roosevelt harnessed the men and women of the \nPhilippines, who served in the Armed Forces and helped our forces \nduring\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\nthat great conflict, to be part of our warrior force that defended and \npreserved the freedoms of America during that great world war.\n  So I honor and I appreciate the leadership of Senator Akaka and \nSenator Inouye and Senator Stevens, who have come to the floor and have \nspoken, from their unique historical perspective, about this being a \nmatter of justice for the Filipino veterans who so helped secure the \nplace of America across the world as a beacon of hope and freedom for \ngenerations to come.\n  I think we, as a Senate body, can do no less than to honor the \nsacrifice of these great veterans--part of the greatest generation--by \nmaking sure we adopt the provisions of this bill as they have been \npresented by Senator Akaka in his bill.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I speak today in support of S. 1315, the \nVeterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007.\n  Our service men and women as well as their families make enormous \nsacrifices for our freedom. In return, Congress has an obligation to \nspend the money and create the programs necessary to provide quality, \ncomprehensive health care services, mental health counseling, \ndisability compensation, pay increases, better education benefits, and \nmore. That responsibility grows daily with so many of our troops \nfighting overseas.\n  I am proud of what this Congress has accomplished to date. We passed \na Defense authorization bill that will enhance wounded soldiers' health \ncare and rehabilitation benefits as well as streamline the physical \nevaluation process. Last year, this Congress provided the largest \nincrease in veterans' spending in this country's history. This \nFebruary, the Senate passed and President Bush signed the economic \nstimulus package that would provide stimulus checks to more than \n250,000 disabled veterans and to the survivors of disabled veterans. We \npassed a housing stimulus package on April 10 that had several benefits \nfor veterans including increased limits on the VA Home Loan program and \nauthorization for the VA to provide increased adapted housing grants to \ndisabled veterans.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I am happy to report that this \nyear's budget puts us on track to provide our veterans adequate support \nin the coming fiscal year. The resolution would provide $48.2 billion \nto help ensure that the Veterans Health Administration within the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs can provide the highest quality care for \nall veterans.\n  But our work is far from done. S. 1315 contains several critical \nbenefits improvements to ensure that veterans young and old have what \nthey need to provide for their families and lead full, productive \nlives. Provisions in S. 1315 would improve life insurance programs for \ndisabled veterans, expand the traumatic injury protection program for \nactive duty servicemembers, extend for 2 years the monthly educational \nassistance allowance for apprenticeship or other on-the-job training, \nand provide individuals with severe burns specially adapted housing \nbenefits. These are important benefits and services that mean a great \ndeal to the nearly 500,000 veterans living in Maryland and to veterans \naround this country.\n  But, for 8 months now, members of the minority party have kept the \nSenate from even debating S. 1315 because they oppose a provision in \nthe bill that would extend certain VA benefits to elderly Filipino \nveterans, residing in the Philippines, who fought alongside U.S. troops \nduring World War II. Drafted by our Government, hundreds of thousands \nof Filipino soldiers served with honor in some of the most dire \ncircumstances of the war. These Filipino veterans were promised \nveterans' status and were even considered United States veterans until \nthat status was taken from them by Congress in 1946. Restoration of \nthat status rights a wrong committed decades ago. And it is a \ncorrection we don't have many more years to make. We should grant these \nformer soldiers full status and the limited pension rights contained in \nthis bill so that they can live out their remaining years in dignity \nand peace.\n  I know that some Senators may disagree with me on this issue. That is \ntheir right. But I regret that they have made it so hard for us to \nconsider this important bill. I hope the Senate will be able to vote on \nfinal passage soon. We owe that much and so much more to this Nation's \nveterans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

A few minutes ago, we concluded the vote on H.R. 2831 that \ncame after a very short debate. It was a clever use of the rules by the \nmajority, I have to hand them that. There is a requirement that there \ncan be only 1 hour of debate before the cloture vote. So we didn't have \nany session today until 5 p.m. The Senate was closed. That is an \ninteresting way to limit debate. As I noted in my earlier remarks, the \nbill we voted on also didn't come to committee and follow the regular \norder.\n  I am very proud of the fact that Senator Kennedy and I are able to \nwork out a lot of things on a lot of bills. In fact, I think we hold \nthe record for major bill passage. The way we were able to do that is \nto work in a very bipartisan way. We have worked out difficulties and \nsometimes we have compromised and sometimes we have left things out so \nthings could get done. On this bill, we never had that opportunity. We \nnever had that courtesy. We never got to debate this for 1 minute in \ncommittee mark-up, let alone on the floor.\n  The debate was kind of fascinating to listen to because there is \nequal pay, which all of us are in favor of; and there is the pay gap, \nwhich all of us want to close. But the discussion ranged between the \ntwo, making them sound like they were the same thing. I want people to \nbe clear that they are not. When we talk about women as a whole in the \nUnited States getting 23 cents per hour less than men do, we are not \ntalking about equal pay for equal jobs; we are talking about pay for \njobs that are not equal. We have held some hearings in our committee on \nthis, and they have been very enlightening. If a person takes what is \nconsidered a traditional job--if a woman takes a traditional job--the \njobs don't pay very well. If a woman takes a nontraditional job, they \npay very well, just like the men who are doing that job. But they are \nnot traditional jobs for women. Somehow, we have to move women from \nthose traditional jobs, where there is overemployment, to some of the \nnontraditional jobs where there is underemployment.\n\n  One of the fascinating people who spoke at our committee was a young \nlady who became a mason. She puts rocks on buildings, and she was proud \nof the work she does, and she should be. She started out paving, then \nlater adding some marble steps, then adding pieces to buildings, and \nthen doing high-altitude work. And I want to tell you, she makes more \nthan I do because she does something different than most people do, and \nit pays well.\n  We have this thing in America where we say there is this kind of job, \nand these are the people who ought to take those; and there are these \nother jobs, and you are probably not qualified for those. Well, when \ndoes that qualification happen? Throughout life. We have to be training \npeople and encouraging people to do better things.\n  In order to encourage that kind of training we had the America \nCOMPETES Act which we passed last year. It puts an emphasis on science, \ntechnology, engineering and math so that people can become doctors and \nengineers, and other high-paying jobs. We ought to get more people into \nthese fields, but what we are getting now is fewer and fewer people \ninto them. We are facing a shortage in those fields, except for the \nfact that we can bring people in from other countries who can do those \nbecause they are turning out a lot of people with the necessary skills.\n  I have asked the reason for that, and the answer is that they do some \nthings we are never going to do in this country. I went to India \nrecently and learned a lot about their education system. They promise \nthat every kid gets an education through sixth grade, but they do not \nfollow that promise. Only 20 percent of the girls get an education at \nall. They also have this little review at fourth grade to see if people \nare interested in education, and if they determine that you aren't they \nkick you out of school. Now, that is before sixth grade. That is fourth \ngrade. They kick them out of school. Those people will\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\nmake $1 a day for the rest of their lives. At sixth grade, they have \nanother purge and even more people are kicked out of school. We would \nnever stand for that. Those people will make $2 a day the rest of their \nlives. Now, in most of the world, poverty is $1 a day, so they are \nabove the poverty line, although they wouldn't be in the United States. \nSo India only lets 7 percent of the kids go to college--just 7 percent. \nAgain, we would never stand for that. We keep trying to figure out how \nto get more and more people into post-high school education, and that \nincludes career and vocational education. And we need to do that. But \nin India, part of people's incentive to get into science, technology, \nengineering, and math is that those are the jobs that pay well. One \nperson in India told me: We don't have professional sports teams, so \nthere aren't any kids out there who are bouncing a basketball or \nthrowing a pass or doing any of the other things that a lot of American \nkids are doing and thinking they are going to get to go pro. Some \nAmerican kids think they are going to go pro and think they will make \nabout $18 million a year. It is not going to happen for most of them.\n  I really appreciate the NCAA's ads running now that show a whole \nbunch of people in different professional sports, and they say there \nare 380,000 young people who are in college sports, and every one of \nthem will go pro but not in their sport. That is the important line on \nit: not in their sport.\n  Somehow, we have to get more people involved in the sciences so they \nhave the basic knowledge in grade school, which will allow them to \nexcel in high school, which will allow them to do well in college and \nthen allow them to get into the higher paying jobs. Men and women have \nequal talent in all of those areas. What we have to do is encourage \nthat equal talent equally.\n  I have been trying to get the Workforce Investment Act through here, \nand I have gotten it through the Senate twice unanimously, but there \nhasn't been a willingness to go to conference committee with the House. \nI asked why, and I was told: Well, we are afraid of where the \nconference committee might go. There is no reason for that fear right \nnow because the same people who were afraid of where it might go would \nbe in charge of the conference committee now. If they are in charge of \nit, they could make sure it doesn't go anywhere they do not want it to \ngo.\n  If we can pass that bill, it will provide the flexibility that will \nallow 900,000 people a year to train for higher skilled jobs. For many \nwomen, that will narrow the pay gap. They can go into other kinds of \njobs that they may have been precluded by other events in their lives \nfrom ever getting into. If we want to narrow the wage gap, there are a \nnumber of ways to do that, but it means we have to get women into areas \nthey haven't been traditionally working in before. That is the best \nsolution to the wage gap argument.\n  Part of the difficulty in passing a bill around here is having a \nchance to work on the bill. The bill that came before us earlier today \npassed the House after being allowed only one hour of debate. Using \ntheir rules, the majority made sure no one was allowed to amend it. \nNow, it comes over here and bypasses the committee. The way we usually \nwork a bill is for the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember, Senator Kennedy and myself, to sit down and list out some \nprinciples that we have to check with the rest of the committee to see \nif they match the problem we are trying to solve. After we have those \nprinciples, we plug in details and see if we have the details right. \nThen we call in the stakeholders, which is really anybody interested in \nthat issue, and we see if they agree with it.\n\n  We have found that when we can get agreements with the people on the \ncommittee and the stakeholders, we have the answer right. And most \npeople in this body agree we have it right because most of the bills \nthat get worked out this way get passed unanimously. A long debate for \na bill that comes out of our committee is probably 2 hours.\n  We are going to have one of those tomorrow. It will be genetic \nnondiscrimination, a very important bill which, first of all, allows \npeople to take advantage of the Genome Project. For example, if you are \nhaving your blood checked you can find out your genetic framework, \nwhich can tell you things that could happen to you in the future. And \nif you know they could happen to you in the future, you can take \nactions to keep them from ever happening.\n  This bill requires that if you have a genetic marker indicating that \nsomething could happen to you, your insurer is not allowed to make it a \npreexisting condition and your employer is not allowed to fire you over \nit. The bill will offer real protection that can ultimately help people \nlive healthier longer.\n  The Genetic Non-Discrimination bill went through the whole process \nthat I have described. It has even been preconferenced with the House \nside. So we are pretty sure that once it finishes here it will go right \nover to the House and the House will take care of it too. That doesn't \nmean we left the House and the House committee out of the process. We \nlet them into the process. We let them into the process early so that \neverybody would know what was happening. But that hasn't been the case \non H.R. 2831.\n  I am disappointed that there wasn't the need, the courage, the desire \nto see what the principles are on this issue and see if we could \nactually solve the problem. We can build a good case for equal \nemployment because we have always voted for equal employment. We will \nall vote for equal employment. We all want to close the pay gap. That \nis a bit tougher to do, but we can do it if we work together. If we \ndon't work together and use issues like this to score political points, \nit will be like so many bills that come over here and get debated for \nlong periods of time and nothing ever happens to address the issue. The \nmost productive place to address tough issues is the committee. In the \ncommittee, you can have a couple of people interested in one part of \nthe issue go off by themselves and come up with a solution. Quite \noften, it isn't the polarized one the Republicans have or the polarized \none the Democrats had. What it becomes is the third way, and that \neliminates the clash of the two polarized sides.\n  There are so many things around here that have been debated so long \nthat if you mention a term from that issue, you get instant rebellion \nfrom both sides. I have watched that so many times, people hear a word \nand jump into the weeds arguing about the broader application of that \nword and keeping the discussion from actually getting to the principle \nthat is trying to be solved.\n  So there is a way to get these bills done, but it isn't through \n``gotcha'' politics. It isn't by just bringing things here without \nconsulting the other side to see if there are any small corrections or \nmaybe even big corrections that can be made. And, as I said before, I \nhappen to be disappointed that after all the cooperation we have had in \nthe committee on other difficult issues, that there wasn't even an \nopportunity for cooperation in the committee on this one.\n  I believe there are some solutions out there, but they are not going \nto be arrived at on the floor of the Senate. What happens here on the \nfloor is that both sides bring a series of amendments that we think \nwill put the other side in a bad light if they vote against it. It \nisn't just one side that will do it, both sides will do it. So we need \nto have a little more civil way of solving this problem, and I have \nconfidence it can be done.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3300-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3300-S3301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COCONUT ROAD INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the competing \nCoburn and Boxer amendments that were offered last Thursday to the \nhighway technical corrections bill. I voted in favor of the Coburn \namendment. That amendment would establish a bipartisan, bicameral \ncommittee of Congress to investigate the circumstances surrounding the \nchanges that were made to the provisions of the 2005 highway bill \nrelating to the Coconut Road project between the time that the bill \npassed the House and Senate and the time that it was enrolled.\n  However, I voted against the Boxer amendment, which purports to \ncommand the Justice Department to commence a criminal investigation of \nthis same matter. Whether to initiate a criminal investigation is a \ndecision\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\nthat our Constitution vests exclusively in the executive branch. It is \nnot a decision that the Constitution allows to be made through \nlegislative enactments. Although the Boxer amendment's mandate to the \nexecutive was modified to state that the criminal investigation shall \nonly commence ``under applicable standards and procedures,'' this \nchange does not cure the amendment's constitutional infirmity. There \nare no ``applicable standards and procedures'' for a legislative \nmandate to the executive to initiate a criminal investigation. Whether \nto initiate such an investigation is a matter of prosecutorial \ndiscretion and is a decision entrusted firmly and solely to the \nexecutive branch. To the extent that the Boxer amendment purports to \ncommandeer this function, it is a dead letter and will surely be \nignored as unconstitutional legislative interference in an executive \nfunction.\n  I would finally note that by insisting on replacing Senator Coburn's \namendment with a me-too amendment of their own, the Democratic majority \nhas undercut the likelihood that there will be any investigation of the \nCoconut Road matter. Senator Coburn's proposal to create a committee of \nCongress to investigate this matter was perfectly constitutional and \nwould have gotten to the bottom of this issue. The Boxer amendment is \nan unconstitutional nullity. And even if that amendment weren't \nunconstitutional, or if the Justice Department undertook an \ninvestigation of this affair on its own initiative, such an \ninvestigation would only answer whether a Federal crime has been \ncommitted. Congress and the people deserve to know the circumstances \nand potential ethical violations raised by this matter regardless of \nwhether a criminal offense occurred.\n  I regret that the Coburn amendment was not adopted and was replaced \nby the Boxer amendment. By taking these actions, the Senate has crossed \na constitutional line and has reduced the likelihood that the \nunderlying matter will be adequately investigated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3301-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity today to solemnly \nobserve the 93rd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.\n  The Armenian genocide was the first genocide of the 20th century. \nFrom 1915 until 1923, 1.5 million Armenians were brutally killed by the \nOttoman Turks in a systematic effort to eradicate the Armenian people. \nThere were unbearable acts of torture; men were separated from their \nfamilies and murdered; women and children were put on a forced march \nacross the Syrian desert without food or water.\n  Henry Morgenthau, the U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913 \nto 1916, recalled:\n\n       When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these \n     deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a \n     whole race; they understood this well, and, in their \n     conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to \n     conceal the fact . . . I am confident that the whole history \n     of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this. \n     The great massacres and persecutions of the past seem almost \n     insignificant when compared to the sufferings of the Armenian \n     race in 1915.\n\n  Tragically, 1915 was just the beginning. We saw the horrors of \ngenocide in World War II when Jews were subjected to systematic \nextermination at the hands of Adolf Hitler and his followers. Indeed, \nHitler remarked at the outset of this unbridled evil, ``Who, after all, \nspeaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?'' Unfortunately, the \nphrase ``never again'' turned out to be a hollow slogan. In the later \nhalf of the last century, countries like Cambodia and Rwanda were \nravaged while the world was silent. And even now, in this new century, \nDarfur is the latest place to experience such brutality and inhumanity \nas the world stands idly by, either incapable or unwilling to do what \nis necessary to stop the devastation and murder.\n  Today, the Turkish Government denies what happened in the dying days \nof the Ottoman Empire and thus this scar on history cannot be healed \nuntil history is accurately spoken, written, and recalled. These are \nlessons that must be told and repeated to each and every generation.\n  In order for democracy and human rights to flourish, we must not \nsupport efforts to rewrite and deny history. In the United States, we \nstrive to make human rights a fundamental component of our democracy. \nIt is long overdue for our Nation to demand that the truth be told. We \nmust recognize the Armenian genocide in the name of democracy, \nfairness, and human rights.\n  To that end, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Senator \nRichard Durbin's S. Res. 106, calling on the President to accurately \ncharacterize the Armenian Genocide in his annual message around April \n24 and to ensure that the foreign policy of the United States reflects \nappropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to \nhuman rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the United \nStates record relating to the Armenian Genocide.\n  It is important that we recognize the Armenian Genocide while its \nsurvivors are still with us to tell their stories. We must recognize \nthe genocide for the survivors. We must recognize the genocide because \nit's the right thing to do. We must recognize the Armenian Genocide to \nhelp shed light on the darkness and move toward a more humane world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3301-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3301-S3302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROY E. JUNE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a distinguished \nand decorated World War II U.S. Army Air Corps veteran from my home \nState of Montana. Born in the small, humble town of Forsyth, 1LT Roy E. \nJune comes as an inspiration to those who wish to lead a life of \nservice to their country and their communities.\n  From the tragedy of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, came America's \ngreatest generation responding to the certain urgency of that era. Like \nmany young men of that generation, Roy and his buddies enlisted in the \nArmed Forces to defend their country and to advance the just cause of \nfreedom. In the U.S. Army Air Corps, Roy's bravery and skills as a \nfighter pilot set him above the rest. As a P-51 Mustang fighter pilot, \nRoy escorted B-29 bombers to Japan, strafed and dive-bombed strategic \nmilitary installations on Chi Chi Jima. For his heroism in the Pacific \nTheater, Roy earned an Air Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster and the \nDistinguished Flying Cross. His 15th Fighter Group, the 47th Fighter \nSquadron was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation.\n  A fellow returning from Hawaii brought news about the end of the war. \n``Atomic Bomb Dropped On Japan'' read the headline of the Honolulu \nDaily Advertiser. After 11 missions over Japan and more than 500 combat \nhours in the P-51s, Roy returned home to Missoula in January 1946.\n  Having grown up in the great State of Montana, Roy could recall many \nfond memories from his youth in his hometown of Forsyth. Roy was a Boy \nScout and played center on the high school football team. Summers meant \nHuck Finn adventures and odd jobs; winters, though harsh, saw skating \nparties on the Yellowstone and ice hockey using sticks and tin cans. \nBefore he joined the Air Corps, Roy studied engineering at the Montana \nState College in Bozeman.\n  And like all Montanans who believe a good education is a lifelong \nprocess, Roy went back to school after his return from war. With \ndegrees in journalism and business administration from the University \nof Montana in Missoula, Roy entered law school in 1949. There he met \nhis wife Laura Jane Brautigam, also a native of Montana.\n  Receiving his law degree in 1952, Roy went on to practice law in \nHelena where he helped to draft bills for State senators during the \n1953 session. In Billings, he became an associate in the law firm of \nSanders, Cresap and Koch representing groups such as the National Beef \nCouncil and the National Livestock Auction Markets. A few years later, \nRoy moved to California to serve as the city attorney for Costa Mesa. \nHe took with him the spirit of Montana generosity and incorporated \nseveral nonprofit companies pro bono as his contribution to his \ncommunity.\n  Even after his retirement in December 1996, Roy continues to give \nback to his community by volunteering at the Palm Springs Air Museum. \nArmed with firsthand knowledge of World War II aviation and the \nconflicts in the Pacific Theater, Roy shares his vivid\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\nexperience with all, much to the delight of visitors, young and old.\n  Mr. President, 1LT Roy June is a testament to the Montana spirit. We \nbelieve in courage, sacrifice, and service. From Montana to the \nJapanese Islands of Iwo Jima and Chi Chi Jima, wherever Roy was, he put \nup his best for his community and more importantly, his country. My \nfellow Montanans and I are extremely proud of Roy and his contributions \nto our State and Nation. A son of Montana from America's greatest \ngeneration, Roy reminds all of us that commitment and service to this \ncountry never end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3302-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMEMORATION OF THE ARMY RESERVE CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I join the citizens of New \nMexico and the United States in celebrating the 100th anniversary of \nthe United States Army Reserve. In 1916 Congress passed the National \nDefense Act, creating the Officers' Reserve Corps, later named the \nOrganized Reserve Corps, all of which are forerunners of the current \nArmy Reserve.\n  The Army Reserve has been an integral part of numerous conflicts. In \nboth World Wars, Army Reserve soldiers answered the call of duty. In \nWorld War I, 89,500 reserve officers were mobilized and during World \nWar II, 200,000 members of the Organized Reserve Corps served, with \nreserve officers providing 29 percent of the Army's officers. More than \n70 Army Reserve units were deployed to the Korean Peninsula providing \ncombat support and combat service. Army Reserve members have also \nparticipated in Operation Desert Shield/Storm, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, \nKosovo, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  The Army Reserve mission has changed over time. Today, the Army \nReserve has partnered with FEMA, State, and local agencies in defending \nthe American homeland against terrorist attacks, providing resources \nand training to ``first responder'' organizations across the Nation.\n  New Mexico started deploying Army Reserve soldiers after September \n11, 2001; in fact, as early as December 2001, in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom, OEF. New Mexico Army Reserve soldiers are currently \ndeployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF. Over 50 percent of New \nMexico's Army Reserve force have deployed in support of both campaigns.\n  Once again I would like to congratulate the Army Reserve on their \ncentennial. I wish them continued success as they help protect our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3302-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. MICHAEL DeBAKEY\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the \naccomplishments of a Texan--Dr. Michael DeBakey--who changed the world. \nI am proud we are honoring Dr. DeBakey with the Congressional Gold \nMedal.\n  Dr. DeBakey's accomplishments are legendary. His lifelong commitment \nto the medical field and helping others has impacted the lives of \ncountless Texans and, indeed, people around the world.\n  Dr. DeBakey, now 99 years old, is the son of Lebanese immigrants. He \nwas born and educated in Louisiana, but has been a Texan for nearly 60 \nyears. His accomplishments as a researcher, surgeon, and teacher have \nimpacted the entire world, and may never be duplicated.\n  As Dr. DeBakey once said: ``I take pride in the outstanding surgeons \nI've trained who have returned to their homes throughout the world to \nprovide the best available health care for their patients.''\n  He is especially recognized for his revolutionary contributions to \ncardiovascular medicine. Including two important inventions, the roller \npump--an essential component of the heart-lung machine--and the DeBakey \nVentricular Assist Device, an apparatus implanted into the heart to \nincrease blood flow. Dr. DeBakey also designed countless medical \ndevices now considered basic tools, such as specialty clamps, and wrote \nthe book on numerous surgical procedures that have become standard \npractice in the operating room.\n  Dr. DeBakey was an innovator from the start of his medical career. \nDuring World War II, he helped develop the concept of the Mobile Army \nSurgical Hospital M.A.S.H. units, a concept that saved thousands of \nlives during the Korean and Vietnam wars. Dr. DeBakey later helped \ncreate a medical and surgical center system for the Veterans \nAdministration and improved the care of thousands of returning service \npersonnel.\n  But Dr. DeBakey will always be best known as a pioneer in \ncardiovascular surgery. He became head of surgery at the Baylor \nUniversity College of Medicine in Houston in 1948, and helped lead the \nTexas Medical Center to the position of international prominence it \nenjoys today.\n  He was one of the first surgeons to undertake coronary artery bypass \nsurgery. And the first to successfully perform a carotid \nendarterectomy. And although generations have passed, his medical \nstudents, inspired by his example, have made countless additional \nbreakthroughs.\n  In 1996, Russian President Boris Yeltsin had a heart attack during \nhis re-election campaign. His doctors told him he could not survive \nsurgery. But Yeltsin called in Dr. DeBakey for a consultation and later \nasked him to oversee his coronary bypass, which proved successful. It \nwas a tacit acknowledgment of U.S. medical leadership and Dr. DeBakey's \ninternational reputation.\n  Dr. DeBakey's worldwide fame has even translated into a few humorous \nmedical anecdotes. It seems that an auto mechanic, working on a car, \ngood-naturedly compared his job to DeBakey's: ``I also take valves out, \ngrind them and put in new parts. So how come you get the big bucks?''\n  According to the tale, Dr. DeBakey quietly replied, ``Yes, but I do \nit with the engine running.''\n  On the last day of 2005, a sharp pain in his upper torso told Dr. \nDeBakey he was suffering an aortic aneurysm--the very condition that \nhis research had addressed years before. Initially, Dr. DeBakey chose \nto wait out the situation in hopes that it would heal itself.\n  It didn't. After a 7-hour surgery and 9 months of touch-and-go \nrecuperation, Dr. DeBakey went back to work.\n  Over the years, as he helped establish Houston as an internationally \nknown center of medical excellence, Dr. DeBakey would always be best \nremembered for the broader humanitarian aspects of his work. He \ndedicated countless hours to advising developing nations, and training \ndoctors and medical authorities to establish stronger and more \nefficient health care systems.\n  Dr. DeBakey has been honored by a multitude of organizations, \ngovernments and medical institutions. He has received the Library of \nCongress Living Legends Award, the American Heart Association Gold \nHeart Award, the National Medal of Science and the Presidential Medal \nof Freedom, to name a few. Today, Dr. DeBakey will be awarded the \nCongressional Gold Medal--the highest civilian award Congress can \nbestow.\n  Dr. Michael DeBakey has helped millions of people to live longer and \nmore productive lives. He is a Texan who has helped change the world, \nand a Texan worthy of this honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3302-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3302-S3303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO LOUISIANA WORLD WAR II VETERANS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to honor a group of 99 \nWorld War II veterans from Louisiana who are traveling to Washington, \nDC, this weekend to visit the various memorials and monuments that \nrecognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable servicemembers.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, is sponsoring \nthis Saturday's trip to the Nation's Capital. The organization is \nhonoring each surviving World War II Louisiana veteran by giving them \nan opportunity to see the memorials dedicated to their service. On this \ntrip, the veterans will visit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Iwo \nJima memorials. They will also travel to Arlington National Cemetery to \nlay a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n  This is the seventh flight Louisiana HonorAir has made to Washington, \nDC, and there will be two additional flights this spring.\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs, but was also a \nconflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 \nmillion people\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\nworldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, and more than \n400,000 American servicemembers were slain during the long war. The \nultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in Europe is a \ntestament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an unprecedented \nmobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our military on two \ndistant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today more than 40,000 living WWII \nveterans, and each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory \nof freedom over tyranny. Veterans in this HonorAir group began their \nservice in 1938, before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and served in the \nEuropean and Pacific theaters, as well as stateside. Some members of \nthis group served as late as 1970. They served in various branches of \nthe military--28 members in the Army; 18 in the Army Air Corps; 37 in \nthe Navy, including three SeaBees; three in the Naval Reserves; eight \nin the Marines; one in the Merchant Marines; and four nurses from \nvarious branches.\n  Several of our heroes fought at Iwo Jima and others at Guadalcanal. \nMany of these veterans earned Purple Hearts, Bronze Star Medals, and \nSilver Stars. Some participated in the Battle of the Bulge and the D-\nday invasion of France at Omaha Beach. Others defended the Atlantic, \nPacific, and Asiatic-Pacific Seas. As a soldier with the Army 1st \nCalvary Division, one of our heroes was part of the liberation of Santo \nTomas Prison Camp in Manila.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 99 veterans, all \nLouisiana heroes, that we welcome to Washington this weekend and \nLouisiana HonorAir for making these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3303-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, this week we celebrate the 45th \nannual Small Business Week organized by the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration. I would like to recognize the accomplishments of a \nsmall business owner who is a leader in his field and a contributor to \nRhode Island's vital hospitality and tourism industry.\n  Today, the SBA will present the 2008 National Jeffrey H. Butland \nFamily-Owned Business of the Year award to Robert Antignano of Angelo's \nCivita Farnese in Providence. This national award, which will go to a \nRhode Islander for the first time, honors a family owned and operated \nbusiness that has passed from one generation to another.\n  Angelo's Restaurant opened in 1924 and has become a landmark on \nProvidence's Federal Hill as the State's longest operating family-owned \nrestaurant. The founder and namesake of the restaurant, Angelo \nMastrodicasa, envisioned a place where the working people of the \nneighborhood could find good food at affordable prices. Mr. Antignano, \nwho is the third generation of his family to run the restaurant, has \ncontinued to pursue this mission with great success. Since assuming \nownership of Angelo's in 1988, Mr. Antignano has tripled the number of \nemployees and increased revenues by more than 300 percent.\n  From Hollywood stars, New England sports legends, and national \npolitical figures to the family who comes in for Sunday dinner, \nAngelo's is the backdrop for so many memorable occasions. This \nrestaurant is more than a place to eat; it is a slice of Americana \nwhere people from all walks of life sit elbow to elbow at the same \nwhite marble tables their grandparents and other family members may \nhave shared over the years. The Butland award recognizes Angelo's \nlegacy and its prominent place in our hearts.\n  I am proud of Mr. Antignano, his hard-working, committed staff, and \nall small business owners in Rhode Island, who together form an \nessential part of Rhode Island's economy. According to the SBA, small \nbusinesses comprise 96 percent of all businesses in the State. Time and \nagain, small businesses, by virtue of their size, have proven their \nability to be innovative and flexible, meeting emerging needs for new \nproducts and services and improving on those that already exist.\n  Once again, I congratulate Mr. Antignano and his family on their \nsuccess and wish them many more generations of good customers, food, \nand spirits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3303-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING MORRISON CHEVROLET\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today during National Small Business \nWeek I wish to commend a local auto dealership from Downeast Maine that \nrecently won the Top Drawer Award from the Ellsworth Area Chamber of \nCommerce. Morrison Chevrolet of Ellsworth has been selling automobiles \nin Hancock County for nearly 80 years, and it shows no signs of slowing \ndown.\n  The Top Drawer Award is presented annually to either a business or \nperson that makes a lasting contribution to the development and \nimprovement of the greater Ellsworth region. The award was founded in \n1980 to commemorate the late Tom Caruso, who established Bar Harbor \nAirlines to ``Link Maine With The World.'' It is clear that, through \nMorrison's solid and intelligent commitment to the customer and the \ncommunity, it is highly worthy of this recognition.\n  Founded in 1930 by the present co-owner Bud Morrison's grandfather, \nHarry, Morrison Chevrolet began its storied history in Winter Harbor, \nabout 25 miles east of its present location. The dealership has moved \nover time first to Bar Harbor and then to several locations in \nEllsworth, finally settling on a new 23,000-square-foot facility on \nRoute 1 in Ellsworth in 2005. Although it may have relocated, the \ncompany has always been owned and run by a member of the Morrison \nfamily. Morrison Chevrolet has always stayed on the cutting edge, \npositioning itself to best survive in a competitive industry.\n  To keep current in providing the best possible service to their \ncustomers, Morrison's technicians attend training and certification \nclasses, frequently via the Internet. Workers often use the company's \nconference room to link in to classes online. Morrison's also makes use \nof technology to augment its sales by continually increasing its \nInternet advertising. In fact, Mr. Morrison says that roughly one-third \nof his sales leads come from the Internet, and the firm ships cars--\neven Corvettes--across the country. Additionally, the dealership's Web \nsite is a handy tool for the consumer, allowing clients to search \navailable new and used automobiles, schedule service and maintenance \nrequests, prequalify for purchasing a car, and calculate whether it is \nwiser for them to buy or lease a vehicle.\n  In addition to providing their customers with convenient options and \ncaring service, Morrison's employees always find time for community \ninvolvement. Dave Keep, the used car sales manager, serves as an \nofficer of the Ellsworth Masons, and P.J. Davis, who works in the sales \ndepartment, is a member of the chamber of commerce's board. And \nMorrison's general manager Clyde Lewis is a member of the board of \ndirectors of the James Russell Wiggins Downeast Family YMCA, which has \nbeen assisting Ellsworth area families since 1961.\n  A staple of the local business scene for decades, Morrison Chevrolet \nis most deserving of the immense honor of the Top Drawer Award. By \nserving the customer and the community at the same time, Morrison's 47 \nemployees exhibit the generosity and kindness of Downeast Mainers. \nFurthermore, by continuing to innovate its business practices, Morrison \nChevrolet is well-positioned for future success and additional \naccolades. I commend Bud Morrison and everyone at Morrison Chevrolet \nfor their accomplishments and wish them well in their continuing \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3303-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3303-4", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3304-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:38 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 831.

A bill to encourage residential mortgage loan modifications \nand workout plans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce a \nbill to give mortgage servicers an incentive to work out new loan terms \nwith struggling homeowners who are falling behind in their mortgage \npayments. It is possible to avoid foreclosure in some cases by \nreworking the payment terms on mortgages. Investors, however, would \nhave to accept a smaller return on their investment than they otherwise \nmay have expected. As a result, businesses that service mortgage loans \nmay fear litigation from investors who are the direct or indirect \nholders of those mortgages. This concern may be slowing the pace of or \nstopping loan modifications. In testimony on December 6, 2007, before \nthe House Committee on Financial Services, Mark Pearce, speaking on \nbehalf of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, testified that at a \nmeeting with the top 20 subprime servicers ``many of them brought up \nfear of investor lawsuits'' as a hurdle to voluntary loan modification \nefforts.\n  The loan servicers have a legal duty to the investors to maximize the \nreturn on their investments. But in light of the current and changing \neconomic environment, and the new and complex financial vehicles that \nhold mortgages, this ``duty'' is not simple or clear. This bill \nclarifies matters by stating that, absent contract provisions to the \ncontrary, the duty is owed to the investor group as a whole, and not to \nindividual investors or classes of investors. In addition, the bill \nclarifies that the servicer satisfies that duty by ensuring that the \nreturn from a mortgage, as modified, exceeds the return that would be \nexpected from foreclosure. This may include agreeing to mortgage \nmodifications or workout plans when a homeowner is in payment default, \nor when default or foreclosure appears imminent. Although some \ninvestors may get a smaller return than they may have expected, in the \nlong run, taking these actions will be in the best interest of all \ninvestors.\n\n  This bill is not a bailout. The bill honors contract provisions that \nmay be contrary to provisions in the bill. This bill would not solve \nall of the problems we face today, but it is an important step in \nremoving barriers that may slow progress as we work to solve the home \nmortgage crisis.\n  This bill is necessary because regulation has not kept pace with \ninnovation. Years ago, a homeowner would obtain a mortgage from a local \nbank. If he couldn't make the mortgage payment, the bank often would be \nwilling and able to offer a workout, modifying the loan's terms to make \nit affordable. The bank would do this because whatever amount the \nborrower could pay would be worth more to the bank than foreclosure. \nForeclosure has its costs, sometimes as much as half the value of the \nmortgage, and banks did not want to have to resell the home, so the \ncalculation was often simple. Today, however, many mortgages are often \nbundled together with others mortgages and are sold to investment \nbanks, who in turn slice and dice the bundles to produce securities \nthat are rated by rating agencies and sold to investors all over the \nworld.\n  Investment banks that issue securities backed by mortgages typically \ndivide the securities into tranches, with some tranches having claims \nthat are senior to other more junior tranches. None of this, of course, \nis transparent to the homeowner, and servicers face a complex \nsituation. Servicers should not have to first determine precisely how a \nloan modification will affect the various tranches of investors and \nthen make choices among the groups. If the servicer reasonably believes \nthat a modification increases the net present value of the investment \nas a whole, it should be able to agree to the modification.\n  This month, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke encouraged the \nnation's bankers to write down the principle on millions of mortgages. \nHe said banks have not made nearly enough modifications to stop \nforeclosures. But there has been some progress. Treasury Secretary \nPaulson reported this month that ``since July more than one million \nstruggling homeowners received a workout--either a loan modification or \na repayment plan that helped them avoid foreclosure.'' In January \nalone, there were 167,000 such modifications, with the number of \nborrowers receiving help rising faster than the number of foreclosures. \nCongress needs to ensure that these modifications continue, and that \nthey continue at a rapid pace.\n  We are faced with a crisis caused by mortgage brokers who pushed \nrisky loans on homeowners, homeowners who assumed the value of their \nhome would always increase, conflicts of interest at credit rating \nagencies, bond underwriters who loosened standards, lax regulators, and \nfinancial institutions that ignored the risks in the instruments they \nwere buying and selling. There is plenty of blame to go around\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\nbut Congress must now take steps to prevent similar problems in the \nfuture. Right now, we must do what we can to keep families in their \nhomes by encouraging the companies that service mortgages to modify \nmortgages where it will prevent foreclosure. This bill will encourage \nservicers to make such modifications and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2901\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Encouraging Mortgage \n     Modifications Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) mortgage modifications often afford the best \n     opportunity to avoid foreclosures and provide long term, \n     sustainable solutions for American homeowners;\n       (2) reaching mortgage modification agreements with \n     homeowners has been unacceptably slow and foreclosure rates \n     continue to rise, with the number of homeowners forced into \n     foreclosure double the number who receive modifications or \n     repayment plans;\n       (3) servicers have an obligation to protect the interests \n     of investors when determining whether to offer a modification \n     or repayment plan;\n       (4) the best course of action for the investor pool as a \n     whole may disadvantage the interests of individual classes of \n     investors;\n       (5) servicers have expressed concern that investor classes \n     that are disproportionately disadvantaged by a modification \n     or repayment plan may seek to hold the servicer liable;\n       (6) without liability protection, many servicers will not \n     be willing to take on the risk associated with approving a \n     mortgage modification or repayment plan, and instead, they \n     will eventually pursue foreclosure even though foreclosure \n     costs can equal 50 percent or more of mortgage value; and\n       (7) the net present value of a modified mortgage loan will \n     almost always exceed the amount recouped by allowing the home \n     to go into foreclosure.\n\n     SEC. 3. LEGAL SAFE HARBOR FOR ENTERING INTO CERTAIN LOAN \n                   MODIFICATIONS OR WORKOUT PLANS.\n\n       Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of \n     1974 (12 U.S.C. 2605) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (i) and (j) as subsections \n     (j) and (k), respectively;

and\n       ``(C) if the servicer acts in a manner consistent with the \n     duty set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B), shall not be \n     liable under any law or regulation of the United States, any \n     State or any political subdivision of any State, for entering \n     into a qualified loan modification or workout plan in any \n     action filed by or on behalf of any person--\n       ``(i) based on the person's ownership of any interest in a \n     residential mortgage, a pool of residential mortgage loans, \n     or a securitization vehicle, that distributes payments out of \n     the principal, interest, or other payment on loans in the \n     pool;\n       ``(ii) based on the person's obligation to make payments \n     determined in reference to any loan or interest referred to \n     in clause (i);

A bill to ensure the independent operation of the Office of \nAdvocacy of the Small Business Administration, ensure complete analysis \nof potential impacts on small entities of rules, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nPryor, during National Small Business Week, to introduce the \nIndependent Office of Advocacy and Small Business Regulatory Reform Act \nof 2008. This bipartisan measure would ensure the independence of the \nSmall Business Administration, SBA, Office of Advocacy, and provide \ntargeted small business regulatory reforms that would strengthen the \nOffice of Advocacy's voice in protecting our small businesses. Our bill \nis supported by the SBA Office of Advocacy and National Ombudsman, as \nwell as the National Federation of Independent Business and the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I recognize that the SBA Office of Advocacy is, \nregrettably, one of our Government's best kept secrets, and in many \ncases, the best hope for small businesses faced with overly burdensome \nFederal regulations.\n  Established in 1976, the Office of Advocacy, headed by the Chief \nCounsel for Advocacy, is a unique office within the Federal Government. \nFirst, the Office of Advocacy is the ``Regulatory Watchdog'' for small \nbusinesses. In this capacity, it represents small businesses before the \nFederal Government in regulatory matters--taking advantage of its \nstatutorily granted independence to argue against Federal regulatory \nactions that impose too great a burden on small businesses for too \nlittle benefit--and to encourage Federal agencies to consider less \ncostly regulatory alternatives. Second, it conducts valuable research \nto further our understanding of the importance of small businesses to \nour economy and the forces that have an effect on them.\n  The SBA Office of Advocacy is part of the SBA, and the Chief Counsel \nfor Advocacy is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. \nAt the same time, the office is also intended to be the ``independent'' \nvoice for small business within the Federal Government. It is charged \nwith the duty of representing the views and interests of small \nbusinesses before other Federal agencies, and developing proposals for \nchanging government policies to help small businesses. These roles can \nsometimes come into conflict.\n  The Independent Office of Advocacy and Small Business Regulatory \nReform Act of 2008 resolves such conflicts in favor of the small \nbusinesses that rely on the Chief Counsel and the Office of Advocacy to \nbe a fully independent advocate within the executive branch. The bill \nwould help to reinforce a clear mandate that the Office of Advocacy \nmust fight on behalf of small businesses, regardless of the position \ntaken\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\non critical issues by the administration.\n  Funding for the Office of Advocacy currently comes from the \n``Salaries and Expense Account'' of the SBA's budget. Staffing is \nallocated by the SBA administrator to the Office of Advocacy from the \noverall staff allocation for the Agency. In 1990, there were 70 full-\ntime employees working on behalf of small businesses in the Office of \nAdvocacy. The current allocation of staff is 48. The independence and \neffectiveness of the office is potentially diminished when the Office \nof Advocacy staff is reduced, at the discretion of the administrator.\n  To address this problem, the Independent Office of Advocacy and Small \nBusiness Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 builds a firewall to minimize \npolitical intrusion into the management of day-to-day operations of the \nOffice of Advocacy similar to the one that protects Inspectors General \nin other agencies. The bill would require the Federal budget to include \na separate account for the Office of Advocacy drawn directly from \nGeneral Fund of the Treasury. No longer would its funds come from the \ngeneral operating account of the SBA. This will free the Chief Counsel \nfor Advocacy from having to seek approval from the SBA administrator to \nhire staff for the Office of Advocacy.\n  The bill would leave unchanged current law that allows the Chief \nCounsel to hire individuals critical to the mission of the Office of \nAdvocacy without going through the normal competitive procedures \ndirected by Federal law and the Office of Personnel Management, OPM. \nThis long-standing special hiring authority, which is limited only to \nemployees within the Office of Advocacy, is beneficial because it \nallows the Chief Counsel to hire quickly those persons who can best \nassist the Office in responding to changing issues and problems \nconfronting small businesses.\n  In addition to protecting the Office of Advocacy's independence, this \nbill also provides targeted small business regulatory reform. As the \nRanking Member of the Small Business Committee, I have long fought to \nensure that small businesses across the country are treated fairly by \nthe Federal Government. Unfortunately, in far too many cases, Federal \nagencies promulgate rules and regulations without adequately addressing \nthe economic impacts on small businesses.\n  The disproportionate burden that Federal regulations often place on \nour small businesses cannot be overemphasized. Research published by \nthe Office of Advocacy indicates that small businesses spend an \nastounding 8 billion hours each year complying with government rules \nand regulations. More specifically, the smallest firms with fewer than \n20 employees, spend approximately 45 percent more per employee than \nlarger firms to comply with Federal regulations.\n  The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) recognizes this situation, as it \nrequires Federal Government agencies to propose rules that keep the \nregulatory burden at a minimum on small businesses. Enacted in 1980, \nthe RFA requires Federal agencies to analyze the economic impact of \nproposed regulations when there is likely to be a significant economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities. In 1996, I was \npleased to support, along with all of my colleagues, the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, (SBREFA), which amended the RFA. \nThe intent of SBREFA was to further curb the impact of burdensome or \nduplicative regulations on small businesses, by clarifying key RFA \nrequirements.\n  The Independent Office of Advocacy and Small Business Regulatory \nReform Act of 2008 would further improve the Regulatory Flexibility Act \nby requiring Federal agencies to consider and specifically respond to \ncomments provided by Office of Advocacy. This critical change would \nensure that agencies give the proper deference to the Office of \nAdvocacy, and to the comments and concerns of small businesses. This is \na straightforward and simple reform that could have major benefits.\n  Finally, our proposal would also clarify that Federal agencies are \nrequired to provide pertinent information to the SBA Ombudsman upon \nrequest.\n  This noncontroversial, bipartisan legislation is absolutely \nnecessary. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can ensure \nthe complete independence of the Office of Advocacy in all matters, and \nprovide our Nation's small businesses and their employees with much \nneeded targeted regulatory relief.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2902\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Deciphering the sequence of the human genome and other \n     advances in genetics open major new opportunities for medical \n     progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of illness \n     will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before \n     symptoms have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to \n     take steps to reduce the likelihood that they will contract a \n     particular disorder. New knowledge about genetics may allow \n     for the development of better therapies that are more \n     effective against disease or have fewer side effects than \n     current treatments. These advances give rise to the potential \n     misuse of genetic information to discriminate in health \n     insurance and employment.\n       (2) The early science of genetics became the basis of State \n     laws that provided for the sterilization of persons having \n     presumed genetic ``defects'' such as mental retardation, \n     mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among \n     other conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in \n     the State of Indiana in 1907. By 1981, a majority of States \n     adopted sterilization laws to ``correct'' apparent genetic \n     traits or tendencies. Many of these State laws have since \n     been repealed, and many have been modified to include \n     essential constitutional requirements of due process and \n     equal protection. However, the current explosion in the \n     science of genetics, and the history of sterilization laws by \n     the States based on early genetic science, compels \n     Congressional action in this area.\n       (3) Although genes are facially neutral markers, many \n     genetic conditions and disorders are associated with \n     particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some \n     genetic traits are most prevalent in particular groups, \n     members of a particular group may be stigmatized or \n     discriminated against as a result of that genetic \n     information. This form of discrimination was evident in the \n     1970s, which saw the advent of programs to screen and \n     identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a disease which \n     afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures \n     began to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the \n     early 1970s began mandating genetic screening of all African \n     Americans for sickle cell anemia, leading to discrimination \n     and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this stigma, \n     Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia \n     Control Act, which withholds Federal funding from States \n     unless sickle cell testing is voluntary.\n       (4) Congress has been informed of examples of genetic \n     discrimination in the workplace. These include the use of \n     pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley \n     Laboratory, which led to a court decision in favor of the \n     employees in that case Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley \n     Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998)). Congress \n     clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the \n     fear of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice \n     in employment and health insurance.\n       (5) Federal law addressing genetic discrimination in health \n     insurance and employment is incomplete in both the scope and \n     depth of its protections. Moreover, while many States have \n     enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these \n     laws vary widely with respect to their approach, application, \n     and level of protection. Congress has collected substantial \n     evidence that the American public and the medical community \n     find the existing patchwork of State and Federal laws to be \n     confusing and inadequate to protect them from discrimination. \n     Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and \n     uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the \n     public from discrimination and allay their concerns about the \n     potential for discrimination, thereby allowing individuals to \n     take advantage of genetic testing, technologies, research, \n     and new therapies.\n\n         TITLE I--GENETIC NONDISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about S. \n2324, the Inspector General Reform Act, which is expected to pass the \nSenate today with an amendment of mine. The amendment makes several \nreforms and clarifying changes to the bill.\n  Section 3 of the bill requires the President to give Congress 30 \ndays' notice before removing or transferring an inspector general from \nhis position. My amendment clarifies that the President may still take \nother actions against an inspector general without providing 30 days' \nnotice, such as suspending him or otherwise preventing him from taking \nofficial actions. While section 3 appears to be designed to allow \nCongress to respond to a situation where an inspector general is fired \nin order to impede his discovery of wrongdoing or for other improper \nreasons, my amendment is intended to address another kind of scenario, \none where an inspector general is fired for very good reasons.\n  We should not assume that inspectors general will be immune to human \nfailings. If an inspector general is fired because he has been indicted \nor is under investigation for corruption or has otherwise abused the \npowers of his office, it should be clear that the President can prevent \nthe inspector general from launching new investigations in retaliation \nor taking other official actions, and that he can be denied access to \nhis office space. My amendment ensures that this is so.\n  Section 6 of the bill authorizes inspectors general to obtain legal \nadvice from the attorneys working for them. While this provision \nstrengthens the independence of inspectors general, it creates a \npotential ambiguity as to who has ultimate authority to resolve legal \nquestions within an agency. Agency employees should not face a division \nof authority if an inspector general were to reach a different \nconclusion on a legal matter previously resolved by the agency counsel.\n  My amendment clarifies that the agency or department's chief legal \nofficer remains the ultimate legal authority within the agency. While \nan inspector general may obtain his own legal advice, his review does \nnot constitute an appeal or review of the general counsel's decisions \nand judgments. The chief legal officer's views are what is final within \nthe agency, and they are subject to review within the executive branch \nonly by the head of the agency and the Justice Department.\n  Section 8 of the bill as reported by the committee allowed inspectors \ngeneral to include their own budget comments with respect to their \noffices in the President's budget proposal to Congress. I would first \nnote that the generous growth of inspectors generals' budgets during \nthis administration leaves little reason to fear that these offices are \nbeing starved of resources. More fundamentally, as a general matter, \nall agencies and departments should be subject to the Office of \nManagement and Budget's budgeting process, to ensure that the \nPresident's budget proposal reflects and balances competing priorities. \nRules such as that in section 8 should generally be disfavored. An \nexception is tolerable here only because of the unique status and role \nof the inspectors general. And even in their case, we should not assume \nthat every disagreement between the Office of Management and Budget and \nan inspector general about the size of his budget reflects some effort \nto suppress an investigation.\n\n  All bureaucrats love to see their budgets grow and to build their \nlittle empires. We should not assume that inspectors general are immune \nfrom this tendency. To mitigate its effects, my amendment would require \nthat an inspector general assert that he would be inhibited in the \nperformance of his duties before he may submit a separate budget \nrequest.\n  The amendment serves two purposes. First, it should rein in requests \nfor ever-expanding budgets, and ensure that inspectors general \ngenerally remain subject to budget discipline. And secondly, it ensures \nthat if an administration is retaliating against an inspector general \nor otherwise reducing his budget in order to prevent him from doing his \njob, then Congress will be alerted to the fact. If separate budget \nrequests were routine, the submission of such requests would provide \nlittle notice to congressional overseers. And if an inspector general \nbelieves that an administration is starving him of resources with the \nintent to undermine his ability to do his job, Congress not only should \nhave before it his separate budget request, it should also be made \naware that the inspector general believes that he is being treated that \nway.\n  Finally, section 14 of the committee-reported bill would have given \nthe Justice Department's inspector general the authority to conduct \nlegal ethics reviews. I found this provision strongly objectionable. An \nattorney's decision to investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice \nis a sensitive one and should be reviewed with great deference. There \ncan be a wide range of legitimate disagreement as to how such issues \nshould be decided. Justice Department reviews of such decisions are \nequivalent to the attorney discipline proceedings conducted by state \nbar associations. They are currently conducted within the Justice \nDepartment by the Office of Professional Responsibility, and there is \nno evidence that this Office's reviews are anything less than adequate.\n  Indeed, recently the Office of Professional Responsibility has taken \nupon itself the role of reviewing the merits of the Office of Legal \nCounsel's legal analyses. The Office of Legal Counsel's lawyers are \nrecognized to be among the very best in the executive branch. They are \nassigned to resolve the most difficult legal questions that confront an \nadministration. I find it dubious that an OPR lawyer would be in any \nposition to assess whether an Office of Legal Counsel opinion is \nlegally correct or not.\n  Absent at least some evidence that such an opinion was the product of \nbribery or other improper external influences, I question the basis on \nwhich\n\n[[Page S3328]]\n\nOPR even assumes for itself the authority to initiate such a review. I \nfear that OPR's actions are influenced more by the toxic style of \nopposition attacks on the Justice Department in recent years, in which \nlegitimate policy and legal disputes are recast as ethical lapses, \nrather than by a sound concern for the integrity of the Department.\n  While some of the Office of Professional Responsibilities' recent \nactions are debatable, the notion of extending that Office's authority \nto the inspector general is totally unacceptable. Inspectors general \ninvestigate waste, fraud, and abuse. They are suited neither by \ntemperament nor experience to second guess whether a Justice Department \nlawyer should have investigated a matter, prosecuted a case, or offered \na legal opinion. It is at my insistence that the original section 14 \nhas been removed from this bill.\n  I commend Senators Lieberman and Collins for their devotion to \noverseeing and improving the operations of the inspectors general and, \nwith the changes made by my amendment, I will raise no objection to the \npassage of this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Kyl \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the committee \namendments, as amended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed; the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate; and any statements related to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for \nrecognizing me and allowing me to speak this evening before we close \ndown.\n\n[[Page S3333]]\n\n  I want to put before the body a situation that is happening right now \nin North Korea. I put a hold on our nominee to be the Ambassador to the \nRepublic of South Korea. I want to explain why I am doing that. I want \nto show why I am doing that. Then I want to raise some issues on human \nrights and why we need to be a lot more involved and pushy about what \nis taking place in North Korea.\n  I was encouraged last week in a meeting I had with the new President \nof South Korea, Mr. Lee Myung Bak, at a meeting hosted by the Senate \nleadership. I was encouraged to hear his interest in dealing with the \nhuman rights situation--or lack thereof, of human rights--in North \nKorea. He is going to be more willing to work with us than the last \nKorean administration in South Korea.\n  I was pleased to see his willingness to work with us and support us \non the nuclear negotiations in which the Korean Peninsula would be a \nnuclear-free zone--although that is not the case. We have seen what \nNorth Korea has done in their willingness to proliferate. I told the \nPresident of South Korea--and he agreed--we must see real and verified \nresults with the North Korean regime, not only on nuclear activities \nbut also on the issue of human rights.\n  We are not seeing either. We are not seeing real and verifiable \nresults on what they are doing in the nuclear development category. We \nare certainly not seeing it in the human rights category.\n  Without transparent improvement in human rights, and I believe the \nsame on the nuclear issues as well, I told him the establishment of \ndiplomatic relations would condone crimes against humanity on a massive \nscale. Without transparent distribution of humanitarian aid from the \nUnited States and outside world into North Korea, this aid would be \nused as a weapon of oppression and diverted from those in greatest need \nto those elites who get the most under the system.\n  These statements I made to him were well received, which is a change \nfrom the prior administration which sought a different policy toward \nNorth Korea, one they wanted to engage but certainly not address on \nthese human rights and nuclear issues.\n  I met with our nominee to be the Ambassador to South Korea. I met \nwith her twice. In two meetings with Ms. Stephens, the nominee, I gave \nher every opportunity to explain to me why she should be our next \nAmbassador to the Republic of South Korea and how she would address the \nhuman rights issues. She is certainly a qualified individual, spending \nher adult career in the State Department and international work. She is \na highly qualified individual. Yet on how we are going to and if we are \ngoing to positively address the human rights concern and address it on \na high scale--to where it is one of the top issues we are dealing with, \nnot just one that, well, once we deal with these others we will talk \nabout human rights or we might bring it up--I did not get satisfactory \nanswers from her, nor did I get those even from Secretary Rice, for \nwhom I have great admiration, a week later, after my meetings with the \nnominee.\n  I asked her in the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations hearing \nwhat specific ``asks'' we are making of North Korea on the human rights \nagenda. She didn't say that we had particular items. Now maybe there \nare ones she is willing to identify. One I asked her specifically about \nis why don't we ask the North Koreans to shut down the gulags, the \npolitical prisoner camps which I am going to showcase here. Why don't \nwe ask them to shut those down as an ``ask,'' putting those on the \ntable? I didn't get a response.\n  We are now approaching 4 years since the passage of the North Korean \nHuman Rights Act of 2004. I was willing to give the State Department \nand other agencies time to implement the act. I was willing to give \nthose implementing the law, which included Ms. Stephens, our nominee to \nbe the Ambassador to South Korea, the benefit of the doubt. I was \nwilling to wait to see if the Department of State negotiators would be \nwilling to confront the North Koreans regarding their human rights \nabuses. I wanted to see how much priority they would give to addressing \nthe trafficking along the border between North Korea and China.\n  Today I met with a number of refugees from North Korea. If a woman \ncrosses over that border looking for food in China, 100 percent are \ntrafficked--they are caught and sold. That is taking place on that \nborder today. I wanted to see if we would give priority to the \ntrafficking issues or gain accession to the gulags that dot the country \nor ensure the food aid would be strictly monitored. I am still waiting, \nas are many other individuals and groups working on North Korean \nissues, but my wait is not significant, nor is their wait. The 23 \nmillion North Koreans who are waiting are the ones who are dying. Many \nare desperately waiting in the gulags. I would like to show you these \npictures today.\n  These pictures are from Google Earth. Google has made a witness of \nall of us, to no longer deny that these things exist and say they are \nclassified photographs. You can go on Google Earth and look these up. \nThe existence of these camps and the specific details have been \nconfirmed by North Korean defectors living in South Korea.\n  Some are guards, others former prisoners in some camps that they were \nable to get out of. I would like to thank, in particular, Rev. Chun Ki \nWon for his assistance.\n  We now have no excuse for ignoring the truth of what many believe is \na holocaust that is occurring in North Korea today. The U.S. Committee \nfor Human Rights in North Korea believes that 400,000 have already died \nin these camps alone--400,000 have died in these camps alone according \nto the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea.\n  If you listen to the defectors' stories, as I have done on several \noccasions, the scale and depravity of the crimes that are committed in \nthese camps rival those done by Pol Pot in Cambodia and even by the \nNazis.\n  Too many of us refuse to confront this issue. Maybe we are afraid \nthat confronting the atrocities of these camps would also require us to \nconfront its urgent moral imperatives.\n  The first photo here is of Camp 22 where chemical experiments are \nalleged to have occurred. Camp 22 is in this picture. It is a huge \nconcentration camp. It is over 400 square miles in size, a \nconcentration camp.\n  No known prisoner has ever left the camp. The information we have has \nbeen from guards who have defected. No prisoner has been known to get \nout of this camp alive. The guards we contacted were able to identify \nits electric fences and moats. They were able to point out the huts \nwhere its prisoners live, the coal mines where men are worked to death, \nand the forests and fields where the dead are not buried, they are \ndiscarded.\n  Former guard Kwon Hyuk claims the fences around Camp 22 are about 2.5 \nmeters high and electrified with 3,300 volts of electricity. He also \nsays the camp is surrounded by land mines and spiked moats.\n  If you look carefully at the center of this next picture, of the \ncourtyard at the middle of the guard station, you will see what appears \nto be a group of people coming in. This is the entry gate--a group of \npeople going in to whatever fate we do not know.\n  Outside the gates, life for North Koreans, such as it is, goes on. \nThis year is said to be an especially difficult one in this part of \nNorth Korea, but the farmers outside the gate are still luckier than \nthose inside.\n  Farmers cannot pretend not to know what goes on beyond the fence. One \nrecent defector who lived just outside Camp 22 told his American \nEnglish teacher how the guards from his camp would come to his house \nand search for scarce food and alcohol, and how drunken guards would \nconfess remorsefully to the cruelties they inflicted on the prisoners.\n  The teacher published his recollection in the Washington Post last \nyear, which I ask unanimous consent be made part of the Record and \nprinted at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. This next picture is the Chungbong Coal Mine in Camp \n22. I described Camp 22. It is over 400 square miles. Its main features \nare coal and forest mining. Ahn Myong Chol, a former guard and driver \nat Camp 22, described the working conditions in this mine. Prisoners \nwork two shifts a day on meager rations. They are organized\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\ninto five-person teams and are encouraged to earn rewards and \nsupplement the starvation rations by informing on each other. Prisoners \nare beaten frequently, sometimes to death, and often for no reason at \nall. This is according to a former guard in Camp 22.\n  They work in cramped, narrow shafts. Accidents and cave-ins kill many \nprisoners. Those who are injured are sent to a hospital without \nqualified staff or medical supplies, and they are essentially left to \ndie. Others die of exhaustion as they try to meet daily quotas. Those \nwho fail to meet the quotas are not fed.\n  Now, there are dozens of these camps all over North Korea. I want to \nshow you some locations of the various gulags that are known throughout \nNorth Korea. We now have corroborated reports from multiple sources of \nthe kind of depravity that continues in these camps to this day.\n  Why not, in our Six Party negotiations and talks that we have going \non today, that one of our primary ``asks,'' along with dealing with the \nnuclear issue, be to shut the gulag system down? It is a very clear, a \nvery specific ``ask.'' We have evidence from Google Earth. I believe we \nhave much better satellite photographs that go into this in even more \ndetail.\n  There are hundreds of North Koreans who have fled now into South \nKorea, a few into this country, with evidence, who are speaking about \nthis issue. So they know and can corroborate what we are seeing in the \npictures.\n  Why not confront the North Koreas with it on an equal par with the \nnuclear negotiations? I think to do this advances our cause overall.\n  In the Soviet Union, when we were dealing with them on nuclear \ndisarmament, one of the key things we asked for is, well, with the \nhuman rights agenda, put it up right there beside it. People are \nsaying: Do not do that. You are going to upset the balance. But when \nyou talk with the people who were in the prison system, and you hear \ntheir statements about it, they were saying that what gave them heart \nwas they knew someone on the outside world was paying attention to \nthem.\n  It also delegitimized the Soviet Union because as long as you are \ngoing at the nuclear issue, the Government in North Korea says, ``They \nare just trying to disarm us.'' And ``They have got it, this is \nsomething that we as North Koreans deserve.''\n  But when you say: What about the Chungbong Coal Mine and the people \ndying there every day; what about Camp 22 where you are having people \ngoing into this all of the time but nobody ever comes out; if you raise \nthat, it delegitimizes the regime, it makes them confront their own \npeople about what they are doing. And that is a more powerful tool. Why \nwould we not raise that? This was my question to our nominee. Why are \nwe not raising that?\n  It seems as if the desire to get something on the nuclear side is so \nmuch greater than that on the human rights side, that this one is set: \nOK, when we get the nuclear one dealt with, we will deal with this. But \nin the meantime, people are dying, a lot of them. And this goes on. It \ncontinues at a time when we would look at those things and say: My \ngoodness, this is 2008. This does not go on in the world today. You \nhave pictures. You can go on Google Earth and see it.\n  I think we have to raise this issue. I think it is important in our \nnegotiations for us to raise this issue. We have expressed our horror \nat what has taken place in various places around the world and said, \n``never again.'' We have said it about concentration camps. Yet it is \ngoing on here and we have a negotiation and we are not even making it a \nmajor issue. So I believe we need to step up and we need to push this \nissue.\n  The final point I would like to make about this is that the Chinese \nare complicit in this as well. They are the ones who could put the most \npressure of any country in the world outside of Korea on the North \nKoreans. They are the ones who have the economic relations. They are \nthe ones who are the protector of North Korea. When people escape out \nof one of these camps or try looking for food in China, they are caught \nby the Chinese and repatriated to an uncertain fate, likely death, \noften imprisonment, and they are sent back against the Chinese \nrequirements of what they had signed in the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission Agreement in 1951, an agreement that China is a signatory of \nthat says they will not send people back into a death camp situation or \nwhere their health would be challenged or would be likely harmed or \nthat they would be killed.\n  Clearly, that is taking place over there, and China continues to do \nit. So on top of what they are doing in Tibet and what they are doing \nin North Korea, on top of what they are doing in Sudan, enabling the \nSudanese Government to continue this in Darfur and buying oil out of \nSudan and backing reform in the United Nations, on top of that and \npursuing resources out of the Congo, regardless of what sorts of abuses \nare taking place by the groups or the militias stealing the resources \nto take them out through China, regardless of what is taking place in \nBurma where the Chinese are blocking and supporting the Burmese and \nthen they are pushing people out, the Korean people are being pushed \ninto Thailand, but they are not citizens of Thailand so they are being \ntrafficked from that point. The Chinese are the ones who are complicit \nin all of this. They are the great enabler of human rights abuses \naround the world today, in their own country and externally. They bear \na huge responsibility for what is taking place today in North Korea.\n\n  I hope this continues to be expressed and brought up--I plan to do \nso--prior to the Olympics this year, which should be a celebration of \ngreat athleticism. I believe it will be. But as China seeks to exploit \nthis as a presentation of their coming forward in the world, I hope the \nworld notices what else they are doing. They are hosting a grand \nOlympics, but they are hosting a greater catastrophe of human rights \nabuses in their country and around the world. Whether it is Tibetans or \npeople in the house church movement, Falun Gong members being arrested, \nNorth Koreans, Burmese, Sudanese, Congolese, they lay at the doorstep \nof the Chinese.\n  I think we need to confront this. I am hopeful the administration \nwill address this. I know the President personally cares very deeply \nabout human rights abuses in North Korea. He has met individually with \npeople who have come out of North Korea. I talked directly with him \nabout it. I don't think we are seeing the administration meet the \nPresident's greatest desires on addressing this issue. That is why I \nput a hold on Kathleen Stephens being Ambassador to the Republic of \nKorea until we begin to address these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 1, 2007]\n\n            Escape From Dear Leader to My Classroom in Seoul\n\n                        (By Samuel Songhoon Lee)\n\n       Seoul.-- At a small restaurant in late February, my student \n     and I ate spicy noodle soup and stared at a huge TV showing \n     the extravagant celebration of Kim Jong Il's 65th birthday in \n     Pyongyang. Thousands of smiling people paraded across the \n     North Korean capital and saluted their Dear Leader.\n       ``I was once there,'' my student said. ``But even as I \n     danced and smiled, I knew of a better life outside.'' She \n     said this matter-of-factly and turned to stir her tea. Her \n     search for that better life had brought her here, at age 13, \n     to Seoul, and to my English class at a special school for \n     young North Korean defectors.\n       The school has more than two dozen students, members of a \n     growing contingent of North Koreans who have deserted that \n     communist country since famines in the mid-1990s killed more \n     than 2 million people. According to South Korea's Ministry of \n     Unification, 41 North Korean defectors arrived in South Korea \n     in 1995. The number increased to 312 in 2000, and to 1,383 in \n     2005, many of them young people.\n       It isn't easy for these young defectors to fit into South \n     Korean schools and fill the gaps in their education. Most \n     schools here don't offer transition courses on the \n     differences in language and culture. But catching up with \n     schoolwork is only one problem they face.\n       In South Korea, a country that withstood centuries of \n     invasions from its Chinese and Japanese neighbors, unity \n     defines survival. And without ethnic diversity or a history \n     of immigration, unity means conformity. When something \n     becomes fashionable here, it can have significant \n     consequences. For example, South Korea has the world's \n     highest ratio of cosmetic surgeons to citizens, catering to \n     the legions of girls who receive eyelid surgery as a present \n     for their 16th birthday. This culture of unity and conformity \n     is vastly different from the one I experienced growing up \n     Korean American in New York, Denver and Seattle. The lack of \n     diversity at school makes the young defectors instant\n\n[[Page S3335]]\n\n     standouts--subject to 15 minutes of fame and adulation, then \n     an enduring period of isolation. When their peers ask about \n     their accent--noticeably different from what's common in \n     Seoul--most students say they're from Gangwon Province, in \n     the northeastern part of the country.\n       Facing ostracism from South Korean students, many young \n     North Korean defectors drop out of school. According to a \n     ministry report in 2005, 43 percent of young defectors were \n     attending school, and 29 percent had dropped out of middle \n     and high schools. Almost half of the 198 young defectors \n     still attending school said that they hid their background \n     from classmates, according to a survey by the National Human \n     Rights Commission.\n       ``Don't expect them to be like us just because they look \n     Korean and speak Korean,'' the principal told me on the \n     orientation day for volunteer teachers at School 34, an \n     independent school for defectors. ``Treat them like \n     foreigners, but with respect.''\n       I was assigned to teach two English classes to students \n     ages 15 to 27. When I introduced myself, they were as puzzled \n     and curious about me as I was about them. An oversized Korean \n     American with big Sony headphones--was I really one of them?\n       Taking the principal's advice, I made it clear from the \n     start that I was not, and that I probably could not \n     understand the obstacles they had to overcome to reach the \n     free world. Many feel deeply betrayed by Kim and the \n     propaganda they were forced to learn. But they have achieved \n     a surprising distance from their painful past. They share \n     memories--which include watching public executions and \n     boiling grass to eat in times of famine--as if they were \n     reciting folk tales with a sense of wonder and humor.\n       Among my students, one young man stood out because of his \n     motivation to learn English. His family is still in North \n     Korea, and he wants to earn the $15,000 in payoffs it would \n     take to get them to Seoul. Numerous underground railroads \n     established by brokers in China make rescuing family members \n     from North Korea possible, he told me--if one has the money. \n     ``I can work hard for two years and make that money. But I \n     will lag behind in my study. Then what can I do even if my \n     family were to come here?'' he said.\n       In North Korea, he knew exactly what he wanted to do: \n     become an officer in the North Korean army. He dreamed of \n     killing as many Americans and South Koreans as he could. In \n     his childhood home, a framed photo of his grandfather and Kim \n     was prominently displayed on the living room wall. His family \n     was part of North Korea's small and reclusive elite society, \n     and he would have marched off as an army lieutenant if he \n     hadn't received a black-market Sony Walkman for his 15th \n     birthday and listened to forbidden South Korean radio \n     frequencies.\n       Late at night, muffling the scratchy signal so as not to \n     get caught, he tuned in to the news, learning that much of \n     what he was taught all day in school was a lie. ``We learned \n     that the Americans were constantly trying to invade us. But \n     from the South Korean news, I learned that it was the other \n     way around. But my classmates truly believed in what we were \n     learning. They were like robots.''\n       When he graduated from high school and was ordered to serve \n     13 years in the military, he decided to defect. His father \n     bribed the North Korean border patrolmen, who took him to \n     China. Because the Chinese government regularly repatriated \n     North Korean refugees, South Korean missionaries took him to \n     Myanmar, where Seoul's consulate prepared the papers for his \n     final journey to South Korea.\n       Soon after arriving in Seoul, he found School 34 and a \n     community of others like him. Most students were too poor to \n     have bribed their way out. Instead, they had braved often \n     frigid waters to swim across the Tumen River to China.\n       Another student, a good-humored young woman, lost her \n     parents to starvation before she turned 11. To survive, she \n     said, she crossed the Tumen many times to obtain food and \n     other goods in China that she could sell on North Korea's \n     widespread black market. When she defected, she went as \n     far as Xinyang, in China's southeastern Henan Province. \n     Discovered by Chinese agents, she was repatriated and \n     served six months in prison. She was 13 at the time. After \n     being released, she swam across the river again and this \n     time she stayed in China, begging for food. Eventually, \n     missionaries helped her get to Seoul.\n       One recent School 34 graduate is now studying at \n     Sungkyunkwan University, one of the nation's top colleges. He \n     grew up a few minutes away from one of North Korea's most \n     notorious political prisons, Prison 22 in Hyeryung, Ham-Kyung \n     Province, at the northern tip of North Korea. Because food \n     and alcohol are scarce in the countryside, the prison guards \n     went to his house for libations. ``They always drank \n     heavily,'' he told me. ``And when they got drunk, they would \n     mumble about how sorry they felt for what they did to \n     prisoners.''\n       Despite his rare glimpse of the prison guards and knowledge \n     of what they did, my student says he finds it difficult to \n     raise awareness about the little-known gulags of North Korea \n     among his classmates in Seoul. Most do not care, he says. Or \n     worse, they take a pro-North Korea stance. President Roh Moo \n     Hyun has been passionately calling for the ouster of the \n     37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea, and a wave of anti-\n     American sentiment is sweeping across college campuses. After \n     eight years of the dubious ``sunshine policy,'' which \n     advocated engagement with rather than containment of the \n     communist north, South Korean public sentiment favors \n     neglecting thousands of North Korean refugees in China and \n     pouring cash and aid into Pyongyang, even with Kim's apparent \n     nuclear ambitions.\n       ``Back in North Korea, we learned to hate and fear \n     America,'' a 17-year-old student who attended middle school \n     in North Korea told me one recent afternoon over sodas at \n     McDonald's. His father was once responsible for importing and \n     distributing Soviet arms to the North Korean army. But he \n     defected to South Korea two years ago after his father was \n     purged. ``Now, I've realized that all I learned was a series \n     of lies,'' he said, taking a bite of his Big Mac. ``I wish my \n     friends back in North Korea could eat this one day.''\n       We left McDonald's shortly and went back to School 34 to \n     study English.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/23/senate-section/article/S3335-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
