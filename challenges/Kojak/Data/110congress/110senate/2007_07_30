Mr. President, last week was a very productive week for the \nSenate and the American people. With Democrats and Republicans working \ntogether, the Senate was able to pass the conference report \nimplementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Also, we passed the \nFiscal Year 2008 Homeland Security appropriations bill and the Higher \nEducation Reauthorization Act.\n  This week, we will turn our attention to important domestic \ninitiatives, including reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram and passing the ethics conference report to strengthen the \nintegrity of our Government. That legislation is completed. The House \nwill pass it tomorrow. Without any qualification or reservation, it is \nthe most significant lobbying and ethics reform in the history of our \ncountry. I hope we can do this piece of legislation without a lot of \nturmoil. I hope that people understand how important it is to the \nAmerican people.\n  As we focus on issues that will lead to a better and brighter future \nfor millions of Americans, two new reports illustrate that neither the \npresent nor the future seem particularly bright for the Iraqis and Iraq \nitself, where our brave troops are fighting in this intractable civil \nwar.\n  One report that came down this morning is from a humanitarian \norganization. The other is from President\n\n[[Page S10210]]\n\nBush's own Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.\n  According to the first report--released by Oxfam, an international \naid organization, and the NGO Coordination Committee network in Iraq--8 \nmillion Iraqis are in need of immediate emergency aid. So according to \nthis first report, 8 million Iraqis are in need of immediate emergency \naid. That is probably more than a third of the population. It means \nthey are desperately lacking basic daily necessities such as food, \nwater, and sanitation.\n\n  Even more troubling, these conditions are worse now than before the \nwar started. Before the war, 19 percent of Iraqi children were \nmalnourished. Today, that is 28 percent. And 50 percent lacked adequate \nwater supplies before the war; that is now 70 percent. So 70 percent of \nall Iraqis live without clean water.\n  With awful and deteriorating conditions such as these, it is no \nwonder a recent poll of the Iraqi people showed 70 percent of the Iraqi \npeople believe the American presence is making them less safe.\n  Our troops are certainly not to blame for these failures to make the \nIraqi people safer or healthier. In the war's 4-plus years, they have \naccomplished everything they have been asked to do. They took down the \nIraqi dictator. They have heroically battled those who seek to \ndestabilize Iraq and the region. They have provided time for Iraqi \nfactions to come together and negotiate a peaceful settlement of their \ndifferences which, unfortunately, these factions have not taken \nadvantage of.\n  These failures lie with the President, who took us to war without a \nplan for peace, and the Defense Department generally, which has not \nmanaged to administer a strategy for success, and the Iraqi Government, \nwhich hasn't taken responsibility for their country's own future.\n  The second new report, from the Inspector General's Office for Iraq \nReconstruction, sheds new light on how thoroughly our efforts in that \narea have failed to help Iraqis and how dearly that failure is costing \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  This inspector general's report tells us Iraq's central government \nhas refused to take responsibility for more than 2,300 reconstruction \nprojects America has already paid close to $20 billion to construct.\n  The result is many projects are lapsing or continue to rely on \nAmerican funds only.\n  I say this in the background of the Iraqi people having arguably the \nlargest oil reserve in the world. When I met those in the first Iraqi \nGovernment, along with Senator Frist, one of the Iraqis proudly said of \nthe governing body: People say we have the second largest oil reserves \nin the world, but we have the largest oil reserves in the world.\n  I don't know whether it is first or second, but they have a lot of \noil, which translates to money, and they are not helping at all with \nthese projects.\n  Not a single project has been turned over to the Iraqi Government in \nmore than a year. Even among those few that have been turned over, \nmany, if not most, are now failing.\n  As a result, our almost $6 billion investment in Iraq reconstruction \nis largely being wasted. What would happen in America? We would not \ntolerate $6 billion being wasted in taxpayer dollars, and we should not \nstand for it in Iraq--especially when it is our taxpayers' money that \nis being wasted.\n  As long as we continue our open-ended commitment of troops, the Iraqi \nGovernment has no incentive to step up. As long as we continue \nfinancing projects that they let lapse, they will continue to let our \ntroops and taxpayers shoulder the burden.\n  The father of a soldier from Nevada wrote me recently to tell me how \nthat burden is affecting his son and his son's fellow soldiers. He gave \nme permission to read this when I called and asked him after reading \nthis heartfelt letter. He asked me not to mention his son's name, so I \nam not going to do that. I will not mention the man's name who wrote \nthe letter. If anybody has a question, I will be happy to show them the \nletter in my office.\n  He wrote:\n\n       Our son is a 20-year-old cavalry scout in the Army. He and \n     his best friend quit college their first semester to ``make a \n     difference.'' We are a close-knit family and although we only \n     get to speak to Mike once every 3-4 weeks, the conditions, \n     morale and circumstances he deals with are like nothing we \n     read about in the press.\n       I have always supported our troops but cannot support the \n     war anymore, particularly when I continue to receive \n     information from my son that is upsetting to me. He has not \n     had a day off since his deployment in early January. He has \n     had his hummer blown up and narrowly escaped death, seen his \n     close friend blown to pieces 30 yards away, had a suicide \n     bomber blow up a hummer in his unit 50 yards away, and the \n     stories go on.\n       My concern is no days off, 7 days a week in combat, 4 hours \n     of sleep per night and no days off in sight for the future. I \n     have to buy a good deal of equipment for him to send over to \n     Iraq . . .\n       I am a successful local businessman and a very patriotic \n     person . . . but we feel helpless and do not know who to \n     speak to . . . What do our soldiers have to look forward to \n     except fighting every day, looking death in the eye daily, no \n     days off, strategy that changes daily, 125 degree weather, \n     [and] little communication with the outside world . . .''\n\n  The Presiding Officer, from firsthand experience, knows what this man \nis talking about. Most of us don't.\n  This young man from Nevada, fighting with bravery far beyond his 20 \nyears, deserves better.\n  As his father said, he signed up for the Armed Forces to ``make a \ndifference.'' There are challenges facing America in nearly every \ncorner of the globe--real dangers that will affect our security for \ngenerations to come. This young soldier should be helping us wage a \nreal war on terrorism that goes after those who attacked us. He should \nbe involved in peacekeeping missions to stop genocide and spread peace. \nInstead, he is stuck in an endless war that even President Bush's own \nmilitary experts admit has no military solution.\n  It is long past time to end this preoccupation with Iraq. It is time \nto rebuild our overburdened military, so this young soldier from \nNevada, and 160,000 more just like him, have the rest and care they \nneed to do their job effectively.\n  As we work this week to make life better for millions of Americans at \nhome--especially children--we continue to think of our troops and the \nIraqi people who suffer abroad, and we will continue to work every day \nto bring about the new course our troops and all Americans deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10210-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last Thursday, July 26, 2007, was the 17th \nanniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act. On \nthat day in 1990, thousands of people gathered on the south lawn of the \nWhite House. It was the largest gathering at least to that date--it may \nstill be--for the signing of legislation. It was a beautiful sunny day. \nPresident Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act into law. \nThat bill had taken a long time to develop, years to develop. A lot of \nhard work and effort went into it.\n  As the chief Senate sponsor of that bill, getting that bill passed \nwas the proudest day in my life, having been raised with a brother who \nwas disabled. Seeing how he was discriminated against all his life \ncompelled me when\n\n[[Page S10211]]\n\nI first came to the House and then to the Senate to work on these \nissues, the issues of the discrimination against Americans with \ndisabilities and how people with disabilities had been kept out of the \nmainstream of American life, how they had been shunted aside, \nwarehoused, categorized in ways that demean their personhood in ways \nthat prevented them from contributing all they could to our American \nsociety.\n  So the Americans with Disabilities Act was a major civil rights act--\na major civil rights act--to ban discrimination, just as we did against \npeople of color, against women, national origin, sex, for example. We \nnow include people with disabilities under a broad civil rights \numbrella.\n  We have made great advances since that time. It is all over. One can \nsee it wherever one goes--curb cuts, accessible buses, accessible \ntrains, widened doors. Every building now built in the United States of \nAmerica is fully accessible. Architecture has changed. I have a nephew \nwho is an architect, and he said when that bill became law in the \n1990s, architecture school started teaching different subjects, \narchitecture firms started designing buildings differently for \nuniversal accessibility. We have come to accept that situation.\n  There is a problem, and the problem has come about through some \nSupreme Court decisions of late. That is why last Thursday on the 17th \nanniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I \njoined with Senator Specter of Pennsylvania, with House majority leader \nSteny Hoyer, and the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, \nCongressman Jim Sensenbrenner, in introducing a bipartisan measure \ncalled the ADA Restoration Act of 2007.\n  As I will explain in more detail shortly, this bill offers a modest, \nreasonable legislative fix in response to court decisions that have \nmisconstrued the original legislative intent of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, which I will refer to now on as the ADA.\n  Again, what is remarkable about this legislation is that it was done \nin a spirit of genuine bipartisanship, with Members of both parties \ncoming together to do the right thing for millions of Americans with \ndisabilities. But that is the way we developed the first ADA in 1990. \nIt was a truly overwhelming bipartisan effort. As I said, as I was the \nchief sponsor in the Senate, I worked very closely with then-Senator \nBob Dole who had been the majority leader and then was the ranking \nminority member in the Senate. We had invaluable support, of course, \nfrom the White House. President George Bush, Bush 41, George Herbert \nWalker Bush, was very helpful; Key members of the administration--I \nespecially want to note for the record Boyden Gray, White House \ncounsel, without whose support and intervention the law probably would \nnever have been passed; Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, again a \nkey player in getting the ADA passed in 1990; Sam Skinner, then \nTransportation Secretary, also was very much involved.\n  The introduction of the ADA Restoration Act last Thursday and the \nreaction to it has been a breath of fresh air amidst all the going back \nand forth politically in Washington, very much in the same spirit we \nhad in 1990 when members of both parties embraced the legislation as \nsomething that can and should be done and should be beyond \npartisanship. There was a sense that on this one measure, we could put \npartisanship aside and come together as a unified body and make a real \ndifference in the lives of our fellow citizens who have disabilities.\n  The fact is, we all take pride in the progress we have made in the \nlast 17 years. Nobody wants to go backward. The ADA, as I said, is one \nof the great landmark civil rights legislation of the 20th century, a \nlong overdue emancipation proclamation for millions of Americans with \ndisabilities.\n  Again, we removed most physical barriers. We have required employers \nto provide reasonable accommodations so that people with disabilities \ncan get jobs and have equal opportunity in the workplace.\n  There were four goals of the ADA, four pillars, so to speak: equality \nof opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic \nself-sufficiency.\n  The reach of the ADA revolution struck me some time ago in \nWashington. I attended a downtown convention of several hundred \ndisability rights advocates, many with very severe impairments. They \narrived in Washington on trains and planes and buses built to \naccommodate people in wheelchairs. They came to the hotel on the Metro \nand in regular buses all seamlessly accessible by wheelchair. They \nnavigated city streets equipped with curb cuts and ramps. The hotel \nwhere the convention took place was equipped in countless ways to \naccommodate people with disabilities. There were sign language \ninterpreters on the dias so people with hearing disabilities could be \nfull participants.\n  For those of us able-bodied, these many changes are all but \ninvisible, but for a person in a wheelchair, for a person without \nsight, for a person with deafness, they are transforming and \nliberating.\n  So our provisions in ADA outlawed discrimination against qualified \nindividuals with disabilities in the workplace and required employers \nto provide reasonable accommodations. But, as I said, a problem has \narisen.\n  In recent years, the courts have ignored Congress's clear intent as \nto who is to be covered by the ADA. The courts have narrowed the \ndefinition of who qualifies as an individual with a disability. As a \nconsequence, millions of people whom we intended to be covered by the \nADA, including people with epilepsy, diabetes, yes, even cancer, are \nnot protected anymore. In a ruling this spring, the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt even concluded that a person with mental retardation was not \ndisabled under the ADA.\n  Looking back to the legislative history, it is abundantly clear that \nwe in Congress intended that the protections of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act apply to all persons without regard to mitigating \ncircumstances, such as taking medicine or using an assistive device.\n  Nonetheless, in a series of cases, the Supreme Court has all but \nignored congressional intent. Together, these Supreme Court cases have \ncreated an absurd and unintended catch 22-type situation. People with \nserious health conditions, such as epilepsy or diabetes or seeing \nproblems, who are fortunate to find treatments that make them more \ncapable and independent and, thus, more able to work may find they are \nno longer protected by the ADA. If these individuals are no longer \ncovered by the ADA, then their request for reasonable accommodations in \nthe workplace can be ignored, denied, or they can be fired. On the \nother hand, if they stop taking their medication or stop using an \nassistive device, they will be considered a person with a disability \nunder the ADA but they won't be qualified for the job.\n  Think about what kind of a position this puts a person in. Let's say \nyou have epilepsy and you take medication to control it. That makes you \nable to work. But under the Court decisions, if you take a job and the \nemployer finds out you have epilepsy, they can fire you. And guess \nwhat. You are not covered by the ADA. On the other hand, if I have \nepilepsy, I don't take my medication, and I have seizures, I will never \nget the job. This is absurd. It is absurd, and it is wrong. It flies in \nthe face of clear, unambiguous congressional intent.\n  I often tell people that when we write laws here, we don't write \nevery little thing into the law. That is why we have hearings, that is \nwhy we have committee prints, and that is why we have report language \nthat goes with the laws we pass. It is very clear and it was common \nagreement at that time, on both sides of the aisle and with the White \nHouse, that the law was designed to protect any individual who is \ntreated less favorably because of current, past, or a perceived \ndisability--a perceived disability.\n  Listen to the report language. Here is the report language we had in \nthe Senate report accompanying the bill:\n\n       Whether a person has a disability should be assessed \n     without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, \n     such as reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids.\n\n  The House report says the same thing and goes on to say:\n\n       For example, a person who is hard of hearing is \n     substantially limited in the major life activity of hearing, \n     even though the loss may be corrected through the use of a \n     hearing aid. Likewise, persons with impairments, such as \n     epilepsy or diabetes, which substantially limit a major life \n     activity, are covered\n\n[[Page S10212]]\n\n     under the definition of disability, even if the effects of \n     the impairment are controlled by medication.\n\n  This is important because if an individual, I repeat, is not \nconsidered to be disabled under the ADA, then they do not have the \nprotections of the Americans with Disabilities Act. For example, as I \nsaid, they are not entitled to reasonable accommodation on the job and \nthey can be fired for any reason--let's say not being able to do the \njob without an accommodation. So if you are a person with a disability \nand you have an assistive device, you get the job and you need a \nreasonable accommodation so you can do the job, but the employer says: \nI am not going to do it, well, guess what. They do not have to because \nthe individual is no longer considered disabled. But if they didn't \nhave the assistive device, they wouldn't get the job in the first \nplace.\n  This is what has happened, and it has created consternation among \npeople with disabilities who want to use assistive devices and take \nmedication and do things--they want to work. But if they do that, they \nare no longer protected by the ADA.\n  So that is why we have introduced the ADA restoration bill, to again \novercome the hurdles the Supreme Court has pronounced in three or four \ncases--I won't get into those now--and so that we get to the original \nintent of the ADA, which is to say you are covered if you have a past \ndisability, a present disability, or you are perceived to have a \ndisability.\n  Again, I repeat, we have a supreme absurdity confronting people with \ndisabilities now. People with serious health conditions, such as \nepilepsy or diabetes, who are fortunate to find treatments that make \nthem more capable and independent, more able to work, may now find they \nare no longer covered by the ADA.\n  One last thing. In another Supreme Court case, the Court held there \nmust be ``a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled.'' This, too, \nhas resulted in a much more restrictive requirement than Congress \nintended and has had the effect of excluding countless individuals with \ndisabilities from the protections of the law.\n  So the situation cries out for a modest, reasonable legislative fix, \nand that is exactly what Senator Specter and Congressmen Hoyer and \nSensenbrenner and I and many other cosponsors propose to do with the \nADA Restoration Act of 2007. Our bill amends the definition of \ndisability so that people Congress originally intended to be protected \nare covered under the ADA.\n  Mr. President, 17 years ago, the Americans with Disabilities Act \npassed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Likewise, today, we are \nbuilding a strong bicameral, bipartisan majority to support ADA \nrestoration. As I said, the companion bill was introduced in the House \nlast week. Now, as with the ADA in 1990, it will take some time. We \nhave to have hearings. It has been referred to four committees in the \nHouse and referred to the HELP Committee here in the Senate. But I am \ngrateful for the bipartisan spirit with which we are approaching this \nlegislation.\n  We have said all along, going clear back to the 1980s, that the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act is supremely nonpartisan. There is \nnothing Republican, Democratic, liberal, conservative, or anything else \nabout this. It is simply doing the right thing. As we look back over \nthe last 17 years, we can take pride in what we have done, particularly \nwhen you see the curb cuts all over America or you go into movie \ntheaters now and you see places where people with wheelchairs can come \nin or you go into restaurants now and see families taking out somebody \nwho maybe has a seeing-eye dog or a companion dog. We have even made \nthe Capitol of the United States fully accessible to people with \ndisabilities. As I said, every place all over America, even sports \nstadiums, has been transformed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired, and the time of the majority has also expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, we have come to the point where we have to go back \nand put into law what it is we originally intended and to cover people \nnow who are caught in this absurd catch-22 situation. We have an \nopportunity again to come together as Republicans and Democrats. We \nhave a chance to come together for millions of Americans with \ndisabilities.\n  I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto restore Congress's original intent, to ensure that Americans with \ndisabilities are protected from discrimination. So on behalf of Senator \nSpecter and myself, the Senate bill is S. 1881, and we encourage \nSenators to take a look at it. We hope we can get good bipartisan \nsupport, have our hearings on it this fall, and get this enacted as \nsoon as possible, probably early next year sometime.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10212-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 976, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the bill (H.R. 976) to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax relief for small \n     businesses, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the psalmist sang:\n\n       Out of the mouths of children and infants, You have \n     ordained strength.\n\n  Today we begin debate on a bill to renew and add strength to a \nprogram that helps children and infants, the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, known as SCHIP. CHIP works. Since the plan began 10 \nyears ago, CHIP, or the Children's Health Insurance Program, has cut \nthe number of children without health insurance by more than a third, \nmore than a third over the last 10 years.\n  Health insurance matters. Children with health coverage are more \nlikely to get the care they need when they need it; that is, if they \nhave health coverage. Because of SCHIP, millions of children get \ncheckups. They see doctors when they are sick. They get the \nprescriptive medicines they need.\n  Uninsured children suffer. Uninsured kids are less likely to get care \nfor sore throats, for earaches, and asthma. When care is delayed, small \nproblems can become big problems. Nearly half of uninsured children \nhave not had a checkup in the past year. Uninsured children are twice \nas likely to miss out on doctor visits or a checkup.\n  I think of a single mother from my home town of Helena, MT, who \nlearned that her son had epilepsy. When did she find out? She found out \nright after her son lost private health coverage. She checked into \nother health care plans but none covered the expensive medication her \nson needed. Plans called her son's epilepsy a preexisting condition.\n  Then a friend told her about CHIP. She applied, and she found out her \nson was eligible. Thanks to CHIP, this young man got the medications he \nneeded, and his mother got the peace of mind she deserved.\n  CHIP, again known as Children's Health Insurance Program, makes sense \nas an investment. A child who is healthy can go to school. A child who \nis healthy in school is more likely to do well. A child who does well \nin school is more likely to get a job. And people with jobs are less \nlikely to end up in jail or on public assistance.\n  Thus, CHIP helps Americans to compete. Ensuring that kids can have \nhealth insurance is an investment in America's future.\n  CHIP helps. CHIP helps more than 6 million children whose parents \nwork\n\n[[Page S10213]]\n\nbut cannot afford insurance on their own--6 million. These low-income \nworking families are not poor enough for Medicaid, and they are not \nrich enough to afford private health insurance. Ninety-one percent of \nchildren covered by CHIP live in families making less than twice the \npoverty level.\n  It is time to strengthen CHIP. Millions of children have no health \ninsurance. There are more kids without health insurance than there are \nkids in the first and second grades combined. Think of that: more kids \nwithout health insurance than there are kids in America in the first \nand second grades combined.\n  Americans overwhelmingly support getting their kids healthy, and the \nSenate will begin debate on a bill that will fulfil CHIP's promise to \nthe 6.6 million children now covered. And our bill will cover 3.2 \nmillion more children who are now uninsured. This bill is a good \ncompromise. It puts enough resources on the table to make a difference \nfor children. It keeps CHIP focused on kids, and it is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  We keep CHIP focused on kids. Childless adults who are covered today \nwill transition off the program. No new waivers will be allowed for \nCHIP coverage of childless adults. Coverage of low-income parents will \ntransition to separate block grants at a lower match rate. No new \nwaivers will be allowed for CHIP coverage of parents.\n  We build in flexibility. States will be able to designate CHIP funds \nto help families afford private coverage offered by employers or other \nsources.\n  We pay for what we do. When Congress created CHIP in 1997, we paid \nfor it with a cigarette tax. We continue that funding source. We \nincrease the Federal tax on cigarettes by 61 cents, and we make \nproportional increases for other tobacco products. Increasing the \ncigarette tax will also discourage smoking, particularly among teens. \nAnd that will be good for kids, too.\n  CHIP is the legacy of work by Senators of goodwill from across the \nspectrum. It is the legacy of work by Senators such as Chuck Grassley \nand Jay Rockefeller, Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy. This year, Senator \nGrassley and I worked with Senators Rockefeller and Hatch to craft a \nconsensus package that was the basis of the bill, the bill before us \ntoday.\n  The Finance Committee modified it and endorsed it with a strong 17-\nto-4 vote. I believe the committee has produced a bill of which the \nSenate can be proud. I thank my colleagues for their hard work, for \ntheir patience, and their commitment to getting something done.\n  CHIP is not new. CHIP is tried and it is true. It has worked \nsuccessfully for 10 years. And four out of five Americans would like to \nsee Congress add new funds to the program.\n  Now it is time for us to act. For the benefit of children and \ninfants, let's provide strength to the benefit of children. Let's \nexpand health care coverage, and for the benefit of children let's pass \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to one of the fathers of this \nprogram with whom I am very proud to have worked this last year, and \ndid yeoman's work, did a great job for kids and also his State of West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise with great pride today to \nspeak in support of the Children's Health Insurance Program--or CHIP--\nReauthorization Act of 2007, legislation I authored with Senators \nBaucus, Grassley and Hatch to provide health care to 4 million children \nin need. It is fitting that we are starting debate on CHIP \nreauthorization today because in less than 1 week--on Sunday, August 5, \n2007--we will be celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the date that \nthis landmark and widely successful program was signed into law. This \nall started out quite some time ago with John Chafee and myself and \nsome others, about 10 years ago. But there has been an intensity of \neffort led by Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member Grassley, myself, and \nOrrin Hatch over the last 3 months, meeting up to 2 hours a day, \nvirtually every day, our staff meeting around the clock to try to reach \nbipartisan consensus, which we have reached, all by giving up some and \nreaching accommodation.\n  I have to say I have a lot of pride in what we are doing today. But I \nhope we will fulfill our work in the Senate in the next few days. It is \ninteresting that Sunday, August 5, 2007, is the actual 10-year \nanniversary this program. As you know, it expires at the end of \nSeptember, in which case all children who now have health insurance \nunder this program--all of children, not only the new ones we are \nincluding, but all of them--would lose their health insurance.\n  This legislation is incredibly personal to me, if I may say so, \nbecause I spent 4 years chairing the National Commission on Children. \nIt was a long time ago. I swore I would try to honor the commission \nwith its very wide spectrum of American public officials and private \npeople, by getting our unanimous recommendations into law. And one of \nthem was, in fact, the Children's Health Insurance Program. So I do \nthat very carefully. I also do that with a certain personal emotional \nexperience.\n  When our oldest son was born, when he was 10 days old, he developed \nsomething called pyloric stenosis, which is called projectile vomiting, \nwhich means your stomach is not taking in food.\n  Because we had health insurance, and we could afford health \ninsurance--unlike the people of the chairman of the Finance Committee's \nbill that we are discussing. Because we could afford that health \ninsurance, we could take him down to the hospital. He had an operation, \nand he is doing fine. Otherwise he would have died. So that is partly \nwhat is inside of me during this debate.\n  As I think about this, I think in 1997 we were acting out of despair \nand frustration because of what was not happening for children. \nSometimes I think this body's best work comes at a point when we do \nreach genuine despair and frustration, when we cannot take it any more. \nWe are so aware of what we are not doing that we proceed to do it.\n  I think that is part of what is propelling us now. The Children's \nHealth Insurance Program is proven, as the chairman of the committee \nhas said. It works very well. In 2006, more than 6 million children \nwere enrolled and were receiving good benefits.\n  Together, CHIP and Medicaid have significantly increased children's \nhealth insurance. Even as the overall number of uninsured Americans who \nare not children have gone up, the number of insured children have \nremained steady and it even declined. In fact, between 1997 and 2005, \nCHIP and Medicaid reduced the percentage of children below 200 percent \nof poverty without health insurance by about one-third. More insured \nchildren, less uninsured because of the good work of this bill.\n  West Virginia, we have 39,000 children who are affected by this \nprogram. One can say that 39,000 is not very many, or one can say that \nis 39,000 lives that have been profoundly and intimately affected by \nall of this. Again, I am moved by that.\n  I started work as a Vista volunteer in West Virginia. I remember what \nit was like when kids did not get health care. And that feeling remains \nin me today as strongly as it did in 1964 when I went to West Virginia \nfor the first time. Anyway, the facts are not so good for everybody.\n  There is a wonderful 12-year-old boy named Deamonte Driver. His mom \nknows that feeling all too well. Her son lost his life because the \nMedicaid coverage lapsed for him, and a dental infection spread to his \nbrain and he died. That happens in America. It happens every single \nday. We do not notice it. But that is what we are here in this Chamber \nfor: to minimize that as much as we possibly can.\n  The bill before us today is $35 billion. That provides health \ninsurance coverage for 4 million low-income children who would \notherwise be uninsured. Let me repeat. They would be uninsured. Most of \nthem are already eligible for Medicaid or CHIP but not currently \ncovered, and that is at a cost of $35 billion over 5 years--not per \nyear but over 5 years.\n  As Peter Orszag, who is the very talented CBO Director, said this is \nthe most efficient possible way per new dollar spent to get reduction \nof roughly 4 million uninsured children.\n  Now, it was not easy to get to this point. It was very hard for me \nbecause I wanted a $50 billion program. It was in the budget mark for \n$50 billion.\n\n[[Page S10214]]\n\nThere are a lot of things we had to give up because we had to arrive at \na place where Republicans and Democrats could agree. As we met every \nafternoon for several hours in Chairman Baucus's office, we had to come \nto a point where Republicans who wanted $22 billion, or the President's \nprogram, or us, who wanted $50 billion, where we could ratchet it down \nso we could agree on something. So we agreed on the $35 million. That \nis where our chairman, Max Baucus, was a fearless leader. He and I have \nsort of agreed--I think we have all agreed--we are going to oppose any \namendment which enlarges this program, which would tend to make us \nhappier, or which would diminish the program, which would tend to make \nothers happier. We are going to oppose amendments. That is not a \ncomfortable thing to do. We don't offer enough dental in this bill for \nmy taste. But when somebody comes and says: I want more dental because \ndental is so important, because so many kids lose their teeth by the \ntime they are 14, 15-years-old, I will oppose that, because I want to \nkeep the integrity of this bill to make sure that 10 million children \nwho are at risk of no health insurance without CHIP get to keep their \nhealth insurance.\n\n  Our legislation passed the committee 17 to 4. The Finance Committee \nis a tough committee. Seventeen to four it passed; that is a huge vote. \nSo today is monumental.\n  The bill does basically three things. The bill eliminates the Federal \nCHIP shortfall so States could keep covering the 6.6 million kids they \ncover now. You remember the President reduced the budget from $15 \nbillion to $5 billion, so that would have taken effect. The increase in \nhealth care costs has also made things more difficult. So eliminating \nthe shortfalls restores CHIP coverage to 1.4 million children. Again, \n1.4 million is a lot of families, a lot of lives who would have lost \nCHIP and faced a lot of agony and a lot of people staying up at night \nlost in despair.\n  Secondly, it provides new Federal resources for States to cover 2.6 \nmillion children currently eligible for Medicaid or CHIP but not \nenrolled. They are out there, as eligible as anybody else, but they are \nnot enrolled because the money isn't there for them. We have sent $20 \nbillion to Saudi Arabia to do what they want, to buy arms. I keep \nasking: What if we were to do some of that here? What if we were to do \nthat on climate change? That is not the discussion of the afternoon so \nI won't pursue it, but our legislation includes 1.7 million who are \nMedicaid eligible, and 900,000 who are CHIP eligible. This 2-to-1 ratio \nmatches the ratio of uninsured Medicaid-eligible children to uninsured \nCHIP-eligible children.\n  And, third, this bill improves the predictability and stability of \nthe CHIP funding formula so that States can cover more children.\n  At the proper time, I will support my colleagues in strongly \nsupporting this bill, which is a start.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from West Virginia. \nBefore the former chairman speaks, I compliment him on his steadfast \nadvocacy for the members of his caucus and for the work for kids he has \ndemonstrated. He has a difficult job. He is standing up for his side of \nthe aisle. There was negotiation, innumerable meetings. I can't mention \nthe number of meetings we have had, there have been so many. At the \nsame time he has also worked for kids. I compliment him for working \nhard to accomplish both objectives.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee \nfor his kind words, and my kind words go to reemphasize the close \nworking relationship over a period of 6 years, now going into the \nseventh year, he and I have had being leaders of both the Republican \nand Democratic members of the Finance Committee. I thank him very much \nfor continuing that working relationship while he was chairman a few \nyears ago and now chairman again. That is why this committee produces \nlegislation that eventually gets to the President. I thank the Senator \nvery much.\n  The State Children's Health Insurance Program--and people watching \nwill hear the acronym SCHIP used often--is the product of a Republican-\nled Congress 10 years ago, 1997, and it is sunsetting this year. That \nis why we are here reauthorizing and bringing more kids into the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. It is very much a targeted program \ndesigned to provide affordable health coverage for low-income children \nof working families. These families make too much to qualify for \nMedicaid but struggle to afford private insurance if they can even get \nit. It is important that we reauthorize this targeted program for \nchildren. The Finance Committee bill proposes a reasonable approach for \nreauthorizing SCHIP that is the product of months of bipartisan work in \nthe committee. Chairman Baucus referred to innumerable meetings. We \ndon't keep track of the number of meetings we have, but for every \nmeeting Senator Baucus and I have been involved in, usually Senator \nHatch and Senator Rockefeller were there as well. In the meantime, \nincluding a lot of weekends of work, the staffs of the respective \nSenators were involved in negotiations to get us to the floor this day.\n  Once again, I emphasize what I heard Senator Rockefeller say. This is \na bipartisan bill voted out of committee on a vote of 17 to 4. It is a \ncompromise. I think it is the best of what is possible. Clearly Members \non the left would want to do more. My colleagues on the right want to \ndo less and go in a different direction. Neither got what they wanted. \nThat is pretty much the essence of a compromise, not only on SCHIP but \nthe essence of compromise in the Senate probably over two centuries of \nthe Senate's history.\n  This compromise bill maintains the focus on low-income, uninsured \nchildren and adds coverage of an additional 3.2 million low-income \nchildren.\n  Although I have been pleased with the bipartisan cooperation that led \nus to the substance of the bill, I can't say the same for the way in \nwhich the bill is now being debated on the floor. Without participation \nor consultation, the Democratic leadership decided to use a so-called \nshell revenue bill, the House small business tax relief bill, as a \nvehicle for debate. The Democratic leadership will correctly maintain \nthat the reason for this unusual maneuver is a strategic decision to \naccelerate a couple of procedural steps. That is nothing new in the \nSenate. You can't find fault with trying to shorten up the process \nbecause the Senate process is already long enough. But since there is \nno House-passed SCHIP revenue bill in the Senate now and not likely to \nbe one by the time the Senate debate ends this week, the Democratic \nleadership wants to take a shortcut now.\n  While I share the goals of completing Senate action on SCHIP and \ndoing it this week, I would rather not be debating a general tax bill. \nThis shortcut means, then, that it is legitimate for Members on both \nsides of the aisle to raise unrelated tax amendments. That was not the \nposture we took in committee. In fact, we discouraged that, and we got \nboth Republicans and Democrats to agree to voting this bill out as a \nhealth insurance bill and not as a general tax bill except for the \nprovisions that relate to tobacco. Of course, now we are on the floor. \nThe stage is set very differently.\n  When I found out about this maneuver from the Senate Republican \nleader, Mr. McConnell, I urged the Democratic leadership, through \nSenator Baucus, to reconsider. I feared this shortcut would only widen \nthe playing field for the first stages of the debate. Obviously, my \ncounsel was rejected. It is disappointing but so be it.\n  Despite my objections to this procedural maneuver, I do support the \nSenate Finance Committee bill and will have more to say about it after \nthe cloture vote this afternoon. In fact, I will have a lot to say \nabout it. I will have a lot to say about particularly people who \nbelieve we have gone too far. I want to make very clear that it would \nbe impossible to do what the President said he wanted to do under the \namount of money he wanted to put into this program, which was $5 \nbillion over what is presently being expended. Obviously, we are way \nabove that at $35 billion, but we were able to do what the President \nwanted to do and cover some more kids. I will go into details on that \nlater on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S10215]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 10 minutes to the chairman of the HELP Committee, \none of the fathers of the CHIP program, the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, many of the best ideas in public policy \nare the simplest. The Children's Health Insurance Program is based on \none simple and powerful idea--that all children deserve a healthy start \nin life, and that no parents should have to worry about whether they \ncan afford to take their child to the doctor when the child is sick. \nCHIP can make the difference between a child starting life burdened \nwith disease or a child who is healthy and ready to learn and grow.\n  I would like to begin by thanking my colleagues Senator Baucus, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hatch for their \ndedication to making sure that more of America's children have a start \nat a healthy life. They have worked diligently to reach the bipartisan \nbill that we have for us today. But I am not surprised by that.\n  Throughout the history of CHIP, Members on both sides of the aisle \nhave exercised true leadership and set politics aside to focus on the \nneeds of children. Senator Baucus, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator \nBaucus have long been advocates for the health and well-being of \nchildren and have been willing to work with those who shared that goal.\n  My old friend Senator Hatch and I worked together in 1997 to create \nthis program that was our shared vision for healthier future for \nAmerican children. This year, we have once again worked together to \nfind common ground on covering the children deserve decent, quality \nhealth care.\n  As we now consider the future of CHIP it is instructive to look back \non the history of the program and the circumstances in which it was \ncreated.\n  The enactment of Medicaid in 1965 brought decent health care to \nfamilies living in poverty, including children. But it became clearer \nand clearer as the years and the decades passed, that more and more \nchildren were unable to obtain health care because they lived in \nfamilies whose incomes were too high to qualify for Medicaid but too \nlow to afford health insurance.\n  Finally, in Massachusetts, in the 1990s we agreed that health care \ncoverage for children is a necessity and that action needed to be \ntaken. John McDonough, executive director of Health Care for All in \nMassachusetts, deserves much of the credit for what came next. His \npioneering work while he was in the Massachusetts Legislature on \nchildren's health care led to the passage in 1993 of the State's \nChildren's Medical Security Plan, which guaranteed quality health care \nto children in families ineligible for Medicaid and unable to afford \nhealth insurance.\n  A year later, Massachusetts expanded eligibility for Medicaid, and \nfinanced the expansion through a tobacco tax--the same approach we used \nsuccessfully a few years later for CHIP and the same approach that is \nproposed in the bill before us now.\n  Rhode Island and other States took similar action, and helped create \na nationwide demand for action by Congress to address the unmet needs \nof vast numbers of children for good health care.\n  In 1997, Congress acted on that call, and the result was CHIP. \nSenator Hatch and I worked together then--as we have this year--to \nfocus on guaranteeing health care to children who need it. Now in every \nState in America and in Puerto Rico, CHIP covers the services that give \nchildren a healthier start in life--well child care, vaccinations, \ndoctor visits, emergency services, and many others.\n  In its first year 1997, CHIP enrolled nearly a million children, and \nenrollment has grown ever since. An average of 4 million are now \ncovered each month, and 6 million are enrolled each year. As a result, \nin the past decade, the percentage of uninsured children has dropped \nfrom almost 23 percent in 1997 to 14 percent today. That reduction is \nsignificant, but it's obviously far from enough.\n  CHIP improves the overall quality of life for children fortunate \nenough to have its coverage, by allowing them to get the care they need \nwhen they need it. They are more likely to have a real doctor and a \nreal place to obtain care, and, their parents don't delay seeking care \nwhen their child needs it. Children on CHIP also have significantly \nmore access to preventive care.\n  Studies also show that CHIP helps to improve children's school \nperformance. When children are receiving the health care they need, \nthey do better academically, emotionally, physically and socially. CHIP \nhelps create children who will be better prepared to contribute to \nAmerica. CHIP all but eliminates the distressing racial and ethnic \nhealth disparities for the minority children who disproportionately \ndepend on it for their coverage.\n  CHIP's success is even more impressive and important when we realize \nthat more and more adults are losing their own insurance coverage, \nbecause employers reduce it or drop it entirely.\n  That's why organizations representing children, or the health care \nprofessionals who serve them, agree that preserving and strengthening \nCHIP is essential to children's health. The American Academy of \nPediatrics, First Focus, the American Medical Association, the National \nAssociation of Children's Hospitals and countless other organizations \ndedicated to children all strongly support CHIP.\n  A statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics puts it this way: \n``Enrollment in SCHIP is associated with improved access, continuity, \nand quality of care, and a reduction in racial/ethnic disparities. As \npediatricians, we see what happens when children don't receive \nnecessary health care services such as immunizations and well-child \nvisits. Their overall health suffers and expensive emergency room \nvisits increase.''\n  Today we are here to dedicate ourselves to carrying on the job begun \nby Congress ten years ago, and to make sure that the lifeline of CHIP \nis strengthened and extended to many more children.\n  Millions of children now eligible for CHIP or Medicaid are not \nenrolled in these programs. Of the nine million uninsured children, \nover two-thirds--more than 6 million--are already eligible for Medicaid \nor CHIP. These programs are there to help them, but these children are \nnot receiving that help either because their parents don't know about \nthe programs, or because of needless barriers to enrollment.\n  Think about that number--9 million children in the wealthiest and \nmost powerful nation on earth; 9 million children whose only family \ndoctor is the hospital emergency room; 9 million children at risk of \nblighted lives and early death because of illnesses that could easily \nbe treated if they have a regular source of medical care.\n  Nine million uninsured children in America isn't just wrong, it is \noutrageous. We need to change it as soon as possible.\n  We know where the Bush administration stands. The President's \nproposal for CHIP doesn't provide what is needed to cover children who \nare eligible but unenrolled. In fact, the President's proposal is $8 \nbillion less than what is needed simply to keep children now enrolled \nin CHIP from losing their current coverage--$8 billion short. To make \nmatters worse, the President has threatened to veto the Senate bill \nwhich does the job that needs to be done if we are serious about \nguaranteeing decent health care to children of working families across \nAmerica.\n  We can't rely on the administration to do what is needed. We in \nCongress have to step up to the plate and renew our commitment to CHIP. \nThat is why I am supporting the CHIP bill before us. It is a genuine \nbipartisan compromise. This bill provides coverage to 4 million \nchildren who would otherwise be uninsured.\n  It adjusts the financing structure of CHIP so that States that are \ncovering their children aren't forced to scramble for additional funds \nfrom year to year and so that Congress doesn't have to pass a new band-\naid every year to stop the persistent bleeding under the current \nprogram. Importantly, this bill will not allow States to keep their \nCHIP funds if they aren't doing something to actually cover children.\n  Equally important, this bill allows each State to cover children at \nincome levels that make sense for their state. The bill also supports \nquality improvement and better outreach and enrollment efforts for the \nprogram. It is a scandal that 6 million children today who are eligible \nfor the program are not enrolled in it.\n\n[[Page S10216]]\n\n  In sum, this bill moves us forward together, Republicans and \nDemocrats' to guarantee the children of America the health care they \nneed and deserve.\n  Our priority should be not merely to hold on to the gains of the \npast, but to see that all children have an access to decent coverage. \nFamilies with greater means should pay a fair share of the coverage. \nBut every parent in America should have the opportunity to meet the \nhealth care needs of their children.\n  Quality health for children isn't just an interesting option or a \nnice idea. It is not just something we wish we could do. It is an \nobligation. It is something we have to do, and it is something we can \ndo today. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure \nthis very important legislation is enacted.\n  I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee and Senators \nGrassley, Rockefeller, and Hatch, who are putting the children of \nAmerica first and reminding all of us of the responsibility we have for \nthe most vulnerable Americans, the children. They have, over a \nconsiderable period, fashioned legislation that will make an enormous \ndifference in not only the health of the neediest children but will \nalso reduce the increasing disparity in our Nation. We have tried to \nmake some progress in the area of education under the leadership of \nSenators Baucus, Grassley, Rockefeller, and Hatch. We are going to \nreduce another area of considerable disparity and that is among the \nneediest children in the Nation.\n  We are over the long term not only going to say we are going to have \na healthier Nation because we are going to invest in children and make \nsure they will get a healthy start for their future, we are going to be \na stronger nation because we are a healthier nation. Over a long period \nof time, this is obviously going to have important implications in \nterms of the quality of health not only of the children but of our \nNation.\n  This is an enormously important day in the Senate. I thank the \nleadership for giving this the kind of priority in these first weeks \nand months of a new Congress. Senator Reid had indicated this was a \nstrong priority. It is an example of where we have had strong \nleadership in our Finance Committee. We have had strong leadership in \nthe Budget Committee. There are scarce resources because of our \ninvolvement in Iraq, limited resources, but nonetheless, under the \nleadership of Senator Conrad and with the strong support of our \ncolleagues, we were able to get the commitment that we on this side of \nthe aisle and the other side, with those courageous Republicans, are \nsaying this is a matter of national priority. This is of national \nimportance. We are moving ahead. I thank all of those Senators.\n  Having listened in our caucus, a number of our colleagues have been \nstrong supporters of our leaders on the Finance Committee. I thank my \ncolleague and friend John Kerry, among others. I thank all of those for \nbringing us to where we are today.\n  This is an enormously important occasion. I welcome the opportunity \nto speak to it.\n  I want to go back over the period when we saw the fashioning of this \nlegislation a number of years ago. We have found this was just about \nthe time the country was dealing with the issue of the tobacco \nsettlement. There was a question about how we could use the resources \nthat were going to be gained from the settlement. There was a great \ndebate. Many in this body thought we ought to use it all for deficit \nreduction; we ought to give it back to the States and let them make the \ndecision. But there were a number of bipartisan Senators saying: No, \nlet's make sure that we develop what is an extremely important need, \nand that is health care for children. There was a recognition that in \n1965, with the passage of Medicaid legislation, we tried to take care--\nwe still don't include all the children who should be there--of the \npoorest of the poor children. We said at that time, as a matter of \nnational policy, that we as a country were going to give focus to the \nneediest in our country. It was the Medicaid program for the neediest, \nbut a special attention was given to children in the Medicaid \nprogram. That was matched with dedication and commitment in the \ndevelopment of a title I program to deal with education for the \nneediest children in our country. Those went along together, and we are \ncoming back to the point where we are doing that under these \ncircumstances. So this legislation is important, and I welcome the \nchance to say these words.\n\n  I wish to also point out, as others have pointed out, the area of \nneed. We know we are making a downpayment on the area of need, but we \nstill have a long way to go if we are serious about including all the \nchildren who are eligible. We need to take care of the neediest \nchildren in Medicaid.\n  But then we need to look at those in our economy who are working \nhard, playing by the rules but who cannot afford health care for their \nchildren. Those are the ones who are reaching $18,000 or $20,000, up to \n$35,000, $38,000, $40,000 a year, depending on what part of the country \nthey are in. We find out that those are the individuals and those are \nthe families who are the most hard-pressed in any event to afford \nhealth care. We know the cost of $8,000, $9,000 per family for health \ncare. We know the challenges those families are facing, and we know the \nincreasing number of those families who are being dropped from health \ninsurance.\n  This program was to try to build upon the Medicaid Program and then \nhave the CHIP program going, taking care of all children in this \ncountry, and to take care of working families--maybe the working poor \nbut, more accurately, working families--to make sure their children \nwere going to be attended to. This, I believe, is where this \nlegislation is targeted. These families are working hard. They are part \nof our American system. They are playing by the rules. But affording \nthat protection is not available to them. The CHIP program reaches out \nto them. Some can say: Well, this is an expensive program. I have \nlistened to all my colleagues. I have listened to Senator Wyden from \nthe State of Oregon speak eloquently about this issue. We need to \nremind ourselves this body is about trying to define priorities. What \nare the Nation's priorities? What is important to us? We are here to \ntry to give focus and attention and direction to the areas of greatest \nneed.\n  What our bipartisan leadership today is saying is the area of \ngreatest need is the children. In this case, the children are members \nof working families who are virtually unable to get that kind of focus \nand attention and coverage unless they have access to this program.\n  What are greater priorities than education and health care focused on \nour children? We still know there is more to be done. So I welcome this \nopportunity to speak. I wished to spend a little time speaking on this \nissue. I have referred to how this whole program has reduced health \ndisparities among children and also how it has reduced disparities on \nthe basis of race in our communities across the country. It was not \nfocused on that, but that was the unintended consequence. So this \nlegislation is a matter of enormous importance.\n  Finally, I would say, as to this program, if we are interested in \neducating the children of this country, we have to make sure the \nchildren can hear the teacher. We have to be able to make sure the \nchildren are going to be able to see the blackboard. We have to make \nsure the children have proper dental care. I commend, particularly, the \nefforts they have made in dental care for children in this program. It \nis not mandated, but there are resources here to encourage the \ndevelopment of these dental programs. We are all aware that dental \nplans are some of the first to leave. We have seen the number of \nchildren out there with deterioration of their teeth, with all kinds of \nconsequences. As we all read in the Washington Post not long ago, some \nchildren actually lost their lives.\n  So I thank those who have been a part of this process. I commend all \nof them. This is a very worthwhile effort. I am hopeful it will be very \nsuccessful.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I now recognize the chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee, Senator Conrad from North Dakota, for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee not only for this recognition but for his leadership in \nputting this\n\n[[Page S10217]]\n\nlegislation together. This has not been easy to do. It has been \nextraordinarily challenging. We wish to thank Senator Baucus, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, for his diligent effort and his \nadvocacy for this program. I also thank Senator Rockefeller of West \nVirginia for the extraordinary effort he has made with respect to \nextending children's health insurance in this Nation. I also recognize, \non the other side, Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley.\n  We are now debating legislation to reauthorize the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, otherwise known as CHIP. This is one place where we \nshould all be in agreement. To extend health care to our children has \nto be one of America's priorities. There is no greater moral obligation \nthan providing for the least among us, especially our children. We also \nknow providing health care for kids is a good investment because \nimproving their health early on is an investment paid for over a \nlifetime. You get the return for a lifetime.\n  The bipartisan Children's Health Insurance Program has been extremely \nsuccessful in getting kids covered and keeping them healthy. Experts \nacross the country agree. Here is what one health care expert had to \nsay about the Children's Health Insurance Program:\n\n       It is a simple idea: We invest in children's health care, \n     and we get healthy children eager to learn and grow,'' said \n     Dr. Rob Nordgren of Child Health Services of Manchester (New \n     Hampshire). . . . Nordgren said children who get good health \n     care, which begins early in life and continues without \n     interruption, are less likely to need expensive \n     interventions as adults.\n\n  What could be a simpler or more profound idea than that? You provide \nhealth care to children, and that is a gift that keeps on giving. It \nkeeps on returning on the investment through that child's lifetime. \nThis is a good investment.\n  There are 6.6 million children who now have health insurance because \nof the Children's Health Insurance Program. But 9 million children \nremain uninsured, and 6 million of these kids are eligible for the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program or Medicaid right now, but we do \nnot have the money to actually provide them the coverage. In this \nreauthorization, Congress simply needs to invest more to reach these \nkids.\n  But let's be clear. If we do not act, we are not only losing an \nopportunity to get more kids covered--if we freeze the current program, \nby 2012, there will be over 1.4 million fewer children covered simply \nbecause of a lack of funds.\n  Here are some facts about this bill.\n  First, it provides health insurance for 4 million more uninsured \nkids, children who would otherwise go without coverage. To bring it \ncloser to home, this bill will mean an increase in funding for North \nDakota to get more kids covered. In fact, North Dakota's allotment will \nalmost double, from about $7.7 million now to over $13 million next \nyear. This will allow the State to cover 1,450 more children over the \nnext two years.\n  Second, I think it is important to note this bill is fully paid for \nover 6 and 11 years. Therefore, it fully complies with pay-go. We have \nheard some other ideas here. As chairman of the Budget Committee, let \nme be clear, this bill fully meets its pay-go obligations. It also \nmeets the other requirements of the Children's Health Insurance Program \nreserve fund set out in the 2008 budget resolution that allows for the \nreserve fund adjustment.\n  Third, it is a 5-year reauthorization. Congress will reauthorize in \n2012 with new policies and with new offsets. Perhaps we will not even \nneed a Children's Health Care Insurance Program by then because perhaps \nby then we will have reformed the way we deliver health care in this \ncountry.\n  I believe the time is right to do that, and certainly in this next 5 \nyears, it will become more critical because we know we are on a course \nthat is absolutely unsustainable. So my own conviction is we will be \nreforming health care during this period.\n  Fourth, reauthorizing the children's health program could actually \nspur action on broader health care reform. It is wrong that our Nation \nhas over 40 million uninsured. We must do something to fix this \nproblem. Having SCHIP in place for this next 5 years will serve as a \nbridge to what we all hope will be a brighter day of fundamental health \ncare reform.\n  Now, let me conclude by saying, some have criticized this bill on \nbudgetary grounds. To the extent that funding levels in the outyears \nare lower, it simply means we will have to pay for these costs during \nthe next reauthorization. But that is the way it always works.\n  I have been stunned to hear some of my Republican colleagues complain \nthat this bill sunsets at the end of 5 years. They say: Well, if the \nprogram continues beyond that 5 years, there will be a cost in those \nsucceeding years. Well, of course that is true. But this bill is paid \nfor, for the next 5 years, unlike what they did on their enormous tax \ncuts.\n  Look at this slide I have in the Chamber that shows what they did. \nThese are the tax cuts, under current law, that they put in place, \nwithout paying for any of them, by the way. As shown on the chart, here \nis what it would cost to extend those tax cuts: $421 billion in 2017--\n$421 billion. That is shown on the chart. Here is what extending the \nCHIP program would cost by comparison. Do you see this little, tiny \nline at the bottom of the chart?\n  Now, our friends on the other side are complaining about that little \ngap. They say nothing about this yawning chasm created by them--$4.1 \ntrillion. They say nothing about that. But they complain about this \ntiny sliver to provide health care insurance for our kids. One has to \nask: What priorities are those?\n  Again, this SCHIP funding is paid for. Overall, this bill sets us on \na responsible path to get every child in America covered with health \ninsurance. Four million fewer children will be without health insurance \nas a result of this legislation. We should be proud of that.\n  It is not socialized medicine, as some have asserted. The Children's \nHealth Insurance Program and Medicaid are partnerships between States \nand the Federal Government. These programs use private doctors and \nprivate health plans to provide services. This is not socialized \nmedicine.\n  The children's health program is successful. It was created with \nstrong bipartisan support. Faith leaders, business groups, labor, \ninsurers, health providers all support this reauthorization proposal.\n  Partisan politics should not get in the way of providing health care \ninsurance for our kids. Goodness knows, if we cannot agree on anything \nelse on the floor of this body, we should be able to agree on providing \nhealth care insurance for our kids.\n  America's children are counting on us. They deserve our very best and \nthey deserve our support for this legislation. We cannot let them down. \nI hope all my colleagues are paying close attention to what is at \nstake. If they are, they will support this legislation.\n  Again, I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Baucus, for his \nleadership and his untiring efforts and Senator Rockefeller for, over \nand over, bringing the challenge of health care insurance for our kids \nto the attention not only of the committee but of the full Senate and \nof the country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon, a very valuable member of the committee and a tireless advocate \nfor good, solid health care.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I don't want to turn this into a bouquet-\ntossing contest, but I do want to single out the bipartisan quartet: \nChairman Baucus, Senator Rockefeller, who is here, Senator Grassley, \nand Senator Hatch. To carve out hours and hours, as the four of them \nhave day after day, is evidence of their commitment. I just want them \nto know I am very much aware we would not be here today advocating for \nAmerica's kids without their work and their effort to find common \nground. I wish to start the day by praising the four of them.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator will yield, I note the Senator from West \nVirginia is a very busy man and he could be doing other things, other \nmeetings, and so forth, but he has decided to stay on the floor during \nall debate on this bill, and I think that is a testament to how \nstrongly he is committed to getting this legislation passed, as well as \nthe Senator from Oregon. The two of you could be vying for\n\n[[Page S10218]]\n\nwho is an even stronger advocate for health care, and you both do a \ngood job.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank you and all four of you for your efforts.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me this is the opening bell of round one \nin the fight to fix health care in America. Fixing health care is the \npremier domestic issue of our time.\n  Suffice it to say we heard in the Senate Finance Committee and we \nhear on the floor of the Senate every day that the current health care \nsystem cannot be sustained. The costs are going up too dramatically. \nThe rapid growth of the elderly population is, of course, relentless, \nand the disadvantage our employers face every day competing in tough \nglobal markets cannot be sustained.\n  My sense is the challenge for the United States is twofold. One--and \nthis is embodied by what Senator Rockefeller, Senator Baucus, Senator \nHatch, and Senator Grassley are doing--is to meet the immediate needs \nof the most vulnerable Americans, immediately. It is obscene that \nmillions of youngsters, in a country as rich and strong and prosperous \nas ours, go to bed at night without decent health care. The bipartisan \neffort of these four Senators is moving to erase this moral blot on our \ncountry. I am proud to be supporting the four of them in this effort.\n  But as we move to tackle these immediate needs of the most vulnerable \nAmericans, let us also set about the task of trying to transform \nAmerican health care. Senator Bennett, a member of the Republican \nleadership, has joined me in this effort. We brought to the floor of \nthe Senate the first bipartisan health reform bill in more than 13 \nyears. As Senator Rockefeller knows, as we are both admirers of the \nlate John Chafee, his was the last, and Senator Bennett and I want to \nwork with colleagues to pick up on this effort. Senator Bennett and I \nhave tried to build on the bipartisanship embodied by Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Hatch, Senator Baucus, and Senator Grassley.\n  What we are saying is that you need something of an ideological truce \non health care in our country. I think my party has been right in \nsaying you have to get everybody covered. It is the moral thing to do. \nIf you don't do it, the people who are uninsured shift their bills to \nthe insured. But I think colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nhad a point as well in saying that you just can't turn everything over \nto Government, that there is a role for the private sector. So Senator \nBennett and I are trying to pick up on the prospect of an ideological \ntruce, just as Senators Rockefeller, Baucus, Grassley and Hatch have \ntried to do on the children's health program.\n  I can tell my colleagues, having served on the Senate Finance \nCommittee through the markup, and through those weeks and weeks of \ndiscussion, that what Senator Rockefeller and the other leaders of the \nFinance Committee had to do was a heavy lift. There are a lot of \ncolleagues on our side of the aisle who wanted to spend more. They were \ninterested in covering other groups of citizens. That was unacceptable \nto colleagues on the other side. So Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nBaucus had to swallow hard; they had to make concessions on points that \nwere important to them. That is what Senator Bennett and I are trying \nto do in terms of transforming American health care. So I am glad \nSenator Rockefeller and the group on the Finance Committee have brought \nus a bipartisan piece of legislation because it lays the groundwork, in \nmy view, for going further.\n  I have a word for the administration on this point in particular: I \nam very hopeful they will join the bipartisan effort here in the Senate \nto find common ground. We know this bill has a long way to go. It will \nbe considered by this body. The other body has other ideas with respect \nto how to tackle this issue.\n  I would say to the administration that there are a number of us on \nboth sides of the aisle who want to work with them on a broader piece \nof health legislation. But to get to that broader piece of health \nlegislation, you first have to deal with the needs of the children. In \nfact, in the budget resolution--and this has not been widely noticed--\nit specifically stipulates that the children's health program would \ncome first, before there was an effort to deal with heath issues in a \nbroader way.\n  Now, I share the view of the administration with respect to the Tax \nCode in health care. It is a mess. It is regressive. It \ndisproportionately rewards the most affluent in our society and \npromotes inefficiency at the same time. If you are a high-flying CEO, \nwith today's Tax Code, you can go out and get a designer smile put on \nyour face and write off the cost of every dime of that operation on \nyour taxes. But if you are a hard-working woman in West Virginia or \nOregon or elsewhere and your company doesn't have a health plan, you \ndon't get anything out of the Tax Code.\n\n  So I am supportive of working with the administration in a bipartisan \nway to fix the Tax Code as it relates to health care and to fix the \nprivate marketplace. But you don't get there until you first deal with \nthe needs of our children. So I want to be conciliatory, both with \nrespect to the administration and with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. We have a big opportunity with this issue.\n  With respect to domestic issues, one of the biggest ones--the \nimmigration legislation--obviously reached something of a standstill. \nIf we can sustain this bipartisan effort for the country's most \nvulnerable--and I know of no one in the Senate--no one--who doesn't \ncare about the well-being of our kids--if this effort can be sustained, \nthere will be a broad berth for another effort to move significantly to \ntransform American health care.\n  Seven members of the Senate Finance Committee, during our discussion \nof the children's health program, specifically talked about the need to \nfix American health care. Senator Conrad, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, pointed out that over the next 5 years--the life \nof this program--there will be plenty of opportunities to transform \nAmerican health care. Senator Bennett and I are saying we want to do it \nin this session. We don't think we got elected to wait around for \nanother 2, 3, 4 years to fix health care; we want to do it in this \nsession.\n  We had a very promising hearing in the Senate Budget Committee where \nsupport for our efforts was demonstrated by both the chairman of the \ncommittee and the ranking minority member. I wish to underscore that \neven the Senate budget resolution makes clear that this program for \nchildren will be done first. As Senator Baucus and Senator Rockefeller \npointed out earlier, this is a question of reauthorizing existing \nFederal law. The country has already made the judgment that the needs \nof children are going to come first. But a lot of us are not going to \nsay the job is done by passing one extremely important bill; that there \nwill be more to do, there will be an opportunity to do it in a \nbipartisan way.\n  While he is on the floor, I want to thank Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Grassley, and Senator Hatch.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I just want to use it to thank our colleagues who are the \nprincipal architects of the children's health program. Because of those \nof us who would like to go further in this Congress, the bipartisanship \nthe leaders of the Senate Finance Committee have shown is going to give \nus that kind of opportunity, if the administration will join this \nbipartisan effort as it goes through this body and the other body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the \nmanager of the bill.\n  I wanted to pick up on a point Senator Conrad made briefly. I want to \nget this so clear at the beginning of this whole amendment debate and \nwhatever debate follows: The whole concept that somehow this Children's \nHealth Insurance Program is a Government-run health care program--is \nwrong. Throw that out. It is completely and totally wrong. It is not \neven an entitlement program. It is a capped block grant program to the\n\n[[Page S10219]]\n\nStates. It is optional. The States don't have to use it if they don't \nwant to. All of them do, including the District of Columbia, but it is \noptional.\n  In virtually all cases, the CHIP programs as they are carried out by \nthe States are funded through private insurance, very much the way it \nwas done in the Medicare prescription drug benefit plan. Thirty-nine \nStates only use private insurance. It has nothing to do with the \nGovernment-run health insurance program. It is health insurance under \nthe private sector using insurance companies, private insurance \ncompanies.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I notice Senator Dole on the floor. I \ndon't know if she wishes to speak on this measure. I see Senator \nGrassley is not on the floor, but I, on behalf of Senator Grassley, \nwill yield such time as the Senator would like to consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I am perplexed by what is happening in the \nSenate these days. Many of my colleagues are calling for a huge tax on \ntobacco--a product purchased disproportionately more by lower income \npeople. This tax hike is said to provide billions of dollars to expand \nSCHIP health care coverage for children whose families cannot afford \ninsurance coverage. While I strongly support reauthorizing SCHIP, a \nmassive and highly regressive tax increase on an already unstable \nproduct is a terribly irresponsible way to fund this important program. \nFurthermore, my home State of North Carolina, which has lost more \nmanufacturing jobs than any other State and continues to undergo a \ndifficult economic transition, stands to lose tremendously if the \ntobacco tax skyrockets.\n  I am fully aware that many of my colleagues view ganging up on \ntobacco and smokers as politically popular. I am not appealing to you \nto change your views on smoking, but I am urging you to acknowledge the \nreality that this tax increase is an irresponsible and fiscally unsound \npolicy.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, no other Federal tax hurts the poor \nmore than the cigarette tax. Of the 20 percent of the adult population \nthat smokes, around half are in families earning less than 200 percent \nof the Federal poverty level. In other words, many of the families \nSCHIP is meant to help will be disproportionately hit by the Senate's \nproposed tax hike. In addition, tobacco sales have been declining 2 to \n3 percent a year and are expected to be slashed by another 6 percent if \nthe Federal excise tax is increased. Yet in order for this tax-hike \ntrick to work, millions more Americans would have to actually take up \nsmoking to foot the bill.\n  A recent ad in Roll Call from North Carolina-based R.J. Reynolds put \nit best:\n\n       Below that familiar picture of Uncle Sam pointing his \n     finger, was the line ``Congress Needs you to Smoke.''\n\n  That is right. More than 22 million additional Americans will need to \ntake up smoking to keep the SCHIP program running over the next decade.\n  Another example of how ill-conceived this proposal is: The Senate \nvery well may approve legislation this year to force the FDA to \nregulate tobacco products.\n  That agency's staff and resources are already fully consumed by its \nmission of regulating food, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals. But \nif many in the Senate have their way, the FDA will soon take on \ntobacco.\n  It is no secret that the Senate FDA bill seeks to ultimately put many \ntobacco companies out of business. So it appears we are going to \neliminate tobacco companies while simultaneously relying on the tax \nrevenue from tobacco sales to fund children's health care.\n  If we are really serious about providing health care coverage to \nchildren in lower income families, this illogical plan clearly is not \ngoing to cut it. I oppose this tax hike plan not only because it is \nfiscally unsound but also because it unfairly hurts my State of North \nCarolina.\n  In recent years, the forces of the global marketplace have triggered \na difficult economic transformation, and our traditional industries of \nfurniture and textiles have shuttered the doors of their factories and \nmills, resulting in the loss of 194,000 manufacturing jobs. Tobacco, \nanother long-time linchpin of North Carolina's prosperity, has also \nfaced its share of challenges from offshore competition. However, this \neconomic engine for North Carolina has endured, but it may collapse \naltogether if the Senate moves forward with the 61-cent increase on \ntobacco products.\n  Tobacco is woven into the fabric of my State like Texas and cattle or \nIowa and corn. In North Carolina, tobacco is part of our history and \nculture. In fact, many of our State's great educational institutions \nand health care facilities are rooted in tobacco funding. Today, more \nthan 255,000 North Carolinians rely on tobacco for their livelihood. \nThese are not just folks in the fields and factories but also suppliers \nand retailers. The industry accounts for $22 billion in value-added \nrevenue, or 6 percent of North Carolina's economic activity.\n  Clearly, if the Senate indiscriminately picks this industry to foot \nthe bill for additional Government spending, North Carolina suffers \ntremendously. According to Blake Brown, a widely respected agricultural \neconomist at North Carolina State University, North Carolina would lose \nnearly $16 million in farm production and at least $540 million in \ndecreased manufacturing; we would lose up to $12.5 million in the State \ncigarette tax revenue; and we would lose $10.3 million from our portion \nof the master settlement agreement payment, which funds the bulk of our \nsafe economic development programs.\n  In addition to North Carolina losing thousands of manufacturing jobs, \nsupplier and retail jobs, State Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler \nsays we could lose as many as 1,800 farm jobs. Compound these jobs and \nrevenue losses with the looming threat of FDA regulation, and North \nCarolina is looking at what Commissioner Troxler calls a double whammy.\n  The rug is being pulled out from under us. Am I supposed to go back \nto my constituents, whose jobs are at stake, and say: Sorry, folks, \nCongress doesn't think you are taxed enough, so, yes, Congress raised \ntaxes to the tune of $35 billion at the expense of your jobs and farms? \nNo single industry should be targeted and victimized by such \nunreasonable Federal regulations and taxes.\n  Let me be clear. Reauthorizing SCHIP has my strongest support. Since \nits creation in 1997, this program has lowered the number of uninsured \nchildren by almost 25 percent. As we seek to provide greater access to \nhealth care for all Americans, starting with children first is not only \ngood policy but it is the right thing to do. However, this legislation \nis the wrong way to go, period.\n  I urge Senators to vote for the McConnell alternative. It responsibly \nrestores SCHIP to its original content: helping low-income children. I \nam not asking my colleagues to sympathize with the tobacco industry and \nsmokers. I am asking you to look at the Baucus bill for what it is: a \nmassive tax hike that disproportionately impacts low-income people and \nan ill-conceived and unsound plan that unfairly targets a single \nindustry and hurts the economy of several States.\n  Let's reauthorize SCHIP, but let's do it the right way.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to reserve time for Senators to \nspeak. I ask unanimous consent that the following time be reserved for \nthese Senators: Casey, 5 minutes; Stabenow, 5 minutes; Whitehouse, 5 \nminutes; Bingaman, 5 minutes; and myself, the remaining 5 minutes. I \nthink that totals 25. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 24 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Then I will cut myself down to 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Casey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n[[Page S10220]]\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Baucus, my distinguished \ncolleague from Montana, for not only the argument he is putting forth \ntoday on children's health insurance but in a special way his \nleadership on the Finance Committee.\n  On the question of children's health insurance, the Senate is \nconfronted with a very serious matter, a matter that has long-term \nimplications for millions of families and our economic security. I \nbelieve at least two questions must be asked and answered this week, \nand they are as follows:\n  Question 1: Will the Senate make a full commitment to the children of \nAmerica and especially to their health care?\n  Secondly, does the Senate want America to have a high-skilled \nworkforce in the future to compete in an ever-changing economy and a \nfuriously competitive world economy?\n  For that reason and so many others, I thank the Senators in this \nChamber who have provided the leadership on the Finance Committee, \nincluding Senator Rockefeller, Senator Baucus and, many years ago, \nSenators Kennedy and Hatch, who came together in a bipartisan way, as \nthey are today, and Senator Grassley, among others.\n  A lot of people watching today may ask what is this program we are \ntalking about? We hear SCHIP, the acronym. Let's call it children's \nhealth insurance for short because the acronyms don't make a lot of \nsense sometimes. It is a 10-year program, where we have covered 6.6 \nmillion children, so they can have well-child visits, dental exams, \npreventive care, all of the things we see on this chart, when we are \nspeaking about a well-child visit. Every child in America should have \nan opportunity to communicate, through their parents, with their \nphysician. Every family should make sure that a child within their care \ngets six visits to the doctor in the first year of life, a complete \nrecord of physical exams, showing height, weight, and other milestones. \nThey should have their hearing and vision checked. They should be \nchecked for normal development, nutrition, sleep safety, infectious \ndiseases and, of course, general preventive care. It is critically \nimportant that every child gets that, no matter what their income is or \nwhere they live in this country.\n\n  In Pennsylvania, we have had more than a 10-year experiment; we have \nhad children's health insurance since 1993. I am proud that my father, \nGovernor Casey, and every succeeding Governor, including Republican \nGovernors Ridge and Schweiker, and Governor Rendell, a Democrat, who \nstrongly supported it and tried to expand this important program.\n  Today, I wish to talk for a couple of minutes about the coverage \noverall across the country. In our State, it is 162,000 children. But \nacross the country, even though we have covered well more than 6 \nmillion children, there are still 9 million American children today who \nhave no health insurance at all. Of those 9 million, 6 million of them \nare eligible right now for either the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram or Medicaid. Of those 6 million eligible but not enrolled, 78 \npercent are from working families. Let me say that again: Seventy-eight \npercent of the children right now who are eligible for children's \nhealth insurance or Medicaid are from working families. We should \nremember that as we debate this issue. There is a lot of talk in this \nChamber that has been misleading on that question.\n  We know what happens when a child has health insurance. They have \naccess to preventive care, they perform better at school, and they are \nmuch more likely to have healthy emotional and social development. If \nwe want--as I think every Member of the Senate wants--a skilled \nworkforce in the future, that starts with giving quality early care and \neducation to our children, giving them the blessing of health insurance \nso they can learn more now and earn more in this new century.\n  There are people out there saying: How do we pay for this? You are \ntalking about an increase in children's health insurance. We pay for it \nby making sure we are increasing a tax that should be increased for \nthis purpose--the tobacco tax--by 61 cents. We are going to have a long \ndebate, and I will wrap up in a minute. When we have this debate today \nand in the next couple of days of this week, and when people come down \nto the Senate floor and talk about how much it is going to cost and why \nwe should not do this, I ask them--especially those arguing against an \nincrease--to hold up this pamphlet. This is the health care every \nSenator gets. They come in here and talk against this program and say \nthey don't want to increase it. But I think every Senator who argues \nagainst it and says health care for Senators is a higher priority than \nhealth care for kids should hold up the health care they get, and they \nshould thank the American people, and then they can go argue against \nthis.\n  We have a long debate ahead of us. We will make sure that we make \nthis a priority for the American people, the health care of our \nchildren.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator can speak longer if he wishes. He is very \npassionate. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes for the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. My colleague from Montana gave me a lot more time and I \nappreciate that.\n  I think it is important that we talk about this program and talk \nabout why some of the arguments have been framed and how they have been \nframed in the last couple of days. We have had a lot of bipartisanship \nhere. A lot of Members of the Republican caucus in the Senate have been \nbrave and independent enough and have focused on the needs of children \nenough to break with the President to say that we respect your view, \nMr. President, but we have to expand this program.\n  I appreciate that. I am grateful for their wisdom and leadership and \ntheir integrity. They have shown an ability, and both sides have to \nwork together on this, to make sure that when we talk about the cost of \nthis program--the President thinks we should only increase it by $1 \nbillion a year, when there is a consensus across the country, by far, \nand in this Chamber and across the way in the House to increase it by \nat least $7 billion a year. That is the least we should do. I think we \ncan go higher, but to get the job done we can compromise.\n  I think it is very important to remember when we are talking about \nthese numbers, one thing is abundantly clear: The President's proposal \nis going to have one dramatic and irreversible impact for children, and \nthis is a fact: By 2012, if President Bush gets his way on this issue, \n800,000 American children will lose their health insurance. So I want \nthose on the other side of the aisle who have not yet come around to \nthe thinking of most of the Members of the Senate to remember that. You \nare just not voting for an increase that may help some children; you \nare voting to cut 800,000 children off of health insurance. I know we \nare going to hear from some Members of the Senate that terminology \nabout socialized medicine and Government-run health care and all of \nthat.\n  I ask them again to remember the health care they get as Senators \nwhen they go on about that point. The facts are otherwise when it comes \nto what we are talking about. For the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram and for Medicaid beneficiaries, these are individuals who are \ncovered through private managed-care plans, private insurance. In \nPennsylvania, we have some nine private providers for the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. I defy anyone to tell us these American \ncompanies are part of some Government-run program they do not support.\n  The support on this issue is overwhelming. The American Medical \nAssociation, all of the pharmaceutical companies virtually have not \nonly supported it but they are advertising in favor of it, and the \nprivate insurance companies and trade associations and so many other \nmajor American companies.\n  President Bush said he did not want to federalize this program. I \ndon't understand it, though, because on the one hand, President Bush \nsays he agrees the program has worked, and on the other hand he says he \nwants to cap it. I don't understand why he does that.\n  I think it is important for us to remember the benefits all of us \nhave in this Chamber at this time on our own health insurance.\n\n[[Page S10221]]\n\n  We are going to have a lot more time later this week to talk about \nother aspects of this legislation. I ask every parent out there who is \nwatching this debate to remember for just a moment what happens to \ntheir child when they are sick and when they are hurt. Your first \ninstinct is to hug your child and to give them all the warmth and \nsupport that you can provide them. But that is not enough. Often you \nhave to take them to a doctor or to a hospital. But for the parents of \nchildren who don't have health insurance, all of the love they provide, \nthe warmth and embrace of a hug is not enough either, and those \nfamilies and those mothers and fathers are powerless to help their \nchildren and show the full measure of their love.\n  I ask my colleagues and those watching today to consider what this \nmeans for a child and his or her family and also what it means for \nAmerica, for our workforce, and for our economy in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Stabenow now be \nrecognized to speak for 5 minutes, a very valuable member of our \ncommittee, very active member of our committee, and a fountain of \nideas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I first thank our chairman of the \ncommittee for his passion in caring for children, always keeping us \nfocused as we brought together a bill that truly is a compromise in the \nbest sense of the word. It is as we should be doing in the Senate, \ncoming together with a number of perspectives and coming up with a \nfinal product. I thank the chairman for leading us in that effort and \nworking with the ranking member. Together they have been a great team \non this legislation.\n  The chairman has constantly said to us: It is about the children. It \nis about the children. Keeping us focused on what this is really about \nwill allow us to come together in a very strong bipartisan vote for a \nvery important bill.\n  I also thank Senator Rockefeller for his passion in caring about \nchildren and his leadership in creating the children's health program. \nHe and Senator Hatch have been a critical part of getting us to this \npoint as well.\n  This is a step forward, and as with any compromise, it always \ninvolves give and take. I come from a State that has received 1 of the \n15 waivers to cover some adults in our State. That is being phased out. \nThat is not my first preference, but it is a compromise. It is a way to \nrecognize this is a children's health program, and we are all coming \ntogether and coming to the middle to work together to get a product \nthat the vast majority of the Senate can support.\n  We are talking about a program for uninsured children, 78 percent of \nwhom live in working families. So we are talking about moms and dads \nwho are working one minimum wage job, maybe two, maybe three to make \nends meet. We have helped that family by passing an increase in the \nminimum wage.\n\n  This second piece for families who are working very hard, who care \nabout their families and want to make sure their children have the \nhealth care they need, is very critical to supporting working families. \nThat is really what the Children's Health Insurance Program is all \nabout.\n  In Michigan, according to the University of Michigan, the number of \nuninsured children in our State grew by 7 percent just in 4 years, \nbetween 2000 and 2004. At the same time, we have seen employer-based \ncoverage cut back and more and more families paying more and more of \nthe health care bill and more and more families, as well, relying on \nMedicaid.\n  Last year in Michigan, MIChild, which is the children's health \nprogram, one-third of the children relied on MIChild or Medicaid for \nhealth coverage. One-third of all the children in Michigan in a State \nof 9 million people were relying on the support of this program and \nother public programs under Medicaid to have the health care they need. \nAgain, three-quarters of these children came from a home with at least \none working parent. So this is very much a program for families who are \nworking hard to make ends meet, families who go to bed at night and \ndon't want to have to say a prayer that their kids don't get sick \nduring the night or the next day. This allows families to have the \nintegrity of work and know that their children are able to receive the \ncare they need.\n  It is also very important to point out the fact that this is very \nmuch about rural families in Michigan and around the country, not just \nurban families. Certainly, we care about urban children, but we know \nthat in Michigan, the fact is, the majority of dollars are going to \nrural communities. Thirty-two percent of all rural children receive our \nchildren's health care program or Medicaid, 32 percent as compared to \n26 percent. So this is very important for children in every part of \nMichigan, as well as the country.\n  Because of the importance of the children's health program for so \nmany families, I urge my colleagues not to listen to the negative \nattacks on this carefully crafted compromise as we move forward.\n  There are always challenges drafting a standard 5-year \nreauthorization and fitting it into a budget window. In this Congress, \nwe have or will address several other 5-year reauthorizations: the farm \nbill, FDA prescription drug user fees, the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nAct, and the ``Leave No Child Behind'' education bill.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I remind my colleagues of the \nproblems in advancing the administration's proposal for reauthorizing \nthe children's health program. The Senate, in a bipartisan vote, \nrejected this proposal.\n  The President's fiscal year 2008 budget proposed less than half of \nthe funding needed for states to cover existing children, let alone to \nmake progress in covering more uninsured low-income children.\n  This would be a step backwards for our children. Under the \nPresident's budget, the number of States facing shortfalls in 2012 \nwould increase to 46.\n  Enrollment of children and pregnant women over the course of a year \nwould fall by 1.6 million by 2012.\n  This is not acceptable. We have a chance before us to make a real \ndifference in the lives of millions of children, many of whom are in \nworking families.\n  We all made compromises on moving CHIP forward. For example, I want \nto work out something that keeps my State whole, but I recognize the \nneed to continue to work in the bipartisan spirit that created CHIP in \nthe first place.\n  I know some of my colleagues want to debate a whole other set of \noptions. We should have a full debate on health care, but this is the \nopportunity to cover more children.\n  We are eager to tackle many pressing issues, especially a plan for \nsmall businesses. But the Children's Health Insurance Program expires \nat the end of September. Right now, we must focus our energy on \nreauthorizing this successful program.\n  Let us remember the bipartisan spirit that created this great program \nfor our Nation's children. CHIP is a great success story that we can \nall be proud of.\n  I know my time is up, my short 5 minutes are up. I again urge all my \ncolleagues to join us in what truly is a wonderful, bipartisan effort \nto cover children with health care in the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on \nour side be reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I first wish to pay tribute to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee and the distinguished \nranking\n\n[[Page S10222]]\n\nmember and Senator Rockefeller, Senator Snowe--so many people--Senator \nKennedy, others on the committee, Senator Stabenow, Senator Wyden, \nfolks on our side who have really stood up on this issue, the CHIP \nissue, Senator Snowe in particular, Senator Smith--I could go right on \ndown the line--Senator Roberts who has been a stalwart. I don't want to \nleave anybody out.\n  This has been the result of tremendous negotiations over a long \nperiod of time, meeting virtually every day, led by the distinguished \nchairman of the committee. We have lots of issues, lots of \ndifficulties, lots of past experience, mistakes that were made by the \nadministration that have caused us a lot of problems, and yet a desire \non the part of virtually everybody to try and do what is right for our \nchildren who basically are not being helped by our current health care \nsystem.\n  As we know, the CHIP bill works remarkably well. Hardly anybody I \nknow has found fault with the way it has operated. The big problem is \nthat we spent $40 billion over the 10-year authorization of CHIP, from \n1997 to today, and it expires this September. But the costs of trying \nto bring on the additional kids who qualify to this program and the \nextra costs that have been caused by the administration issuing \nwaivers, which has resulted in at least one or two States having more \nadults on the program than children, has caused some difficulties. We \nthink we have resolved some of those problems, and we hope the vast \nmajority of Senators will recognize that and vote for this bill.\n  We know the House bill is going to be off-the-charts expensive. \nFrankly, this is the bill people ought to look at, they ought to \nsupport, and I believe we ought to support wholeheartedly because we \nare trying to help the children of this country who are the least \nlikely to be helped because they do not vote.\n  The CHIP bill has helped millions of children, there is no question \nabout it. It was originally decided to help the children of the working \npoor who were the only kids left out of the process. The poor children \nwere helped by Medicaid, and, of course, those in the middle class or \nabove were able to afford their own health insurance. But these kids \nwere left out of the program and, of course, left out of basic health \ncare. We have been able to resolve many of those difficulties through \nthe original CHIP program. In this program, we will do away with \nwaivers. We can't do away with some of the grandfathered people who are \non CHIP right now, but we will get childless adults out of the program, \nand we will bring into the program pregnant women, which we did not do \nbefore.\n\n  When we did the original CHIP bill, I was against bringing them in \nbecause of the high cost of the bill at that time. That bill cost $40 \nbillion over 10 years. This bill will cost $60 billion over 5. But the \nreason for the original cost happened to be not only inflation, but \nalso the outreach programs that were included, and the fact that we \nweren't covering upwards of 3 million children. Some estimate even more \nunder the original CHIP program.\n  My personal belief is, if we cover these children properly, we will \nsave billions of dollars in the long run. We will save more than what \nit costs us to take care of these kids. But even if we didn't, we still \nought to be taking care of these children who basically are not \nproblems to society but can be great contributors to society if they \nare healthy. If we don't take care of them while they are in their \nyouth, it is very likely they will not be as healthy as they otherwise \nwould be and, in the end, they would cost more money than if we had \nfaced the music and done what is right now. That is why this CHIP bill \nis so important.\n  Again, I want to compliment and thank all of those who have \nparticipated in bringing this bill about.\n  Mr. President, I understand Senator Lott wants to speak at 4:30. I \nhave another set of remarks I would like to make. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe under the agreements that have \nbeen worked out I am going to speak at this time with regard to the \nSCHIP issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me first emphasize that we will have a \nmotion to proceed to the State Children's Health Insurance Program this \nafternoon, and Republicans and Democrats will vote for that procedural \nmotion to go forward because all of us support reauthorization of the \nso-called SCHIP program, which is Washington speak for State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program.\n  This is a classic example of how no good deed goes unpunished because \nI remember when this program was developed legislatively on the Senate \nfloor. The Senator from Utah was a key player. I remember some of the \nexchanges that were made at the time with Senator Hatch talking and \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Phil Gramm when we created this program. \nThis was about, I guess, 10 years ago or so. We created it because we \ndid believe there was a need in America for children to have health \nassistance--a health insurance program--particularly low-income \nchildren.\n  There were a large number of children who were not then covered, so \nit was well intentioned, and everybody wanted to go forward with a \nprogram that would cover these children so their health needs could be \naddressed and so they could live healthier lives.\n  I just heard Senator Hatch make the point that if we don't have this \ntype of health insurance available for children in critical times, a \nlonger term cost will greatly exceed what the cost might be for the \nprogram at this time. So we were in it together. We created it at a \ntime when we had a Republican majority in the Congress and a Democratic \nPresident in the White House. It was generally a bipartisan effort, and \nwe created a good program that was targeted. It was expensive, but we \nbelieved it was important that we get this done.\n  Now, since that time, this program has continued to grow, and we have \nseen States start adding not only higher and higher levels of income \nfor these children to be covered--up now to, I think, 350 percent of \npoverty in some States, and another State now is actually trying to get \nit up to 400 percent of poverty, which certainly is not low-income \nchildren. That is middle-income coverage. That would cover children in \nthe range of a family of three making $60,000 to $70,000 a year. So \nthat has really started causing problems, with the higher and higher \nlevel of income for children and adults being included. That was never \nthe intent.\n  The core mission of this program was for children to get this help, \nbut more and more States have included adults, and not just the \npregnant mother but the parents and even adults beyond that in some of \nthese States that have gotten waivers. It is going to be argued by some \nSenators, Senator Grassley and probably Senator Baucus, that a lot of \nthis problem has been caused by this administration--probably the \nprevious administration but certainly this administration--by giving \nwaivers to the States to begin to cover a higher and higher income \nlevel of children and adults. That is a legitimate criticism. They \nshouldn't have done it, and they shouldn't have done it the way they \ndid. And certainly they shouldn't have done it repeatedly. I don't know \nhow many States have gotten waivers now--14, 16 States, something of \nthat nature, and more to come probably.\n  Some people at the Department of HHS will say: Well, we don't have \nmuch discretion under the waiver. I don't believe that is true, and \ncertainly they had more discretion than they exercised. So the program \nnow, with these waivers, has got lots of problems, and that is why I \noppose it in its current form.\n\n  Let me first talk about the Baucus bill and give the reasons I am \nopposed to it. The baseline for this children's health program is $25 \nbillion over 5 years--$25 billion. I believe the President, and these \nare general numbers, but I think the President asked for basically a $5 \nbillion increase over those 5 years, which would have brought it up to \nthe $30 billion range. I was thinking in committee that was not enough;\n\n[[Page S10223]]\n\nthat we were going to have to go higher so that we could try to cover \nthose children now covered in the program, realizing some who would be \neligible are not covered because, No. 1, they may not have applied, No. \n2, they are covered by private insurance, and No. 3, they were covered \nby Medicaid. But it was clear to me it was going to take more money in \norder to cover the children we really intended to cover than the basic \nof $25 billion.\n  Now, I thought we were going to be talking in the range of $7 billion \nor $8 billion, and I still believe that is the right number to continue \nto cover those children who are now covered by the program. The bill we \nhave before us, though, has risen by $35 billion above the so-called \nbaseline for a total of $60 billion over 5 years--$60 billion. A \nprogram that was originally intended for low-income children to get \nthis health insurance, certainly never intended to be $25 billion, now \nin this bill would be $60 billion over 5 years, and explosive in the \noutyears. And this is before we go to conference with the House. The \nHouse is talking $70 billion to $100 billion.\n  So even though one might say: Well, this bill has gone way too far, \nthis is the new baseline, if we pass it at $60 billion, it will only go \nup. What will it be, $70 billion, $80 billion, $90 billion for this \nprogram--only for this program? And by the way, a program that will \ninclude adults and will include children probably certainly well above \n200 percent of poverty.\n  That is why we have an alternative that will make sure we cover those \nchildren we originally intended to cover and children now under the \nprogram, but we did not want this sort of doubling of the size of the \nprogram in the next 5 years. Ours would even provide for a 33-percent \nincrease over the next 5 years. We have a real problem. It is a massive \nspending increase. It uses certain budget considerations to deal with \nwhat happens after the fifth year.\n  Some people say: Well, there will be time to change that. But nobody \nreally believes that once you build a program, like this chart shows, \nthat goes up, up, and up, and then all of a sudden when it reaches a \ncertain level, it drops back down. It won't do that. It will continue \nto go up. And therein is the second part of the problem.\n  How do you pay for this? The bill before us has tax increases in the \n$61 billion to $70 billion range. I believe that is accurate, but a \nminimum of $61 billion, with that coming from a tax on cigarettes and \nother tobacco products. The fact is, when you tax something with that \nmuch of an increase, which takes it up to a full dollar from the \ncurrent 39 cents, that is a huge increase. When you have that kind of \nincrease, a dollar a pack on cigarettes, what you are going to get is \nless revenue. So at a time when the cost of the program is going up, \nthe revenue that is actually going to be coming in is going down. That \nis a prescription for huge budget problems.\n  Of course, the argument again is, well, that is down the road; we \nwill have time to fix that later on. But one of my concerns about the \nprogram as it is now is that it also will actually be taking children \nnow on private insurance--children who have coverage--and they will be \ngoing off private insurance coverage and going into the so-called SCHIP \nprogram. There are an estimated 600,000 children--and I don't know how \nyou estimate those numbers, which I suspect are low--but a large number \nof kids, up to perhaps as many as 2.1 million, will be moved from \nprivate health insurance programs to the Government-run health care \nprogram.\n  So here we have a massive spending increase, we have a program that \nwill be taking children now covered off of private insurance and moving \nthem on to a government program, and you have a massive tax increase.\n  We will have an alternative that reauthorizes the program, keeps it \nfocused on the core mission of low-income children, which does increase \nfunding generously, by as much as 33 percent, and avoids the huge tax \nincrease. And the revenue it brings in is real, not a revenue that will \nbe on a declining basis. It will give, additionally, millions of \nAmericans access to health insurance through the small business health \nplans and includes reforms in the health savings accounts.\n  Mr. President, I know we have a number of Senators lined up to speak, \nbut I just wanted to begin to point out some of the basic problems of \nhow we got here, what is in this bill, and the fact that we will have \nan alternative that I believe is better than the one that was reported \nby the Finance Committee.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, are we under controlled time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator from Iowa on the minority \nside controls 40 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield myself 10 minutes of my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 10 years ago a Republican-controlled \nCongress created and passed the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. It targets the health care needs of poor children whose \nfamilies make too much to be eligible for Medicaid but are still in \ndanger of not being able to afford private health insurance.\n  In many ways, this program, SCHIP, is a remarkable success. The rate \nof children in America living without health insurance dropped 25 \npercent from 1996 to 2005. Last year, 6.6 million children had health \ncare coverage thanks to SCHIP, including more than 50,000 in the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky. Those are some truly astounding numbers.\n  There is a lot of good in the current SCHIP law that we should \nreauthorize, but at the same time, we should also modernize and improve \nit.\n  Our goal should be to continue to target those low-income children \nwho fall between the cracks and go without health insurance. And we \nshould seek out those children who are eligible for SCHIP, but \ncurrently go without, and bring them into the program.\n  Unfortunately, I have serious concerns with the bill that the Finance \nCommittee sent to the floor. I do appreciate all the hard work of the \nranking member, Senator Grassley, as well as Senator Hatch, who is one \nof the original authors of this program. However, the committee's bill \nis a dramatic departure from current SCHIP law: It will significantly \nraise taxes, increase spending, and lead to government-run health \ninsurance.\n  Funding for this proposed massive increase in spending relies not \njust on a massive tax increase, but also on a budgeting gimmick. Their \nplan will increase SCHIP spending every year for the next 5 years, with \nprojected spending of $8.4 billion in 2012.\n  Then suddenly in 2013, like magic, spending would drop to only $400 \nmillion--a decrease of $8 billion in one year. That's not because the \nfunds won't be needed--rather, it is a sleight of hand needed to fit \nthe program within the bill's funding limits.\n  But does anyone seriously think Congress will decide to cut SCHIP by \n$8 billion in one year, so that millions who rely on it will lose their \nhealth insurance? Of course not. Future Congresses will go back and \nspend more, and this proposal will end up costing exponentially more \nthan its current price tag.\n  Under this scenario, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the \ntotal cost of this bill over the period from 2008 to 2017 is actually \n$112 billion--$41 billion more than the advertised price.\n  And most of this increase will go toward people that SCHIP was never \nmeant to cover.\n  The expansion proposal we are considering here on the floor will \nallow SCHIP coverage to extend to families with incomes as high as 400 \npercent of the Federal poverty level--even though 89 percent of \nchildren in families with incomes as high as 300 to 400 percent of the \nFederal poverty level already have private coverage.\n  The bill also includes a tax increase, when the American people are \nalready taxed too much. So I hope we will have a free, open debate on \nthis bill, and every Senator will be allowed to offer ideas to improve \nit.\n  Senators Lott, Kyl, Gregg, Bunning and I will propose an alternative \nmeasure called the Kids First Act. It refocuses SCHIP to help the \npeople it was designed to help: low-income children.\n  While considerably less expensive to the taxpayers than the Finance \nCommittee's bill, it's worth noting that many States, including \nKentucky, would fare better next year under the\n\n[[Page S10224]]\n\nKids First Act than under the committee bill.\n  Our plan is fiscally responsible and focuses Government assistance on \nthose who really need it. I urge all of my colleagues to seriously \nconsider it.\n  Many Senators have also worked exceedingly hard to craft \ncomprehensive measures addressing the uninsured in America. I applaud \ntheir efforts, and look forward to having a full and open debate on the \nSenate floor about their ideas.\n  I especially want to recognize Senators Burr, Coburn, Corker, DeMint \nand Martinez for their work in this regard.\n  As we begin to consider SCHIP legislation, this Senate should focus \non reauthorizing a program that works, instead of transforming it into \na license for higher taxes, higher spending, and another giant leap \ntoward government-run health care.\n  Legislation like that will not receive a Presidential signature. But \nthis Senate can craft something that will. Let's work toward that and \nproduce a bill that focuses on the true goals of SCHIP--providing a \nsafety net for kids in low-income families.\n  I also have here an editorial from today's Wall Street Journal that \ndescribes many of the problems with the committee's bill I just \ndetailed. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 30, 2007]\n\n                         The Newest Entitlement\n\n       The State Children's Health Insurance Program sounds like \n     the epitome of good government: Who could be against health \n     care for children? The answer is anyone who worries about one \n     more middle-class taxpayer entitlement and a further slide to \n     a government takeover of health care. Yet Schip is sailing \n     toward a major expansion with almost no media scrutiny, and \n     with Republicans in Congress running for cover.\n       Schip was enacted in 1997 to help insure children from \n     working-poor families who make too much to qualify for \n     Medicaid. In the intervening years, the program reduced the \n     rate of uninsured kids by about 25 percent but has also grown \n     to cover the middle class and even many adults--and it gets \n     bigger every year. Schip expires in September without \n     reauthorization, and Congressional Democrats want to enlarge \n     its $35 billion budget by at least $60 billion over five \n     years.\n       State Governors from both parties are also leading the \n     charge--and for their own self-interested reasons. Schip \n     money is delivered as a block grant, which the states match \n     while designing their own insurance programs. All cost \n     overruns, however, are billed to the federal government, \n     which is on the hook for about 70 percent of Schip's \n     ``matching rate.'' This offers incentives for state \n     politicians to make generous promises and shift the costs to \n     the feds, or to toy around with costly universal health-care \n     experiments. And since the states only get 57 cents on the \n     dollar for Medicaid, they are working hard to transfer those \n     recipients to Schip.\n       This self-interest explains a recent letter from the \n     National Governors Association demanding ``urgent action'' on \n     Schip, which got lots of favorable play in the press. Yet \n     these are the same Governors who have been moaning for years \n     about rising entitlement burdens, which is what Schip will be \n     soon enough. Particularly egregious was the signature on the \n     letter of Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, a Republican who \n     regards himself a conservative health-care maven and should \n     know better.\n       This ``bipartisan'' cover is serving Democrats in Congress, \n     who want to liberalize Schip eligibility as part of their \n     march to national health care. The Senate Finance Committee \n     has voted 17-4 to increase Schip spending to at least $112 \n     billion over 10 years. Not only does it use a budget trick to \n     hide a payment hole of at least $30 billion, it proposes to \n     offset the increase by bumping up the cigarette tax by 61 \n     cents to $1 a pack.\n       House Democrats are putting the finishing touches on their \n     own plan, making the cigarette tax somewhat lower to win over \n     tobacco-state Members. Instead, the House is proposing to \n     steal nearly $50 billion from Medicare Advantage, the \n     innovative attempt to bring private competition to senior \n     health care.\n       Michigan's John Dingell explains that ``these are not \n     cuts'' but ``reductions in completely unjustified \n     overpayments''--which will come as news to insurers that \n     offered coverage plans based on certain funding expectations. \n     The ``overpayments'' he's referring to were passed expressly \n     as an incentive for companies to offer Medicare Advantage in \n     rural areas with traditionally fewer insurance options--and \n     are intended to be phased out over time. Democrats apparently \n     want to starve any private option for Medicare.\n       In any case, the actual costs of Schip will overwhelm these \n     financing gimmicks. Like all government insurance, Schip is \n     ``covering'' more children by displacing private insurance. \n     According to the Congressional Budget Office, for every 100 \n     children who are enrolled in the proposed Schip expansion, \n     there will be a corresponding reduction in private insurance \n     for between 25 and 50 children. Although there is a net \n     increase in coverage, it comes by eroding the private system.\n       This crowd-out effect is magnified moving up the income \n     scale. In 2005, 77 percent of children between 200 percent \n     and 300 percent of the poverty level already had private \n     insurance, which is where the Senate compromise wants to move \n     Schip participation. New York State is moving to 400 percent \n     of poverty, or some $82,000 in annual income. All of this \n     betrays the fact that the real political objective of Schip \n     is more government control--HillaryCare on the installment \n     plan.\n       We'd have thought Capitol Hill Republicans would understand \n     all this, especially with the White House vowing to veto any \n     big Schip expansion. But we hear the GOP lacks the Senate \n     votes for a filibuster and perhaps even to sustain a veto. \n     GOP Senators Mitch McConnell and Jon Kyl are backing an \n     alternative to account for population growth and reach the \n     remaining 689,000 uninsured children that Schip was intended \n     to help. Republicans would be wise to support this version, \n     or they'll take one more step to returning to their historic \n     minority party status as tax collectors for the welfare \n     state.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks \nbe printed in another place in the Record and the time be charged \nagainst our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico; that then I be able to complete my remarks on CHIP after he is \ndone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nprofusely. I thought it would not be appropriate to let the SCHIP \nlegislation proceed without some comments about how it got started.\n  Actually, in 1992, when I was chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, I helped to create the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, also known as SCHIP, as part of the Balanced Budget Act, \nbelieve it or not.\n  The program has been a success. The number of children without \ninsurance has declined by a very large amount. The Senate Finance \nCommittee has approved a reauthorization of SCHIP, and the full Senate \nwill take it up this week. The bill increases 5-year funding for the \nprogram from $25 billion to $60 billion. The $35 billion expansion is \npaid for in full by taxes on tobacco products.\n  In the current form, I will support the Finance Committee-passed \nbill. I suggest that many should. In my home State's problem with \nuninsured children, recent reports have New Mexico at the bottom in the \nNation in coverage of these children. About 100,000 children in my \nState are without insurance, 25 percent of the adolescent population.\n  I have many concerns with the cost of this bill and the way it is \npaid for. However, I am willing to spend the next 5 years working on \nthese concerns.\n  If the bill is substantially changed or expanded during debate this \nweek in the Senate, or if it is significantly changed during conference \nwith the House, they can count me out; I will no longer support it. \nThis is about the size we ought to support, to handle our money \nproperly and to create a program that may very well be one of those \nthat will help us immensely with insurance for adolescents and \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico for his remarks. I personally appreciate them.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wish to also compliment the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, this week the Senate will focus on how to \nreauthorize and finance the CHIP program.\n  Therefore, I would like to take some time on the Senate floor today \nto lay the groundwork for that process by examining the history of the \nCHIP program and the successes it has had over the last decade.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997--BBA 97--created CHIP as Title XXI of\n\n[[Page S10225]]\n\nthe Social Security Act. Today, all 50 States, the District of Columbia \nand five territories have CHIP programs. As is allowed by the law, 17 \nStates use Medicaid expansions, 18 States use separate State programs \nand 21 States use a combination approach of both their Medicaid program \nand the State program.\n  The CHIP program is financed through both the federal and State \ngovernments and is overseen by the States. States receive an enhanced \nfederal match for the CHIP program. This federal match is significantly \nhigher than the federal match that States receive through the Medicaid \nprogram.\n  The Medicaid federal medical assistance percentage, known as F-MAP, \nranges between 50 percent and 76 percent in fiscal year 2006; the CHIP \nF-MAP ranges from 65 percent to 83.2 percent.\n  Through BBA 97, approximately $40 billion in federal funding was \nappropriated for the CHIP program. Overall, States have spent $10.1 \nbillion dollars since it was first implemented through September 30, \n2005.\n  Today, approximately 6.2 million children have their health insurance \ncoverage through the CHIP program. As one of the original authors of \nthe CHIP program with Senator Kennedy, Senator Rockefeller, and the \nlate Senator Chafee, I am very proud of the program's successes and I \nwant these successes to continue.\n  When we drafted this legislation in 1997, our goal was to cover the \nseveral million children who had no insurance coverage. Their families \nwere too rich to qualify for Medicaid; however, their families did not \nhave enough money to purchase private health insurance. We have gone a \nlong way in meeting that goal, but we are clearly not there yet. \nCoverage of these uninsured children is still my top priority.\n  I have always believed that we shouldn't even consider expanding this \nprogram to other populations until we have covered all children who do \nnot have health care coverage.\n  Unfortunately, that has not been the case and a program that was \ncreated for low-income children has covered childless adults, parents \nof CHIP-eligible children and pregnant women. How has this happened?\n  Both the Clinton and Bush administrations granted waivers to States \nto cover adults, something that I strongly oppose. Today, 11 States \ncover parents through State waivers and six States cover childless \nadults in CHIP through State CHIP waivers.\n  When Senator Rockefeller, Senator Kennedy, Senator Chafee and I \nworked on the original legislation in 1997, our goal was to cover the \nseveral million children who had no health insurance, but I believe \nthat the bill before the Senate today makes great progress in this \narea.\n  I believe the bill the Senate is considering this week captures the \ntrue essence of the 1997 law and builds on that foundation to insure \neven more children.\n  That, indeed, should be our purpose.\n  The bill drafted by Finance Committee Chairman Baucus, Finance \nRanking Republican Member Grassley, Finance Health Subcommittee \nChairman Rockefeller and myself is the very essence of compromise.\n  To be fair, it does not make any of us Republicans comfortable to \nface a veto threat from our President.\n  It does not make me comfortable to face a veto threat issued by my \ncolleague and good friend from Utah, Secretary Leavitt.\n  It does not make me comfortable to advocate for such a large amount \nin new spending.\n  At the same time, I know none of you on the other side of the aisle \nare comfortable with the fact that we did not authorize spending up to \nthe $50 billion limit in the budget resolution. Many of my Democrat \ncolleagues made sacrifices in endorsing this bill and in sacrificing \nprogram expansions they so dearly advocated.\n  Senator Kennedy and I often like to joke with each other that if \nneither side is totally comfortable with one of our compromises, we \nmust have done a good job.\n  And in that spirit, I say to my colleagues, we must have done a good \njob.\n  This bill will make it all about the kids. That was our goal, and we \nachieved it. Our bill will provide health coverage to 2.7 million of \nthe 6 million currently uninsured, low-income children who are 200 \npercent of the Federal poverty level and below.\n  I want to circle back to the cost of this bill.\n  I remember so well my conversations with my colleagues in 1997 about \nthe cost of the original CHIP bill and the precedent it could \nrepresent.\n  We must recognize that we have already covered the kids who are easy \nto find. Six million of them to be exact.\n  We can all be proud of that.\n  But one of the lessons we have learned along the way is that it will \ncost proportionately more to cover the remaining children. They are \nharder to find and thus harder to cover.\n  This is what CBO told us.\n  So you can't do the simple math and say:\n\n       It costs $40 billion to cover 6 million kids, so it should \n     cost $40 billion to cover the remaining 6 million kids. It \n     doesn't work that way.\n\n  CBO told us that we need to give States more money to cover these new \nuninsured children, and that is what we have done.\n  We have made a number of other important decisions in this bill.\n  We have restored the program back to its intent to cover children, \nnot adults. This was a hard decision for Senators from States with \nadult waivers, and I commend them for their commitment to the children.\n  The legislation before the committee removes childless adults from \nthe CHIP program by the end of FY09 and afterwards, gives the States \nthe option of covering these individuals through Medicaid.\n  It also prohibits the approval of any new State waivers for parents \nto be covered through CHIP.\n  Only parents living in states with approved parent waivers will be \neligible for health coverage through the CHIP program.\n  The next tough issue was the coverage of pregnant women. While I was \nnot opposed to this in theory, in practice we all know that the cost of \none delivery could fund insurance for three or four children. That is \nwhy I opposed this coverage in 1997.\n  I have been convinced that States should have the option of covering \npregnant women through the CHIP program. This was a difficult decision \nfor me and, again, a true compromise.\n  Third, we included money for outreach and enrollment. This is key for \nenrollment, but as we found out, it is very expensive. So we made the \ndecision to place a limit on the amount of money dedicated to these \nefforts.\n  Fourth, our legislation includes premium assistance through CHIP for \ncoverage through private plans. And if it is determined that family \ncoverage would be more cost efficient, the entire family would be \ncovered through this health plan.\n  This is something that was very important to me and Senator Grassley. \nUtah has started such a program with the hopes of providing affordable \ncoverage to an entire family.\n  Fifth, our legislation includes a cap of 300 percent of the Federal \npoverty level for eligibility in CHIP. If a State provides CHIP \ncoverage above that level, it will not receive the enhanced match. \nStates with higher eligibility levels when this legislation becomes law \nwould be grandfathered in.\n  Finally, I am pleased that this bill changes the name SCHIP back to \nCHIP, the way it was before the House added the superfluous S.\n  Madam President, this is a good bill. It accomplishes what we have \nset out to do--to take care of the children.\n  Yes, I wish it did not cost what it does, but I am persuaded this is \nnecessary spending when I think of the 6 million American children who \nare leading healthier lives because of our vision and commitment.\n  We should not let the opportunity pass us buy to build on that solid \nfoundation and do even more good for the children, our future.\n  I will add one more point that I want my Republican colleagues to \ntake to heart. This is a bipartisan compromise bill. It is not like the \nlegislation being considered by the House of Representatives that will \ncost up to an additional $50 billion to reauthorize the CHIP program \nover the next 5 years.\n  In my opinion, the Senate version of this legislation is the better \ndeal for the American people, and it is my hope that my colleagues who \ndisagree will take one more look at this legislation.\n\n[[Page S10226]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion to proceed to this bill.\n  I hope in the final analysis, once we do proceed, our colleagues will \nvote for the bill because it is the right thing to do.\n  How much time do we have remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 9\\1/2\\ minutes, and the \nmajority has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island and ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the quorum \ncalls, I be recognized for 2 minutes immediately prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking \nMember Grassley and the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, who \nhave been so energetic in preserving, enhancing, and protecting this \nplan. Rhode Island has a significant role, going back to the days of \nJohn Chafee, whose name has been mentioned by Senator Hatch, and, of \ncourse, through Senator Jack Reed, whose relentless advocacy for this \nprogram is a legend on this floor.\n  My time is very short, so I will speak to a very simple point and \ncome back and speak more to the children's health issue later in the \ndebate.\n  It strikes me, as a new legislator, that legislating is about \nchoices. The distinguished Senator from Utah said this bill is \nexpensive, but it is the right thing to do. I would like to show two \ncharts to help illustrate the expense in some context.\n  This is a chart which illustrates the additional cost we are talking \nabout for children's health care in America, the subject we are \ndebating in these increments, the increase over the next 3 years. The \nchart compares it to the cost to all of us of the Bush tax cuts going \nto the 1 percent of the richest Americans. So is it expensive to spend \n$2.1 billion on children's health care in 2008? It probably is. And is \nit expensive to spend $5 billion on children's health care, increasing \nit in 2009? Is it expensive to spend $7.9 billion? It probably is. But \nthis is an administration which is happy to spend $70 billion on the \nrichest 1 percent of America in the same year that they are fighting \nabout $2.1 billion to improve health care for children. They are \nwilling to spend $72 billion in the following year and $82 billion \nafter that. So in the context of comparing expense to doing the right \nthing, it is a little bit expensive, but is it ever the right thing, \nparticularly in a world where we are judged by our choices.\n  Here is another demonstration of really the same principle. We are \ntalking about a cost spread over 5 years to help America's children \nhave health insurance. By comparison, the interest alone on the Federal \ndebt George Bush ran up with his tax cuts to the rich, just the \ninterest expense in the fiscal year 2007, is more than that. It is $46 \nbillion. This administration is fighting about whether we should spend \n$35.2 billion over 5 years for children's health insurance, poor \nchildren's health insurance, versus the Gulf Stream gazillionaires' tax \nbreaks.\n  If you look to the President for leadership, you don't find it. What \nyou find in his budget is $5 billion across the whole period instead of \n35, which, because of the increase in medical costs over that period, \nit has been estimated would throw a million American children off of \nhealth insurance.\n  What Chairman Baucus has done, what Ranking Member Grassley has done, \nis work out a bipartisan compromise in the Senate that is the right \nthing to do and not all that expensive.\n  I congratulate them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I understand the Senator from Iowa \nwishes to yield back the remainder of his time, and I understand that \nunder the order, I have 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have 2 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, there are a lot of points one could make \nat this juncture. We will have time tomorrow and in the next several \ndays. The Senate is about to vote on the motion to proceed to the bill. \nI understand Senators on both sides of the aisle will support it.\n  It is important to be on the bill. There are differing views within \nthis Chamber about how we get the reauthorization passed, but I don't \nthink there is much disagreement that we need to do something. If we \ndon't get to the bill, we are probably then not going to authorize the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, and that is going to mean a lot of \nkids are going to lose health insurance. So I urge Senators to vote to \nproceed to the bill. I understand the Senate will vote to proceed, and \nI think that is the right thing to do.\n\n  One point I want to make, in this very brief time, is there is some \nillusion by some Senators as to some States providing CHIP to families \nwho are 400 percent of poverty, that somehow the Children's Health \nInsurance Program is going to not only help low-income kids but help \nhigh-income kids.\n  I understand that concern because it has been bandied about. But the \nfact is, no State currently covers their children at 400 percent of \npoverty. Only one State is thinking about it. That is New York. That \nState would have to get approval--either with a waiver by HHS or have \ntheir plan approved. I frankly doubt this current administration is \ngoing to agree to do that.\n  I also point out, of all the children in the country covered by CHIP, \nonly 3,000 come from families above 300 percent of poverty. Only 3,000 \nchildren today come from families who are above 300 percent of poverty. \nFrankly, that is an ideal calculation. That is less than one-tenth of 1 \npercent of the 6.6 million kids who are covered. So a very small \nfraction of the children come from families who are above 300 percent \nof poverty. They all live in the State of New Jersey.\n  I might also add, those 3,000 children in New Jersey represent about \n2.4 percent of the children covered by the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram in that State--a very small percentage--and all these children \npay $1,400 per year for their health care, which is a contribution of \n2.2 percent of their family income.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Central American Free Trade Agreement\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 2 years ago this week the House of \nRepresentatives forced through the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, the dysfunctional cousin of the job-killing trade agreement, \nNAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA expanded NAFTA \ninto five Central American countries and the Dominican Republic despite \nwidespread bipartisan opposition to it in the United States, in Central \nAmerica, and in the Dominican Republic.\n  During the CAFTA debate, the largest ever bipartisan coalition was \nformed in opposition to CAFTA and in support of fair trade, a very \ndifferent direction in our trade policy. A coalition of farmers, \nranchers, cattlemen, small business men and women, labor groups, human \nrights organizations, consumer and environmental and faith groups \nconnected the widespread opposition to NAFTA around the country, with \nDemocrats and Republicans, were standing up to the President.\n  CAFTA passed but not on its merits. In the middle of the night, the \nvote was held open until enough arms were twisted to secure a win in \nthe House of Representatives by only two votes. CAFTA passed by the \nslimmest margin of any trade agreement in the modern era. That was \nbecause of the overwhelming opposition by those of us who support fair \ntrade. We forever changed the debate on trade.\n  Make no mistake, we want trade. As Senator Dorgan says, we want trade \nand plenty of it. However, 2 years after CAFTA, supporters of the \nfailed NAFTA-like model still are trying to force through Congress more \nof the same--more job-killing trade agreements that hurt U.S. \nbusinesses and that exploit workers in developing nations, more \nfundamentally flawed agreements designed to protect multinational \ncorporations, and big drug companies. They are protectionists all \nright; they protect large corporations, especially the large drug \ncompanies.\n  More trade agreements can send our trade deficit soaring and \nhemorrhaging U.S. jobs. In 1992, the year I first ran for the House of \nRepresentatives, our trade deficit was $38 billion. Last year, it \nexceeded $800 billion. From $38 billion, that is an increase of more \nthan 20 times. The first President Bush said for every billion-dollar \ntrade agreement or deficit, it translates into 13,000 jobs. You do the \nmath on what an $800 billion trade deficit means.\n  CAFTA was passed by two votes. Since CAFTA passed 2 years ago this \nlast week, how has it done so far? CAFTA proponents told us if it \ndidn't pass, poverty would get worse in Central America; CAFTA would \npromote economic growth, curb the violence in Central America, and \nserve as a model for strengthening democracy. Let's look at the region \n2 years later.\n  Violence and murders continue to silence the opposition to CAFTA \nthroughout Central America. State violence was responsible for the \ndeath of several CAFTA demonstrators in Guatemala. Since 2001, more \nthan 2,500 women and girls have been brutally murdered in Guatemala. \nMany work in factories built for export and make just a few dollars a \nweek. The Guatemalan Government failed to bring those responsible to \njustice. And we reward that Government with a free-trade agreement. \nFour Guatemalan police confessed in the murder of three Salvadoran \nlegislators whose crime was they opposed CAFTA. Despite the threats of \nviolence, still thousands of people are protesting CAFTA in Central \nAmerica.\n  CAFTA promoters also said the trade deal would strengthen labor \nrights. U.S. Trade Representative Zoellick told us:\n\n       If CAFTA stumbles, labor rights in Central America will not \n     be strengthened.\n\n  The reality is, there have been disturbing developments in the \nregion, including the recent passage by the Honduran Government of a \nlaw to create ``exception zones'' that will allow foreign factories to \npay less than the national minimum wage in the southern part of the \ncountry. The national minimum wage--think how low it is. It is only a \nfew dimes an hour. This whole idea of a trade agreement is to lift up \nstandards. That is what they say, but what they do is have an exception \neven from the low wages for foreign companies to come in and pay an \neven lower wage.\n  In Guatemala, forced laborers, most of whom are well under the age of \n18, are coerced to work 10- to 14-hour days, 6 or 7 days each week.\n  In Nicaragua, the human rights ombudsman alleges that nearly half of \nthe female employees working in free-trade zones had been subject to \nphysical or sexual abuse.\n  Consistent with its history of repeating the same act and expecting \ndifferent results, the administration now wants Congress to approve \ndeals with Peru, Panama, Colombia, and South Korea--still using the \nfailed NAFTA-CAFTA trade model. I think it was Albert Einstein who said \nthe mark of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over and \nexpecting a different result. This President continues to try to push \nthrough trade agreements.\n  NAFTA failed. PNTR with China is causing a hemorrhaging of industrial \njobs from Ohio, in Stubenville, Toledo, Dayton, Cleveland, Canton, \nPortsmouth--from all over our State. Yet the President continues to \npush these kinds of trade agreements with Peru, Panama, South Korea, \nand Columbia through Congress.\n\n  This fall, Congress will debate these new free-trade agreements, and \nthis fall I look forward to working with my fair trade colleagues in \nthe House and\n\n[[Page S10228]]\n\nSenate in changing our Nation's trade policy. It is clear that an \noverwhelming majority of the American people want a very different \ntrade policy. It is clear that our communities, people all over my \nState of Ohio and all over this country understand that these trade \npolicies have cost people their jobs, they have broken too many \nfamilies, they have hurt too many communities, and they have depleted \nthe manufacturing base in our country.\n  People want a different direction in trade. We want trade; we want \nmore of it. We want trade under different rules. That is why we demand \nfair trade.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to speak \ntoday on behalf of the legislation that is pending before the Senate to \nprovide health insurance to an estimated 3.2 million children in \nAmerica who will undoubtedly stand to benefit from this legislation.\n  I wish to voice my strong support as a member of the Finance \nCommittee for the Baucus-Grassley reauthorization of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. I also extend my congratulations \nto Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley, as well as chairman and \nranking member of the Health Care Subcommittee, Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Hatch, for their visionary leadership and tireless perseverance \nin crafting this package, which has received such broad bipartisan \nsupport on the committee--and hopefully on the floor as well--and never \nlosing sight of the overarching goal of obtaining health insurance for \nuninsured children.\n  I can well recall in the Senate more than 5 years ago when Senators \nHatch and Kennedy originally authored the legislation that paved the \nway for this unprecedented program which was supported by the Federal \nGovernment in partnership with the States in recognizing that one of \nthe most vulnerable populations in this country was left without health \ninsurance. This really did engender strong support across the board in \nthe Senate and in Congress, and in every State in the country it has \nbeen remarkably successful. That is why I think that record of \nexperience should bode well for the passage of this legislation.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Senator Rockefeller and I introduced \nseparate SCHIP legislation earlier this year, a bill that is \ncosponsored by more than 22 Members of this body. Many of the elements \nof that legislation have been incorporated into the legislation that is \npending before us today.\n  Although there are some key components that are absent, I think \noverall the core issues that are so essential to bolstering a strong \nprogram for the future have been inserted in this legislation.\n  This is a strong bipartisan bill, authored in a bipartisan fashion, \nand was reported out of the Finance Committee with an overwhelmingly \nstrong support with a 17-to-4 bipartisan vote. Time and again, we talk \nabout the value of setting partisan politics aside and working together \nto produce solutions for the problems confronting the American people. \nIf there is ever a time to turn our words into action, that time is \nnow.\n  So the legislation today, while neither perfect nor ideal, represents \na strong consensus in response to a growing epidemic in our Nation \ntoday, which is a lack of health insurance among working Americans of \nlimited means.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, the SCHIP program is not for \nchildren below the poverty line. They are already covered by Medicaid. \nRather, SCHIP provides fallback health coverage for children of working \nmen and women above the poverty line who nevertheless have been unable \nto obtain even basic health care for their families, most often because \nof lack of health coverage at work and the prohibitively expensive cost \nof individual policies on the private market. In fact, nearly 90 \npercent of the uninsured children come from families where at least one \nparent is working and in households earning less than $40,000 per year, \nwhich is 200 percent of poverty, and fewer than half are offered \nemployer-sponsored health insurance at work. This is a 9-percent drop \nsince 1997. So, obviously, that is moving in a different direction, \nunfortunately, and that is because of the prohibitive costs that have \nbeen associated with health insurance plans recently.\n  For many working families struggling to obtain health care benefits \neven accessible to them, the costs are moving further and further out \nof their reach. The anguish of those who work hard to make ends meet \nyet still cannot afford to pay for health coverage for their children \nis truly devastating. Parents without access to affordable health \ninsurance for their children live in constant anxiety. They face \ndecisions no parent would ever want to have to confront as to whether \ntheir child is really sick enough to go to a doctor. They worry every \nday about their children doing simple activities, worrying because they \ncan ill afford the consequences of a broken arm or a sprained ankle. \nTheir only alternatives is to ratchet up their credit card balances, \noften irrespective of mounting debt. That is why this SCHIP program has \nbeen such a saving grace for so many families. It has been the one \nremarkable program which has led to a substantial reduction in the \nnumber of uninsured.\n  Some may say that $35 billion over 5 years, which is the estimated \ncost of this program, will only cover an additional 3.2 million \nchildren--that it will cost $2,188 per child. But I happen to believe \nthis is just further illustration of how health care costs continue to \nspiral out of control. The staggering cost of an individual policy with \nreasonable coverage is a reality families without health insurance \nconfront every day.\n  Today, the income eligibility for the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram in my State of Maine is 200 percent of poverty, $41,300 per \nfamily of four. An uninsured parent who wants to buy coverage for their \nchild on the individual market with a $250 deductible and 20-percent \ncoinsurance can expect to pay $8,777 a year. This should hardly be \nsurprising given that a family of four seeking to purchase a health \ninsurance plan on the individual market will typically pay in excess of \n$24,000 per year. That is $24,000 per year. So when people talk about \nthe fact that this is going to cost $35 billion for 3.2 million \nchildren, that is a cost of $2,188, a price that no individual, no \nfamily could possibly hope to obtain to provide health insurance for \ntheir family. That is why this Children's Health Insurance Program is \nso essential and critical to working families.\n  In 1998, a year after Congress passed this program, 14 percent of \nchildren in Maine were uninsured. Within 5 years, the number of \nuninsured in Maine dropped to 7 percent and has remained at that level. \nThis is, at the same time, a dramatic improvement in health coverage as \nwell as a definitive statement that a great deal more work remains if \nwe are to address the critical issues of affordability and \naccessibility of health insurance, especially as they relate to health \ncare for our children.\n  That is why I am so pleased that the Baucus-Grassley bill before us \nprovides a significant increase in Federal investment in the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program beyond the reauthorization of the status quo \nbecause States not only require sufficient Federal funding to ensure \nthat children currently enrolled in the SCHIP program do not lose \ncoverage and become uninsured, but they also need additional funding to \nenroll more uninsured children.\n  Most critically, this legislation increases the Children's Health \nInsurance Program coverage to children in households earning up to 300 \npercent of poverty level. That was one of the central pieces of the \nlegislation Senator Rockefeller and I introduced earlier this year. It \nalso adopts another key Rockefeller-Snowe component by ensuring \ncoverage for pregnant women--a long overdue upgrade in the program that \nrightfully has gained broad support in this Chamber.\n  I believe the Finance Committees's approach to SCHIP is a balanced, \ncarefully considered package worthy of the Senate's support. I wish to \naddress\n\n[[Page S10229]]\n\nsome of the opposition that has arisen to this bill because I think it \nis important to address some of these comments and complaints.\n  While I acknowledge my colleagues' sincerity in searching for \nsolutions to our overall national uninsured program and I, in fact, \nsupport some of the proposals they offer, I must assert that now is \nneither the time nor the place for attempting to move these legislative \nproposals. With the September 30 expiration date on SCHIP fast \napproaching, we simply must take care of children first.\n  First, we heard the unfortunate veto threat issued by the White \nHouse, and I am dismayed by this stance because it seriously misjudges \nthe concern Americans have about access to health care, especially for \nchildren and especially for this program.\n  Year after year, poll after poll affirms that access to affordable \nhealth care is the No. 1 domestic priority of Americans. Moreover, in a \nMarch New York Times/CBS News poll, 84 percent of Americans surveyed \nsaid that they supported expanding the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram to cover all uninsured children. That was 84 percent of the \nAmerican people, obviously across the political spectrum. By its very \nnature, it includes Republicans, Independents, as well as Democrats. A \nsimilar majority said they thought the lack of health insurance for \nmany children was a very serious problem for this country. So to stand \nin the way of these efforts which are presented to the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program demonstrates a stark disregard for the wishes \nof the American people.\n  Let there be no mistake, I think the public would hold us all \naccountable if we failed to reauthorize this program but also to make \nfuture investments in this program. I think undeniably the problem \ndeserves to be recognized.\n  Some of my colleagues will say the SCHIP reauthorization is the first \nstep toward Government-run health care and that we will substitute \npublic coverage for private insurance. This is patently untrue, \nespecially because most Medicaid and SCHIP beneficiaries receive \ncoverage through the private plans that contract with their States. For \ninstance, 73 percent of the children enrolled in Medicaid receive most \nor all of their health care services through a managed care plan. Far \nfrom scaling back private coverage, this bill actually shores up \nemployer-based coverage by giving States the option to subsidize \nemployer-sponsored group health care for families for whom coverage is \ncost prohibitive. Moreover, the bill targets incentive payments only to \nenrollment of low-income children under 200 percent of poverty, which \nis, as I said earlier, $41,300 for a family of four, who are least \nlikely to have access to private coverage in the first place.\n  Some others will argue that SCHIP could reduce or eliminate coverage \nfor adults, especially childless adults. Although I believe that \ncoverage for adults can have a clear benefit for children, both in \nterms of enrollment for children as well as the fact that health \nproblems for a working parent can lead to economic insecurity for a \nfamily, I recognize the opinion of those who desire to place a greater \nemphasis on covering children, and that is why this compromise \nlegislation phases out coverage of adults.\n  I find it interesting, if not somewhat contradictory--I know the \nadministration has been very vocal about the cost and scope of the \nlegislation before us. But this is the same administration which has \ngranted the State waivers to allow States to cover adults for the past \n6\\1/2\\ years and just 2 months ago renewed waivers for adult coverage. \nClearly, the trend from the administration was to grant State waivers \nrecognizing the importance of insuring parents of uninsured children \nbecause, as we have seen time and time again, if a parent is insured, \nmore likely the child will be insured as well and be part of the SCHIP \nprogram.\n  Others may argue that the cost of this legislation is too high, given \nthat the baseline program is $25 billion. But I also would respond that \nthe $35 billion that is placed in this bill is $15 billion below the \namount we provided in the budget resolution and fully offset. This is a \ndirect product of the negotiations that occurred within the Finance \nCommittee to reach a compromise and consensus across the political \naisle, and I applaud them for the efforts they made. We know the \nlegislation before us will insure 3.2 million. There is probably at \nleast another 5 or 6 million children who may be uninsured. So we \nhaven't addressed the problem in its entirety.\n  I wish we could have gone the extra mile to do everything we could to \nreach all the children who are uninsured in America, but I believe this \nbill is the opportunity to push forward with the most important piece \nwe can at this moment in time in reaching a consensus to address at \nleast 3.2 million because it is $35 billion in addition to those who \nare already covered, which is an additional $25 billion.\n  I know some would suggest this is another way of advancing \ncomprehensive health care reform. I think there is no question we all \ndesire to address the most grappling domestic problem we face, and that \nis the issue of the uninsured, of which there are more than 47 million \nAmericans who now lack health insurance. That is certainly the most \npreeminent domestic policy issue of our time. But if we cannot begin \nwith insuring our children, how can we possibly address the larger \npopulation? This is a problem we must tackle, undeniably. \nUnfortunately, many of the proposals that are being discussed have not \nobviously been vetted yet for consideration through the committee \nprocess, and I am concerned that ultimately it will affect this \nlegislation before the Senate.\n  For example, I have heard that possibly the Small Business Health \nInsurance Plan will be attached to the pending legislation. As the \nformer chair and now ranking member of the Committee on Small Business, \nI have long championed and been an advocate for the Small Business \nHealth Insurance Plan. In fact, I crafted my own legislation more than \n4 years ago, so it is an issue I have advocated for a considerable \nperiod of time and clearly one that needs to be addressed. But I would \nhope we could consider that as a separate component. The fact is it \ndeserves to stand alone in consideration, as we tried to do last year \nbut, unfortunately, could not reach the 60 votes necessary to overcome \nthe cloture vote.\n  There is no question we ought to address that particular issue. At \nthis moment in time, since we are nearing a deadline of September 30 \nwith respect to the reauthorization of SCHIP, I think it is important \nwe stay on track in the Senate and address the other issues related to \nhealth insurance at a later point in time. I hope Members of the Senate \nwill set aside those amendments and give their strong support to this \nlegislation.\n  I think there is no question we have to work to achieve a consensus \non health care as a larger question, without a doubt, as we were able \nto accomplish on this legislation which provides health insurance for \nuninsured and insured children in America. But I hope my colleagues \nwill see the true benefits of this legislation and support this package \nthat is before us today. I hope we will not be sidetracked with \nadditional amendments, as I said, whether it is on the Small Business \nHealth Insurance Plans or providing for tax credits or health savings \naccounts. I do think all those issues are critical and should be \naddressed in their entirety but not as part of this legislation that \nultimately could erode the bipartisan support that has been developed \nfor this critical piece of legislation before us today.\n  I hope we will pass this bill and allow the States to increase the \nSCHIP eligibility up to 300 percent, which will be the first time that \nhas been allowed by the Federal legislation. I think the data available \ndemonstrates that drawing the eligibility line at 300 percent of \npoverty will help maximize the number of children we assist with this \nlegislation. In Maine alone, for example, approximately three-quarters \nof uninsured children are from families with incomes at 300 percent of \npoverty or below.\n  The Baucus-Grassley bill also provides States the option to provide \nhealth coverage for pregnant women, a policy that has garnered \nlongstanding, well-deserved bipartisan support. The fact is, proper \nprenatal care can reduce the likelihood of having a preterm baby, and \nroutine care for pregnant women can detect health conditions affecting \nthe mother as well as the baby. Sometimes these medical problems can\n\n[[Page S10230]]\n\nbe addressed before the child is born. So I think this is an important \nadjunct to this legislation.\n  I am also pleased the bill includes the Lincoln-Snowe amendment that \nwas adopted in the committee on the development of pediatric quality \nmeasures aimed at reducing preterm births as well. Our country has one \nof the highest rates of infant mortality among industrialized nations. \nThat is a disgrace in a land with our wealth and our means. Coverage of \npregnant women, coupled with quality measures on reducing preterm \nbirth, will help turn around those unacceptable statistics. Investing \nin good prenatal care saves money too. According to the March of Dimes, \nhealth care costs for babies born prematurely are nearly 15 times \ngreater than for full-term babies.\n  I hope the Senate will provide strong bipartisan support for this \nlegislation. I think we should recognize the success of this program \nand what it has managed to accomplish over the last 5 years with strong \nFederal support. I think it is an ideal partnership with the States, \nwhich have been extremely successful and effective in the way they have \nadministered this program.\n  What is also important about this legislation is that we revised the \nformula so we do not penalize States that do an excellent job of \nreaching out and continuing to insure more and more children. We don't \nwant to reward just the status quo. So we revised the formula to take \ninto account the States' experiences and how they have been able to \nsucceed in covering low-income, uninsured children so they do not see \ntheir allotment drop as a result of being so successful.\n  That is the way it has worked in the past. If, for example, States \nhave been very good at being able to insure many children in their \nStates, many more than maybe some of the other States, they would lose \npart of their funding. So we have revised the formula so there isn't \nthis perverse disincentive to cover more children. We should recognize \nsuccess and make sure it is rewarded.\n  Finally, I was disappointed, and I know the Chair has been a strong \nadvocate for this as well, that we were not able to provide dental \ncoverage for children. It is something I attempted in the committee, \nand it was included as part of the Rockefeller-Snowe legislation to \naddress this issue. The chairman of the committee, along with the \nranking member, agreed to include a $200 million Federal grant that is \nspecifically targeted to States to boost their coverage of dental \nbenefits. I am disappointed we don't have a guaranteed dental benefit \nbecause I think it is long overdue and is something we should recognize \nis a critical dimension to health insurance.\n\n  We have known of so many examples of tragedies that have occurred and \none most recently in Maryland, where a young boy died because he had an \nabscessed tooth. An extraction would have cost $100. He ultimately \ndied. They spent more than $200,000 trying to save his life, but, \nunfortunately and tragically, they did not. Think about what might have \nbeen had he had dental coverage--simple dental coverage.\n  Hopefully, we will be able to achieve some kind of support for a \ncompromise. I know I am not satisfied with the fact that we don't have \nthat guaranteed benefit, but I am pleased we do have a $200 million \nFederal grant as part of this program and that will be the beginning of \nthat process of providing dental benefits. I do think, ultimately, we \nneed to incorporate it as part of the underlying and fundamental \npackage of health insurance.\n  I thank the Chair and Members of the Senate for the opportunity to \naddress this issue. I believe that in the long run we are taking a \ncritical stand toward insuring more children in this country, and, \nhopefully, we can do more. I think the package before us is fiscally \nresponsible. It provides for an offset with a 61-cent increase in the \ntobacco tax. I know there are those who do not support such a tax \nincrease, but nevertheless, the 61-cent increase will help not only to \ncompletely offset the additional cost of this program of $35 billion, \nbut it also will prevent nearly 1.9 million children from ever starting \nto smoke, it will help nearly 1.2 million adult smokers quit, it will \nprevent more than 900,000 smoking-caused deaths, and it will produce \n$43.9 billion in long-term health care savings. So even if an increase \nraises money in the short-term but levels off because, more \nimportantly, fewer people will smoke, that is a win-win situation.\n  I hope the Senate will look to the strong 17 to 4 vote coming out of \nthe Finance Committee, which is indicative of the broad bipartisan \nsupport. Also, it is an example of what we can accomplish when we set \naside our political differences in order to do the right thing for \nchildren in America. Compromise is essential, and that certainly has \nbeen the hallmark of this effort.\n  We are poised to see a renewal of one of our most uniquely successful \ninitiatives when it comes to a health insurance program for children. \nThis will send a very strong signal to hard-working American families \nwhom the Federal Government is prepared to provide the support to help \ntheir children and to help their families as they struggle to meet one \nof the basic necessities of their life. More importantly, I hope, we \nwill reach the time when we will address the larger question of the \nuninsured in America because it is long overdue and is a vital \nnecessity for millions and millions of Americans.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10230-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10230-S10303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I begin by thanking the staff for \nstaying a few extra minutes to enable me to come back to the floor to \nmake a short statement.\n  I have sought recognition to speak about a revised reform bill on \nimmigration. In the course of the past 3 years, the Senate has spent a \ngreat deal of time on trying to reform our immigration system: to begin \nto fix the broken borders; to add more Border Patrols; to undertake \nsome necessary fencing; to add drones; to undertake employer \nverification by utilizing identification which now can provide, with \ncertainty, whether an immigrant is legal or illegal; to take care of a \nguest worker program to fill employment needs in the United States; and \nto deal with the 12 million undocumented immigrants.\n  During the 109th Congress, when I chaired the Judiciary Committee, we \nreported out a bill. It came to the floor, and after considerable \ndebate it was passed. The U.S. House of Representatives passed \nlegislation directed only at border patrol and employer verification, \nand for a variety of reasons we could not reconcile the bills and enact \nlegislation.\n  This year a different procedure was undertaken: to have a group of \nSenators who had been deeply involved in the issue before craft a bill. \nIt did not go through committee, and, as I said earlier on the floor, I \nthink it probably was a mistake because the committee action of \nhearings and markups and refinement works out a lot of problems. At any \nrate, as we all know, after extensive debate, the bill went down. We \ncould not get cloture to proceed, and it was defeated.\n  It was defeated for a number of reasons. But I believe the \nimmigration issue is one of great national concern--great importance--\nand ought to be revisited by the Congress and that ought to be done at \nas early a time as possible.\n  We have a very serious problem with people coming across our \nborders--a criminal element, and a potential terrorist element. The \nrule of law is broken by people who come here in violation of our laws. \nWe have continuing problems from the 1986 legislation that employer \nverification is not realistic because there is no positive way of \nidentification.\n  No matter how high the borders or the value of border patrol, it is \nnot possible to eliminate illegal immigration if the magnet is present. \nThe legislation I will be putting in as part of the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks is a draft of suggested proposals to be \nconsidered by the Senate. There are two major changes which have been \nundertaken.\n\n[[Page S10231]]\n\n  Much as I dislike to, I have eliminated the automatic path to \ncitizenship but instead deal with the fugitive status of the \nundocumented immigrants, the 12 million, and eliminate that fugitive \nstatus. Whether it is categorized as permanent legal resident or some \nother category, as a matter of nomenclature it can be worked out.\n  But the principal concern has not been the citizenship, although it \nis a desirable factor to try to integrate the 12 million into our \nsociety. But the principal concern has been that when an undocumented \nillegal immigrant sees a policeman on the street, there is fear of \napprehension and being rounded up and deported, or the undocumented \nillegal is at the mercy of an unscrupulous employer who will take \nadvantage of them and they cannot report to the police the treatment or \na violation of law by an employer because they are fearful of being \narrested and deported. In many places you cannot rent an apartment or \nundertake other activities. So I think eliminating the fugitive status \nis a major improvement.\n  The other significant change is to not tamper with or change family \nunification but to leave it as it is now. We had come up with, with the \nbill which was defeated, an elaborate point system for immigration. It \nwas our best effort but, candidly, it turned out to be half-baked. It \ndid not go through the hearing process to hear from experts. It did not \nhave that kind of refinement and raised a lot of problems. That could \nbe revisited at a later date. I have worked with the so-called interest \ngroups representing immigration interests and have had what I consider \nto be a relatively good response.\n  I do not want to characterize it or put words in anybody's mouth. \nThere is a certain reluctance to make any more concessions because \nconcessions were made last year and the bottom fell out. So they made \nan inquiry, understandably so, that there be some realistic chance of \ngetting the bill passed if they are to give up a path to citizenship.\n  I have undertaken to talk to many of my colleagues, Senators who \nopposed the bill, to get a sense from them as to whether, with the \nautomatic path to citizenship out, and dealing only with the fugitive \nstatus, that there might be some greater willingness to find an \naccommodation and deal with the issues.\n  With respect to citizenship, even under the legislation that was \ndefeated, there would not be an opportunity for citizenship until at \nleast 8 years have passed, to take care of the backlog, and then \nanother 5 years to work out the 12 million undocumented immigrants. So \nthe citizenship, even under the bill which was defeated, was not \nsomething which was going to be imminent.\n  We have seen local governments and State governments trying to deal \nwith the issue. Reports are more than 100 laws have been passed and \nordinances enacted which would deal with the immigration problem. They \ncannot do it on a sensible basis. Last week the U.S. District Court for \nthe Middle District of Pennsylvania handed down an opinion that the \ncity of Hazelton, notwithstanding the understandable efforts by the \nmayor, program was not constitutional; that under our laws, the answer \nhas to come from the Congress.\n  We have seen a lot of unrest on the issue. The front page of the \nWashington Post the day before yesterday had a report about groups of \nimmigrants feeling that they had been mistreated. There was an \nuneasiness on all sides, uneasiness by people who are angry about the \nviolation of our borders, by immigrants who think they are not being \nfairly treated, and a grave concern about the availability of workers \non our farms across America, concerns of the hotel industry and \nlandscapers and restaurateurs about the adequacy of our labor force. So \nthere is no doubt that this is a very significant issue.\n  Last week I circulated to my 99 colleagues a letter, and one page \nsummarizing the study bill--I will call it a study bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the draft proposal and the \none-page letter circulated to all other Senators be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. In conclusion, I emphasize that I am inviting \nsuggestions and comments for improving the bill. The one view that I do \nhave, very strongly, is that it is our pay grade to deal with this \nissue. Only the Congress can deal with the immigration problem, and it \nis a matter of tremendous importance that we do so. We obviously cannot \nsatisfy everyone, but I invite analysis, criticism, and modification.\n  I see my distinguished colleague from Vermont, one of my \ndistinguished colleagues from Vermont, awaiting recognition.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear\n       I believe it is possible to enact comprehensive immigration \n     reform in this Congress, perhaps even in this calendar year, \n     if we make two significant changes in the bill we recently \n     had on the floor.\n       First, a new bill should eliminate the automatic path to \n     citizenship for the approximately 12 million undocumented \n     immigrants. Instead, we should just eliminate the fugitive \n     status for the 12 million so that they would not be fearful \n     every time they see a policeman, be protected from \n     unscrupulous employers who threaten to turn them in if they \n     don't do the employer's bidding, and be free to do things \n     like rent apartments in cities which now preclude that. From \n     soundings I have taken from many senators, that should take \n     the teeth out of the amnesty argument, which was the \n     principal reason for the defeat of the last bill.\n       Second, we should not tamper with the current provisions on \n     family unity with the elaborate point system which was \n     insufficiently thought through. If that is to be ultimately \n     accomplished, we need hearings and a more thoughtful \n     approach.\n       Third, although not indispensable, I believe we should \n     provide more green cards to assist the hitech community.\n       The enclosed draft bill covers these three changes and also \n     includes the guest worker program, the increased border \n     security and enhanced employer verification in the last bill.\n       Because it will be easier to get real border security if we \n     deal with the 12 million undocumented immigrants, I think \n     this proposal presents an alternate and plausible path to \n     achieve comprehensive immigration reform now.\n       I have discussed this proposal with the senators who were \n     part of the core negotiating group and with the relevant \n     interest groups and have received a generally favorable \n     response and, in many cases, an enthusiastic response. \n     Similarly, in discussing the proposed bill with the \n     dissenters, I have heard no strenuous adverse response so I \n     believe it is worthy of a repeat effort. Although the defeat \n     of the bill on the Senate floor was a major disappointment, I \n     think that we proponents of comprehensive immigration reform \n     have significant momentum and these changes, perhaps \n     supplemented by other modifications, could put us over the \n     top.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (9) encouraging the Government of Mexico to create \n     incentives for persons who have migrated to the United States \n     to return to Mexico.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Regarding Bilateral Partnership on \n     Health Care.--It is the sense of Congress that the Government \n     of the United States and the Government of Mexico should \n     enter into a partnership to examine uncompensated and \n     burdensome health care costs incurred by the United States \n     due to legal and illegal immigration, including--\n       (1) increasing health care access for poor and under served \n     populations in Mexico;\n       (2) assisting Mexico in increasing its emergency and trauma \n     health care facilities along the border, with emphasis on \n     expanding prenatal care in the United States-Mexico border \n     region;\n       (3) facilitating the return of stable, incapacitated \n     workers temporarily employed in the United States to Mexico \n     in order to receive extended, long-term care in their home \n     country; and\n       (4) helping the Government of Mexico to establish a program \n     with the private sector to cover the health care needs of \n     Mexican nationals temporarily employed in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 414.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 902. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States Government \n     deemed as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born and \n     300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and their \n     families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification and limited their travel and personal property \n     rights. At that time, these groups were the 2 largest \n     foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (2) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned, or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to European Axis nations, many to be \n     exchanged for Americans held in those nations.\n       (3) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American nations, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were arrested, brought to \n     the United States, and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated, or deported to European Axis nations during \n     World War II, many to be exchanged for Americans and Latin \n     Americans held in those nations.\n       (4) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian American and German American \n     communities, individuals, and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (6) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution or genocide and sought safety in the United \n     States. During the 1930s and 1940s, the quota system, \n     immigration regulations, visa requirements, and the time \n     required to process visa applications affected the number of \n     Jewish refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, \n     who could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (7) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to fully assess and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (8) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. 903.

The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I want to take this opportunity to say \na few words about health care in general and about the needs of our \nchildren in particular. Let me preface my remarks by saying that I \nthink it is clear to most Americans that our health care system today \nis disintegrating, and that we unfortunately and tragically remain the \nonly country in the industrialized world that does not guarantee health \ncare to all of its people as a right of citizenship.\n  Now, I hear a whole lot of talk in the Senate--I heard it in the \nHouse--about health care. But, up front, we should be aware that there \nis something fundamentally wrong in terms of the way we do business \nthat 46 million Americans have zero health insurance, that the cost of \nhealth care is soaring every single year, and that tens of millions of \nAmericans who do have health insurance have very weak insurance \nprograms and are underinsured.\n  On top of all of that, with 46 million uninsured, tens of millions \nunderinsured, we continue to pay by far the highest prices in the world \nfor our prescription drugs. In other words, we have a problem, and the \ntime is long overdue for the Senate to stand up to the insurance \ncompanies and the drug companies and start representing the American \npeople.\n  In my view, the solution is moving us toward a national health care \nprogram which provides health care to every man, woman, and child as a \nright of citizenship.\n  When people say, well, something like that will be very expensive. \nWell, not really. What we have now is clearly the most inefficient and \nwasteful nonsystem in the world by which we are spending twice as much \nper capita for health care as any other major country.\n\n[[Page S10304]]\n\n  So people say: Well, gee, the Canadian system is not perfect; The \nBritish system is not perfect; The Danish system is not perfect. True \nenough. Neither is our system. And we spend twice as much per person on \nhealth care as does any other system.\n  Tonight, and in the coming few days, we are going to be focusing on \nthe needs of our children. In the midst of a nation with 46 million \nuninsured, we have over 9 million children, one in nine, who are also \nuninsured. Every 46 seconds another baby is born uninsured in the \nUnited States.\n  I have heard a lot through my career in the U.S. Congress about \nfamily values. So let me be very clear and suggest that it is not a \nfamily value to live in a country in which 9 million children have no \nhealth insurance at all.\n  Uninsured children are almost 12 times as likely as insured children \nto have an untreated medical need, are four times as likely as insured \nchildren to have an unmet dental need.\n  The statistics go on. An estimated two-thirds of children and \nadolescents with mental health needs are not getting the care they \nneed. Only one in five children with serious emotional disturbances \nreceives specialized treatment. Given this sorry state of affairs, I \nfind it ironic that we are having any debate about increasing health \ncare coverage for children under the CHIP program. It seems to me that \nthe very least this Nation should be doing is providing health \ninsurance to every child in America--something, by the way, this bill \ndoes not do.\n  If this bill, in its current form, were to pass tomorrow, it would \nprovide health insurance to approximately one-third of the children who \nare uninsured--one-third. In my opinion, as we move toward a national \nhealth care program guaranteeing health care to every man, woman, and \nchild, the very least we should be doing is making sure all of our \nchildren are covered. That is why I have recently introduced S. 1564, \nthe All Healthy Children Act of 2007.\n  This bill, in fact, would provide the opportunity for every child in \nAmerica to have health care coverage. In addition, since insurance \ncoverage alone does not guarantee access--in other words, you can have \nhealth insurance, but you cannot necessarily find a doctor or a dentist \nwho will treat you--we must also make certain there is an adequate \nsupply of health professionals and conveniently located sites of care.\n  Along with Senator Murkowski, I have also introduced S. 941, the \nCommunity Health Centers Investment Act, to significantly expand the \nnumber of community-based, federally qualified centers, a proven cost-\neffective system of primary health care that is governed by the people \nwho use it. These health care democracies serve all regardless of \nability to pay and insurance status.\n\n  The issue we are dealing with in terms of health care is not only \nproviding health insurance but making sure there are doctors and \nclinics and hospitals available to treat the people who need the help. \nOne of the crises, of the many we are facing as a nation in terms of \nhealth care, is, believe it or not, we are not producing the doctors we \nneed for today, especially in rural areas and primarily in primary \nhealth care. We are not producing the dentists we need. We are not \nproducing the nurses we need. As our Nation becomes older, those \nproblems will only become more severe.\n  In that regard, I have done what I could and will continue to move \nforward to significantly increase the funding for the National Health \nService Corps, to provide scholarships and loan repayment to those \nchoosing primary care specialties and agreeing to practice in \nunderserved areas. I am happy we are on a path to increase funding for \ncommunity health centers, but clearly we have a long way to go in order \nto fund the national health service.\n  While the debate on these initiatives awaits another day, we must \npass a CHIP bill that matches the House bill in funding level. \nAccordingly, I will be cosponsoring the Kerry amendment to provide \nSCHIP with a $50 billion increased authorization over the next 5 years. \nAt a minimum, though, I certainly hope the Senate passes the bill \napproved by the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I know some of the objections raised about expanding health care \ncoverage for children come from people who think spending the amount of \nmoney proposed in this legislation is too much. I mention to those \nMembers who, in many cases--certainly including the President of the \nUnited States--are supporting the repeal of the inheritance tax, the \nestate tax, to tell them that with the full repeal of the estate tax, \none of the wealthiest families in America would receive in tax breaks \nalmost as much money as we are attempting to spend right now to provide \nhealth care for over 3 million American children. So on the one hand, \nthere are people--the President of the United States, among others--who \nsay we have to repeal the inheritance tax, all of which benefits now \nwill go to the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent. One family getting \n$32 billion, that is a good idea. But to provide $35 billion to provide \nhealth care for over 3 million American children, that is a bad idea. I \nthink those priorities are a little bit backwards.\n  Let me conclude by saying all of us are very proud to be Americans. \nWe want this country to be No. 1 in many respects. It should not give \nany of us pride to know that in every other major country on Earth \nvirtually all of the people have health insurance as a right, have \nlower cost prescription drugs than we do. The idea that today and \ntomorrow we will be debating whether we can afford to provide another 3 \nmillion children with health insurance suggests to me we have a long \nway to go in this debate. We should not only provide health insurance \nto 3 million children, we should provide health insurance to the over 9 \nmillion children who are without health insurance. We should provide \nhealth insurance not just to 9 million uninsured children but to 46 \nmillion uninsured Americans.\n  In my view, health care is a right, not a privilege. The idea that \nthere are people today who are scared to death about what happens when \nthey or their children become ill because of the high cost of health \ninsurance is something that should not take place in this country. This \nbill is a small but important step forward.\n  At the end of the day, we have to join the rest of the industrialized \nworld and make sure all of our people, regardless of income, have high \nquality health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10304-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Madam President, I rise in strong support of Judge Leslie \nSouthwick's nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit.\n  The evaluations, hearings, and investigations are complete.\n  The American Bar Association's highest rating is in.\n  It is time for this body, the United States Senate, to decide whether \nto consent to this judicial nomination by voting up or down. That is \nour role and we should assert it rather than avoid it.\n  Vote yes or vote no, but it is time for this body to do its duty and \nvote on the Southwick nomination.\n  This Senator will proudly vote to confirm this excellent nominee.\n  Before looking specifically at the Southwick nomination, I must \nrespond to some recent remarks made by my Democratic colleagues \nconcerning the confirmation process.\n  Three of their claims require a response.\n  First, Democrats have said that the three appeals court nominees \nconfirmed so far this year are ``three more than were confirmed in this \nsimilar year in the last Clinton term.''\n  That is a factual claim and it is either true or false.\n  An evaluation of this claim is simple:\n  We are in the third year of President Bush's second term and the \nSenate is controlled by the other party.\n  The third year of President Clinton's second term was 1999, when the \nSenate also was controlled by the other party.\n\n[[Page S10305]]\n\n  Democrats, therefore, are claiming that the Senate confirmed no \nappeals court nominees in 1999.\n  That allegation is patently false.\n  In fact, and this is obviously a matter of public record, the Senate \nconfirmed seven appeals court nominees in 1999, more than twice as many \nas the Senate has confirmed so far this year.\n  Now, to give my Democratic colleagues the benefit of the doubt, \nperhaps they intended to refer to a different year during the last \nClinton term.\n  If so, the evaluation is the same with the same conclusion that their \nclaim is patently false.\n  The Senate confirmed seven appeals court nominees in 1997, 13 in \n1998, seven in 1999, and eight in 2000, a presidential election year.\n  That is an average of nine per year and seventeen per Congress.\n  It was my Democratic colleagues who used appeals court confirmations \nin President Clinton's second term as a benchmark for appeals court \nconfirmations in President Bush's second term.\n  By my Democratic colleagues' own standard, they will have to pick up \nthe appeals court confirmation pace to match what Republicans did \nduring President Clinton's second term.\n  The second thing Democrats have claimed is that the judicial vacancy \nrate is at an all-time low.\n  Once again, that claim is false.\n  The judicial vacancy rate has been increasing each year since before \nPresident Bush's re-election.\n  Average vacancies this year are 35 percent higher than in 2004, and \naverage district court vacancies are 62 percent higher.\n  I do not know where my colleagues get their information, but the \njudicial vacancy rate is on the way up, not at an all-time low.\n  The third Democratic claim is that the Republican-controlled \nJudiciary Committee did not give hearings to 70 of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees. This, they say, was a sign of great disrespect.\n  This is the judicial confirmation equivalent of an urban legend but, \nlike other urban legends, constant repetition does not make it any more \ntrue.\n  We may be entitled to our own opinions, but we are not entitled to \nour own set of facts.\n  Not only does this claim, right off the bat, overstate the total by \nmore than 20 percent but, more importantly, it ignores the fact that \nsome judicial nominees do not receive hearings for a variety of \nperfectly legitimate and obvious reasons.\n  My Democratic colleagues, of course, know this but also know that \nmost Americans will not know the difference and many in the media will \nnot bother to sort it out.\n  President Clinton, for example, withdrew a dozen of his own nominees \nfor various reasons, some involving significant and even embarrassing \ncontroversy. Was it disrespectful not to hold a hearing on nominees the \nPresident had withdrawn?\n  President Clinton submitted other nominees too late in a \nCongressional session to permit proper evaluation. Was it a sign of \ngreat disrespect not to give a hearing to a nominee not yet ready for a \nhearing?\n  Other nominees did not receive hearings because they were opposed by \ntheir home-State Senators, a tradition of Senatorial courtesy dating \nwell back into the last century. Are my Democratic colleagues arguing \nthat respecting the wishes of home-State Senators, including some of \nthem, was being disrespectful to the nominees?\n  There are even more reasons, but eliminating these three alone--\nPresidential withdrawals, late nominations, and home-State Senator \nopposition--raises the Democratic margin of error to more than 100 \npercent.\n  The Southwick nomination has none of the problems I just mentioned \nthat prevented confirmation of some Clinton judicial nominees.\n  President Bush has obviously not withdrawn the nomination. He \nsubmitted this nomination on January 9, 2007, when the current 110th \nCongress convened, so there has been more than enough time for \nevaluation and confirmation.\n  In fact, last year the Judiciary Committee thoroughly vetted Judge \nSouthwick when he was initially nominated to the U.S. District Court.\n  We looked at the same man with the same character, the same \nqualifications, and the same record. And we sent the nomination to the \nfull Senate without any opposition, including from any of my Democratic \ncolleagues who today are suddenly raising such a ruckus.\n  To be fair, in the name of full disclosure, I must candidly admit \nthat two important things have changed since last fall, when the \nJudiciary Committee unanimously approved Judge Southwick's nomination.\n  First, Judge Southwick has been nominated to the appeals court rather \nthan to the district court.\n  Second, the American Bar Association has rated Judge Southwick higher \nfor his appointment to the appeals court than they did for his \nappointment to the district court.\n  It makes no sense to me, but I suppose someone somewhere might think \nthat a higher rating justifies more opposition.\n  The higher rating means Judge Southwick gets even higher marks from \nthe ABA for his compassion, open-mindedness, freedom from bias, and \ncommitment to equal justice.\n  If someone can explain how that makes him less qualified for the \nFederal bench, I would like to hear it.\n  Unlike Clinton nominees who did not receive hearings, Judge Southwick \nhas the strong support of both of his home-State Senators.\n  The Senators from Mississippi, Senators Cochran and Lott, are senior \nand highly respected members of this body. Their support ought to mean \nsomething.\n  I have no doubt that if these two fine Senators objected to Judge \nSouthwick receiving a hearing or an up or down vote, the Democrats who \nrun this body would give them the respect they deserve and there would \nbe no vote.\n  It seems, however, that today this traditional courtesy to esteemed \nhome-State Senators is on its way to becoming a one-way street.\n  Both Mississippi Senators have been working with President Bush to \nfill this same seat for more than 5 years, and I think they deserve our \nrespect and support just like we would seek theirs if the situation \nwere reversed.\n  In the last few years of the Clinton administration, a Republican \nSenate confirmed a string of highly controversial appeals court \nnominees who nonetheless had the backing of their home-State Senators.\n  I supported them and today I urge my colleagues to do the same for \nour colleagues from Mississippi and for Judge Southwick.\n  When I came before this body a month ago, I explained why the tactics \nbeing used against Judge Southwick and other judicial nominees are \nillegitimate.\n  It is illegitimate to focus only on a few of the thousands of \ndecisions in which Judge Southwick participated while on the \nMississippi Court of Appeals.\n  It is illegitimate to ignore the facts and the law of those few \ncases.\n  It is illegitimate to ignore the standard of review that Judge \nSouthwick had to follow as an appeals court judge.\n  It is illegitimate to look only at the political interests served by \nthe results of those few cases.\n  It is illegitimate to create a distorted, twisted caricature of this \nnominee, a caricature that is simply unrecognizable by those who know \nhim best and have worked with him most.\n  These are some of the illegitimate tactics being used against this \nfine nominee. I have a hard time believing that any of my colleagues \nwould endorse these tactics or, worse yet, be persuaded by them.\n  As I said, the entire case against this highly qualified nominee \nrests on just two of the 7,000 cases in which he participated, each \ninvolving an opinion which he did not write.\n  If saying that is not enough to reject this empty case against Judge \nSouthwick's confirmation, I fear for the confirmation process and this \nbody's role in judicial appointments.\n  But let me take a minute and look at these two lone decisions that \nsupposedly justify this tirade, this assault, this hatchet job against \nJudge Southwick.\n  The first is titled Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human \nResources.\n  Last week, one of my Democratic colleagues said that this one lone \ndecision creates a perception that Judge\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\nSouthwick will be not be fair in civil rights cases as well as in cases \nabout what he called the rights of ordinary people.\n  I agree with the distinguished Judiciary Committee Ranking Minority \nMember, Senator Specter, who has said that this body should evaluate \njudicial nominees based on facts, not perceptions.\n  Perceptions, after all, can be created with one press release, sound \nbite, letter, interview, or floor speech. If all it takes to justify \nopposition is such a deliberately invented perception, a politically \nmotivated innuendo is all it would takes to defeat a nominee and \ndestroy a good man's reputation.\n  That is wrong, and is another sign that this judicial confirmation \nprocess is steadily degrading.\n  In the Richmond case, a State employee used a racial slur one time. \nThe person to whom it was directed did not hear it and later accepted \nan offered apology. The State review board concluded that these \ncircumstances did not require terminating the employee.\n  To hear the critics describe it, the issue on review before the \nMississippi Court of Appeals was whether racial slurs are good or bad, \nwhether racial slurs ought to be tolerated in the workplace.\n  To hear the critics describe it, the appeals court looked at this \ncase from scratch, had all options open, and could have done anything \nit wanted.\n  The critics know that is not true, but they also know that most \npeople will not know the difference.\n  Apparently, the political or partisan goal of attacking Judge \nSouthwick justifies misleading people about what judges do in general, \nand about this case in particular.\n  The Mississippi Court of Appeals, on which Judge Southwick sat, was \nlimited to reviewing this decision under a specific, narrow standard \ncalled the arbitrary and capricious standard.\n  The appeals court was required to affirm the review board's decision \nif there was any evidence to support it. That is a very deferential \nstandard, and a judge's personal opinion is not enough to overcome it.\n  On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court agreed with Judge \nSouthwick's court that the facts of this case did not require that the \nemployee be terminated.\n  Let me make this very clear.\n  Judge Southwick's critics are not addressing what the court actually \ndid in this case. They are attacking Judge Southwick because his court \ndid not reach a decision it had no authority to reach. No matter what \nyour personal feelings about the issue in the case, that is the wrong \nstandard.\n  It is wrong to suggest that judges are not fair to parties simply \nbecause they rule against them.\n  It is wrong to suggest that judges should prefer politically correct \nresults over legally correct results.\n  Judges do not exist to opine on social problems or address social \ntrends, they exist to decide legal cases.\n  Judges do not exist to serve political interests or pursue policy \nagendas, they exist to settle legal disputes.\n  Judge Southwick apparently understands this much better than his \ncritics. Properly understanding that judges must follow the law rather \nthan their personal opinions is precisely why Judge Southwick should be \nconfirmed.\n  Some have said that this decision shows Judge Southwick has hostile \nviews on race.\n  It does not show his views on that issue one way or another.\n  But if any question remained about Judge Southwick's personal views, \nin his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee--a more \nappropriate setting in which to do it--Judge Southwick made his views \nperfectly clear. He said that this particular slur is always offensive \nand inherently derogatory.\n  If some of my colleagues believe judges should ignore the law and \ndecide cases based on personal views, they should say so.\n  If some of my colleagues believe judges should decide which side is \ngoing to win before a case even starts, they should say so.\n  If some of my colleagues really believe that litigants will get a \nfairer shake before judges who decide cases by personal opinions rather \nthan the law, they should explain such a wrong-headed idea.\n  America's founders did not believe that, I do not believe that, and I \nthink most Americans do not believe that.\n  The other case with which Judge Southwick's critics would indict him \nis titled S.B. v. L.W.\n  In this custody case, all of the relevant factors such as employment, \nincome, home ownership, and community roots, weighted in favor of the \nfather.\n  State statutes and State judicial precedents at the time also favored \nthe heterosexual father over the bisexual mother.\n  The court's job was to review these factors, and the court upheld the \ndecision to give custody to the father. That is what the law required, \nso that is what the court did.\n  So what is it about this decision that Judge Southwick's critics \noffer as the basis to oppose him? That an opinion he joined but did not \nwrite used the phrase ``homosexual lifestyle.''\n  I can accept that some people see this as a negative phrase.\n  But others might see it simply as a factual phrase.\n  The Mississippi Supreme Court used this phrase in the line of cases \nthat Judge Southwick's court had to follow in its decision.\n  The phrase has been used in hundreds of court decisions, on both the \nState and federal level, all across this country. This includes the \nSupreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas, which Judge Southwick's \ncritics no doubt would applaud.\n  It is hardly a stretch to see that this phrase is relevant in a \ncustody case where applicable law makes lifestyle patterns and home \nlife decisions important.\n  This, I say to my colleagues, is the case against Judge Southwick: \ntwo decisions, two opinions he did not write, with results some people \ndo not like but which followed applicable law and stuck to the job the \nappeals court had to do.\n  That so-called case against Judge Southwick is less than \nunpersuasive, it is no case at all.\n  Before I close, I want to repeat a point I made the last time I \naddressed this body about this excellent nominee.\n  In their letter opposing Judge Southwick, the Congressional Black \nCaucus said that we ``should be impressed by the frequency with which \nSouthwick's opinions and concurrences have been overruled.''\n  That is the standard the Congressional Black Caucus recommends that \nwe apply to this nomination.\n  Judge Southwick authored 927 opinions and concurrences while on the \nMississippi Court of Appeals.\n  Only 21 of those 927 opinions and concurrences, or just 2.3 percent, \nhave been either reversed or even criticized by the Mississippi Supreme \nCourt in 12 years.\n  As the Congressional Black Caucus said I should be, I am indeed \nimpressed by the frequency with which Judge Southwick's opinions and \nconcurrences have been overruled. A reversal rate so low is a sign that \nhe is a balanced jurist whose work is highly respected and holds up \nunder scrutiny.\n  This is yet another reason why this excellent nominee should be \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. President, the majority of Americans who disapprove of our job \nperformance has been growing all year, from 56 percent in March and \nApril to nearly 65 percent today.\n  A record low of 14 percent of Americans have confidence in Congress.\n  Perhaps, just perhaps, illegitimate tactics and unfair treatment of \ngood people and outstanding nominees such as Judge Southwick contribute \nto this dismal picture.\n  I hope that changes, not only for the nominees but also for the \nvitality and integrity of this institution.\n  The Southwick nomination is ready for the Senate to decide whether to \ngive its consent by voting up or down.\n  The background checks are done.\n  The ABA's highest rating is in.\n  The questionnaire is complete.\n  The hearings have been conducted.\n  The distinguished home-State Senators have given this nominee their \nstrongest endorsement.\n  None of the factors that stopped, held up, or slowed down past \nnominees exist in this case.\n  There are no reasons or excuses for further delay.\n  The Judiciary Committee and the full Senate should promptly approve \nthis excellent nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10304-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10304-S10307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF LESLIE SOUTHWICK\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in strong support of Judge Leslie \nSouthwick's nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit.\n  The evaluations, hearings, and investigations are complete.\n  The American Bar Association's highest rating is in.\n  It is time for this body, the United States Senate, to decide whether \nto consent to this judicial nomination by voting up or down. That is \nour role and we should assert it rather than avoid it.\n  Vote yes or vote no, but it is time for this body to do its duty and \nvote on the Southwick nomination.\n  This Senator will proudly vote to confirm this excellent nominee.\n  Before looking specifically at the Southwick nomination, I must \nrespond to some recent remarks made by my Democratic colleagues \nconcerning the confirmation process.\n  Three of their claims require a response.\n  First, Democrats have said that the three appeals court nominees \nconfirmed so far this year are ``three more than were confirmed in this \nsimilar year in the last Clinton term.''\n  That is a factual claim and it is either true or false.\n  An evaluation of this claim is simple:\n  We are in the third year of President Bush's second term and the \nSenate is controlled by the other party.\n  The third year of President Clinton's second term was 1999, when the \nSenate also was controlled by the other party.\n\n[[Page S10305]]\n\n  Democrats, therefore, are claiming that the Senate confirmed no \nappeals court nominees in 1999.\n  That allegation is patently false.\n  In fact, and this is obviously a matter of public record, the Senate \nconfirmed seven appeals court nominees in 1999, more than twice as many \nas the Senate has confirmed so far this year.\n  Now, to give my Democratic colleagues the benefit of the doubt, \nperhaps they intended to refer to a different year during the last \nClinton term.\n  If so, the evaluation is the same with the same conclusion that their \nclaim is patently false.\n  The Senate confirmed seven appeals court nominees in 1997, 13 in \n1998, seven in 1999, and eight in 2000, a presidential election year.\n  That is an average of nine per year and seventeen per Congress.\n  It was my Democratic colleagues who used appeals court confirmations \nin President Clinton's second term as a benchmark for appeals court \nconfirmations in President Bush's second term.\n  By my Democratic colleagues' own standard, they will have to pick up \nthe appeals court confirmation pace to match what Republicans did \nduring President Clinton's second term.\n  The second thing Democrats have claimed is that the judicial vacancy \nrate is at an all-time low.\n  Once again, that claim is false.\n  The judicial vacancy rate has been increasing each year since before \nPresident Bush's re-election.\n  Average vacancies this year are 35 percent higher than in 2004, and \naverage district court vacancies are 62 percent higher.\n  I do not know where my colleagues get their information, but the \njudicial vacancy rate is on the way up, not at an all-time low.\n  The third Democratic claim is that the Republican-controlled \nJudiciary Committee did not give hearings to 70 of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees. This, they say, was a sign of great disrespect.\n  This is the judicial confirmation equivalent of an urban legend but, \nlike other urban legends, constant repetition does not make it any more \ntrue.\n  We may be entitled to our own opinions, but we are not entitled to \nour own set of facts.\n  Not only does this claim, right off the bat, overstate the total by \nmore than 20 percent but, more importantly, it ignores the fact that \nsome judicial nominees do not receive hearings for a variety of \nperfectly legitimate and obvious reasons.\n  My Democratic colleagues, of course, know this but also know that \nmost Americans will not know the difference and many in the media will \nnot bother to sort it out.\n  President Clinton, for example, withdrew a dozen of his own nominees \nfor various reasons, some involving significant and even embarrassing \ncontroversy. Was it disrespectful not to hold a hearing on nominees the \nPresident had withdrawn?\n  President Clinton submitted other nominees too late in a \nCongressional session to permit proper evaluation. Was it a sign of \ngreat disrespect not to give a hearing to a nominee not yet ready for a \nhearing?\n  Other nominees did not receive hearings because they were opposed by \ntheir home-State Senators, a tradition of Senatorial courtesy dating \nwell back into the last century. Are my Democratic colleagues arguing \nthat respecting the wishes of home-State Senators, including some of \nthem, was being disrespectful to the nominees?\n  There are even more reasons, but eliminating these three alone--\nPresidential withdrawals, late nominations, and home-State Senator \nopposition--raises the Democratic margin of error to more than 100 \npercent.\n  The Southwick nomination has none of the problems I just mentioned \nthat prevented confirmation of some Clinton judicial nominees.\n  President Bush has obviously not withdrawn the nomination. He \nsubmitted this nomination on January 9, 2007, when the current 110th \nCongress convened, so there has been more than enough time for \nevaluation and confirmation.\n  In fact, last year the Judiciary Committee thoroughly vetted Judge \nSouthwick when he was initially nominated to the U.S. District Court.\n  We looked at the same man with the same character, the same \nqualifications, and the same record. And we sent the nomination to the \nfull Senate without any opposition, including from any of my Democratic \ncolleagues who today are suddenly raising such a ruckus.\n  To be fair, in the name of full disclosure, I must candidly admit \nthat two important things have changed since last fall, when the \nJudiciary Committee unanimously approved Judge Southwick's nomination.\n  First, Judge Southwick has been nominated to the appeals court rather \nthan to the district court.\n  Second, the American Bar Association has rated Judge Southwick higher \nfor his appointment to the appeals court than they did for his \nappointment to the district court.\n  It makes no sense to me, but I suppose someone somewhere might think \nthat a higher rating justifies more opposition.\n  The higher rating means Judge Southwick gets even higher marks from \nthe ABA for his compassion, open-mindedness, freedom from bias, and \ncommitment to equal justice.\n  If someone can explain how that makes him less qualified for the \nFederal bench, I would like to hear it.\n  Unlike Clinton nominees who did not receive hearings, Judge Southwick \nhas the strong support of both of his home-State Senators.\n  The Senators from Mississippi, Senators Cochran and Lott, are senior \nand highly respected members of this body. Their support ought to mean \nsomething.\n  I have no doubt that if these two fine Senators objected to Judge \nSouthwick receiving a hearing or an up or down vote, the Democrats who \nrun this body would give them the respect they deserve and there would \nbe no vote.\n  It seems, however, that today this traditional courtesy to esteemed \nhome-State Senators is on its way to becoming a one-way street.\n  Both Mississippi Senators have been working with President Bush to \nfill this same seat for more than 5 years, and I think they deserve our \nrespect and support just like we would seek theirs if the situation \nwere reversed.\n  In the last few years of the Clinton administration, a Republican \nSenate confirmed a string of highly controversial appeals court \nnominees who nonetheless had the backing of their home-State Senators.\n  I supported them and today I urge my colleagues to do the same for \nour colleagues from Mississippi and for Judge Southwick.\n  When I came before this body a month ago, I explained why the tactics \nbeing used against Judge Southwick and other judicial nominees are \nillegitimate.\n  It is illegitimate to focus only on a few of the thousands of \ndecisions in which Judge Southwick participated while on the \nMississippi Court of Appeals.\n  It is illegitimate to ignore the facts and the law of those few \ncases.\n  It is illegitimate to ignore the standard of review that Judge \nSouthwick had to follow as an appeals court judge.\n  It is illegitimate to look only at the political interests served by \nthe results of those few cases.\n  It is illegitimate to create a distorted, twisted caricature of this \nnominee, a caricature that is simply unrecognizable by those who know \nhim best and have worked with him most.\n  These are some of the illegitimate tactics being used against this \nfine nominee. I have a hard time believing that any of my colleagues \nwould endorse these tactics or, worse yet, be persuaded by them.\n  As I said, the entire case against this highly qualified nominee \nrests on just two of the 7,000 cases in which he participated, each \ninvolving an opinion which he did not write.\n  If saying that is not enough to reject this empty case against Judge \nSouthwick's confirmation, I fear for the confirmation process and this \nbody's role in judicial appointments.\n  But let me take a minute and look at these two lone decisions that \nsupposedly justify this tirade, this assault, this hatchet job against \nJudge Southwick.\n  The first is titled Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human \nResources.\n  Last week, one of my Democratic colleagues said that this one lone \ndecision creates a perception that Judge\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\nSouthwick will be not be fair in civil rights cases as well as in cases \nabout what he called the rights of ordinary people.\n  I agree with the distinguished Judiciary Committee Ranking Minority \nMember, Senator Specter, who has said that this body should evaluate \njudicial nominees based on facts, not perceptions.\n  Perceptions, after all, can be created with one press release, sound \nbite, letter, interview, or floor speech. If all it takes to justify \nopposition is such a deliberately invented perception, a politically \nmotivated innuendo is all it would takes to defeat a nominee and \ndestroy a good man's reputation.\n  That is wrong, and is another sign that this judicial confirmation \nprocess is steadily degrading.\n  In the Richmond case, a State employee used a racial slur one time. \nThe person to whom it was directed did not hear it and later accepted \nan offered apology. The State review board concluded that these \ncircumstances did not require terminating the employee.\n  To hear the critics describe it, the issue on review before the \nMississippi Court of Appeals was whether racial slurs are good or bad, \nwhether racial slurs ought to be tolerated in the workplace.\n  To hear the critics describe it, the appeals court looked at this \ncase from scratch, had all options open, and could have done anything \nit wanted.\n  The critics know that is not true, but they also know that most \npeople will not know the difference.\n  Apparently, the political or partisan goal of attacking Judge \nSouthwick justifies misleading people about what judges do in general, \nand about this case in particular.\n  The Mississippi Court of Appeals, on which Judge Southwick sat, was \nlimited to reviewing this decision under a specific, narrow standard \ncalled the arbitrary and capricious standard.\n  The appeals court was required to affirm the review board's decision \nif there was any evidence to support it. That is a very deferential \nstandard, and a judge's personal opinion is not enough to overcome it.\n  On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court agreed with Judge \nSouthwick's court that the facts of this case did not require that the \nemployee be terminated.\n  Let me make this very clear.\n  Judge Southwick's critics are not addressing what the court actually \ndid in this case. They are attacking Judge Southwick because his court \ndid not reach a decision it had no authority to reach. No matter what \nyour personal feelings about the issue in the case, that is the wrong \nstandard.\n  It is wrong to suggest that judges are not fair to parties simply \nbecause they rule against them.\n  It is wrong to suggest that judges should prefer politically correct \nresults over legally correct results.\n  Judges do not exist to opine on social problems or address social \ntrends, they exist to decide legal cases.\n  Judges do not exist to serve political interests or pursue policy \nagendas, they exist to settle legal disputes.\n  Judge Southwick apparently understands this much better than his \ncritics. Properly understanding that judges must follow the law rather \nthan their personal opinions is precisely why Judge Southwick should be \nconfirmed.\n  Some have said that this decision shows Judge Southwick has hostile \nviews on race.\n  It does not show his views on that issue one way or another.\n  But if any question remained about Judge Southwick's personal views, \nin his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee--a more \nappropriate setting in which to do it--Judge Southwick made his views \nperfectly clear. He said that this particular slur is always offensive \nand inherently derogatory.\n  If some of my colleagues believe judges should ignore the law and \ndecide cases based on personal views, they should say so.\n  If some of my colleagues believe judges should decide which side is \ngoing to win before a case even starts, they should say so.\n  If some of my colleagues really believe that litigants will get a \nfairer shake before judges who decide cases by personal opinions rather \nthan the law, they should explain such a wrong-headed idea.\n  America's founders did not believe that, I do not believe that, and I \nthink most Americans do not believe that.\n  The other case with which Judge Southwick's critics would indict him \nis titled S.B. v. L.W.\n  In this custody case, all of the relevant factors such as employment, \nincome, home ownership, and community roots, weighted in favor of the \nfather.\n  State statutes and State judicial precedents at the time also favored \nthe heterosexual father over the bisexual mother.\n  The court's job was to review these factors, and the court upheld the \ndecision to give custody to the father. That is what the law required, \nso that is what the court did.\n  So what is it about this decision that Judge Southwick's critics \noffer as the basis to oppose him? That an opinion he joined but did not \nwrite used the phrase ``homosexual lifestyle.''\n  I can accept that some people see this as a negative phrase.\n  But others might see it simply as a factual phrase.\n  The Mississippi Supreme Court used this phrase in the line of cases \nthat Judge Southwick's court had to follow in its decision.\n  The phrase has been used in hundreds of court decisions, on both the \nState and federal level, all across this country. This includes the \nSupreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas, which Judge Southwick's \ncritics no doubt would applaud.\n  It is hardly a stretch to see that this phrase is relevant in a \ncustody case where applicable law makes lifestyle patterns and home \nlife decisions important.\n  This, I say to my colleagues, is the case against Judge Southwick: \ntwo decisions, two opinions he did not write, with results some people \ndo not like but which followed applicable law and stuck to the job the \nappeals court had to do.\n  That so-called case against Judge Southwick is less than \nunpersuasive, it is no case at all.\n  Before I close, I want to repeat a point I made the last time I \naddressed this body about this excellent nominee.\n  In their letter opposing Judge Southwick, the Congressional Black \nCaucus said that we ``should be impressed by the frequency with which \nSouthwick's opinions and concurrences have been overruled.''\n  That is the standard the Congressional Black Caucus recommends that \nwe apply to this nomination.\n  Judge Southwick authored 927 opinions and concurrences while on the \nMississippi Court of Appeals.\n  Only 21 of those 927 opinions and concurrences, or just 2.3 percent, \nhave been either reversed or even criticized by the Mississippi Supreme \nCourt in 12 years.\n  As the Congressional Black Caucus said I should be, I am indeed \nimpressed by the frequency with which Judge Southwick's opinions and \nconcurrences have been overruled.

CON. RES. 21\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, section 301 of S. Con. Res. 21, the 2008 \nbudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for \nlegislation that reauthorizes the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, SCHIP. Section 301 authorizes the revisions provided that \ncertain conditions are met, including that the legislation not result \nin more than $50 billion in outlays over the period of fiscal years \n2007 through 2012 and that the legislation not worsen the deficit over \nthe period of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of fiscal \nyears 2007 through 2017.\n  I find that S. 1893, which was reported to the Senate on July 27, \n2007, and will be offered as a complete substitute to H.R. 976, \nsatisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for SCHIP \nlegislation. Therefore, pursuant to section 301, I am adjusting the \naggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation \nprovided to the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to S. Con. \nRes. 21 printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008--S.

Madam President, last week when the Senate considered the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Bill, I offered an amendment, numbered \n2406, with my good friend and partner from Montana, Jon Tester. Our \namendment would bar funds appropriated in the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill from being used to establish a national ID card.\n  Benjamin Franklin once said, ``They that can give up essential \nliberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor \nsafety.''\n  Generations of Americans have fought for both our liberty and safety.\n  America's Founders sought the freedom to lead their lives as they \nchose--freedom of religion, speech, and assembly. Freedom, above all \nother motives, led them to cross the ocean find a new home in America.\n  Whether defending our liberty from British colonial governors, Nazi \naggression, or today's Islamic radicals, Americans have never tired in \ntheir effort to stand up in defense of our liberty.\n  But sometimes the threat to liberty is not as obvious as a red-coated \narmy or a German panzer division. Sometimes, the threat is much harder \nto see but just as dangerous.\n  The threat I speak of today is a national ID card.\n  A national ID card may sound harmless to some. Indeed, a number of \npoliticians have called for giving every citizen a national ID card. \nThey argue that a national identification card would make it harder for \nterrorists to use fake identification to enter the country.\n  But a national ID card has the potential to be abused. Such a card \ncould become a system of identity papers, databases, status and \nidentity checks, and Federal surveillance used to track and control \nindividuals' movements and activities. It could, in effect, create an \ninternal U.S. passport.\n  Some have argued that a national ID is essential to protecting \nAmericans from terrorism. I strongly disagree.\n  In response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, Congress passed \nthe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. This act \nprovided a number of improvements to our Nation's driver's licenses.\n  I support these reasonable efforts to secure our State driver's \nlicenses from terrorists. However, a national ID card would just give \nGovernment bureaucrats another chance to meddle in the private lives of \nregular law-abiding Americans.\n  Just to get on a plane, go in a Federal building, or drive down the \nroad, you would have to have the permission of some bureaucrat in \nWashington.\n  If a national ID card were established, we would be right back here \non the Senate floor debating whether citizens would be required to \ncarry them at all times or pondering what citizens are allowed to do \nwithout a national ID card.\n  A National ID card would be a terrible loss of freedom in this \ncountry.\n  Foreign countries with the worst civil liberties records in the world \nrequire their citizens to carry a national ID at all times. They have \nlegal punishments for people caught without their IDs.\n  Take Zimbabwe, for example. They passed a law in November which \nrequired all citizens to carry a national ID. Citizens face a fine or \nimprisonment if they refuse to carry the ID.\n  History has taught us that national ID cards can lead to dangerous \nand destructive government policies. National ID cards played important \nroles in the genocides of both Nazi Germany and Rwanda.\n  The apartheid-era Government of South Africa used national \nidentification documents as internal passports to oppress the country's \nnative population.\n  Clearly, a national ID would be wrong for the United States. I am \nproud to say my home State of Montana would be the first to reject any \neffort to impose this sort of system.\n  Montana's leadership has spoken, and I have heard them loud and \nclear; get the Federal Government out of the business of telling the \nStates how to produce driver's licenses and ID cards.\n  My friend, Montana's Governor Brian Schweitzer, signed a law in April \nthat bans Montana's Department of Motor Vehicles from enforcing the \nrequirements of the Real ID act. Republicans and Democrats alike in \nMontana's Legislature have voted unanimously to reject Real ID. I am \nproud of Montana's vigilant stand against the Federal Government's \nencroachment.\n  It is wrong for politicians in Washington to burden State authorities \nwith excessive regulations. We must allow our States to take \ninitiatives as well. We should never try to micromanage them. They know \nhow to do their job.\n  Mr. President this is not a partisan issue. Organizations from the \nleft, the ACLU, join hands with groups from the right, the NRA, and \nraise serious concerns about the establishment of a national ID card.\n\n[[Page S10308]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join the chorus of Americans and support this \namendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to amplify my brief earlier \nstatement regarding my vote against the DeMint amendment No. 2481 to \nthe fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations Act.\n  On February 28, 2007, during Senate consideration of the Improving \nAmerica's Security by Implementing Unfinished Recommendations of the 9/\n11 Commission Act of 2007, there were two side-by-side votes on \namendments related to criminal offenses which disqualify an applicant \nfrom receiving a transportation worker identification credential.\n  The first vote was on an amendment offered by Senator Inouye. This \namendment, amendment No. 285, specified certain criminal offenses which \nwould disqualify an applicant from receiving the transportation worker \nidentification credential but gave the U.S. Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity the authority to add to or modify the listed offenses in a \nrulemaking. I voted in favor of this amendment because I believe the \nSecretary ought to have the authority to modify the existing list of \ncrimes when circumstances warrant a regulatory change, and the \namendment was adopted by a vote of 58 to 37.\n  The second vote was on an amendment offered by Senator DeMint. This \namendment, amendment No. 279, was identical to the previous amendment \noffered by Senator Inouye aside from its omission of Secretarial \nauthority to modify the list of existing offenses. Since these \namendments were in direct contradiction with one another over the issue \nof granting the Secretary authority to modify the existing list, I \nvoted against the DeMint amendment. Nevertheless, it was adopted by a \nvote of 94 to 2, with 56 Senators voting to contradict the position \nthey had taken on the previous amendment.\n  Therefore, when the question came up on the DeMint amendment No. 2481 \nto the fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, which \nwould have prohibited funds provided in the act from being expended by \nthe Secretary to remove offenses from the list of criminal offenses \ndisqualifying individuals from receiving a transportation worker \nidentification credential, I voted against it, not only because I \nbelieve it is sound public policy to require flexibility on such \nmatters but also because it was consistent with my position on the \nInouye amendment to the Improving America's Security by Implementing \nUnfinished Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The \nDeMint amendment No. 2481 was adopted by a vote of 93 to 1 even though \nit was again in direct contradiction to the position taken by the \nSenate when it adopted the Inouye amendment to the Improving America's \nSecurity by Implementing Unfinished Recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission Act of 2007.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I was pleased to support the fiscal \nyear 2008 Homeland Security appropriations bill. Our national security \nstrategy needs to adapt in order to meet new and emerging threats while \nensuring those in charge of protecting us have the resources they need. \nI am pleased to support the current Homeland Security appropriations \nbill which includes many important measures to keep our communities \nsafe.\n  The Senate unanimously accepted my amendment to improve the Safe \nSkies program that I established a few years ago. The amendment will \nencourage the Transportation Security Administration and the airlines \nto better implement legislation I authored that allows first responders \nto volunteer to help flight crews in the event of an onboard emergency.\n  The bill would increase funding for State fire fighter and emergency \nmanagement grants. Along with a bipartisan coalition of Senators, I \nwrote to Senate appropriators earlier in the year asking that they \nincrease funding for these important grants. The appropriators agreed \nwith our recommendations and recommended $700,000,000 for fire fighter \ngrants and $300,000,000 for emergency management performance grants. \nThese funds will help State and local agencies obtain the equipment and \ntraining they need to protect us against terrorist incidents and \nnatural disasters.\n  I was disappointed that an amendment I cosponsored to fund \ndecontamination units for the National Guard's Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Civil Support Teams, WMD-CST, did not receive a vote. As a \nresult of legislation I authored, every State in this Nation now has a \nfunctional WMD-CST. The Department of Defense recently announced that \nit will soon finalize the certifications of all of these teams. I will \ncontinue to work to ensure that the National Guard receives the funds \nit needs to perform its homeland security operations.\n  The bill would appropriate the funds needed to hire 3,000 additional \nborder patrol agents. This important provision will help us secure our \nborders and restore credibility to our immigration system. While I was \ndeeply disappointed that the Senate was unable to reach a bipartisan \ncompromise to implement comprehensive immigration reform, I am pleased \nthat the bill will help improve our border security. I also supported \nan amendment offered by Senator Graham to appropriate an additional $3 \nbillion for additional border agents, infrastructure and technology. I \nwas concerned that the amendment was not offset and that it authorized \nbuilding 700 miles of fencing, which has not been demonstrated to be a \nrealistic or cost-effective method of securing the border. However, I \nsupported the amendment because the personnel, infrastructure, and \ntechnology provisions represent important steps toward border security, \nwhich is one of our top homeland security priorities.\n  The bill would permit States to enact chemical security regulations \nthat are stronger than Federal regulations. Chemical security \nregulations are an urgent homeland security priority, and I support the \nability of the States to set tougher standards.\n  Wisconsin residents and Americans across the country are concerned \nabout the serious backlog in passport application process. This bill \nwould delay the implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel \nInitiative to keep the backlog from increasing until we have a chance \nto resolve this issue.\n  I voted to table an amendment offered by Senator Alexander that would \nhave reduced funding for border, port and air security in order to \nprovide increased funding for implementation of the REAL ID Act. That \nact is deeply flawed. While I am concerned that it remains an unfunded \npriority, I am also concerned that, if we head down the road of funding \nthis misguided policy, the Senate will not take the necessary steps to \nreform the REAL ID Act. Moreover, the National Governors Association \nhas estimated that the cost of implementing the REAL ID Act could reach \n$11 billion, which means that the increased funding provided by this \namendment, $400 million, would do little to address the unfunded \nmandate of REAL ID while taking away money for pressing homeland \nsecurity priorities. I will continue to push for reform of the REAL ID \nAct, to provide for proper funding of any Federal mandate in the \nreformed act, and to ensure that the implementation of the act is not \nrushed.\n  We are still spending almost twice as much on Iraq as is allocated \nfor homeland security, diplomacy, and international assistance \ncombined. The billions we spend each month in Iraq could be better \ninvested in the protection of critical infrastructure and our system of \nnational preparedness and response that failed in the wake of Hurricane \nKatrina. As we consider the defense appropriation this fall, I \nencourage my colleagues to take a broader view when it comes to our \nnational security priorities and make the tradeoffs that must be made.\n  This bill would significantly increase spending on homeland security. \nI do not take lightly a decision to vote in favor of spending the \ntaxpayers' money. Fiscal responsibility is one of my highest \npriorities, but it is imperative that we provide the resources needed \nto combat al-Qaida and its affiliates and protect the country.\n  I am pleased that the bill would appropriate funds to double the \nfrequency of spot checks at regulated port facilities across the \ncountry, to conduct vulnerability assessments at 10 high risk ports, to \ncreate a radiation detection test center to help scan cargo and to \npurchase and install explosives detection equipment at airports. Much \nmore remains to be done. I will continue to work to ensure that our \nnational security strategies address the range of\n\n[[Page S10309]]\n\nthreats we face and properly prioritizes homeland security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10309-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10309-S10310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I wish to discuss several provisions in \nthe conference bill, H.R. 1, Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission Act of 2007. As chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, \nI wish to thank Senators Lieberman, Collins, Dodd, and Shelby for \nworking with me and my staff on provisions that will protect seniors in \nthe event of an emergency or disaster.\n  It has been nearly 2 years since our Nation reeled from the tragic \nand shameful images of seniors abandoned during the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina. Sadly, we now know that 71 percent of the people who \ndied were older than 60. Last year, the Special Committee on Aging held \na hearing to examine how prepared the Nation is to care for our seniors \nin the event of a national emergency. What we learned was \ndisheartening.\n  We learned that our Nation is woefully unprepared to meet the unique \nneeds of our seniors in the event of a terrorist attack, natural \ndisaster, or other emergency. Cookie-cutter emergency plans are of \nlittle use to seniors, especially those who depend on others for \nassistance in their daily lives. We need specific plans, programs, and \ninformation for all seniors facing emergencies.\n  That is why I teamed up with Senator Coleman to continue to work with \nthe committees of jurisdiction to ensure that the Departments of \nHomeland Security and Transportation place seniors on the forefront of \ntheir emergency planning agenda. These provisions are an important step \ntoward ensuring that seniors are not overlooked but are protected when \nthe next national emergency occurs.\n  I thank Senators Lieberman and Collins again for working with us to \ninclude two important provisions in titles I and IV that will address \nemergency preparedness and planning for older individuals.\n  The first provision we have successfully included amends the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002 to ensure that as State, local, and tribal \ngovernments develop their mass-evacuation plans they include specific \nprocedures to inform the elderly before and during an evacuation. This \nwill send a strong signal to States and communities that are engaged in \nemergency planning that seniors must be a priority and cannot be \nforgotten or ignored during mass evacuations. This will also assist \nolder individuals and their families in appropriately preparing for an \nevacuation during an emergency or other disaster.\n  The second provision we have included amends the Post-Katrina \nEmergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to ensure that the National \nExercise Program is designed to address the unique needs of older \nindividuals. The National Exercise Program was originally created to \ntest and evaluate our Nation's level of preparedness and capability to \nprevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from national \ndisasters. Such testing and evaluation will allow emergency management \nentities to effectively identify, assess, and improve vulnerabilities \nat the State, local, and tribal levels. This provision will keep older \nindividuals on the forefront of national emergency planning.\n  I thank Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby again for working \nwith us to successfully include and expand upon our original provision \nin title XIV, supported by the American Public Health Association, \nwhich would ensure that public transportation workers and other related \nemployees are trained to meet the evacuation needs of seniors in the \nevent of a crisis. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a \nprogram to conduct security exercises, which will be scaled to meet the \nneeds of specific transportation systems and must take into account the \nneeds of seniors who utilize those systems. Additionally, another \nprovision in this title will ensure that transportation agencies \nreceiving grant funding in high-risk areas have mandatory security \nplans in place that must include appropriate evacuation and \ncommunication measures for the elderly as a component of each agency's \nplan. Both provisions are particularly important since so many of our \nseniors utilize public transportation for access to their everyday \nneeds. Furthermore, only public transportation has the capacity to move \nmillions of people and provide first responders with critical support \nin major evacuations of urban areas.\n  Mr. President, these four provisions will go a long way in ensuring \nthat our seniors are taken care of if we have another national \nemergency or disaster. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita taught us many \npainful lessons that should never be forgotten. I will not forget, and \nI intend to pursue additional legislation aimed at explicitly \nsafeguarding the needs of America's seniors in the event of an \nemergency. The time to act to protect our seniors is now.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I want to add my thoughts to the \ndebate on the conference report accompanying the Improving America's \nSecurity Act of 2007.\n  First, I want to preface my remarks by applauding the chairman and \nranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee for their work on this important bill. This bill makes \ncrucial and long overdue improvements in transportation security, \ncritical infrastructure protection and emergency response capabilities. \nThere is no higher priority than protecting homeland security and this \nbill is a key component in that effort.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Federal Agency Data Mining \nReporting Act is included in this bill as Section 804. I have been \nworking on this legislation for a number of years with Senator Sununu, \nSenator Leahy, and Senator Akaka. Many law-abiding Americans are \nunderstandably concerned about the specter of secret government \nprograms analyzing vast quantities of public and private data about \ntheir pursuits, in search of patterns of suspicious activity. Four \nyears after we first learned about the Defense Department's program \ncalled Total Information Awareness, there is still much Congress does \nnot know about the Federal Government's work on data mining. This bill \nis an important step in allowing Congress to conduct oversight of any \nsuch programs or related research development efforts.\n  I supported the provision in the Senate bill which mandates the \ndeclassification of the aggregate amount of the intelligence budget. It \nis unfortunate that this provision was watered down during the \nconference process to permit the President to waive this requirement if \nthe disclosure of this information would harm national security. The 9/\n11 Commission found that ``when even aggregate categorical numbers \nremain hidden it is hard to judge priorities and foster \naccountability.'' I concur with the Commission, that aggregate budget \nfigures ``provid[e] little insight into U.S. intelligence sources and \nmethods.'' Sharing this information with the American people will \nprovide a greater level of transparency and accountability and in the \nend make us more secure.\n  I am pleased that this bill includes provisions to ensure proper \noversight of homeland security grants. The bill requires regular \nauditing of homeland security grant funds to ensure that they funds are \nspent appropriately and effectively. I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues to improve oversight of homeland security funding.\n  The conference report also includes important nonproliferation \nprovisions. It would establish a Presidential coordinator for the \nprevention of WMD proliferation and terrorism. Currently, there is no \npoint person in the Federal Government in charge of coordinating \nnonproliferation initiatives and efforts to prevent nuclear terrorism. \nWe face a variety of worldwide terrorist threats. One of the most \nserious of those threats is the possibility that terrorists could \nsmuggle fissile materials into the United States. This provision is an \nimportant contribution to our efforts to secure these materials and \nprevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  I must note that one provision of this bill troubles me greatly. That \nis the so-called John Doe provision concerning immunity for citizens \nmaking tips of possible terrorist threats and government officials \nacting on those tips. This provision was not in the bill that was \npassed in the Senate, nor was it in the bill that passed the House. It \nwas apparently inspired by a lawsuit filed\n\n[[Page S10310]]\n\nafter six Muslim imams were told to get off a plane they had boarded in \nMinneapolis, but the Judiciary Committee never had the opportunity to \nstudy it or perfect it. Regardless of its merit, this provision should \nhave received more careful consideration by the Senate. I am deeply \nconcerned that as written this provision appears to endorse racial, \nethnic, and religious discrimination. The best way to prevent terrorism \nis through solid law enforcement and intelligence work, not through \nscare tactics or racial profiling.\n  I voted for this bill because it makes key changes to address \nsecurity needs. However, our Nation's vulnerabilities demand more and I \nwill continue to work to ensure that our vital homeland security needs \nare met.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10310-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF PAUL CULLINAN\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, as chairman of the Budget Committee, and \nalong with my colleague, Senator Gregg, the ranking member, I would \nlike to gratefully acknowledge the expert assistance that the Congress \nhas received from Paul Cullinan during his time at the Congressional \nBudget Office. Paul is retiring from congressional service in August, \nand this institution will sorely miss him.\n  Dr. Cullinan arrived at CBO in 1981, and has contributed to a vast \nrange of policy analyses, budget projections, and legislative cost \nestimates over the past 26 years. But more important than the amount \nand variety of such work is the consistently high quality of that work \nand Paul's continual dedication to providing the Congress with thorough \nand timely analysis.\n  For the past 13 years, Paul Cullinan has served as the unit chief of \nCBO's Human Resources Cost Estimates Unit. He excelled in that role, \nand his service there allowed CBO to provide critical support to \nconsideration of many varied pieces of legislation, including: efforts \nto reauthorize and extend higher education programs and the food stamps \nprogram, potential changes to Social Security, proposals to reform U.S. \nimmigration policies, and changes to a host of income security \nprograms. Moreover, Paul has been a key contributor to and coordinator \nof CBO's work on long-term budget projections, which we have come to \nconsider more as we move toward the pending retirement of the baby-boom \ngeneration.\n  In addition to his superb analysis of legislative proposals, Paul has \nprovided constant and wise support to the Budget Committees in both the \nSenate and the House of Representatives. In short, there are only a \nhandful of true first-tier budget experts here on Capitol Hill, and \nPaul Cullinan is clearly in the top ranks of that small group--we will \nmiss his input, careful judgment, and dedication to providing the best \nbudgetary information possible for congressional consideration.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I join with Senator Conrad in recognizing \nPaul Cullinan of the Congressional Budget Office. Paul's leadership, \nextremely dedicated work, and the products of his unit have been \nessential to understanding entitlement programs and the long-term \nfiscal condition of the United States. Paul has served CBO Directors \nand Budget Committee Members of the House and Senate with distinction. \nHe represents the type of dedicated public servants whom we are \nfortunate to have at the CBO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10310-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam. President, today I rise in support of the \nUnemployment Insurance Modernization Act which was introduced on July \n25. I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators Edward M. Kennedy, \nOlympia J. Snowe, John D. Rockefeller IV, and Maria Cantwell to \nintroduce this bipartisan proposal which seeks to encourage States to \nmodernize their unemployment insurance systems. The Unemployment \nInsurance Modernization Act would make $7 billion in incentive payments \navailable to States to encourage them to expand eligibility for \nbenefits and provide training to workers struggling with long-term \nunemployment.\n  The unemployment insurance, UI, program must be reformed to address \nfundamental shifts in the economy. The UI system provides needed \nbenefits to millions of U.S. workers each year. But the system needs to \nbe updated to better assist today's more highly mobile workforce and \nlong-term unemployed workers left behind by declining industries. \nToday, many unemployed workers do not qualify for benefits because \ntheir most recent work is not taken into account. Others exhaust their \nbenefits before finding work, joining 1.1 million long-term unemployed \nworkers and an additional 1.5 million discouraged job-seekers \nstruggling to get by. For these reasons, only 35 percent of unemployed \nworkers currently collect unemployment benefits.\n  The UI Modernization Act sets aside $7 billion from tax receipts \nauthorized under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, FUTA, to provide \nincentive payments to encourage States to update their UI systems. The \nbill rewards states for: (1) removing barriers that block coverage for \nlow-wage and part-time workers; (2) ensuring a more family-friendly UI \nsystem; and (3) helping dislocated workers increase their skills. It \nalso provides $500 million in funding to States to improve the \nadministration of their unemployment compensation systems. These \nadministrative payments are fully paid for from the existing UI trust \nfund.\n  The UI Modernization Act would give States the resources and \nflexibility they need to pass important reforms. Each State would have \na chance to receive a share of the $7 billion set aside for incentive \npayments. To receive one-third of its allotted funds, a State must \nadopt an ``alternative base period'' allowing workers to meet \neligibility requirements by counting their most recent wages. This \nmakes the system--which has traditionally relied on wage data that is \nup to 6 months old more accurate and helps workers who have recently \nsatisfied earnings requirements to collect the benefits they deserve. \nStates that have already adopted such a system would also receive these \nincentive payments.\n  States will receive the additional two-thirds of their share of funds \nif they adopt or have adopted two of the following reforms that benefit \nworkers: (1) provide unemployment compensation for workers who have \nvoluntarily left their jobs due to the illness or disability of an \nimmediate family member, the relocation of a spouse for employment, or \ndomestic violence; (2) provide training benefits to unemployed workers \nlaid off from a ``declining'' occupation who are enrolled in a State-\napproved training program for entry into a high-demand occupation; (3) \nprovide unemployment compensation benefits to individuals seeking part-\ntime work; (4) raise maximum compensation caps so that all long-term \nunemployed workers can receive a full 26 weeks of benefits; or (5) pay \nunemployed workers at least an extra $15 per week for each of the \nworker's dependents.\n  Mr. President, in periods of unemployment, workers need a sound \nprogram of training and benefits to find new and rewarding \nopportunities. This bill will provide important resources to States \nlike Virginia, as they improve their programs to help workers and their \nfamilies in times of need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10310-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10310-S10311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, despite the outcry for change in the wake \nof the deadliest shooting rampage in our Nation's history, too many \nschools continue to be plagued by gun violence. True prevention \nrequires reducing the likelihood of death or injury before an incident \noccurs. Unfortunately, we have still not done enough to prevent \ndangerous guns from falling into the hands of those who may \nintentionally or unintentionally use them to harm themselves or others.\n  Earlier this month, a group of engineering students at Kettering \nUniversity, in Flint, MI, gathered in an apartment to celebrate the \nbeginning of their 3-month job co-ops, part of their degree \nrequirements. One of the students stumbled across a 9mm handgun lying \non a dresser in one of the apartment's bedrooms. He picked up the \nweapon, and, after seeing himself in a mirror, made a sudden spin move \nwith it. As he spun around, the gun accidentally discharged. Karl \nJoseph Hansen, 21 years old and asleep at the time, died of a single \ngunshot wound to the head.\n  Because a loaded handgun was present in an otherwise unremarkable\n\n[[Page S10311]]\n\ncelebration, one student was left dead and another has been charged \nwith involuntary manslaughter, a felony punishable by up to 15 years in \nprison. Such an event is extremely difficult to comprehend. For the \npeople and families directly involved, it is nearly impossible.\n  Shortly after the tragedy at Kettering University, following a heavy \nnight of drinking, an undergraduate student at Yale University decided \nit would be a good idea to fire one of his pistols in the basement of \nhis fraternity house. When he heard the shots, a visitor to the school \nran downstairs to investigate. The student responded to the visitor's \nrequests for him to put the gun down by firing two rounds of blanks at \nthe ceiling. When the visitor then tried to convince the student even \nblanks could be dangerous, he is reported to have responded by asking \n``Why don't I point it at your head and find out?'' When the student \nwas subsequently arrested, police discovered an AK-47 assault rifle, \nAR-15 assault rifle, two rifles, a shotgun, several other pistols and \nnearly 5,000 rounds of ammunition in his bedroom. He has been charged \nwith two counts of illegal possession of an assault rifle, unlawful \ndischarge of a firearm, reckless endangerment in the first degree, \nthreatening in the second degree, and breach of peace in the second \ndegree.\n  Time after time, we see these tragedies reported in the news. Yet \nCongress has not taken the necessary steps to help control these acts \nof violence or ease the anxiety that many parents and families feel \neach day as their children head off to school. By removing firearms \nfrom potentially dangerous situations, we can prevent these types of \ntragedies from occurring. Congress should take up and pass sensible gun \nlegislation as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10311-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10311-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. REED.

It is the first reauthorization of the highly \nsuccessful Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. I am proud to \nhave been a part of the original bipartisan effort to create this \ninitiative back in 1997. While some on the other side of the aisle will \ncriticize the Finance Committee agreement pending before this Chamber, \nno one can deny CHIP has played a crucial role in helping to reduce the \nrate of uninsured low-income children over the past 10 years. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the number of uninsured \nchildren fell from 22.5 percent in 1996 to 16.9 percent in 2005 due in \nlarge part to CHIP.\n  I look forward to a vigorous and spirited debate on this bill, and I \nam dedicated to working very closely with my colleagues to ensure the \nSenate will advance a reauthorization bill that reaffirms our \ncommitment to health insurance coverage for children in Rhode Island \nand around the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10311-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10311-S10312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               COMMEMORATING THE 1997 SPRING CREEK FLOOD\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, today I commemorate the Spring \nCreek Flood in Fort Collins, CO, which occurred 10 years ago this \nweekend. As the rains began to fall on the evening of July 27, 1997, it \nwould have been hard for anyone to believe that this seemingly typical \nsummer afternoon storm would wreak havoc on the city.\n  All told, 14.5 inches fell on Fort Collins within a 31-hour period of \ntime. Composite rainfall patterns indicated that over 10 inches of rain \nblanketed a 30 square mile area of northern Colorado. This flood took \nthe lives of 5 Fort Collins residents and forced over 400 to be rescued \nfrom the rising waters, severely damaged or destroyed approximately \n2,000 homes and businesses across the city, caused over $200 million in \ndamage, including the near destruction of Colorado State University's \nlibrary. The storm derailed a train and caused buildings to explode. \nThis was not something this college town was used to experiencing. \nThose residents who were fortunate enough to be unaffected by the flood \nthat night awoke to the sounds of helicopters, massive road closures, \nand local schools converted into Red Cross shelters. For a place that \noccasionally made national news by appearing on lists for ``best place \nto live'' and ``most restaurants per capita,'' this sudden and shocking \ndestruction was not the reason why the people of Fort Collins ever \nimagined their town would be the top story on all the news networks.\n  As quickly as the rains came that night, and continued through most \nof the following day, it was all over. Sadly, like the pictures we all \nvividly remember of recent natural disasters in the United States, many \nwondered aloud in Fort Collins 10 years ago how this could have \nhappened here. As the small creeks that flowed peacefully along the \nsides of bike trails and through the parks and baseball fields of the \ncity suddenly swelled and transformed into violent streams of water \nthat engulfed so much, it seemed probable that this city of about \n110,000 residents would be permanently affected by this storm for a \nlong time to come. For a community that had experienced tremendous \nexpansion and job growth through the 1990s--due considerably to the \nrise of the tech boom--it appeared the good times had come to an end. \nWith so many infrastructures in disrepair, it seemed unlikely that \ncompanies would continue to expand to Fort Collins in the manner they \nhad been doing over the years preceding the flood.\n  What had long been, and continues to be, the heart of Fort Collins, \nColorado State University, received the brunt of the damage. Just 5 \nweeks prior to the start of classes, a 7-foot wall of water that had \nconcentrated its strength through the run off of many smaller floods \ntore through the main campus. Thirty-six buildings sustained \nsignificant damage, most especially the newly remodeled Morgan Library \nand the Lory Student Center. Rain-water, sewage and debris rushed \nthrough the library and destroyed about 425,000 books and journals, \nabout one-quarter of the library's inventory. As school began that \nyear, the students and professors adapted to a more nomadic life, but \nworked together, as they all faced the same obstacles.\n  As time moved on, CSU began to recover from the flood, the Morgan \nLibrary was rebuilt and CSU took the opportunity to update its \nelectronic resources, making them state-of-the-art. The drainage \nsystems were updated and replaced, with walls and landscaping put in \nplace to counter a flood 6 inches greater than what was experienced in \n1997. As CSU recovered, the city did as well. Beautification and clean-\nup efforts took place on a massive scale, stronger bridges were built, \nand creeks were redesigned to more evenly disperse water should this \n500-year flood ever occur again. The community at-large pitched in to \nclean up the parks and neighborhoods that were littered by debris. \nLocal businesses, the school district, and CSU all continued to work \ntogether and leaned on each other to bring Fort Collins back.\n  As the Colorado summer faded into fall and the days began getting \nshorter, the mounds of ruined furniture and rows of unusable \nrefrigerators that lined the neighborhood sidewalks for so long slowly \nbegan disappearing from the city's landscape and life started to get \nback to normal. Fort Collins has continued to grow over the last 10 \nyears and so has CSU. Still, there are many reminders today of the \nstorm: from the occasional open spaces that were simply wiped out by \nthe flood and never rebuilt; to new buildings, roads and bridges that \nwere built following the storm; to the glaring markers that line the \nSpring Creek Trail showing the water levels on that day 10 years ago.\n  Sadly, Fort Collins' experience with flooding and tragedy is shared \nby many communities across the Nation, most especially along the gulf \ncoast in Louisiana and Mississippi, as many continue to struggle to \nfind some semblance of normalcy almost 2 years after Katrina and Rita. \nRecently, we have\n\n[[Page S10312]]\n\nseen massive floods throughout Texas and in the Midwest as well, \nparticularly in Kansas and Missouri. While all these events are all \nuniquely tragic, it is my hope that the devastation experienced in Fort \nCollins, Colorado 10 years ago can serve as an example to the many \nother communities across the country that are not as far removed from \ntheir storms: that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and as \ninsurmountable as a natural disaster may seem, life will and does go \non.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10312-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN MEMORY OF MATT BURTON AND SCOTT DESMOND\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I \nask my colleagues to join me today in honoring the memory of two \ncourageous firefighters, captain Matt Burton of Concord, CA and fire \nengineer Scott Desmond of Brentwood, CA. Captain Burton and Fire \nEngineer Desmond were heroes who died in the line of duty in San Pablo, \nCA on July 21, 2007. Captain Burton was 34 and Fire Engineer Desmond \nwas 37.\n  Both men were dedicated firefighters who served in the Contra Costa \nCounty Fire Department for more than 10 years. They were killed while \nbattling a residential fire in a neighborhood outside of San Pablo. The \ntwo residents of the home, Delbert and Gayle Moore, were also killed in \nthe blaze.\n  Captain Burton and Fire Engineer Desmond are remembered by friends \nand colleagues as cheerful and full of life as well as seriously \ndedicated to their profession. The men served the community with \nenthusiasm and a commitment to protecting the residents of Contra Costa \nCounty.\n  Captain Matt Burton and Fire Engineer Scott Desmond risked their \nlives every day to make Contra Costa County safer. We will always be \ngrateful for their brave service to their community and the State of \nCalifornia. Our hearts go out to their families, friends, and \ncolleagues who struggle with their loss.\n  Captain Burton is survived by his wife, Chantel, and his two \nchildren, Megan and Joshua Matthew. Fire Engineer Desmond is survived \nby his wife Carolyn and his 17-month-old son Tyler.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10312-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   50TH ANNUAL BAT FLIGHT CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I would like to honor and give \nspecial attention to the 50th annual Bat Flight Celebration Breakfast, \nat New Mexico's beautiful Carlsbad Caverns. Every evening over 300,000 \nMexican free-tail bats exit the caves to feed, only to return in the \nearly morning hours. It is in these early morning hours, once a year, \nthat visitors gather to observe the return of these thousands of bats \nto their homes inside these incredible caves. On Saturday July 28, \n2007, for the 50th time, over 600 visitors gathered and enjoyed a New \nMexican breakfast while witnessing this magnificent in-flight return to \nthe cave.\n  Created by inland sea between 250 and 280 million years ago, the \nlimestone caves of Carlsbad were declared a national monument in 1923, \nand the surrounding area was made a national park in 1930, in order to \npreserve its unique beauty and geology. Carlsbad Caverns National Park \nhas more than 100 known caves and covers over 46,000 acres, with \napproximately 33,000 acres designated as wilderness. The park's most \nprominent feature is the cavern itself, which contains one of the \nworld's largest underground chambers and countless spectacular \ngeological formations, many of which are easily accessible along a 3-\nmile paved underground trail.\n  The next time you happen to be in New Mexico, I encourage you to come \nvisit and take some time to enjoy all New Mexico has to offer. From the \nbeautiful rock formations, the stalagmites and stalactites, the \nwildlife, the culture and the history--the unique caverns near \nCarlsbad, NM, have it all. New Mexico is a great place, and the \nCarlsbad Caverns help make it so. To all, past and present, who have \nworked hard to preserve Carlsbad Caverns and showcase the annual bat \nflight celebration, I extend a heartfelt thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10312-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10312-4", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10312-5", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3093.

A bill to aid and support pediatric involvement in reading \nand education; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce with my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, the Prescribe A Book Act.\n  Our legislation amends the No Child Left Behind Act to create a \nfederal pediatric early literacy grant initiative based on the long-\nstanding, successful Reach Out and Read program. The program would \naward grants to highly qualified nonprofit entities to train doctors \nand nurses in advising parents about the importance of reading aloud \nand to give books to children at pediatric check-ups from 6 months to \nfive years of age, with a priority for children from low-income \nfamilies. It builds on the relationship between parents and medical \nproviders and helps families and communities encourage early literacy \nskills so children enter school prepared for success in reading.\n  The Reach Out and Read model has consistently demonstrated \neffectiveness in increasing parent involvement and boosting children's \nreading proficiency. Research published in peer-reviewed, scientific \njournals has found that parents who have participated in the program \nare significantly more likely to read to their children and include \nmore children's books in their home, and that children served by the \nprogram show an increase of 4-8 points on vocabulary tests. I have seen \nup-close the positive impact of this program on children and their \nfamilies when visiting a number of the 40 Rhode Island Reach Out and \nRead sites.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Prescribe A Book Act and work \nfor its inclusion in the upcoming reauthorization of the No Child Left \nBehind Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1895\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 11 Central Street in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, as \nthe ``Officer Jeremy Todd Charron Post Office''; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to honor a fallen officer of the \nEpsom, NH, Police Department, Officer Jeremy Todd Charron, by \nintroducing a bill to designate the United States Postal Service \nfacility at 11 Central Street in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, as the \nOfficer Jeremy Todd Charron Post Office.\n  Born on March 18, 1973, Officer Charron was the third of five \nchildren to Bob and Fran Charron. Originally from Pittsfield, NH, \nJeremy and his family moved to Hillsborough in 1977. Throughout his \nearly life, Jeremy grew intensely goal orientated, a trait that \npersisted throughout his shortened life, and by the time he had reached \nsecond grade he knew his calling was to one day serve as a U.S. Marine.\n  Although he was an outstanding athlete in many sports, he excelled at \nplaying defense on the soccer field. The same tenacity that Jeremy used \non the soccer field, he carried with him off the field. One poignant \nexample of Jeremy's developing leadership occurred as a friend lost his \nhair from cancer treatments and was teased by fellow classmates. While \nit may have been easier for most students to ignore the taunting of \nother classmates, Jeremy actively defended his friend. Throughout \nJeremy's life, he stood up for what he thought was right and protected \nthose who could not defend themselves.\n  During Jeremy's high school years at Hillsborough-Deering High \nSchool, he grew into a leader, quickly becoming active in all aspects \nof the school community. His peers voted him ``most spirited'' and \nelected him class president. At the same time, he had convinced 8 \nclassmates to join the Marines with him following graduation. Together, \nthey would dedicate their weekends to training for their future service \nin the Marine Corps.\n  After graduating high school in 1992, Jeremy entered the Marine Corps \nand proudly served his country for 4 years. As his enlistment term drew \nto a close, he had a new aspiration, which was to become a New \nHampshire State Trooper, and looked forward to starting a family.\n  To achieve this objective, Jeremy enrolled at the New Hampshire \nTechnical College in Concord to study Criminal Justice, and was hired \nby the Epsom, New Hampshire Police Department as a part-time and then \nfull-time police officer.\n  Sadly, Jeremy's dream was cut short. On August 24, 1997, the morning \nafter he attended the funerals of New Hampshire State Troopers Leslie \nLord and Scott Phillips, Officer Charron was responding to a report of \na suspicious car, which contained two men. Tragically, while Officer \nCharron questioned one of the men, the individual pulled out a gun and \nopened fire. Although Jeremy was wearing a bullet-proof vest, one of \nthe bullets struck him in an unprotected area. Despite his fatal \nwounds, Jeremy heroically returned fire until he collapsed, forcing his \ntwo killers to abandon their car and steal a near-by truck that could \nbe identified by police, eventually leading to their capture.\n\n  Had Jeremy's dreams not been cut short at the age of 24, he would \nhave achieved his goals of becoming a State Trooper and having a family \nof his own. Jeremy's murderers stripped our Nation, the State of New \nHampshire and the community of a true patriot, citizen, and role model, \nas well as a loving friend and family member.\n  Ten years have gone by since Jeremy's passing and a new generation of \n7 nieces and nephews know Jeremy's stories. People of Hillsborough, NH, \nstill have stories to share and lessons to learn from their very own \nAmerican hero. As the years move forward, the citizens and future \ngenerations of Hillsborough will always remember Jeremy and share \nanecdotes about his life when they visit the Officer Jeremy Todd \nCharron Post Office Building.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mrs. Clinton (for herself, Mrs. Dole, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Brown)):\n  S. 1898. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \nexpand family and medical for spouses, sons, daughters, and parents of \nservicemembers with combat-related injuries; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military \nand Family Medical Leave Act, bipartisan legislation that extends the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act, FMLA, for up to 6 months for children, \nspouses and parents of soldiers who have been injured in combat. This \nlegislation implements a key recommendation made last week by the \nCommission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors. I would \nalso like to acknowledge my colleagues Senators Dole, Mikulski, Graham, \nKennedy and Brown whose partnership on this legislation reflects the \nfact that supporting our families and service-members is a bipartisan, \ncommon sense issue.\n  The families of our servicemen and women face extraordinary demands \nas they struggle to care for loved ones injured in service to our \nNation. Yet, currently, family members of these injured servicemembers \nreceive no additional leave to accommodate the support they need.\n  The Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors was \nestablished in March 2007 with the specific goals of conducting a \ncomprehensive review of services the Government currently provides to \nour wounded warriors and delivering recommendations to the President, \nSecretary of Defense, and Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  In its review, the commission found that 33 percent of active duty, \n22 percent of reserve component, and 37 percent of retired/separated \nservicemembers report that a family member or close friend relocated \nfor extended periods of time to be with them while\n\n[[Page S10317]]\n\nthey were in the hospital. In addition, 21 percent of active duty, 15 \npercent of reserve component, and 24 percent of retired/separated \nservicemembers say friends or family gave up a job to be with them or \nact as their caregiver.\n  To address this situation and help support these caregivers, the \ncommission recommended strengthening family support programs by \nextending the FMLA for up to 6 months for the family members of \nseriously injured soldiers. This is a step we can make immediately that \nwill make a real difference. Our men and women in uniform have made \ntremendous sacrifices on our behalf and we have a responsibility to do \neverything we can to make sure they have the care and support they \nneed.\n  The Military Family and Medical Leave Act will enact this \nrecommendation by amending the FMLA to allow up to 6 months leave for a \nfamily member of a servicemember who has a combat-related injury and \nmeets the eligibility requirements in the law.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will join Senators Dole, Mikulski, \nGraham, Kennedy, Brown and me in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 1899. A bill to require every American to have health insurance \ncoverage; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to explain a bill I am \nfiling today that will establish universal health coverage called \nUniversal Health Coverage Act. Let me tell you why I am introducing \nthis bill.\n  Our health care system provides the highest quality health care in \nthe world if you are fortunate to get access to it. People come from \nall over the world to come to our great academic centers to get their \nhealth care needs met and to train their health care professionals.\n  In my home State of Maryland, I am very proud of the University of \nMaryland Medical Center and Johns Hopkins University. We have great \ninstitutions, such as the National Institutes of Health, that provide \ntop-quality health care.\n  The problem is too many people cannot get access to affordable \nquality health care in America. We have 46 million uninsured; 9 million \nare children. We spend more money than any other country by far on \nhealth care, and yet our health care results do not reflect that type \nof investment of our public funds.\n  The No. 1 problem in health care in America today is the number of \nuninsured. We need to do something about it. The Universal Health \nCoverage Act does exactly that. It says every person in this country \nmust have health insurance.\n  We are paying for the people who do not have health insurance. Those \nof us who have health coverage are paying more for our doctors and \nhospitals. We pay more in taxes because people have no health \ninsurance. The reason is they have delayed diagnosis and treatment that \nleads to more serious illness and treatment for those who have no \nhealth insurance.\n  We all pay the price with higher premiums and cost. According to the \nInstitute of Medicine, taxpayers shoulder 65 percent of the total cost \nof uncompensated care through subsidies to hospitals and clinics. The \nsame study showed that poor health care status from being uninsured \ncosts our Nation between $65 billion and $130 billion a year. It is in \nour interest as those who have health insurance and as taxpayers that \nwe have universal health coverage in America.\n  Why does it cost more for someone who has no health insurance? With \ntwo people with the same types of conditions, it can actually cost our \nsystem more for those who have no health insurance because they do not \nseek preventative health care. Fewer than one-half of uninsured women \nages 50 to 64 have received a mammogram in the past 2 years compared to \n75 percent of women with insurance. Only 18 percent of uninsured adults \nover the age of 50 have had colon cancer screenings in the last 5 years \ncompared to 56 percent of adults with insurance. Only 35 percent of \nuninsured Americans had dental examinations in the last year. When \nuninsured receive care, it is often at a much later point and is more \ncostly and less efficient. We can do something about it.\n  Who are the uninsured? Another myth: Eighty-one percent of the \nuninsured actually come from working families. These are working \nfamilies who are unable, for whatever reasons, to get affordable health \ncare coverage. Low-income Americans with family incomes below 200 \npercent of poverty run the highest risk of being uninsured. More than \none-third of the poor and 30 percent of the near poor with incomes \nbetween 100 percent and 200 percent of poverty lack health insurance.\n  My legislation is simple. The Universal Health Coverage Act requires \npersonal responsibility, requires everyone to have health insurance, \nand it builds on the current employer-based system and protects \ngovernment-sponsored health programs.\n  We would require every American to have qualified health coverage. \nThat qualified health coverage could be Medicare, it could be our \nveterans health care, it could be one of the governmental programs, or \nit could be an employer-sponsored health plan.\n  We then empower the Secretary of Health to work with the State \ninsurance commissioners to develop three low-cost plans in every State \nin the Nation so there will be an available product to those who cannot \nfind an affordable health care plan.\n  The plans would be available for those whose incomes are below 400 \npercent of poverty. The reason we picked that number, 400 percent of \npoverty, is those above generally have the opportunity to buy insurance \nat work. Those below are the most vulnerable in our community.\n  Those who fail to enroll in any coverage would be required to pay a \ntax which would be equal to the premiums so that the Government can \nenroll them in one of the low-cost plans within their State.\n  This plan makes sense. It is a framework on which we can build. It \nsays we will not tolerate 46 million people without health insurance, 9 \nmillion children without health insurance. It allows the States to do \ninnovative approaches to deal with those who otherwise would have \nproblems affording their health care. We expect States to act. States \nare already acting. States are already showing leadership. This \nframework will give States the incentive to move further along. \nEmployers who now know every employee needs health benefits are more \nlikely to provide insurance for their workforce, and there would be an \naffordable product because everyone would be in the system. We would \nnot have adverse risk collection or cherry-picking by insurance \ncompanies. It gives us the framework to move forward and will allow the \nFederal Government to move in those areas in which the Federal \nGovernment can do best to help those who are otherwise vulnerable.\n  I hope we will not let this opportunity go without dealing with the \nNo. 1 problem in our health care system, and that is dealing with \npeople who do not have health insurance. I look forward to working with \nall my colleagues so we can work on a doable plan, so this country not \nonly has the highest quality health care, but we have a system in which \nall Americans have access to that quality care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCain:\n  S. 1900. A bill to authorize appropriations for the United States \nInstitute for Environmental Conflict Resolution; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \ncontinue Federal support for the U.S. Institute for Environmental \nConflict Resolution. Congressman Grijalva has introduced a similar bill \nin the House of Representatives.\n  In 1998, the Congress enacted legislation to establish the U.S. \nInstitute for Environmental Conflict Resolution with the purpose of \noffering an alternative to litigation for parties in dispute over \nenvironmental conflicts. As we know, many environmental conflicts often \nresult in lengthy and costly court proceedings and may take years to \nresolve. In cases involving Federal Government agencies, the costs for \ncourt proceeding are usually paid for by taxpayers. While litigation is \nstill a recourse to resolve disputes, the Congress recognized the need \nfor alternatives, such as mediation and facilitated collaboration, to \naddress the rising number of environmental conflicts\n\n[[Page S10318]]\n\nthat have clogged Federal courts, executive agencies, and the Congress.\n  The Institute was placed at the Morris K. Udall Foundation in \nrecognition of former Representative Morris K. Udall from Arizona and \nhis exceptional environmental record, as well as his unusual ability to \nbuild a consensus among fractious and even hostile interests. The \nInstitute was established as an experiment with the idea that hidden \nwithin fractured environmental debates lay the seeds for many \nagreements, an approach applied by Mo Udall with unsurpassed ability.\n  The success of the institute is far greater than we could have \nimagined. The institute began operations in 1999. Agencies from the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Departments of Interior and \nAgriculture, the U.S. Navy, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal \nHighway Administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and \nothers have all called upon the Institute for assistance.\n  Among its many accomplishments, the Institution has also assisted in \nfacilitating interagency teamwork for the Everglades Task Force which \noversees the South Everglades Restoration Project. The U.S. Forest \nService requested assistance to bring ranchers and environmental \nadvocates in the southwest to work on grazing and environmental \ncompliance issues. Even Members of Congress have sought the institute's \nassistance to review implementation of the Nation's fundamental \nenvironmental law, the National Environmental Policy Act, to assess how \nit can be improved using collaborative processes.\n  The demand on the institute's assistance had been much greater than \nanticipated. At the time the Institute was created, we did not \nanticipate the magnitude of the role it would serve to the Federal \nGovernment. The institute has served as a mediator between agencies and \nas an advisor to agency dispute resolution efforts involving \noverlapping or competing jurisdictions and mandates, developing long-\nterm solutions, training personnel in consensus-building efforts, and \ndesigning international systems for preventing or resolving disputes.\n  This legislation simply extends the authorization for the Institute \nfor an additional 5 years. Support for the institute's service is an \ninvestment that will ultimately benefit the taxpayers by preventing \ncostly litigation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                  ____\n\n  By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1902. A bill to limit cost growth associated with major defense \nbase closures and realignments implemented as part of the 2005 round of \ndefense base closure and realignment; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, one of the primary goals of the \nPentagon's Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, process is to reduce \ncosts. Unfortunately, we have seen the cost of implementing BRAC \nballoon out of control. Back in 2005, Congress agreed to implement the \nrecommendations of the BRAC Commission based on the understanding that \nit would cost the American taxpayers $21 billion, a substantial \ninvestment. But now, only two years later, we are looking at a price \ntag of $30 billion, which is a 43 percent increase.\n  If costs continue to rise at this rate, we will be looking at even \nmore of a burden on the American taxpayer by the time the base closures \nand realignments are completed in 2011. In my home State of New Jersey, \nwe are keenly aware of some of the wildly inaccurate cost estimates \nused in the BRAC process. The closing of New Jersey's army base at Fort \nMonmouth was originally expected to cost $780 million, now we are \nlooking at a $1.5 billion price tag. Part of this inflated cost is due \nto the egregious miscalculations on how much it would cost to move the \nU.S. Military Academy Preparatory School, currently located in New \nJersey, to West Point, NY. Although the BRAC Commission's original, \none-time implementation cost estimate was $29 million, current \nestimates put the move at nearly $200 million. Many communities and \nfamilies will be greatly impacted by the closing of Fort Monmouth and \nthe relocation of the military prep school. Knowing that these \ndecisions were based on miscalculations and misinformation does not sit \nwell with our State, and it should not sit well with taxpayers across \nthe country either. If American families are being forced to foot a \nbill they weren't expecting, there should be an escape hatch.\n  That is why I am introducing the BRAC Cost Overruns Protection Act of \n2007 or the BRAC COP Act. This legislation will work to control the \nexcessive cost overruns in BRAC and ensure that BRAC is maximizing our \ntaxpayers' money. This bill, which I am introducing with Senator \nLautenberg, is based on principles found in existing law concerning \ncost overruns in weapons programs, known as the Nunn-McCurdy amendment. \nLet me take a few moments to discuss exactly how this legislation will \nwork.\n  The BRAC COP Act will create a trigger mechanism to require a re-\nevaluation of any major base closure or realignment should the actual \ncost exceed BRAC's estimated cost by more than 25 percent. In order to \nmonitor BRAC costs, this bill will require the Secretary of Defense to \nwrite biannual reports on the costs of implementing the pending base \nclosure or realignment recommendations mandated by BRAC law. If the \nsecretary determines that the actual cost of implementing a major base \nclosure or realignment recommendation has exceeded the 25 percent \nthreshold, the Defense Secretary will then notify the Chairman and \nRanking Member the Congressional Defense Committees and devise a \nbusiness plan to reduce the cost, without readjusting the baseline \nestimated cost, so that it does not exceed the 25 percent limit.\n  The Secretary will then make a recommendation to the President on \nwhether to continue the base closure or realignment. The BRAC COP Act \nalso supports transparency in this process, so if the Defense Secretary \nrecommends that the President continue or modify the base closure or \nrealignment, despite the excessive cost overruns, the Secretary must \ninclude an explanation of why it is necessary to continue with these \nexpenditures. After reviewing the Secretary's recommendation, the \nPresident will make his own recommendation and submit it to Congress. \nJust like the congressional procedure for voting on BRAC law, Congress \nwill then have the option to vote to disapprove the President's \nrecommendation.\n  Let me be clear: this legislation will not overturn BRAC, nor is it \nintended to re-open the BRAC process. This bill simply asks that the \nSecretary of Defense, the President, and the Congress take a second \nlook when we face exhorbant cost overruns. The BRAC COP Act will only \naffect the largest base closures and realignments that are over budget, \nso we will not be analyzing every single one of the BRAC \nrecommendations.\n  It is time that the Defense Department is held more accountable for \nits expenditures. This Congress and the American people do not want to \ncontinue providing blank checks so that the Pentagon can rework its \naccounting tables, regardless of the costs. Congress supported the \nrecommendations of the 2005 BRAC Commission based on the fact that \nthese closures and realignments, although inconvenient, would end up \nsaving money in the long run and addressing the changing requirements \nof our military. It now appears that cost-benefit analysis has changed. \nThe BRAC COP Act will work to ensure that the 2005 BRAC law, and any \nfuture BRAC laws, do not go grossly over budget.\n  This bill is good for our military and our communities, and I ask my \ncolleagues to support this fiscally responsible legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10318-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10318-S10319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 283--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n    UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE SHOULD DISCONTINUE THE PRACTICE OF \n                 CONTRACTING OUT MAIL DELIVERY SERVICES\n\n  Mr. CASEY submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs:\n\n                              S.

Trials on charges of trespass are \nscheduled to commence on August 22, 2007. The defense has subpoenaed a \nmember of the Senator's staff who had conversations with the defendant \nprotesters during the charged events. Senator Salazar would like to \ncooperate by providing testimony from his staff. This resolution would \nauthorize that staff member, and any other employee of Senator \nSalazar's office from whom evidence may be required, to testify in \nconnection with these actions, with representation by the Senate Legal \nCounsel.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 284) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 284\n\n       Whereas, in the cases of City and County of Denver v. Susan \n     I. Gomez (07GS008693), Daniel R. Egger (07GS008692), and \n     Carter Merrill (07GS967589), pending in Denver County Court \n     in Denver, Colorado, testimony has been requested from \n     Matthew Cheroutes, an employee in the office of Senator Ken \n     Salazar;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) \n     and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     represent employees of the Senate with respect to any \n     subpoena, order, or request for testimony relating to their \n     official responsibilities;\n       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United \n     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate \n     may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from \n     such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;\n       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or \n     in the possession of the Senate may promote the \n     administration of justice, the Senate will take such action \n     as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the \n     privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved. That Matthew Cheroutes and any other employees of \n     Senator Salazar's office from whom testimony may be required \n     are authorized to testify in the cases of City and County of \n     Denver v. Susan I. Gomez, Daniel R. Egger, and Carter \n     Merrill, except concerning matters for which a privilege \n     should be asserted.\n       Sec. 2. The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent \n     Matthew Cheroutes and other employees of Senator Salazar's \n     staff in the actions referenced in section one of this \n     resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/30/senate-section/article/S10335-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10335-S10336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REGARDING COURTS WITH FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR A CHILD OF A \n                  DECEASED MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 242, S. Res. \n203.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 203) calling on the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China to use its unique influence and \n     economic leverage to stop genocide and violence in Darfur, \n     Sudan.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations with an amendment to strike out all after the resolving \nclause: an amendment to strike the preamble and insert in lieu thereof \nthe following:\n\n                              S. Res. 203\n\n       Whereas since the conflict in Darfur, Sudan began in 2003, \n     hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and more \n     than 2,500,000 displaced as a result of the ongoing and \n     escalating violence;\n       Whereas on July 23, 2004, Congress declared, ``the \n     atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide'' and on \n     September 23, 2004, then Secretary of State Colin Powell \n     stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate that, ``genocide has occurred and may still be \n     occurring in Darfur,'' and ``the Government of Sudan and the \n     Janjaweed bear responsibility'';\n       Whereas on October 13, 2006, the President signed the \n     Darfur Peace and Accountability Act (Public Law 109-344), \n     which identifies the Government of Sudan as complicit with \n     the forces committing genocide in the Darfur region and urges \n     the President to, ``take all necessary and appropriate steps \n     to deny the Government of Sudan access to oil revenues'';\n       Whereas President George W. Bush declared in a speech \n     delivered on April 18, 2007, at the United States Holocaust \n     Memorial Museum that no one ``can doubt that genocide is the \n     only word for what is happening in Darfur--and that we have a \n     moral obligation to stop it'';\n       Whereas the presence of approximately 7,000 African Union \n     peacekeepers has not deterred the violence and the increasing \n     attacks by the Government-sponsored Janjaweed militia and \n     rebel groups;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan has previously refused to \n     allow implementation of the full-scale peacekeeping mission \n     authorized under United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1706;\n       Whereas former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan \n     subsequently negotiated a compromise agreement with the \n     Government of Sudan for a hybrid United Nations-African Union \n     peacekeeping mission to be implemented in 3 phases;\n       Whereas the African Union and the United Nations have both \n     affirmed that the Government of Sudan has now stated that it \n     will accept implementation of a hybrid United Nations-African \n     Union peacekeeping mission;\n       Whereas the Sudanese government has reneged on and \n     obstructed earlier agreements;\n       Whereas it is critical that the nations of the world, and \n     particularly the members of the United Nations Security \n     Council, take steps to implement the full deployment of this \n     hybrid peacekeeping mission as soon as possible;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has long-standing economic and military ties with Sudan and \n     continues to strengthen these ties in spite of the on-going \n     genocide in Darfur, as evidenced by the following actions:\n       (1) China reportedly purchases as much as 70 percent of \n     Sudan's oil;\n       (2) China currently has at least $3,000,000,000 invested in \n     the Sudanese energy sector, for a total of $10,000,000,000 \n     since the 1990s;\n       (3) Sudan's Joint Chief of Staff, Haj Ahmed El Gaili, \n     recently visited Beijing for discussions with Chinese Defense \n     Minister Cao Gang Chuan and other military officials as part \n     of an eight-day tour of China; Cao pledged closer military \n     relations with Sudan, saying that China was ``willing to \n     further develop cooperation between the two militaries in \n     every sphere'';\n       (4) China has reportedly cancelled approximately \n     $100,000,000 in debt owed by the Sudanese Government; and\n       (5) China is building infrastructure in Sudan and provided \n     funds for a presidential palace in Sudan at a reported cost \n     of approximately $20,000,000;\n       Whereas given its economic interests throughout the region, \n     China has a unique ability to positively influence the \n     Government of Sudan to abandon its genocidal policies and to \n     accept United Nations peacekeepers to join a hybrid United \n     Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission;\n       Whereas the President's Special Envoy to Sudan, Andrew S. \n     Natsios, further said in testimony on April 11, 2007, that \n     ``China's substantial economic investment in Sudan gives it \n     considerable potential leverage, and we have made clear to \n     Beijing that the international community will expect China to \n     be part of the solution'';\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has previously influenced the Government of Sudan to take \n     steps toward reducing violence and conflict by--\n       (1) abstaining from, and choosing not to obstruct, several \n     important votes in the United Nations Security Council on \n     resolutions related to Sudan, including Resolution 1556, \n     which demanded Sudan disarm militias in Darfur, and \n     Resolution 1706, which called for the deployment of \n     additional United Nations peacekeepers, including up to \n     17,300 military personnel and up to 3,300 civilian police;\n       (2) helping to facilitate the Addis Ababa framework reached \n     on November 16, 2006, which provides for a joint United \n     Nations-African Union peacekeeping force;\n       (3) sending high-level delegations, including Chinese \n     President Hu Jintao, to Sudan, and encouraging President \n     Bashir to show flexibility and allow the joint United \n     Nations-African Union peacekeeping force to be deployed;\n       (4) making frequent public statements that the Government \n     of Sudan must carry out agreements made within the Addis \n     Ababa framework of November 2006 to admit United Nations \n     peacekeepers to join the United Nations-African Union \n     peacekeeping force in Darfur;\n       (5) pledging to provide military engineers to support \n     African Union peacekeeping forces in Darfur;\n       (6) announcing on May 10, 2007, the appointment of a senior \n     diplomat as China's special representative on African affairs \n     who is to focus specific attention on the Darfur issue; and\n       (7) reportedly exercising its influence to help convince \n     the Khartoum government to accept the hybrid peacekeeping \n     mission;\n       Whereas due to its vast population, its rapidly growing \n     global economy, its large research and development \n     investments and military spending, its seat as a permanent \n     member of the United Nations Security Council and on the \n     Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, China is an emerging power \n     that is increasingly perceived as a leader with significant \n     international reach and responsibility;\n       Whereas in November 2006, China hosted its third Forum on \n     China-Africa Cooperation with more than 40 heads of state in \n     attendance and which focused heavily on trade relations and \n     investment on the African continent as it is expected to \n     double by 2010;\n       Whereas China is preparing to host the Olympic Summer Games \n     of 2008, the most honorable, venerated, and prestigious \n     international sporting event;\n       Whereas China should be held accountable to act \n     consistently with the Olympic standard of preserving human \n     dignity in Darfur, Sudan and around the world; and\n       Whereas China has previously been reluctant to use its full \n     influence to improve the human rights situation in Darfur, \n     but recent events have demonstrated the impact that China can \n     have as a positive influence on this situation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the close relationship between China and \n     Sudan and strongly urges the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China to use its full influence to--\n       (A) urge the President of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, to abide \n     by his agreement to allow a robust peacekeeping force under \n     United Nations command and control as described in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1706;\n       (B) call for Sudanese compliance with United Nations \n     Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564, and the Darfur \n     Peace Agreement, all of which demand that the Government of \n     Sudan disarm militias operating in Darfur;\n       (C) call on all parties to the conflict to adhere to the \n     2004 N'Djamena ceasefire agreement and the recently-agreed \n     United Nations communique which commits the Sudanese \n     government to improve conditions for humanitarian \n     organizations and ensure they have unfettered access to the \n     populations they serve;\n       (D) emphasize that there can be no military solution to the \n     conflict in Darfur and that the formation and implementation \n     of a legitimate peace agreement between all parties will \n     contribute toward the welfare and stability of the entire \n     nation and broader region;\n       (E) urge all rebel groups to unify and assist all parties \n     to come to the negotiating table in good faith;\n       (F) urge the Government of southern Sudan to play a more \n     active role in pressing for legitimate peace talks and take \n     immediate steps to support and assist in the revitalization \n     of such talks along 1 single coordinated track;\n       (G) continue to engage collaboratively in high-level \n     diplomacy and multilateral efforts toward a renewed peace \n     process; and\n\n[[Page S10337]]\n\n       (H) join the international community in imposing economic \n     and other consequences on the Government of Sudan if that \n     government continues to carry out or support attacks on \n     innocent civilians and frustrate diplomatic efforts; and\n       (2) recognizes that the spirit of the Olympics, which is to \n     bring together nations and people from all over the world in \n     peace, is incompatible with any actions, directly or \n     indirectly, supporting acts of genocide.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported substitute be agreed to, the resolution, as amended, \nbe agreed to, that the amendment to the preamble be agreed to, the \npreamble, as amended, be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table en bloc, that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
